Classical methods depend on fully specified causal graphs and extensive observational data, while recent invariance-based approaches typically assume access to the state of perturbed features.\nThese assumptions may not hold in practical settings with unknown causal relationships, partial and limited interventional data, and the need to consider novel, untested interventions/perturbations. \nWe propose a novel framework for causal effect estimation under such conditions that uses interventional embeddings to capture perturbation-specific information. Leveraging ideas from causality and robust learning, we propose a predictor that \ntargets a form of interventional regime-specific risk-optimality but that does so using transformations of available data and hence does not require access to interventional data from the target regime.\nWe put forward an end-to-end attention-based model that jointly learns embedding transformations and similarity-based weighting, enabling scalable prediction of causal effects even when no features are observed under intervention. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our framework generalizes effectively to unseen interventions, hence addressing a critical challenge in prediction of causal effects in complex, real-world settings.", "tldr": "We propose a framework for predicting causal effects under unseen interventions.

Setting of this work**: The setting of this work is not clear. There are several terms used, but looking at the math, they seem to be the same thing under the hood. For instance, $x^e$ denotes \"features\" from an environment $e$. Using these features, we may predict the response variable $y^e$. The inference environment, $v$, is not observed during training. My understanding is that we may or may not have access to the features $x^e$ during training. Instead of $x^e$, we have access to \"embeddings\" $u^e$ during training (please see my related comment about embeddings in W3). Lines 182-183 say these embeddings \"contain relevant information about the intervention in question.\" Lines 293-295 say that \"we can in general write the feature embeddings $h^\\*(x^e)$\" as a function of only the intervention embeddings $u^e$.\" From these sentences, I gather that the embeddings $u^e$ are some kind of super-informative variable that can predict both the interventional description $\\psi^e$ and the latent embedding $h^*(x^e)$ (which is complex enough to model the intervention as a mean-shift operation).\n\n**W1. (a) Are the two settings different?** At that point, is there any difference in terms of the two considered settings (with and without features)? Having access to only the embeddings, and not the features, does not make the setting any more challenging.\n\n**W1. (b) Do we need the asterisk terms?** If we can always express the unobserved, but informative, variables such as $h^\\*$ and $\\psi_e^\\*$ in terms of observable embeddings $u^e$, why do we need to write anything in terms of $h^\\*$ or $\\psi_e^\\*$? Can't all the findings in this paper be expressed in some learned latent space (like $h$) where eq. (2) holds?\n\n**W2. Comparison to related works**: I would appreciate it if the findings could be contrasted with works such as [A1-2] (and the references therein) that also consider modeling interventional effects under the process in eq. (2). (Shen et al., 2023) and (Rothenhausler et al., 2021), referenced in the paper, also use this interventional model. Specifically, are $\\alpha$'s in this work related to anchors in anchor regression (Rothenhausler et al., 2021)?\n\n**W3. Difference between embeddings and features**: How are embeddings $u^e$ different from features $x^e$? The descriptions for $u^e$ in lines 129-130 and 377-390 are not helpful."}, "questions": {"value": "While I agree that this is not an easy paper to write, the writing could be improved a bit, especially in the introduction. For instance, in the setting description, a more rigorous description of \"information on the nature of the intervention\" (lines 040-041) will be useful to the readers. Minor questions/comments on writing:\n\n**Q1.** In lines 96, does \"features are available for learning...\" mean features from causal regime $v$ are available during training?\n\n**Q2.** Why is $c^*$ invariant under IET assumption?\n\n**Q3.** Is it $\\epsilon$ or $\\varepsilon$ in eq. (2)?\n\n**Q4.** There is some confusion in lines 217-219. Does \"the effects are causally downstream\" mean the response $y^e$ is an effect of the feature embeddings? In a related note, line 106 said the learned function was \"not constrained to use only features that [were] direct causes of $y$\". Does that mean the function can use successors of $y$, or that it can use non-direct ancestors of $y$? Does $(\\delta_e)_{q+1}=0$ in lines 217-219 mean the changes in $y^e$ due to the perturbation in environment $e$ are purely a downstream effect of the changes in $x^e$?\n\n**Q5.** Line 140 says that * denotes aspects that are not accessible in practice. Why does $h$ that combines $h^\\*$, $g^\\*$, and $c^\\*$ in eq. (7) not have $\\*$? Line 392 says $h$ \"will be learned from data in an end-to-end fashion.\" But in algorithm 1, $\\hat{h}(x^e) = \\phi(u^e)$, where $\\phi$ is \"a generic regression model\" (lines 362-363). How is $\\phi$ obtained? And, how is $h$ \"invariant across environments\" (line 303)?\n\n**Q6.** $k(b, \\alpha)$ is defined differently in Theorem 3.1 and in its proof in Appendix B.1. Also, is it supposed to be $\\delta_v^\\*$ instead of $\\delta_e^\\*$ in line 651 (and in the equations following that line)?\n\n**References**\n\n[A1] Dominik Rothenhäusler, Peter Bühlmann, Nicolai Meinshausen, \"Causal Dantzig: fast inference in linear structural equation models with hidden variables under additive interventions\", Annals of Statistics, 2019.\n\n[A2] Julius von Kügelgen, Jakob Ketterer, Xinwei Shen, Nicolai Meinshausen, Jonas Peters, \"Representation Learning for Distributional Perturbation Extrapolation\", ICLR Workshop on Learning Meaning Representations of Life, 2025."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5rCpl8JRmT", "forum": "Yvotp6rqZ8", "replyto": "Yvotp6rqZ8", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18084/Reviewer_GxA9"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18084/Reviewer_GxA9"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18084/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761950187769, "cdate": 1761950187769, "tmdate": 1762927860296, "mdate": 1762927860296, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
