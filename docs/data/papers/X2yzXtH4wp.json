Making unwarranted assumptions to compensate for the missing information and failing to ask clarifying questions can lead to suboptimal outcomes, safety risks due to tool misuse, and wasted computational resources. In this work, we study the ability of LLM agents to handle underspecified instructions in interactive code generation settings by evaluating proprietary and open-weight models on their performance across three key steps: (a) detecting underspecificity, (b) asking targeted clarification questions, and (c) leveraging the interaction to improve performance in underspecified scenarios. Our findings reveal that models struggle to distinguish between well-specified and underspecified instructions. However, when models interact for underspecified inputs, they effectively obtain vital information from the user leading to significant improvements in performance, up to 74\\% over the non-interactive settings, underscoring the value of effective interaction. Our study highlights critical gaps in how current state-of-the-art models handle missing information in complex software engineering tasks and structures the evaluation into distinct steps to enable targeted improvements.", "tldr": "We study how LLM agents handle underspecified instructions in interactive code generation, focusing on (a) using interactivity to improve performance, (b) detecting underspecificity, and (c) asking targeted questions.", "keywords": ["Ambiguity", "Underspecificity", "SWE Agent", "Software Engineering", "Clarification", "Evaluation", "Interaction"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2cf6ba3640e76afe4ccfdc4ed6ce3acdba290c3b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/52adeab96db3822bf3ff9b618ff267edb3163e88.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper investigates how large language model (LLM) agents handle underspecified instructions where bug reports or feature requests omit critical details. Building on the SWE-Bench Verified dataset, the authors include three settings: (1) Full, where complete issue descriptions are given; (2) Hidden, where GPT-4o-generated summaries remove key information; and (3) Interaction, where agents can query a simulated user (GPT-4o) that has full task details under Hidden setting. The study evaluates four across three capabilities: detecting missing information, asking clarification questions, and leveraging answers to solve tasks. Results show interaction boosts success rates by up to 15.4% over non-interactive in hidden settings, though performance still lags behind fully specified inputs. Most models fail to detect underspecificity without explicit prompting, with only Claude Sonnet 3.5 achieving 84% accuracy under moderate encouragement, while Claude and DeepSeek ask more specific, information-rich questions and Llama tends to pose generic ones."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper explores a critical issue within current LLMs where they typically cannot recognize the underspecioficity in user query.\n2. The paper clearly defines underspecificity as “missing information that prevents an expert from producing a correct fix,” grounding it in the SWE-Bench Verified rubric rather than using vague notions of ambiguity\n3. The study divides performance into three measurable capabilities: 1) detecting underspecificity, 2) asking targeted questions, and 3) leveraging responses, which enables more diagnostic evaluation rather than a single overall score\n4.

The paper admits that naturally underspecified GitHub issues often still contain concrete technical cues (error messages, file references, conversational fragments), whereas the generated summaries mainly remove details, which may exaggerate the severity of underspecificity and may bias the task toward “missing vital context” rather than “ambiguous intent.”\n2. The paper mentions using the OpenHands agent environment but gives minimal explanation of how the agent framework is structured or how its components (planning, editing, execution, and interaction) collaborate.\n3. In Section 3.3, the discussion of navigational gains lacks clarity: what counts as navigational information, why it matters for task success, and whether such behavior mirrors how real developers seek information.\n4. The simulated user based on GPT-4o is insufficiently validated; the paper provides no evidence that GPT-4o’s responses align with real-user behaviors or communication patterns. And there is lack of analysis about the correctness of the response to the clarification questions generated during the interaction setting.\n5. In Section 5, information gain is defined as 1 – cosine similarity between the summarized task and the cumulative knowledge after interaction. This metric may overestimate improvement, as asking many irrelevant questions could still yield a high score. Would it be more accurate to calculate the score between the fully specified knowledge and the cumulative knowledge after interaction?"}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Outdated models: Both proprietary (Claude-3.5) and open-source models (DeepSeek-v2 and Llama-70b) are unfortunately rather behind the state of the art, given the rate of progress in recent months. Just for Claude models alone, we've seen Sonnet-3.7, Sonnet-4, and Sonnet-4.5 in the meantime. For this paper to be relevant for a conference presentation, I fear that the paper would really require updated results from more up-to-date frontier models. This will also make the claims around open-weight vs. proprietary models more relevant. In fact, I am intruiged if the type of \"interaction\" gap in the paper still remains with the current generation of models.\n\n2. I find the results and methodology for RQ3 \"Can the LLM generate meaningful and targeted clarification questions?\" slightly underwhelming, since the main message seems to be that Llama 3.1 70b is not very good at question answering. The evaluation metrics do not really seem to be able to reveal fine-grained differences in question-asking abilities. The qualitative analysis is nice, but in my opinion lacks comprehensive documentation of full problem statements and agent traces featured in the appendix.\n\n3. The paper relies quite heavily on SWE-bench for the original problem statements, which is quite heavily targeted by model creators. I think an analysis of how results would transfer to a more niche software engineering settings would be very interesting."}, "questions": {"value": "> We did not evaluate on naturally underspecified SWE-Bench examples because they lack the paired ground truth (complete specifications) necessary for causal measurement of interaction impact.\n\nWould it be possible to infer the complete specification from the known `gold_patch` and `test_patch`?
