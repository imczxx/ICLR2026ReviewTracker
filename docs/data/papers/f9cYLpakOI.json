We study endogenous protocol formation in infinitely repeated stage games with a costless pre-play channel. Each agent has a representation map that compresses private signals into messages subject to an information budget. Agents update strategies by no-regret learning with stochastic approximation and choose representation maps by a myopic objective that trades off predictive value and encoding cost. We provide three main results. First, if the stage game admits a folk-theorem set and the information budget exceeds a task-specific threshold, there exists a stable communication equilibrium in which messages are sufficient statistics for continuation payoffs. Second, when the budget is below the threshold, any stable equilibrium must be pooling on a finite partition that we characterize with a minimax information bound. Third, we give polynomial sample-complexity guarantees for convergence to an approximately efficient communicating equilibrium under mild regularity. Our analysis connects cheap talk, representation learning with information constraints, and multi-agent no-regret dynamics. The framework yields testable predictions for when emergent messages are interpretable, when they collapse, and how much data is needed for stable coordination.", "tldr": "We show when cheap-talk communication learned by agents in repeated games is predictive, incentive-compatible, and sample-efficient, giving tight conditions for stable emergent protocols.", "keywords": ["multi-agent learning", "repeated games", "cheap talk", "communication", "information bottleneck", "equilibrium", "representation learning"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f066855147b7f8a0cc58eb0f08fc0e64b7bf487c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors study a model in which no-regret learning agents are augmented with the ability to send costless messages to each other."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "I think the intersection of agent communication and learning in games can produce interesting settings and research directions."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The paper is very poorly written.
