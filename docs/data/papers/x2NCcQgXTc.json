Either the under-approximation assumption must trivialize with $\\underbar{\\alpha}=1$ or one must allow PSD Hessian approximation matrix $B_{x}$. \n\n2. **On the Practical Verifiability of Assumption 2** \n\nThe entire convergence analysis of the proposed method hinges on Assumption 2, the relative inexactness condition $(1-\\underline{\\alpha})B_{x} \\le \\nabla^{2}f(x) \\le (1+\\overline{\\alpha})B_{x}$. The resulting convergence rates in Theorem 1 depend directly on the inexactness parameters $\\underline{\\alpha}$ and $\\overline{\\alpha}$. However, the paper provides no practical, computationally feasible method to construct or verify an approximation $B_x$ that is guaranteed to satisfy this assumption for known (or even bounded) values of $\\underline{\\alpha}$ and $\\overline{\\alpha}$. While the experiments employ standard methods like L-BFGS, these are recursive methods that do not, in general, come with a priori guarantees on their spectral relationship to the true Hessian $\\nabla^{2}f(x)$. It is unclear how these practical methods connect back to the foundational assumption of the theory. This creates a significant gap between the theory and practice. For instance, the parameter selection for the non-adaptive algorithm (e.g., $\\theta \\ge 1+\\overline{\\alpha}$) is impossible to implement without a priori knowledge of $\\overline{\\alpha}$. The adaptive method  attempts to find this level, but it does so by reacting to a failed condition rather than by verifying the assumption itself. The analysis lacks a crucial component: a practical algorithm to compute a $B_x$ that demonstrably satisfies the conditions upon which the theory is built. The authors do discuss in the appendix (L1359) that one may satisfy such assumption if $B_k$ is chosen as the exact hessian at a point near $x_k$, but assuming that we can compute the exact Hessian defies the purpose of Newton-type or quasi-Newton method. \n\n3. **Trajectory-dependent constants**\n\nThis is the biggest concern that the reviewer has on the theoretical contribution of this work. The analysis in Theorem 1 presents a convergence rate that depends on a quantity $D=\\max_{k\\in[0;K+1]} ||x_{k}-x_{*}||_{B_k}$.  \n\nThis makes the stated convergence bound circular. A standard, a priori complexity bound should be expressed in terms of initial problem parameters (e.g., $||x_0 - x_*||$ and function properties) and should allow one to predict the number of iterations $K$ required to achieve a target accuracy $\\epsilon$. As written, the bound in Theorem 1 cannot be used for this purpose, since the value of $D$ is unknown until after the algorithm has already run for $K$ steps. While Lemma 2 establishes a valuable descent property on the function value, this alone is insufficient to guarantee a uniform (i.e., $K$-independent) bound on $D$, especially as the norm $|| \\cdot ||_{B_k}$ changes at each iteration. This reliance on a posteriori quantities seems to be a foundational part of the analysis, as it also appears in the definition of $\\overline{D}$ for the adaptive method in Theorem 2 4 and again as $R$ in the alternative analysis of Theorem 5. The theoretical claims would be significantly strengthened if the authors could provide true a priori bounds based on a more standard analysis, such as by assuming a bounded initial level set.\n\n4. **On the Condition for the $O(k^{-2})$ Rate (Corollary 2)**\n\nThe paper claims that an $\\mathcal{O}(k^{-2})$ rate is achievable if the inexactness satisfies the condition $\\alpha_k \\le L||x_{k+1}-x_{k}||_{B_k}$. \n\nHowever, this condition is inherently a posteriori. It cannot be guaranteed before taking a step, as the right-hand side of the inequality depends on the next iterate $x_{k+1}$, which is itself a result of the step taken. The choice of $\\alpha_k$ influences the step, which in turn determines if the condition is met.Therefore, one cannot enforce this condition to guarantee the accelerated rate. One can only check after the fact if the condition was satisfied at each iteration. The paper itself notes that the condition is \"verifiable in practice\"2, which reinforces this point. As such, Corollary 2 does not provide a constructive method to achieve the $\\mathcal{O}(k^{-2})$ rate, but rather identifies a specific, non-enforceable scenario under which it occurs.\n\n\n5. **QN vs. Newton-type**\n\nThe authors refer to their proposed method as a \"Quasi-Newton\" (QN) method. While the term is used broadly, in optimization literature, \"Quasi-Newton\" most often refers to a specific class of methods (like BFGS, DFP, or SR1) where the Hessian approximation $B_k$ (or its inverse $H_k$) is constructed recursively using iterate and gradient differences, satisfying a secant equation. It would be more appropriate to name the proposed method as \"Newton-type\" rather than QN. I was initially excited that this work would have established the global convergence guarantee for QN methods in the literature, but the proposed algorithm was rather of a Newton-type. \n\n6. **Comparison to Existing Work**  \n\nIn the introduction, the authors state that global convergence rate for Newton-type or quasi-newton method is not known in the literature --- \"Despite all of the interest, even nowadays, many classical Quasi-Newton methods still lack non-asymptotic global convergence guarantees. Only recently global non-asymptotic convergence guarantees with explicit rates were established for BFGS in the strongly convex setting for specific line search procedures\". Their primary goal is  \"to guarantee global non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for classical Quasi-Newton methods for non-strongly convex functions.\" Precisely this has been done in a recent work (Duan, Lyu 2025; arXiv:2509.21684) on a different but related algorithm, which relaxes Mishchenko's globally regularized Newton (Mishchenko, 2021; arXiv:2112.02089) with overestimated Hessian approximation with also a very simple stepsize rule. This work provides some practical randomized Hessian overestimation procedure, obtains $O(1/k)\\rightarrow O(1/k^2)$ global convergence rate (similar to Thm. 1), and local convergence analysis in rank-deficient landscape. Another related work is (Doikov, Stich, Jaggi, 2024; arxiv: 2402.04843), where stronger convervgence guarantees are provided assuming some global knowledge of Hessian spectrum. Certainly the author's goal has been considered in the literature and very relevant results are already obtained. The author's should discuss how their result compares to this work and modify the introduction accordingly. \n\n\n7. **Notational inconsistencies**\n\nSome inconsistancies in notations. For example, it seems to me that some of the $L$'s between line 163 and 170 should be $L_2$ instead, and $\\eta$ on line 201 should be $\\eta_k$. At line 116, given fixed $\\mathbf{B}$, one defines the operator norm of another matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ as $$\\|\\mathbf{A}\\|_{op}=\\sup_{y\\in\\mathbb{R^d}}\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{A}y\\|_{x}^{*}}{\\|y\\|_x},$$ but the right hand side does not depend on $\\mathbf{B}.$ Maybe the author(s) want to define the operator norm for a fixed reference point $x$ instead?\n\n7. **Lack of local convergence analysis.**\n\nOne benefit of Newton-type methods is that one can still have superlinear local convergence without processing the full Hessian. It seems unlikely that (adapted) CEQN can have superlinear local convergence since it is using Hessian approximation from limited memory and the stepsize is not going to 1. In this case, it seems the benefit of using CEQN versus AGD is unclear, given that AGD also have global rate $O(1/k^2).$\n\n\n\n\n**Minor comments:**\n\nL108:  holds --> it holds that \n\nL198: an stepsise --> a stepwise\n\nL201: \\eta-->\\eta_k\n\nL201: The exposition here is rough.
