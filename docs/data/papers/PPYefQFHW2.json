However, these adapters are predominantly co-trained with base diffusion models, inheriting their critical drawback: slow, multi-step inference. This work addresses the challenge of adapting pre-trained ID adapters to much faster distilled diffusion models without requiring any further training. We introduce FastFace, a universal framework that achieves this via two key mechanisms: (1) the decomposition and adaptation of classifier-free guidance for few-step stylistic generation, and (2) attention manipulation within decoupled blocks to enhance identity similarity and fidelity. We demonstrate that FastFace generalizes effectively across various distilled models and maintains full compatibility with a wide range of existing ID-preserving methods, enabling high-fidelity personalized image generation at unprecedented speeds.", "tldr": "training-free techniques for adaption of pretrained id-preserving adapters to distilled diffusion models", "keywords": ["diffusion models", "id-preserving generation", "distillation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b0fceab5c2df71a3f7ca4413ec95967077350ea7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/33033e955b0731fee23b9c27acf36fe510829463.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a set of training-free tricks to augment the distilled ID-consistent person generation model to achieve better ID preservation and preserve the instruction following ability.\n\nFor this objective, the paper presents two methods to augment adapter-based person generation models:\n\n1.

The method proposed in this paper lacks theoretical rigor, and many of its design choices are derived purely from empirical experience rather than from complete theoretical derivation. For instance, in Appendix D, the authors acknowledge that their derivation relies on an independence assumption that “generally is not true,” which leaves the method without a solid theoretical foundation. Moreover, DCG is applied only at the intermediate steps, yet no theoretical explanation is provided for this choice; the authors merely observe through visualization that applying DCG at the first or last step leads to artifacts and therefore adopt this empirical rule. Although these design decisions may be effective in practice, they lack the necessary analytical justification and theoretical reasoning to support their validity.\n2. The paper lacks a systematic ablation study of the DCG and AM modules. The authors clearly distinguish their respective roles: DCG is designed for stylistic generation and prompt-following, while AM focuses on realistic generation and identity preservation. However, in the experiments, both modules are directly combined and evaluated as a unified framework, making it difficult to quantify their individual contributions. Although the appendix provides partial ablation results for AM and DCG, it lacks comparative experiments conducted under identical conditions, for example, evaluating the complete performance metrics when using only DCG or only AM. Consequently, the current experimental setup is insufficient to reveal the specific contribution and mutual relationship of the two modules in the overall performance improvement.\n3. The evaluation dataset used in this paper, DiverseBench, is overly idealized, as the experiments are conducted primarily on synthetic identities and synthetic prompts. All samples are generated by diffusion models and therefore lack the complexity found in real-world human faces, such as variations in lighting, pose, occlusion, and facial expression. Since all experiments are performed in such a controlled environment, the model’s generalization and robustness in real-world settings remain unverified. Consequently, the reported results mainly reflect performance under idealized conditions rather than stability in practical applications.\n4. Although the authors describe the fundamental principles and respective roles of DCG and AM, they do not explain why combining the two modules leads to the best overall performance. According to the results presented in the appendix, using DCG alone increases the CLIP score while decreasing ID similarity, whereas using AM alone improves ID similarity but lowers the CLIP score. This suggests that the two modules respectively favor stylistic coherence and identity fidelity, and that using either one individually merely achieves a trade-off between different performance metrics. However, the paper does not provide a theoretical or mechanistic explanation of why their combination can simultaneously improve both metrics, nor does it discuss whether conflicts may arise between the two modules during inference. Therefore, the joint use of DCG and AM appears to be an empirical engineering design rather than a theoretically grounded method.\n5. Equations (16) and (17) appear to be incorrect. Both expressions contain mismatched parentheses, and Equation (16) additionally includes an extra “ϵ”."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can the proposed method be applied to preserve non-facial human characteristics? AM enhances facial feature retention, but human characteristics are not limited to facial features—they also include factors such as body shape. Does AM have any effect on preserving these other features?\n2. Can validation be conducted on real faces or public face datasets to confirm that the method can maintain stable ID similarity under complex, real-world conditions?\n3. Please explain the interaction between DCG and AM. In some cases, when DCG and AM are used together, could their respective gains counteract each other? Are there situations where using only DCG or only AM yields the best performance?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ms7CQEtV37", "forum": "PPYefQFHW2", "replyto": "PPYefQFHW2", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19252/Reviewer_f74h"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19252/Reviewer_f74h"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19252/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761986332947, "cdate": 1761986332947, "tmdate": 1762931225217, "mdate": 1762931225217, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a method for facial id preservation in distilled image generation using SDXL.
