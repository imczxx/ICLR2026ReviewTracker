To this end, we introduce IGeoCAD, a framework that implements this dual awareness by explicitly modeling constraints through two simple yet effective modules: the Point Constraint-Aware Module (PCM) and the Curve Constraint-Aware Head (CCH).\nSpecifically, at the point level, PCM interprets the geometry of each command, aligning high-level requirements with keypoints and modeling spatial dependencies through coupled attention, thereby ensuring precise localization and consistent point constraints. \nConcurrently, at the curve level, CCH fosters sequence geometric consistency by tracking dependencies across commands through a multi-task objective where an auxiliary head infers constraints to condition parameter prediction. \nCollectively, these modules significantly enhance IGeoCAD's geometric awareness, enabling the generation of complex and precise CAD programs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["CAD Command Sequence Generation", "Geometric Awareness", "Sequence modeling"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5fab8d6974c8f6cd9f914830a9a127d66ec4ded1.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/69d6a8d3e8dff1e7064eb345683523bc7f52b861.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a novel text-to-CAD approach called IGeoCAD.

Text2CAD paper introduces 4 level of text prompts from L0 (abstract) to L3 (expert). And only L3 is suitable for CAD reconstruction (assuming the single correct prediction). For this end authors of Text2CAD measure F1 and CD scores only on L3 benchmark. L0 prompts include \"generate a cylindrical object\", and there can not be a single correct answer, as there can be imagined infinite amount of correct cylindrical objects. That is why Text2CAD authors introduce two metrics: GPT4-evaluation and user study evaluation. However, IGeoCAD is still compared to existing approaches with F1 and CD on all benchmarks from L0 to L3. All these ~2e2 CD metrics doesn't show anything relevant, and are misleading for the readers.\n\n- The single evaluation benchmark is not enough to demonstrate the advantages of proposed PCM and CCH modules. Recent papers, including mentioned in related work, Cadrille or CAD-MLLM evaluate their approaches on up to 3 datasets (DeepCAD, Fusion360, CC3D) and 3 different input modalities (images, point clouds, text). However IGeoCAD is only evaluated on DeepCAD with textual prompt modality. I think, the contributions of proposed modules can be shown on much more of the listed datasets and modalities.

This ultimately impairs the geometric correctness of the 3D model and reduces its executability in practical CAD software. However, the paper does not discuss or verify this potential risk.\nInsufficient description of the specific calculation methods for RPC and GCC metricsThe paper only defines RPC as \"calculating the average difference of corresponding relative vectors, with lower values being better\" and GCC as \"extracting constraint sequences via LLMs and calculating matching degree, with higher values being better\", without specifying key details.
