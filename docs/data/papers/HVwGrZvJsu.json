However, the acquisition of such high-resolution climate information is often prohibitively costly, necessitating the development of data-driven meteorological prediction models. These models aim to generate fine-grained climate data from low-resolution inputs, a process termed climate data super-resolution (SR). Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning for climate data SR have primarily focused on leveraging single-frame spatial information, largely neglecting the temporal correlations between different time frames that could enhance SR outcomes. Furthermore, climate data are inherently stochastic and noisy, rendering widely used temporal alignment methods, such as optical flow models, ineffective in this context. Consequently, the development of a framework tailored for climate data SR that effectively captures implicit temporal correlations remains an unresolved challenge. To this end, we propose a novel Temporal-Enhanced framework with bidirectional temporal alignment. In essence, our framework establishes a temporal bridge to enhance spatial resolution in climate data SR through bidirectional alignment, leading to improved SR performance. Within this framework, Paired Latent Mapping achieves spatial alignment and noise reduction by unifying latent spaces. Then a Bidirectional Temporal Alignment captures temporal correlations by training forward and backward networks on consecutive latent frames. Temporal Enhanced Super-resolution then optimizes the entire framework for climate data SR. Experiments on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrated the superior performance of our framework.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Super-Resolution", "Climate Data", "Temporal Alignment"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8ef1be7bd3ca0c12bb252a484655c1224f3e9425.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors develop a framework to address super resolution tasks on weather data.

How can this be offset?\n\n- While $\\psi_B$ is shown to assist the SR training, can the authors provide some understanding of how using future information to predict past information will not cause any issues. Physical systems evolve such that entropy (disorder) continuously increases. Therefore, going forward and backward in time is not a symmetric process. Granted, such arguments may not be too important for the timescale the authors are looking at. Still, some intuition of how $\\psi_B$ may negatively affect the model is helpful.\n\n- On line 270 the authors state (without citation) that minimizing VSR with only MSE is not optimal. This seems to be a key concept as the loss with $\\psi_B$ and $\\psi_F$ directly follows from this logic. There is a lack of reasoning and evidence to justify this loss. While the loss may be justifiable, the authors colloquially say in 270 that MSE alone is not good, with no justification or citations, and expect the reader to simply believe them. This is lacks sufficient scientific rigor. Please add citations, explanations, and some intuition to back up this claim which is important to why you need this loss and consequently $\\psi_B$ and $\\psi_F$.\n\n- The benchmark models are from 2021, 2023, and 2024, but none from the first half of 2025, nor more from 2024. Can the authors either add more benchmarks or explain why they chose not to include more modern models.\n\n- I do not see a comparison with diffusion or flow-based models, which have been shown to improve super-resolution. The authors state that VRT includes an optical flow, but it is unclear if this is a generative ML method like flow-based models. A good (and recent) comparison for this work would be \"FLEX: A Backbone for Diffusion-Based Modeling of Spatio-temporal Physical Systems\" which also uses temporal information to improve super resolution tasks, but uses a diffusion model framework.\n\n- If the goal is to resolve weather data to the same resolution as data that currently exists, then why not train at that resolution and supplement the training with lower resolution data? Can the authors explain why it is better to apply their method rather than multi-resolution training. Do the authors expect that this method can be applied to the highest resolution data available and improve that resolution beyond what it was trained on? Currently, that is unclear as the supervised loss uses high-resolution data."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "GP4jmkMv60", "forum": "HVwGrZvJsu", "replyto": "HVwGrZvJsu", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8518/Reviewer_3yq4"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8518/Reviewer_3yq4"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8518/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761710571583, "cdate": 1761710571583, "tmdate": 1762920382424, "mdate": 1762920382424, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new method for generating high-resolution climate data from low-resolution inputs, i.e., climate data super-resolution (SR).
