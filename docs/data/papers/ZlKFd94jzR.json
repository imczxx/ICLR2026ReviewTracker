This work extends these efforts by exploring the application of the binning technique to linear models. The conceptual rationale is based on the idea that binning can serve as a simple means of efficient learning through isolating temporal patterns. Instead of relying on temporally adjacent observations, binning adopts another perspective by exposing binned linear layers to periodically grouped data, treating temporal neighbors independently. Both conceptual analysis and empirical experimentation are conducted, with the results demonstrating that this modification can lead to improvements in prediction error. This work positions binning as a simple and effective technique, contributing to the exploration of representations structured by periodicity.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Time Series", "Forecasting", "Linear Model"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/92ff75e97ab9f77b8fd9c2abff626f6e4d15bbf7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a binning technique for time series forecasting that partitions the lookback window based on periodicity rather than temporal adjacency. Each bin contains data points that are w time steps apart (e.g., all same-hour observations for hourly data with daily period), and is processed independently by a separate linear layer. The authors provide theoretical analysis showing that binning eliminates seasonal variation within bins and reduces parameters from LH to LH/w. The technique is validated on synthetic data and five benchmark datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Electricity) using four linear model variants."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The periodicity-based binning technique they provided sounds interesting and novel. Unlike some previous value-based discretization (e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10111), this work groups data by temporal phase within periods, which is conceptually intuitive for seasonal time series.\nThey provided strong theoretical foundations for their method as well as empirical validation in both synthetic datasets and real benchmarks. \nThey made a comprehensive analysis for each experiment, especially the weight visualization, which provides useful insights."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Although the binning technique in this work is novel (as far as I know), there were some other related works (like https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10111) that also use the 'binning' concept in a different way. The authors should make more comparisons with such related works.\n2. They made some theoretical claims that were not thoroughly validated in experiments. For instance, they claimed a significant parameter efficiency ($LH \\to LH/w$), but why is it not reflected in the experiments? Did the binning use less parameters compared to the baselines? Also, they claimed the method can be applied to any model, but they only did experiments on linear ones.\n3. They made strong assumptions in their theoretical part, for example they assumed there is only one single period and it is perfectly periodic throughout the entire time series, which should be more carefully dealt with (for example in AutoFormer they only required approximate periods and learns it). Also they assumes the period $w$ is known, which is acceptable in real cases but should be more clearly stated.\n4. Their method consistently fails in Etth2 (and for some models in some other datasets). They made a superficial discussion in the Appendix but it would be better if they can analyze deeper, for example why binning fails here and in what cases should be use binning.\n5. More ablation studies on experiment hyperparameters should be done, and they should do more comparisons with other methods instead of only the linear models themselves."}, "questions": {"value": "I think there are many interesting ideas in this paper which are underdeveloped, and there are some other concerns. If the author manage to address some of these concerns I think this would significantly improve the quality of this paper (and of course I'd considering giving higher score).\n1. As mentioned in 'weaknesses', was the parameter efficiency reflected in your experiments? If not, why not?\n2. Can you test the method on non-linear models? Is it also effective?\n3. Can you explain what may happen if the assumptions are slightly imperfect? For example what will hapen if you got a wrong $w$? How can you handle if their are multiple seasonalities?\n4. You only tested the $b=w$ case but left other cases as future works. Can you briefly justify this (for example why not $b=w/2$ or $b=2w$) either theoretically or empirically?\n5. As mentioned in 'weaknesses', the binned models consistently fail on ETTh2 across all model types, but only a superficial discussion was made, which is unsatisfactory. Have you investigated why? Does ETTh2 violate your periodicity assumptions? Would using a different period w or number of bins b help? Understanding this failure would strengthen the paper by clarifying when binning should/shouldn't be used. \n6. Section 2 discusses SparseTSF in detail and notes it also uses periodic sampling, but you never provide a direct empirical comparison. Could you include SparseTSF results in Table 1 to show the marginal contribution of your binning approach compared to this closely related method?\n7. Tables 1-2 show that global relative binning (grb) generally outperforms local absolute binning (lab), but the reason is not clearly explained. Is this because grb provides better scale normalization, or because it allows better cross-series learning? Could you provide more analysis on when each strategy is preferable?\n8. Figure 2 (synthetic experiments) shows binned models perform best at high TO ratios (oscillation-dominated). Can you characterize which real datasets have high vs. low TO ratios? Does this explain why binning works well on some datasets (ETTm2) but fails on others (ETTh2)?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "MCxsk0yHQI", "forum": "ZlKFd94jzR", "replyto": "ZlKFd94jzR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24156/Reviewer_mKLw"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24156/Reviewer_mKLw"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24156/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761388323994, "cdate": 1761388323994, "tmdate": 1762942962770, "mdate": 1762942962770, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "In the paper under review, a binning method for linear models for time series forecasting is proposed, where the binning is used to capture the periodic / seasonal part of the time series."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1) The paper is well written and easy to follow.\n2) The approach is simple and can be applied to any linear forecasting model."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1) The paper makes strong assumptions about the structure of the time series.
