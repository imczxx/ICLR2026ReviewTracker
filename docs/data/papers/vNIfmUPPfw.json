However, existing SNN-based studies have largely focused on temporal dynamics, restricting their scope to spike encoding and temporal modeling. In contrast, recent advances in artificial neural networks demonstrate that modeling inter-channel similarity can substantially enhance forecasting performance. Despite this, such perspectives remain underexplored in the context of SNNs. In this work, we introduce a method that explicitly models inter-channel similarity through channel clustering and integrates it into temporal spike encoding. Specifically, we employ attention-based clustering to quantify channel similarity as cluster memberships, and leverage the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to enable both end-to-end optimization and seamless integration into spike-based encoding. We evaluate the proposed approach on six benchmark datasets spanning diverse domains and temporal characteristics, using recurrent-, transformer-, and convolution-based SNN backbones.

The paper addresses a clear and sensible gap in the literature. The motivation, that SNNs for time-series have largely ignored inter-channel relationships, a proven benefit in the ANN world—is well-argued and provides a strong foundation for the work.\n2. The proposed method is technically sound and modular. Using an attention-based clustering mechanism is a reasonable approach, and the use of the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to integrate this into a spike-based framework is appropriate. The design allows it to be plugged into different SNN backbones (RNN, Transformer, TCN), which is a nice feature.\n3. The experimental validation is reasonably comprehensive. The use of six standard benchmarks and three different types of SNN architectures demonstrates the general applicability of the proposed CSE module. The inclusion of an analysis on theoretical energy consumption is also commendable, as it provides a more complete picture of the trade-offs involved."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The trade-off between accuracy and efficiency needs more discussion. The results show a relative RRSE reduction of around 5.2% on average (Line 299), but Table 4 indicates a significant energy consumption increase of 2.7x to 3.3x. This is a substantial cost for a modest accuracy gain and seems to undermine the primary motivation for using SNNs, which is their efficiency. The paper presents these numbers but doesn't really delve into the implications of this trade-off.\n2. While the method improves upon SNN baselines, the performance still lags considerably behind standard ANN models. For instance, in Table 1, the proposed method with Spike-TCN on the Electricity dataset (horizon 96) achieves an RRSE of 0.350, whereas the iTransformer baseline achieves 0.226. This is a significant performance gap. A more direct acknowledgment and discussion of this remaining gap would help contextualize the contribution.\n3. The justification for the specific design choice of concatenating cluster information along the time axis could be stronger (Section 4.4). The paper mentions it is done to \"preserve binary spike values\" (Line 258), but it's not immediately obvious why this is superior to other potential fusion mechanisms. An ablation study or a more detailed explanation of alternatives considered would strengthen this part of the methodology."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Regarding the accuracy-energy trade-off highlighted in Table 4: could the authors elaborate on the practical applications or scenarios where a ~3x increase in energy cost is justified for the performance gains observed? Given that SNNs are often targeted for resource-constrained environments, this seems like a critical point to address.\n2. In Section 4.4, the binary cluster memberships are replicated and concatenated along the SNN time axis. Have other methods for integrating this information been considered? For example, could the cluster embeddings be used to modulate the firing thresholds of neurons or act as a form of attention mechanism over the temporal spikes? A little more insight into the design process here would be helpful.\n3. The clustering process described in Section 4.2 seems to generate a single set of cluster assignments for the entire input time-series window. This implies an assumption that inter-channel relationships are static within that window. Was any thought given to capturing more dynamic relationships, where channels might cluster differently at different points in time?\n4. The parameter analysis in Section 5.4 and Table 3 shows that performance is quite sensitive to the choice of n_cluster. Specifically, performance degrades when moving from 3 to 4 clusters. Is there an intuition for why this might be the case? Does this suggest that the datasets used have a small number of inherent, dominant channel groups?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "zAA5APOhIo", "forum": "vNIfmUPPfw", "replyto": "vNIfmUPPfw", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24767/Reviewer_ioK9"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24767/Reviewer_ioK9"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24767/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762125914997, "cdate": 1762125914997, "tmdate": 1762943190148, "mdate": 1762943190148, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
