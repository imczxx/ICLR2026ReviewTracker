Most existing deep learning methods are limited to simplified one-way FSI scenarios, often assuming rigid and static solid to reduce complexity. Even in two-way setups, prevailing approaches struggle to capture dynamic, heterogeneous interactions due to the lack of cross-domain awareness. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{Fisale}, a data-driven framework for handling complex two-way \\textbf{FSI} problems. It is inspired by classical numerical methods, namely the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (\\textbf{ALE}) method and the partitioned coupling algorithm. Fisale explicitly models the coupling interface as a distinct component and leverages multiscale latent ALE grids to provide unified, geometry-aware embeddings across domains. A partitioned coupling module (PCM) further decomposes the problem into structured substeps, enabling progressive modeling of nonlinear interdependencies. Compared to existing models, Fisale introduces a more flexible framework that iteratively handles complex dynamics of solid, fluid and their coupling interface on a unified representation, and enables scalable learning of complex two-way FSI behaviors. Experimentally, Fisale excels in three reality-related challenging FSI scenarios, covering 2D, 3D and various tasks.

Since that is the case, couldn't you simplify the model to:\n    1) update solid via cross attention;\n    2) update fluid via cross attention;\n    3) update interface with self attention;\n    4) update grid?\n\n    Note that 1) and 2) can be potentially done in parallel if solid and fluid concatenated, which would make it even faster.

However, it is not clear to me what attention is used: linear or self-attention. If not latter, then I would expect much better performance from using standard attention which would, in my opinion, question the value of having the PCM module. It would be great if authors could do the ablation measuring runtime, memory and performance. Having a single kernel might also make it faster, hence I am curious about the runtime.\n- The paper does not do an interpretability analysis of the latent ALE grids. While it is not strictly necessary, I do find Transolver slice assignment useful, perhaps the paper would benefit from a similar plot.

That is counter-intuitive to me as I would expect improved performance with increased number of grid points.

If linear, would it be possible to update the table with standard attention (flash attention) and compare memory, runtime on top of performance?\n- For the set of problems, how does the method compare against a numerical solver?\n- Authors report Relative L2 instead of MSE for the CoDA-NO dataset.

This is clear from the ablations performed in Appendix G. The increased accuracy in the experiments in the main paper can simply arise from the high representational capacity of the architecture itself, since there are a lot of learnable components. Also, the choice of the dimension of the latent ALE grid (i.e. D) does not seem to be explicitly defined anywhere in the paper. A large value of D can also cause overfitting.  \n\t2.\tThe intuition behind using attention for coupling is not very clear. In my understanding, attention mechanisms are used to model long-range dependencies which arise in text based domains, for example. The interface dynamics in fluid-structure interaction are necessarily short range, as far as both fluid and solid domains are concerned. So, using attention would be wasteful, and might even be numerically unstable. \n\t3.\tThe proposed model does not seem to be generalizable across tasks, which involve different geometry (static and dynamic). There is separate training and dataset for each of the three tasks. In that case the gain in inference time is not so much to offset the training time required for each of the tasks, when compared with a classical numerical simulation. \n\t4.\tThere is no mention of how the initial values of physical quantities q is fed to the model. The only point where it seems to be involved is in defining the initial latent state x^{0,h} = Linear(u). Even that uses a trainable linear layer. Without information about the initial state, no model can accurately predict future states.

It was shown in GNS that the model is able to handle multi-material systems (water-sand, water-jelly) by simply creating material-type embedding and leveraging data-driven training to learn the interaction dynamics.

Lagrangian systems typically require GNN based processing and models designed to handle Eulerian grid inputs fail to handle inter-particle interactions. This was shown in UPT, Transolver and GIOROM. The problem setting describes a system that is Eulerian or Lagrangian but the results don't seem to include any interaction dynamics datasets despite referencing GNS several times in the paper. \n3. The rationale behind KNN based grid is not fully clear to me. Typically neural operators leverage radius based grids with mean aggregation to enable discretization invariance (GINO, multipole graph kernel network). This is because when the input discretization changes, radius aggregation ensures an entire region is captured. With KNN based grids, the aggregation region changes based on discretization -- how does this enforce discretization convergence? \n4. The approach inherently handles multi-scale inputs.
