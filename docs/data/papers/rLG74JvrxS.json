This limitation undermines their performance in terms of coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge with CausalPlan, a framework that integrates explicit structural causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states influence future decisions. This model is then used to inform the planning process, shaping proposed LLM-generated plans through causal scoring, reweighting, and fallback to grounded alternatives when needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop, CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviors without requiring fine-tuning. We evaluated CausalPlan on the Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B and Llama-70B. Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming strong reinforcement learning baselines.

The learned object is a policy-structure over observed features that predicts the next action, not a dynamics model one could query with do operators or counterfactuals. The SCA takes parents $(a_{t-1}, s_t)$. This models cause-effect relationships within the agent’s decision process, not the environment’s physics or tasks dynamics\n\nAccording to the definition at L229-L232, each row of $M$ corresponds to a possible next action and each column to a state of past-action features. Each entry is the learned probability that feature $j$ influences action $i$, given the learned structure. Querying $M$ sums the active parent entries to produce a \"causal score\". In effect, from my understanding, higher sum implies that the model has learned that the currently active features are predictive parents of that next action. This is not a causal effect estimate in the Pearl sense.\n\nThe proof’s conclusion (L812-L814) that \"the causal action matrix … faithfully reflect the true cause-effect relations among states and actions\" reads too strongly. What is captured is a sparse dependence over $(s_t, a_{t-1})\\to a_t$, which is a property of the actor’s policy, not of the world’s causal structure.\n\nA (hard) intervention (if atempted) would possibly be toggling columns $j$ (making a feature active/inactive) and seeing how the score changes. The paper does not define or use interventional queries over an SCM over the environment’s variables. Concretely, the method learns a decision structure, not environment causality.\n\nCan you clarify the above in the paper?\n\nMinor: “intervention” is used informally (L277, re-prompting) which can be confusing in a section that discusses causal effects and structural causal action models.\n\nFurthermore, there are two distinct issues with the proof:\n\nA) Proof-method mismatches\n- Estimator mismatch; The appendix analyses ridge on fixed basis features and reads parents from the support of $W$. The method itself trains neural Bernoulli heads via NLL and learns $\\eta$ jointly. These are not equivalent and, as far as I can tell, one does not imply the other.\n- ANM vs classifier; The proof invokes ANM-style identifiability but the trained model is a binary classifier\n- Acyclicity gap: The proof assumes a DAG. The method’s heuristic \"zero the smaller of each bidirectional pair\" only removes 2-cycles, leaving (3+)-cycles in the action-action portion of the graph). Take for example the following relations: $W(a \\to b) = 0.5 > 0.3 = W(b \\to a)$, $W(b \\to c) ‎ = 0.5 > 0.3 = W(c \\to b)$, $W(c \\to a) = 0.5 > 0.3 = W(a \\to c)$. The heuristic would remove the three arrows $b \\to a$, $c \\to b$, $a \\to c$ but $a \\to b \\to c \\to a$ remains. This is inconsequential when the learned matrix is used in a feedforward manner as done in the paper, but the claim (L236-238)\"…ensure DAG property of a standard SCM…\" is not correct.\n- Observability: The proposition (L220) states $a_t$ is unobservable, but the proof in the appendix uses an observed $a_t$ to train the SCA model. Clarifying unobserved at test time, observed during training would help.\n\nAny of the above, in my view, render the statement proven in the appendix inapplicable to the method in the main paper (apart from the observability claim but that’s a wording inconsistency).\n\nQuestions: Either restate and prove a proposition for the actual model class and estimators, align the method to the ridge/basis estimator in the appendix or clearly state that this is a motivating surrogate that does not apply to the method.\n\n\nB) Standalone proof issues\n\nWhen considering the proof itself in isolation:\n\n- The specific regularizing conditions/assumptions are not clearly stated (i.e., L728: \"identifiability of causal direction relies on the function class having sufficient expressiveness and satisfying certain regularity conditions (e.g., nonlinearity, invertibility)\". Invertibility, as far as I can tell, is not relevant to the proof. Please state the exact assumptions used.\n- Ridge regression is used and the parents are identified by the support of $W_i$ (L808) with the claim (L809): \"one can recover the graph structure by examining which entries of $W_i$ are significantly nonzero, using thresholding or statistical tests.\". L2 regularisation has no sparsity guarantees and typically yields dense solutions. How exactly is this step justified and implemented?\n- The proof assumes causal faithfulness but the collaborator’s actions are not modelled (L899-901). If $u$ denotes the collaborator’s action, an implicit assumption is made: $a_t \\perp u_{t-1} \\mid (s_t, a_{t-1})$. If $s_t$ is intended to be sufficient to mediate all effects of the parent’s last action, clearly state so, otherwise sufficiency is violated.\n- Eq (8) instantiates the dataset as sequences of the form $(s_t, a_{t-1}, a_t)$. Clearly state what is observable and what is not.\n\nFurthermore:\n- L244-246: Can you clarify how the actions are sampled by the LLM and how they are scored?\n- In the action pruning step, the method assumes access to an external verifier of feasibility. What does this verifier look like? What happens when such a verifier is unavailable (i.e., real-world robotics)? If it is required, can you add this as an explicit assumption?\n- Why does CausalPlan underperform in some settings (Table 1)? A rief discussion of failure modes would help.\n- L318: A short description of the baselines in the main text (with details in the appendix) would make the experiments easier to follow.\n- What is the impact of removing the previous action feature/removing partner-state features or adding the partner’s previous action?\n- How well does an SCA trained on trajectories from a behaviour policy paired with a partner transfer when deployed with different partners?"}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "TrxH9ah2kI", "forum": "rLG74JvrxS", "replyto": "rLG74JvrxS", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16296/Reviewer_AtpH"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16296/Reviewer_AtpH"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16296/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761578614466, "cdate": 1761578614466, "tmdate": 1762926438525, "mdate": 1762926438525, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes CausalPlan, a framework that purports to integrate explicit structural causal reasoning into LLM-based multi-agent planning.

The framework learns from trajectories generated by a fixed behavior policy in Overcooked-AI, which means each action is conditioned on the policy’s internal decision process. Since actions aren’t randomized or independently manipulated, the data are observational, not interventional.\n\n2. The Structural Causal Action model optimizes a likelihood loss ( -\\log P(a_t \\mid s_t, a_{t-1}) ), which captures conditional correlations rather than causal effects ( P(a_t \\mid s_t, \\text{do}(a_{t-1})) ). Without interventions or counterfactual adjustments, the learned structure reflects co-occurrence patterns, not causal mechanisms.\n\n3. Although Overcooked-AI’s environment is deterministic, the data collection process is not interventionally controlled. The simulator ensures that actions deterministically affect states, but the trajectories used for learning are policy-dependent rollouts, not samples from systematically applied interventions.\n\n4. Because the same policy governs both state visitation and action choice, correlations between (s_t) and (a_t) can arise from shared dependencies on unobserved latent factors such as internal LLM reasoning or high-level strategy. The model treats these as causal links.\n\n5. The binary feature encoding used for states and actions is a coarse abstraction of the full simulator state. Hidden variables like spatial positioning or timing can confound state–action dependencies, violating causal sufficiency.\n\n6. The framework’s only verification is improved prediction accuracy and task performance, which measure behavioral alignment, not causal correctness. A model can be highly predictive while causally wrong.\n\n7.
