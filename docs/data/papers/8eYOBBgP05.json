However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity, presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario. Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding. Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods across diverse tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Time series modeling", "Time series forecasting", "Time series foundation model"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/be4682720ab589d4de0425482c8adc005bdd93bd.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/118d5cf52e0ed4b28a124d04e659919014b4902f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Kairos, a new Time Series Foundation Model designed to handle heterogeneous and dynamic time series data.

The use of 𝑃 = {32,64,128}, k=3 and z=2 indicates that the proposed dynamic tokenization strategy is not genuinely flexible. In practice, the method behaves very similarly to a fixed tokenization with P=32, where different patches are merely assigned different weights. While the approach may appear more sophisticated at first glance, its operations are ultimately limited to combining a small set of predefined patch sizes, which constrains its adaptability and overall novelty.  A truly dynamic tokenization should produce patches of arbitrary lengths. Ideally, it should generate very long patches in smooth regions and patches whose lengths are roughly comparable to the fluctuation period in regions with rapid changes, rather than being limited to a few predefined lengths such as 32, 64, or 128.\n\n2. The function and purpose of the null expert remain unclear. Specifically, it is not evident what contributions it makes to the model’s performance, and no ablation study has been presented to quantify its effects or justify its inclusion.\n\n3.

For instance, works on domain-specific tokenisation [1] and wavelet-based tokenisation [2] should be included to provide a representative overview of the current literature. \n\nTerminology:\n\n2) The term 'general-purpose time series foundation model (TSFM)' (see line 039) is misleading, as the proposed model is only able to perform forecasting. This is also the case for the title. A more suitable term in the context of this study would be 'foundational forecasting model', since general-purpose time series models such as MOMENT [3] are able to perform classification and regression in addition to forecasting. \n\nMethodology:\n\n3) The authors measure the information density of a time series via spectral entropy. They claim a direct relationship between spectral entropy (SE) and information density (ID), i.e. low SE indicating low ID and high SE indicating high ID, as suggested in Figure 1.b. However, I believe the relationship between ID and SE to be inverse. For example, the ID of a pure sine wave should be higher than the ID of a sine wave overlaid with white noise, which is not the case in Figure 1.b. \n4) Furthermore, the ID of a time series is strongly coupled to the sampling frequency (SF). For instance, ETTm1 and ETTh1 are recordings of the exact same underlying signal, however, ETTm1 has a higher ID since it is recorded at a higher SF. While an interesting approach, the usage of spectral entropy as a measure of information density might not be the best fit. \n5) The overview of the proposed method in Figure 2 is not self-containing and thus hard to follow for the reader. \n6) The proposed method is designed for univariate time series analysis and thus cannot model dependencies between variates. However, previous works [1] have shown that inter-variate dependencies are critical in time series analysis and should be considered during the tokenisation process.\n\nExperiments: \n\n7) The authors compare the proposed tokeniser against several baselines, however, they do not include recent works in the field of time series tokenisation. Particularly, OTIS [1] and WaveToken [2] should be included as baselines to ensure a fair comparison of the proposed method. \n8) The authors argue that the proposed multi-patch prediction strategy 'effectively mitigates the cumulative errors inherent in autoregressive precesses' (see ll. 289-299). However, in Figure 6 (appendix C) they show that predicting only the next two patches achieves best performance. In light of this, the authors seem to overstate the importance of the multi-patch prediction strategy. \n9) The authors ablate the proposed components MoS-DP and IARoPE in Section 4.3. While their work primarily focuses on how \"fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their ability to adapt to varying information densities\" (see ll 17-19), the results presented in the last two rows of Table 2 suggest otherwise. Specifically, the proposed dynamic patching tokeniser MoS-DP yields only marginal improvements of 0.68%, 0.13%, and 0.12% across short-, medium-, and long-term prediction horizons, respectively. This modest gain raises the question of whether fixed-size patching truly constitutes a limitation of current methods in the first place.\n10) The authors analyse the proposed IARoPE in Section 4.4.2 and show that Intra-Dataset shuffle performs better than the original RoPE, which seems to be counter-intuitive and requires further elaboration.\n\nDiscussion:\n\n11) The discussion of the experiments is limited. The experiments section only provides numbers without their interpretation, while the conclusion section only provides a brief summary of the study.\n12) The authors do not discuss the limitations of the study in the main manuscript. \n13) The authors do not discuss topics relevant for future work in the main manuscript.\n\n___\n[1] Turgut, Ö. et al. \"Towards generalisable time series understanding across domains.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.07299 (2024).\n\n[2] Masserano, L. et al. \"Enhancing Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting via Wavelet-based Tokenization.\" ICML (2025).\n\n[3] Goswami, M. et al. \"MOMENT: A Family of Open Time-series Foundation Models.\" ICML (2024)."}, "questions": {"value": "1) Could the authors visualise examples of the synthetic data included in the pre-training corpus?\n2) How do the authors determine the perfect balance between real-world and synthetic data used for pre-training?\n3) What is the advantage of infusing synthetic data into the pre-training corpus?

However, the authors do not explain how 'comprehensive coverage' is defined or measured in this context.\n4) Could the authors evaluate their method against multi-variate approaches such as [1]? This would enable a comparison of different tokenisation approaches that address the problem of varying temporal dependencies across domains.

However, if that is the goal, the more intuitive way would be to actually start from the fines resolution, i.e., the individual time steps and then fuse more and more information together to form larger patches eventually. It is unclear how splitting the initial coarse patch into finer patches would \"fuse information from multiple granularities\". Furthermore, the approach that the authors took also requires the user to choose the largest granularity p_S, which may not be easy as it already requires good knowledge about the time series at hand. The illustration in Figure 4 is not quite clear. It would help to overlay directly the selected size of the finest patch p_k for the regions. This way, the reader should see immediately that smaller patches are considered by the network in \"interesting\" areas, such as the ones with high fluctuation or rapid changes. Furthermore, the description of the patch fusion and the Figure 2 illustrating it feel overly complicated. In Figure 2, the information flow is from the bottom to the top. However, in the dynamic patch fusion phase, the coarse patch is broken up into smaller pieces, hence shouldn't the larger green patch be at the bottom and then the splits be towards the top? Also, the coloring scheme is confusing, both across the entire figure (inappropriate color reusing) and within the patch fusion as well (Expert 1 is not even selected for the patch on the right and Expert 1 in green is not chosen in both of the show patches, but highlighted on top).\n\nThe adjustment of the RoPE idea to be specific to the current instance sounds reasonable and the idea to use the core frequency components of the time series to do that also makes sense. However, the specific strength of the original RoPE approach was to be able to generalize to seamlessly generalize to various sequence lengths. It feels that with the IARoPE, this crucial benefit may be lost? Why is so much emphasis put on RoPE then, instead of using a custom position embedding based on the components that the authors extract from the time series?\n\nThe literature review part is very weak and not well written:\\\nSince the paper focuses so much on the input tokenization, there are several papers left unmentioned / undiscussed. For example, the PatchTST architecture, which introduces the central component of this paper, the patches, in the first place is not discussed. Other works, that also employ dynamic patching, such as the TTM, is just mentioned on passing and in a different context even.

In my view, a foundation model could instead aim to learn a comprehensive repertoire of feature extractors that capture fundamental time series characteristics, such as slopes, periodicities, and bursts, across multiple scales. These features could then be contextualized and combined within subsequent transformer layers. Ultimately, robustness to varying time scales might emerge from training on large and diverse datasets, rather than from architectural specialization. This mirrors the behavior of foundation models in other domains: for example, in computer vision, convolutional networks learn to represent objects at different scales and resolutions using a shared set of feature detectors, without domain-specific encoders.\n\n- Similarly, I struggle to see the need for adaptive positional embedding.
