Building on the two-\ntimescale extragradient method, we develop VATT-EG (Vanishingly-Anchored Two-Timescale\nExtragradient), which introduces vanishing Tikhonov-style anchors to eliminate neutral modes\nwithout biasing the stationary set. We show that under the standard calmness (bounded-\nratio) assumption: (i) a point is asymptotically stable for VATT-EG if and only if it is a calm\nlocal minimax equilibrium; (ii) every non-minimax stationary point is a hyperbolic repeller\nwith a quantitative spectral margin; and lastly (iii) from almost every initialization, iterates\nconverge with probability one to a calm local minimax point. The proposed analysis depends\non a discrete-time extragradient expansion with constants; a Lyapunov metric built from the\nrestricted Schur complement, and a Robbins-Siegmund argument combined with a measure-zero\nstable-manifold theorem. Experiments on canonical two-dimensional games confirm the neutral-\nmode damping of vanishing anchors, while a delayed-corrector stress test shows that VATT-EG\nstabilizes regimes where GDA and standard extragradient diverge or spiral out. Finally, in\na practical adversarial debiasing example (namely Colored-MNIST), VATT-EG achieves digit\naccuracy comparable to baselines and consistently reducing adversary accuracy, yielding more\ninvariant features.

From Assumption 4.2 asserting $\\gamma_k, \\beta_k \\geq c_2 \\eta_k$, it seems like $c_2 P$ in equation (13) should actually be $c_2 \\eta_k P$. Consequently, the bound on $\\mathrm{Sym}(\\Delta_k)$ along the $y_0$ subspace would be $O(\\eta_k^2)$, not $O(\\eta_k)$ as claimed. This would further invalidate the energy decrement inequality (line 676), as the $O(\\eta_k)$ term in the right hand side cannot have full $\\|\\|e\\|\\|_P$, but a truncated one (not having the part corresponding to $y_0$), potentially even affecting the stated convergence guarantees in Theorem 5.5. Can you check this?\n2. Can the authors provide more details on the Lowener inequality regarding $\\mathrm{Sym}(P \\Lambda_{\\tau_k} J)$ around line 662? It is currently stated without proof, but I don't think it is trivial enough, and I can't see why it should hold. \n3. The experiments appear to be implemented or interpreted incorrectly. For instance, the extragradient (EG) method, regardless of whether it is used in a two-timescale or single-timescale form, should converge on simple bilinear games. However, Figure 1 shows that the final gradient norm remains large, suggesting that even basic convergence behavior is not achieved. This discrepancy raises doubts about the correctness of the experimental setup or the evaluation procedure. Could the authors recheck their implementation and confirm whether the results in Figure 1 are consistent with known behavior of EG on bilinear problems?\n4. It should be straightforward to construct synthetic quadratic minimax games that possess local minimax equilibria where VATT-EG is theoretically guaranteed to converge, while standard methods such as no-anchor TT-EG or GDA lack such guarantees. Experiments on these controlled examples would more directly demonstrate the claimed advantages of VATT-EG, and would provide a clearer empirical validation than the current toy tasks.
