To overcome these limitations, we propose Executable Network of Thoughts (XNoT), a prompt scheme that leverages LLMs’ intrinsic capabilities to autonomously plan and execute reasoning steps from minimal user input. Central to XNoT is the LLM Workflow Template (LWT), a format that supports a network of thought dependencies among sequential elementary steps, enabling XNoT to flexibly adapt to different task complexities and input lengths. XNoT demonstrates superior scalability compared to prior methods. For example, while all methods achieve near 100% accuracy on sorting 16 numbers, XNoT attains 92% on sorting 32 numbers, substantially outperforming CoT (0%) and ToT (12%).", "tldr": "We introduce XNoT, a prompt-native framework that compiles LLM plans into executable networks of thought, scaling reasoning by decomposing tasks into elementary steps with explicit dependencies for higher accuracy and lower cost.", "keywords": ["Executable Workflow", "Prompt Engineering", "Large Langue Model"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1bb5ddb541d86a5faadfe8f27679f5813f939f6b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6331e00491b302c723b531d8954c65b0b4cd70c8.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a prompting method named Executable Network of Thoughts (XNoT).

It seems to me that the core idea is to reduce the burden of LLMs on attending to the dependency issues (which is handled by the execution of the script itself) in its reasoning process."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Like what I mentioned, the shining point for the method seems to be casting the dependency consideration to the script execution process. In that sense, is this method merely a program of thought with some kinds of execution? And how does this method compare to program of thoughts [1]?\n\n- The tasks presented in the paper are rather synthetic, any chances of comparing the your method and the existing ones on some real-world benchmarks? For instance, [2, 3] target specifically on table understanding tasks, and CoT [4] and many others [1] are shown to be effective on various general language / math / code tasks.\n\n- The authors only conduct their experiments based on the GPT-3.5 model, which is less satisfying. How does the base model selection affect the general performance? I think testing the method on other base models would convince readers that the method itself is generalizable in terms of LLMs. Also, studying your method based on some open-source LLMs would potentially shed more insights.\n\n----\n### References\n[1] Chen, Wenhu, et al. \"Program of thoughts prompting: Disentangling computation from reasoning for numerical reasoning tasks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.12588 (2022).\n\n[2] Sun, Zhenjie, et al. \"Table as Thought: Exploring Structured Thoughts in LLM Reasoning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2501.02152 (2025).\n\n[3] Wang, Zilong, et al. \"Chain-of-table: Evolving tables in the reasoning chain for table understanding.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.04398 (2024).\n\n[4] Wei, Jason, et al. \"Chain-of-thought prompting elicits reasoning in large language models.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 35 (2022): 24824-24837."}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "tNuwqCMh0K", "forum": "eGAGRKCeOI", "replyto": "eGAGRKCeOI", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14610/Reviewer_7Cp5"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14610/Reviewer_7Cp5"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14610/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761703131066, "cdate": 1761703131066, "tmdate": 1762924991998, "mdate": 1762924991998, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new prompting framework for large language models that aims to overcome the scalability limitations of existing reasoning methods like Chain of Thought and tot."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "The proposal of LWT as a natural language abstraction for defining step dependencies is conceptually elegant and aligns with how LLMs process structured input.

The reader must infer how the format translates into actionable steps, making reproducibility difficult. \n\n2. the “intelligence amplification” claim is overstated; the method still depends heavily on predefined templates and task examples, which contradicts the claim of full automation. The process of generating and executing LWT scripts still involves manual tuning (e.g., constant prompts, example crafting), and the paper does not quantify how much of the design is truly automated. Third, the experiments rely mainly on synthetic or simple tasks (sorting, keyword counting, arithmetic), which do not strongly demonstrate general reasoning or transferability to realistic domains. There is no evidence that XNoT scales to tasks requiring long-context reasoning, multimodal input, or ambiguous natural language understanding. The comparison to baselines may also be unfair—since ToT and GoT require external scripts, their implementations here may have been simplified, which could bias the cost and accuracy metrics\n\n\n\n the theoretical section (Theorem 1, Lemma 1–2) is mathematically very shallow and does not connect to observed empirical patterns beyond verbal justification!!!
