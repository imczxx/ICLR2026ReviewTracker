We repurpose post-training block ablation as a diagnostic probe: we ablate residual blocks by replacing them with identity mappings, then measure the resulting accuracy drop on a small training ``probe\" slice, yielding a block-level saliency map that we evaluate out of sample on ImageNet. Across ResNet-50, our stage-aware analyses show that simple magnitude or energy proxies are weak or inconsistent predictors of, indicating that large activation does not imply importance; redundancy is better explained by low novelty relative to the skip path. We characterize structure using stage-wise distributions, and we assess practical trade-offs by one-shot identity replacement of those blocks with optional short finetuning, reporting realistic latency-accuracy behavior on CPU and GPU while preserving topology. The methodology is architecture-agnostic and readily extends to other modern skip-connected families (for example, ConvNeXt and ViT).
