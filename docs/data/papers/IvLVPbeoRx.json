Most of these relate to the idealized nature of the assumptions and the gap between the theory and empirical applicability. The following points highlight areas where the work could be strengthened or where additional clarification or experimentation would improve the contribution:\n\n\n1. The fast-rate $O(1 / T)$ convergence is achieved only under an idealized knowledge alignment condition, namely when $\\|\\|D\\left(f_{\\star}\\right)\\|\\|_{L^2} \\approx 0$. In practice, the physical operator $D$ is rarely known with such precision, and even modest mismatch can revert the rate to the slower $O\\left(T^{-d}\\right)$ regime. The paper does not provide a quantitative robustness analysis that would clarify how sensitive the rates are to partial or imperfect alignment, which limits the applicability of the theoretical claims in realistic settings.\n\n2. The theoretical guarantees depend on $\\lambda_T$ choices tied to latent problem quantities (e.g., $\\Psi(f_{\\star}), \\sigma_W^2$ ). While the authors note that cross-validation could be used in principle, the paper offers limited practical guidance or empirical validation for tuning $\\lambda_T$ in realistic settings.\n\n3. The single toy experiment (unicycle) is supportive but narrow (one setting, small MLP, no real-world data/baselines), so the robustness of the phase transition across architectures/noise regimes remains unclear. Even in this controlled synthetic setting, implementing the physics-informed regularization term $\\Psi(f)= \\|\\|D(f)\\|\\|_{L^2}^2$ may require evaluating higher-order derivatives and Sobolev norms, which can be computationally demanding in higher dimensions. In addition, the paper does not discuss how discretization, numerical differentiation, or instability in PDE solvers or neural approximators would affect the performance or validity of the theoretical bounds, leaving a gap between the continuous theory and practical implementation.\n\n4. The framework relies on $D$ being a known, linear elliptic operator. Many modern scientific machine learning applications involve unknown or nonlinear physics, or operators that must be learned jointly with the model (e.g., operator learning, neural PDE surrogates, and PINNs). As the current analysis does not extend to such settings, it is unclear how the insights would generalize to applications where the governing equations are only partially known or inherently nonlinear."}, "questions": {"value": "In relation to the weaknesses stated above, please see my questions/comments below:\n\n1. The paper presents a two-term bound combining the $T^{-d}$ and $T^{-1}$ rates, but it is unclear how to interpret the intermediate regime. Could the authors clarify whether the transition between the two regimes is smooth or abrupt, and provide any threshold conditions under which the fast term becomes dominant? In addition, it'd be great if the authors could shed some light on the following: how robust this behavior is to imperfect knowledge alignment? For example, if $\\|\\|D\\left(f_{\\star}\\right)\\|\\|_{L^2}$ is small but nonzero, does the convergence rate degrade gradually (and remain faster than $T^{-d}$ ) or does it collapse sharply to the slower regime?\n\n3. Since $\\Psi(f)=\\|\\|D(f)\\|\\|_{L^2}^2$ may involve higher-order derivatives, do the authors foresee computational or numerical challenges when scaling beyond low-dimensional synthetic problems? Any guidance on discretization or numerical stability when implementing this regularizer in practice would be helpful.\n\n3. The analysis assumes that $D$ is a linear and elliptic operator, which can be restrictive. Could the authors comment on whether any part of the analysis may extend to mildly nonlinear or non-elliptic operators, or if linear ellipticity is fundamentally required for the proof techniques used?\n\n4. The paper imposes $s \\geq 2 d_X$ to ensure the burn-in term vanishes. Is this threshold believed to be intrinsic to the problem, or could the two-phase rate behavior persist under weaker smoothness assumptions (e.g., $s>d_X$ or $s>3 d_X / 2$ ) with possibly different constants?\n\n5.

Set in the context of statistical learning, our construction provides the first convergence rates for physics-informed learning under dependent data, deriving results that are entirely algorithm-agnostic and hold for any nonparametric approach.\\\nMany of the Reviewers' questions regarded practical aspects such as implementation, neural network architecture and optimization errors. \nWe appreciate that these are issues of tremendous interest in machine learning practice, but answering them would require an extensive empirical study that is out of the scope of this paper, which does not focus on any specific algorithm. Nevertheless, we made a more explicit connection to practical implementations, enriching the bibliography on physics-informed machine learning and deep networks. Also, following the suggestion of Reviewers tMrX and 7BGW, we expanded the explanation of our results to make our work more accessible -- please find the proposed revised version in the Supplementary material, where we uploaded the new version with modifications in blue-printed fonts.\n\nAlong the same lines, we would like to point out that the numerical illustration presented in the paper is just to display a sample behavior of what is predicted by the theory: the empirical excess risk decreases faster if injected with correct physical knowledge. Its goal is not to claim superiority of one algorithm compared to a baseline. However, we modified its presentation, featuring more comments on practical issues like burn-in quantification, finite-sample behavior, selection of $\\lambda_T$ and impact of non-aligned prior knowledge (Reviewers 3SEU, 6PJM and 7BGW). \n\nFurthermore, we appreciated the Reviewers' comments on the standing assumptions in our paper:\n- Reviewers tMrX, 3SEU, 6PJM asked about relaxing Assumption 4 on having the differential operator to be linear and elliptic. While unfortunately our analysis does not carry over seamlessly to nonlinear operators (which will be a compelling future research direction), we were able to relax the requirement on the PDE to be elliptic. Indeed, such a condition lends us the norm inequality (C.2), which we use only in Proposition C.4 to compute the covering-number bound for the effective hypothesis space $\\mathscr{F}^{\\rho}$. However, elliptic regularity is only a sufficient, not necessary condition for inequalities like (C.2) to hold: similar results can be obtained (i) for second-order parabolic operators, via $\\mathscr{L}^2$-regularity in anisotropic Sobolev spaces for $\\mathscr{D} = \\partial_t - \\mathscr{A}$, with $\\mathscr{A}$ being the spatial differential operator ([1], Ch.7.1.3); and (ii) for second-order hyperbolic operators, relying on energy estimates ([1], Ch.7.2.3). Thanks to this, we were able to extend the applicability of our results to other priors of interest, such as those given by the heat and wave equations.\n- Reviewers tMrX and 3SEU consider Assumption 5 (on having the unknown function to be estimated to be contained in the hypothesis space) very restrictive. In general, such an assumption is quite common in the learning theory literature and allows us to focus on the stochastic component of the excess risk, deriving the results presented in our paper. If Assumption 5 were violated, the excess risk bounds would feature an additional deterministic term given by the choice of the hypothesis space. Bounds for such a bias have been derived in the statistical learning literature leveraging, e.g., interpolation theory [2] -- however, being entirely data-independent, these bounds are essentially decoupled by the ones derived in our paper, and our analysis would not advance their theory. Nevertheless, we expanded the comment on Assumption 5 based on these considerations.\n- Reviewers 3SEU and 6PJM ask about different avenues to relax Assumption 2 on the Sobolev space order $s$, which is indeed a very interesting matter. At the moment, the stricter assumption on $s$ is needed to have a well-defined burn-in time, which in turn emerges from the whole construction of martingale offset complexity bounds. Even if intuitively one can explain that a larger smoothness degree is needed to cope with dependent data, we do not exclude that different set-ups could lead to relaxing the assumption on $s$, possibly introducing some restriction elsewhere.\n\nPlease refer to the individual comments to Reviewers for further detailed responses. \n\n**References:**\\\n[1] L.
