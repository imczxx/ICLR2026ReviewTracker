However, even recent T2V models find it challenging to follow text descriptions accurately, especially when the prompt requires accurate control of spatial layouts or object trajectories. A recent line of research uses layout guidance for T2V models that require fine-tuning or iterative manipulation of the attention map during inference time. This significantly increases the memory requirement, making it difficult to adopt a large T2V model as a backbone. To address this, we introduce Video-MSG, a training-free Guidance method for T2V generation based on Multimodal planning and Structured noise initialization. Video-MSG consists of three steps, where in the first two steps, Video-MSG creates Video Sketch, a fine-grained spatio-temporal plan for the final video, specifying background, foreground, and object trajectories, in the form of draft video frames. In the last step, Video-MSG guides a downstream T2V diffusion model with Video Sketch through noise inversion and denoising. Notably, Video-MSG does not need fine-tuning or attention manipulation with additional memory during inference time, making it easier to adopt large T2V models. Video-MSG demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing text alignment with multiple T2V backbones (VideoCrafter2 and CogVideoX-5B) on popular T2V generation benchmarks (T2VCompBench and VBench).

My main concern is that the proposed pipeline is overly complex. The end-to-end latency is likely to be substantial, as the method requires a cascade of different models (T2I, I2V, Object Detection, MLLM, Segmentation, Inversion, and T2V). This sequential process is time-consuming and introduces a significant risk of error propagation. A failure at any single stage could compromise the entire generation process.\n\n2. The method's success is heavily reliant on powerful, closed-source models like GPT-4o to generate accurate LLM planning. Table 4 shows that using a weaker LLM planner drastically degrades performance. \n\n3. The \"VIDEO SKETCH\" is constructed by pasting a single, static image of the foreground object across all frames based on the planned trajectory. This approach cannot capture or guide intra-object motion. I wonder about the visual effect for prompts like \"a man walking with his arms swinging\" or \"a cat walking with its tail wagging\". For such cases, the method might even underperform the baseline T2V model."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can the authors also compare the end-to-end latency of Video-MSG with other similar methods?

This project utilizes a complex and computationally demanding pipeline, incorporating models such as FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, Cogvideo-5B, Recognize-Anything, Grounding-Segment-Anything, GPT-4o, and noise inversion.

The performance of this method is restricted by additional modules such as Recognize-Anything, Grounding-Segment-Anything, and GPT-4o. Errors from these components will negatively affect the model's behavior.\n\n3. The qualitative examples shown in the paper often involve relatively simple scenarios. The experiments do not fully demonstrate the method's performance in more complex and \"chaotic\" scenarios. For example: Dense multi-object interaction and Complex camera movements.\n\n4. The lack of analysis on failure cases makes our understanding of this method's robustness and boundary conditions incomplete.

When the noise injection ratio α is inappropriate, what specific visual artifacts will appear, besides \"unnatural motion\" or \"not following the trajectory\"?\n\n5.

Video-MSG also has some notable drawbacks. Firstly, its entire pipeline relies on a large and complex ensemble of multimodal models, including an MLLM for planning, object detection, and instance segmentation models for processing the background, and T2I and I2V models for generating background and foreground. This complexity not only makes the system difficult to deploy and debug but also introduces more potential points of failure.

The method has limited capability in controlling interactions between objects and changes in dynamic attributes. Experimental data in the paper also show little improvement in dynamic attribute binding. This is because the core guiding information is the object's motion trajectory.
