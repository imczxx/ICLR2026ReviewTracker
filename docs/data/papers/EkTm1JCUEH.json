However, many applications require strong properties besides valid inference, such as privacy, robustness or validity under continuous distribution shifts; deriving prediction-powered methods with such guarantees is generally an arduous process, and has to be done case by case. In this paper, we resolve this issue by connecting prediction-powered inference with conformal prediction: by performing imputation through a calibrated set-predictor, we attain validity while achieving additional guarantees in a natural manner. We instantiate our procedure for the inference of means, Z- and M-estimation, as well as e-values and e-value-based procedures. Furthermore, in the case of e-values, ours is the first general prediction-powered procedure that operates off-line. We demonstrate these advantages by applying our method on private and time-series data. Both tasks are nontrivial within the standard prediction-powered framework but become natural under our method.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["prediction-powered inference", "conformal prediction", "distribution-free methods", "e-values"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/aa83f887ac5e1e781f5cc3ec7b6f5e3e7cb24a9c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a40fc8cf3bcd99d920e4690d08998570aeea74c1.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposed a new Prediction-Powered Inference method to construct a confidence set for the unknown parameters.

The conservative issue of the proposed method.**\n\nAccording to the confidence interval in Eq. (1), the width of the interval scales with the range of $\\phi(Y)$, which could be very large in practical regression problems. To make this dependence vanish, Proposition 2.4 requires the coverage error $Err(C)$ of the conformal prediction set to tend to 0. However, for standard conformal prediction methods, if the coverage error converges to zero, the prediction set tends to be the whole label space. Considering the regression problem $Y = X + \\epsilon$ with the prediction model $mu(X) = X$, if we use the absolute residual as the score, we get the CP set $C(X) = X \\pm \\hat{q}$, where $\\hat{q}$ is the $(1-\\alpha)(1+|\\mathcal{C}|^{-1})$ quantile of calibration scores. To guarantee $Err(C) = 0$, we need $P(|Y - X| > \\hat{q}) = P(|\\epsilon| > \\hat{q}) = 0$.\n\n**2. The tradeoff on the miscoverage level of the prediction set is not well discussed in this paper.**\n\nIn addition to the limiting case after Proposition 2.4, the authors should discuss more about the tradeoff on the coverage level $\\gamma$ of the conformal prediction set. In Proposition 2.4, $Err(C)$ is a decreasing function of $\\gamma$, and other terms are increasing functions of $\\gamma$. Are there any optimal choices in finite samples?\n\n**3. About the use of labeled data.**\n\nThe labeled dataset in this paper is only used to construct the conformal prediction set. In the PPI paper (Angelopoulos et al., 2023a), the labeled dataset was directly used to build the confidence set of parameters. Hence, I'm wondering how we can leverage the labeled dataset to improve the confidence set. Also, the width characterization depending on the sample sizes of the labeled and unlabeled datasets should be added.\n\n**4. About the experiments.**\n\nIn Appendix C.2, the range $M$ is set as $1$, is the target function bounded by $1$? In addition, all the specified miscoverage levels for conformal prediction are $1.01/|\\mathcal{C}|$. What is the criterion to choose this level? The experiment results on different levels should be added. Also, there is no comparison with baseline methods in Figure 2.

The key observation in this paper is Lemma 2.1, which derives deterministic bounds for the target parameter, but these bounds depend on a bounded condition (the corresponding parameter M is usually unknown in applications).

If feasible, could you report sensitivity curves of interval length versus $\\gamma$ (and label budget), to illustrate the efficiency-coverage tradeoff?\n2. Z-estimation inversion and solvability. In the Z-estimation setting, $\\theta$ is obtained by inverting the one-sided bounds (yielding a confidence set).

A few worked examples (analytic or algorithmic) would clarify how practitioners should compute $\\theta$ in common parametric tasks.\n3. Comparisons under partial updates (Sec. 3.3). Even though Csillag et al. (2025) requires active data collection, it would still be informative to compare in settings where Prediction-Powered e-values are only updated when a new $Y$ is observed (i.e., no active querying).
