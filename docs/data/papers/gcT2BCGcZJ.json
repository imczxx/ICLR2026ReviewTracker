Despite their effectiveness, existing methods pose the danger of generating uncredible content recommendations (e.g., fake news, misinformation) that may significantly harm social well-being, as they primarily emphasize recommendation accuracy while neglecting the credibility of the recommended content. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose Disco, a novel method to steer diffusion models towards credible content recommendation. Specifically, we design a novel disentangled diffusion model to mitigate the harmful influence of uncredible content on the generation process while preserving high recommendation accuracy. This is achieved by reformulating the diffusion objective to encourage generation conditioned on preference-related signals while discouraging generation conditioned on uncredible content-related signals. In addition, to further improve the recommendation credibility, we design a progressively enhanced credible subspace projection that suppresses uncredible content by projecting diffusion targets into the null space of uncredible content. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Disco in terms of both accurate and credible content recommendations.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Credible content recommendation", "Societal Considerations", "Diffusion models"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2a0bf8bbf16da4866f03326abdc16e9394d3d0aa.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/60766a3051ec4081b0f9c7e8cb91ab0e35672b83.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Disco, a diffusion model-based recommender system designed to mitigate uncredible content recommendations such as fake news and misinformation. The authors identify two factors causing existing diffusion models to generate uncredible recommendations: uncredible conditions from users' historical interactions with uncredible items, and uncredible diffusion targets when the target item itself is uncredible. Disco addresses these through three main contributions: a disentangled diffusion model that separates preference signals from uncredible content signals by jointly encouraging generation conditioned on preference-related embeddings while discouraging generation conditioned on uncredible content embeddings; a credible subspace projection module using SVD-based null-space projection to remove uncredible features from diffusion targets; and a progressive enhancement strategy to handle limited labeled data by iteratively detecting and incorporating potential uncredible items.

The paper tackles the important societal concern of recommender systems amplifying uncredible content, with well-motivated examples including COVID-19 misinformation spread (lines 59-62). The problem formulation is realistic, acknowledging that only partial credibility labels are available in practice (lines 135-138), which distinguishes this work from prior methods like Rec4Mit, HDInt, and PRISM that assume complete label availability. This practical constraint makes the research more applicable to real-world deployment scenarios.\n\n2. **Strong Theoretical Foundations for the design**. The disentangled diffusion model uses the diffusion objective itself as a disentangler without auxiliary networks (lines 211-214), reducing computational overhead. The reformulation in Equation 4 that minimizes variational bound conditioned on preference while maximizing it conditioned on uncredible content is theoretically well-motivated. The credible subspace projection using SVD null-space decomposition (Equations 7-8) is grounded in prior null-space projection work, and Appendix C provides both empirical evidence (Table 6) and theoretical proofs demonstrating how uncredible conditions and targets enhance uncredible generation, strengthening the paper's technical contributions."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Limited Experimental Scope and Insufficient Baseline Analysis**. The evaluation is restricted to three datasets, all in news/video domains (lines 337-343), limiting generalizability to other content types like e-commerce or music. More critically, the paper fixes the labeled data ratio at 20% (line 360) without ablation studies on different ratios (e.g., 10%, 15%, 30%, 50%), making it unclear how sensitive Disco is to label availability.\n\n2. **Unclear Evaluation Protocol**. While the paper states \"complete labels are provided during testing\" (lines 137-138), it doesn't clarify whether uncredible items are included in the candidate pool during evaluation or how this impacts metrics like CR@K. The data augmentation strategy in Appendix B.1 (lines 772-776) transforms each user sequence into multiple sub-sequences, but doesn't specify how train/test splits prevent leakage when subsequences from the same user appear in both sets.\n\n3. **Inadequate Justification and Analysis of results**. Table 2's ablation reveals that replacing cosine loss with MSE (\"w/o CE\") causes severe performance degradation (HR@5 drops from 0.2664 to 0.1034 on PolitiFact, line 439), attributed to training instability (lines 227-229), yet the paper provides no learning curves, gradient analysis, or convergence studies to characterize this instability.

While this work aims to advance credible content recommendation, the experimental results primarily focus on traditional accuracy-based metrics, without providing dedicated evaluations or metrics to assess credibility.

Fake news is often defined based on human judgment, which inherently involves subjective and context-dependent factors. However, the Disco framework relies primarily on ID-based embeddings to identify uncredible content, which may lack the semantic richness and contextual understanding necessary to capture the nuanced nature of credibility. Consequently, the motivation for improving content credibility by adjusting the diffusion process solely based on ID-level signals is potentially limited and requires further theoretical justification and empirical validation.\n3. The proposed improvement to the diffusion model appears to be incremental, primarily involving the addition of a disentanglement strategy. To better position the novelty of their work, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison with existing diffusion-based recommendation methods such as DreamRec and DiffuRec. Specifically, it is important to clarify how Disco differs in terms of model architecture, and objective formulation.\n4. The motivation behind the use of null-space projection for filtering uncredible information is insufficiently explained and appears debatable. While the method is intended to suppress untrustworthy signals, the theoretical justification for why null-space projection effectively filters such content is not clearly articulated. Moreover, the authors do not provide any dedicated experiments to validate the effectiveness of this mechanism in isolating or removing uncredible information. \n5.
