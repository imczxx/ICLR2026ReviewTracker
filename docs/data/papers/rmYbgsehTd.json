The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human ''mind-reading'', we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct communication (termed ''latent communication''). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.", "tldr": "We send an LLM's last hidden states between agents instead of natural language, and train to compress them preserving utility.

The framework of training agents to communicate in a high-dimensional space to solve the sender-receiver task has been extensively researched in the emergent communication and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) community.

Emergence of linguistic communication from referential games with symbolic and pixel input\n\nc. Emergent discrete communication in semantic spaces\n\nd. Trading off Utility, Informativeness, and Complexity in Emergent Communication\n\n2. The methods section is hard to follow.

The description of the training framework could be more specific for better reproducibility. For example, how is the permutation done in conditional mind separation? What is the language space plan in plan-aligned regulation? How does stochastic replacement happen in curriculum learning?\n\nb. The motivation and description of information compression are too brief to be comprehensible. It is not clear how the compression is done in Section 3.3 of the main text. Even after reading Appendix B, the use of a fixed instruction-tuned model and the distillation process lacks a clear rationale. I would recommend moving the description of compression to the main text and emphasizing the motivation for this module.\n\nc.

Motivation and significance not fully articulated: While the paper demonstrates performance gains, it remains unclear what new behaviors or communicative properties latent communication enables beyond efficiency.

This marks an interesting shift in how multi-agent systems can share information, avoiding some of the inefficiencies of text-based communication. The idea seems especially promising for multimodal scenarios, where agents work across different representational spaces.\n\nThe proposed approach shows efficiency gains, achieving large reductions in communication latency. This makes it a strong candidate for scaling multi-agent systems where bandwidth and response time really matter. That said, these benefits likely come at the cost of interpretability, since it’s much harder to understand or inspect what’s being passed around in latent space compared to language-based exchanges.\n\nIn addition, the paper’s clear visualizations and detailed methodological explanations greatly enhance its readability and accessibility."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Overstated and Misaligned Anthropomorphism**: The paper repeatedly compares latent-space communication to human *mind-reading*, which is wrong. What’s actually happening here is closer to the exchange of high-dimensional neural activations, not cognitive inference (or mind reading) on nonverbal cues as in human communication. This framing risks false anthropomorphizing what is essentially a representational alignment problem. I’d strongly recommend removing this metaphor to keep the paper conceptually grounded.\n\n**Lack of Clarity Around Baselines**: The setup and training details for the baseline models are not clearly described. It’s hard to tell whether Interlat’s improvements are valid. The paper mentions that more details are in the Appendix, but that section is a copy-paste of the main text instead of providing the necessary experimental specifics. Without a clearer explanation, it’s difficult to judge how strong the improvements really are.\n\n**Confounding from Shared Model Family**: All agents in the experiments use the same model backbone (Qwen2.5), which means the sender and receiver already share an aligned latent space. The observed performance gains might therefore reflect this intra-family compatibility rather than true inter-agent latent understanding. Testing communication across different model families or scales (e.g., Qwen -> LLaMA) would provide much stronger evidence for the claimed generality.\n\n**Ambiguity in the “Information Parallel Budget” Analysis**: The \"information parallel budget\" idea is interesting but not very clearly defined or empirically grounded. The analysis treats differences in output probability distributions as evidence of parallel reasoning, but that interpretation is speculative — lower probability mass could just indicate more uncertainty, not necessarily parallel thought processes. Also, the analysis only looks at the first six hidden states, which likely misses longer-horizon reasoning effects. As it stands, this part feels underdeveloped and could use a clearer theoretical motivation or empirical validation."}, "questions": {"value": "- Why do you use the base models as the actor models?
