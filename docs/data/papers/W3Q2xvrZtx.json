Most self-supervised methods for articulated object modeling reconstruct discrete interaction states and relate them via cross-state geometric consistency, yielding representational fragmentation and drift that hinder smooth control of articulated configurations. We introduce PD$^{2}$GS, a novel framework that learns a shared canonical Gaussian field and models the arbitrary interaction state as its continuous deformation, jointly encoding geometry and kinematics. By associating each interaction state with a latent code and refining part boundaries using generic vision priors, PD$^{2}$GS enables accurate and reliable part-level decoupling while enforcing mutual exclusivity between parts and preserving scene-level coherence. This unified formulation supports part-aware reconstruction, fine-grained continuous control, and accurate kinematic modeling, all without manual supervision. To assess realism and generalization, we release RS-Art, a real-to-sim RGB-D dataset aligned with reverse-engineered 3D models, supporting real-world evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PD$^{2}$GS surpasses prior methods in geometric and kinematic accuracy, and in consistency under continuous control, both on synthetic and real data.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["articulated object; reconstruction; digital twin;"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/824a76e7f0016d73ab893c2d0e8315dd44d84fc4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces PD²GS, a novel framework for reconstructing and modeling articulated objects from multi-view images without manual supervision.

This elegantly sidesteps the \"representational fragmentation\" of prior two-state methods, enabling smooth, continuous control and interpolation of articulated poses, which is a major step towards high-fidelity digital twins. The framework automatically infers the number and boundaries of rigid parts without manual supervision. It achieves this through a clever coarse-to-fine process that first clusters Gaussians by their motion trajectories (using a VLM for part counting) and then refines boundaries using SAM, making it highly applicable to real-world objects with unknown kinematics."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The empirical evaluation lacks comparison to foundational dynamic scene representation works like D²NeRF (Dynamically Deformable NeRF) or Gao et al.'s deformable 3DGS, which also model scenes via a canonical field and latent-code-driven deformation. This omission makes it difficult to assess the true novelty and contribution of the deformation modeling component beyond the specific task of articulation.\nThe method is explicitly noted to assume \"accurate camera poses,\" and its robustness to pose estimation noise, a common issue in real-world applications, remains entirely unvalidated. This is a significant practical limitation that is not addressed through ablations or sensitivity analysis, casting doubt on the method's real-world readiness. While tested on objects with up to three parts, there is no evidence provided for the method's performance on objects with a higher number of articulated parts (e.g., >5). The clustering and segmentation pipeline may face challenges with increasing complexity, and its scalability remains an open and significant question."}, "questions": {"value": "1.Dynamic Scene Baselines: Why were foundational dynamic scene representations like D²NeRF or other deformable 3DGS methods not included as baselines?

Could you provide an ablation or sensitivity analysis on the robustness of PD²GS to noisy camera poses, which are common in real-world SfM pipelines? This would significantly strengthen the claim of real-world applicability.\n\n3.Handling Occlusion: The limitation of being unable to reconstruct unobserved geometry is acknowledged.
