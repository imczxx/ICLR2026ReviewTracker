Yet most existing methods, if not all, rely on strong structural assumptions, such as enforcing specific indicator patterns for latents or restricting how they can interact with others. We argue that a core obstacle to a general, structural-assumption-free approach is the lack of an equivalence characterization: without knowing what can be identified, one generally cannot design methods for how to identify it. In this work, we aim to close this gap for linear non-Gaussian models. We establish the graphical criterion for when two graphs with arbitrary latent structure and cycles are distributionally equivalent, that is, they induce the same observed distribution set. Key to our approach is a new tool, edge rank constraints, which fills a missing piece in the toolbox for latent-variable causal discovery in even broader settings. We further provide a procedure to traverse the whole equivalence class and develop an algorithm to recover models from data up to such equivalence. To our knowledge, this is the first equivalence characterization with latent variables in any parametric setting without structural assumptions, and hence the first structural-assumption-free discovery method.

Your paper currently focuses on minimal DGs, where minimality is measured in terms of numbers of variables.

Your paper currently makes LiNG assumptions. However, low-dimensional bottlenecks should still be noticeable in linear Gaussian, or in nonlinear settings. What prevents us from generalizing the approach to these cases?\n3. Given this classification of equivalence classes, is there any hope (and need) for a GES-like algorithm to learn the (equivalence class of) the causal graph? Would this provide any benefit?\n4. Would it be possible to explain more about why certain graphs are not equivalent? For example, in the example in section C.2, Figure 5, one could think that the graph $G_1$, but with the edge $X_3 \\rightarrow X_1$ removed (equivalently, $G_10$ with the edge $X_3 \\rightarrow X_2$ removed) might lie in the same equivalence class. \n\nAs a side note, it appears that your sections D.1-D.3 and their contents are currently struggling a little with formatting."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "oDnFGJRWl0", "forum": "b8TlYh6PN6", "replyto": "b8TlYh6PN6", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6490/Reviewer_Czvx"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6490/Reviewer_Czvx"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6490/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761556871151, "cdate": 1761556871151, "tmdate": 1762918864120, "mdate": 1762918864120, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies a fundamental problem in causal discovery: the distributional equivalence criterian of causal structure from observational data when both latent confounders and cycles are allowed, in linear non-Gaussian models.

I think this is inline with how the authors present the work in the paper (e.g., presenting the glvLiNG algorithm as a \"proof of concept\" rather than a practical tool for causal discovery from real data), but nevertheless answers to the following questions could lead me to increase my rating: \n1. Do the authors have any real-data applications in mind, where the learned equivalence classes are sufficiently informative? I'm thinking of how a CPDAG can still be relatively useful in practice, while it's less clear how useful one of these equivalence classes would be.\n2. Any ideas for an interpretable representative a given equivalance class (analogous to a CPDAG)?\n3. Any ideas for how to refine these to interventional equivalence classes?\n\nThe following are suggestions I hope the authors will find useful but that don't require a response and don't affect my rating:\n1. Without providing finite sample guarantees, it doesn't really make sense to talk about \"identifying\" a graph from data---the graph is rather identified from (parameters of) the data-generating distribution. In many but not all instances, the paper correctly uses \"recover\" (and \"estimate\" or \"learn\" would also be appropriate words) for this case, but there are still some places where \"identify\" is used incorrectly (including L015, L027, L064).\n2. L211: \"share the same latent variables\" seems too strong; can the authors justify the step from the same *number* of latents in the previous sentence to the same latent variables here? or use more precise language here if nothing more is meant.\nwriting: L238 (\"is\" -> \"are\", or \"constraints\" -> \"constraint\"), L297 (\"to the\" -> \"in\"), L346 (\"in edges term\" -> \"in terms of edge ranks\").\n3. reference formatting: ensure all words (e.g., 'Bayesian') are capitalized correctly; use the correct characters in Dénes Kőnig's name.\n4. Consider adding additional citations, e.g., to work on transformational characterizations for other settings [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], and identifiability in nonparametric latent measurement models (without graphical assumptions beyond acyclicity) [6], [7], [8].\n5. Remove the \"if not all\" part in the second sentence of the abstract. Papers [6], [7], and [8] (and I imagine others) don't make structural assumptions---they just use minimality, which is essentially the author's irreducibility but for identifiability up to nonparametric independence model equivalence rather than up to LiNG distributional equivalence.\n\n[1] Zhang, J., & Spirtes, P.
