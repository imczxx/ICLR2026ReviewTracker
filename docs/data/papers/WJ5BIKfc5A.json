While existing KV cache optimization methods address these challenges through token pruning or feature merging, they often incur irreversible information loss or require costly retraining. To this end, we propose ZSMerge, a dynamic KV cache compression framework designed for efficient cache management, featuring three key operations: (1) fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional token importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) a residual merging mechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention scoring, and (3) a zero-shot adaptation mechanism compatible with diverse LLM architectures without requiring retraining. ZSMerge significantly enhances memory efficiency and inference speed. When applied to LLaMA2-7B, it demonstrates a 20:1 compression ratio for key-value cache retention (reducing memory footprint to 5% of baseline) while sustaining generation quality and achieving a 2.25× throughput improvement at extreme 54k-token contexts, eliminating out-of-memory failures.

We deeply appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our work. We have **provided detailed point-by-point response to each reviewer's specific questions**. Below, we address common themes and provide an overview of major revisions made to the paper.\n\n***All revised/updated contents are in red in the updated PDF***\n\n---\n\n**Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis (Response to AyAi-Q10, BJzQ)**\n\nMultiple reviewers raised concerns about the sensitivity of our hyperparameters, particularly the decay factor $\\lambda$ and window size. We have conducted comprehensive ablation studies to validate our design choices:\n\n**Decay Factor ($\\lambda$) Ablation:**\n\n|$\\lambda$|ROUGE-1|ROUGE-2|ROUGE-L|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|0.00|0.3052|0.1122|0.2527|\n|0.50|0.3084|0.1141|0.2560|\n|0.80|0.3081|0.1143|0.2557|\n|0.90|0.3099|0.1163|0.2568|\n|0.95|0.3074|0.1142|0.2550|\n|**0.98**|0.3078|0.1142|0.2551|\n|1.00|0.3074|0.1135|0.2543|\n\nPerformance remains stable across reasonable decay factor values with minimal variation. This demonstrates ZSMerge's robustness to hyperparameter choice.\n\n**Window Size Ablation:**\n\n|window_size|ROUGE-1|ROUGE-2|ROUGE-L|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|0.3067|0.1127|0.2539|\n|4|0.3096|0.1158|0.2567|\n|**8**|0.3082|0.1147|0.2560|\n|16|0.3053|0.1127|0.2530|\n|32|0.3017|0.1108|0.2494|\n|64|0.3057|0.1133|0.2515|\n|128|0.3104|0.1144|0.2574|\n|256|0.3117|0.1162|0.2596|\n\nPerformance is consistent across practical window size ranges with minimal variation. Smaller windows provide efficient prefill, while larger windows achieve marginally better quality at higher cost. Our choice balances prefill efficiency with generation quality.\n\nThese results confirm that ZSMerge does not require task-specific hyperparameter tuning, addressing concerns about practical deployment complexity.\n\n**Multi-Turn Dialogue Evaluation (Response to AyAi-Q8)**\n\nFollowing the reviewers' suggestion, we conducted experiments on SCBench, a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark covering various long-context tasks. We compare ZSMerge against KVzip with results normalized by full budget performance:\n\n**Per-Dataset Results (Normalized Performance):**\n\n|Dataset|Method|0.1|0.2|0.3|0.5|0.8|1.0|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|scbench_many_shot|KVzip|0.842|0.895|1.026|1.079|0.868|1.0|\n|scbench_many_shot|ZSMerge|1.053|0.974|1.026|1.079|1.026|1.0|\n|scbench_qa_eng|KVzip|0.513|0.365|0.520|0.941|0.687|1.0|\n|scbench_qa_eng|ZSMerge|0.237|0.230|0.289|0.507|0.982|1.0|\n|scbench_repoqa_and_kv|KVzip|0.000|0.054|0.321|0.804|0.804|1.0|\n|scbench_repoqa_and_kv|ZSMerge|0.000|0.091|0.400|0.709|1.000|1.0|\n|scbench_summary_with_needles|KVzip|0.000|0.000|0.236|0.653|0.750|1.0|\n|scbench_summary_with_needles|ZSMerge|0.125|0.306|0.333|0.556|1.000|1.0|\n\n**Average Performance Across All Datasets:**\n\n|Method|0.1|0.2|0.3|0.5|0.8|1.0|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|KVzip|0.339|0.328|0.526|0.869|0.777|1.0|\n|ZSMerge|0.354|0.400|0.512|0.713|1.002|1.0|\n\nZSMerge demonstrates competitive performance across different budget constraints, with particular advantages in extreme memory-constrained scenarios, validating its effectiveness for practical multi-turn tasks.\n\n**Efficiency Comparison with SnapKV (Response to pRqZ, BJzQ)**\n\nTo address reviewer concerns about efficiency comparisons with SnapKV, we conducted detailed latency measurements under long-context decoding. The table below highlights the key trends:\n\n**Prefill Stage:** ZSMerge incurs slight overhead due to contribution score initialization and residual merging setup.\n\n**Decoding Phase:** Early decoding shows persisting but rapidly narrowing overhead as merging operations are amortized. Extended decoding reveals ZSMerge's advantage: as SnapKV's cache grows unboundedly while ZSMerge maintains strict budget constraints, decoder benefits from compressed KV cache overwhelm the incremental cost of dynamic operations.\n\n**Overall Performance:** ZSMerge achieves superior throughput for long-context generation, demonstrating the advantage of dynamic compression during extended decoding phases compared to one-shot prefill compression.\n\n---\n\n|Token Count|snapKV(s)|ZSMerge(s)|Speedup|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|0-1|2.42|2.71|-12.0%|\n|500|24.91|25.48|-2.3%|\n|1000|25.52|25.47|+0.2%|\n|1500|26.13|25.48|+2.5%|\n|2000|26.71|25.48|+4.6%|\n|2500|27.23|25.48|+6.4%|\n|3000|27.77|25.47|+8.3%|\n|3500|28.28|25.49|+9.9%|\n|4000|28.78|25.49|+11.4%|\n|4500|29.25|25.48|+12.9%|\n|5000|29.75|25.47|+14.4%|\n|**Total**|**283.99**|**263.62**|**+7.2%**|\n\n\n---\nWe deeply appreciate the time and effort invested in reviewing our work.

ZSMerge allocates the cache using a three-part budget: $B_p$ stores recent tokens, $B_c$ retains high-contribution tokens, and $B_r$ holds merged representations (defined in Section 3.2, Equation 3, page 4).

Figure 1 appears to be redundant and contains only superfluous information that could be succinctly summarized in a single sentence. Furthermore, the overview of token merging presented in this figure is not sound as not all merging methods tune the LLM weights.\n\n\n2. The authors' motivation does not demonstrate any distinctive aspects. Their stated objectives essentially encompass what all LLM KV compression methods aim to achieve. There is no clear differentiation from existing work.\n\n\n3. Poor writing on the introduction: \n   - The introduction is written too abstractly, making it difficult for readers to follow. First, the concept of \"fine-grained memory allocation\" is not clearly defined, and its distinction from previous methods is not adequately explained.\n   - Second, most existing methods are already zero-shot approaches, so this characteristic is not a unique merit of the proposed method.\n   - Additionally, the authors' claims about the token merging field are not well-supported. For instance, the statement that token merging can only be performed with additional networks is incorrect. There are notable counterexamples, such as [1,2].\n   \n4. Regarding the contribution evaluation, I believe Equation 5 presents significant issues in practical applications. Equation 5 appears to be merely a variant of H2O, and this accumulative approach does not work well for pre-filling acceleration. Moreover, in multi-turn conversation scenarios, the previously accumulated attention scores are unreliable.\n\n\n5. Lack of Novelty in Equations 6 and 7: As for Equations 6 and 7, I cannot identify any substantial novelty. At minimum, the authors should compare their approach with previous merging methods to clearly demonstrate the differences and improvements.\n\n\n6. Incomplete Experimental Comparisons: \n   - Some state-of-the-art methods such as Duo-Attention and PyramidKV were not considered in the experimental comparisons.\n   - The performance does not exceed that of SnapKV, and there is no efficiency comparison with SnapKV.\n\n\n7. Concerns about Efficiency Comparisons:\n   - I have serious concerns about the efficiency comparisons presented. First, I believe the implementation efficiency difference between the proposed method and H2O should be minimal, yet Table 1 shows that H2O is even 3 times slower than the proposed method, which appears completely unreasonable. I suspect there may be unfair aspects in the authors' comparison setup.\n   - A sequence length of 4096 does not represent a long-sequence decoding problem. The authors should provide acceleration results on ultra-long sequences (e.g., 128K tokens), as reported in works like Duo-Attention, to better demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on truly long-context scenarios.\n\n\n[1] CaM: Cache Merging for Memory-efficient LLMs Inference.

However, Figure 3 and Section 4, report an increase from 4 tokens/sec to 9 tokens/sec, which is 2.25x, not 3x.\n\n**Q4.** The claim of \"negligible performance degradation\" is inaccurate. On Falcon-7B (Table 2), ROUGE-1 drops significantly from 27.06 (FullKV) to 15.04 (5% ZSMerge)—a substantial 44% relative degradation.\n\n**Q5.** In Table 2 (LLaMA2-7B), ZSMerge (at 5%) achieves higher ROUGE scores than the FullKV baseline. Just make sure if the implementation is correct.\n\n**Q6.** The novelty of individual components is limited. The contribution evaluation mechanism (Eq. 5), using exponentially decayed integration of attention activations, is nearly identical to the cumulative attention score mechanism in H2O. Furthermore, the concept of merging tokens instead of evicting them has been explored in works like LESS  and  Dynamic Memory Compression (Nawrot et al., 2024). While ZSMerge implements this in a zero-shot manner, the conceptual novelty is limited. \n\n**Q7.** The residual merging uses simple incremental mean aggregation based on Key similarity (Eq. 6 and 7). This approach risks \"semantic deviation\" by grouping tokens that are semantically unrelated but align in the Key space, leading to noisy Value representations. Averaging also destroys positional information and structural relationships between the merged tokens. The paper does not analyze the semantic coherence of the merged tokens.\n\n**Q8.** The evaluation focuses only on single-turn tasks. The authors must include an evaluation on a standard multi-turn benchmark, such as SCBench and multi-turn MIAH.
