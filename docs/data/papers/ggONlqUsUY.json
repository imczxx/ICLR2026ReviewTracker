Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based methods by using hypersphere radii as a monotonic transformation of local density characteristics while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode local sparsity through a monotonic transformation of density: smaller radii correspond to dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance over 11 baseline methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Anomaly Detection", "Unsupervised Learning", "Isolation Forest"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2d18aa412e800358d9c952a4af8c9dbe4d6c06b5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes ISER (Isolation-based Spherical Ensemble Representations), a new unsupervised anomaly detection method designed to overcome the limitations of existing approaches such as conflicting distribution assumptions, inefficiency, and poor handling of diverse anomaly types.

The key assumption of the proposed method that the radius of a hypersphere can serve as a proxy for the local density of a sample point is questionable. Intuitively, local density should be reflected by the ratio of the number of sample points inside the hypersphere to its volume. Since the paper directly uses the hypersphere radius as a proxy for density, a stronger theoretical justification is necessary.\n2. In Equation (4), the choice of the function $\\frac{1}{r[\\hat{z}_i(x)]}$ lacks explanation. Could other functions that are monotonically decreasing with respect to $r[\\hat{z}_i(x)]$ and take values within $[0,1]$ be used instead? Would such alternatives affect the method’s performance, and should a comparative analysis be conducted?\n3. The proposed method uses similarity or mean-based strategies to compute anomaly scores. Although this reduces computational cost, both strategies are based on empirical observations rather than rigorous theoretical guarantees like those provided in IDK [2].\n4. In Figure 1, the notation $Di$ is clearly incorrect, as the index $i$ is not shown as a subscript. Moreover, the bold points in the figure, which seem to represent sampled points, are not explicitly explained, and there is no legend provided. Is it necessary to make these additions?\n5. In Table 5, the %Ano value for the “fault” dataset is clearly wrong, which raises concerns about the reliability of the experimental code. Additionally, in the authors’ anonymous repository, the “Avg.” row in the README’s version of Table 5 is inconsistent with the version presented in the paper.\n6. The abstract mentions the “difficulty in handling different anomaly types,” yet the introduction contains no discussion of this issue. This inconsistency should be addressed.\n7. The introduction does not make the logic behind combining the two methods clear.

This is done by repeatedly sampling subsets of data, defining hyperspheres based on nearest-neighbor distances within these subsets, and then encoding based on its nearest hypersphere. The paper proposes two scoring mechanisms for this representation, ISER-A and ISER-S.
