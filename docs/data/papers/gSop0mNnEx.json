Despite considerable advancements, the field lacks a unified codebase that consolidates existing methods, resulting in redundant re-implementation efforts, unfair comparisons, and high entry barriers for researchers. To address these challenges, we introduce MASLab, a unified, comprehensive, and research-friendly codebase for LLM-based MAS. (1) MASLab integrates over 20 established methods across multiple domains, each rigorously validated by comparing step-by-step outputs with its official implementation. (2) MASLab provides a unified environment with various benchmarks for fair comparisons among methods, ensuring consistent inputs and standardized evaluation protocols. (3) MASLab implements methods within a shared streamlined structure, lowering the barriers for understanding and extension. Building on MASLab, we conduct extensive experiments covering over 10 benchmarks and 5+ models, offering researchers a clear and comprehensive view of the current landscape of MAS methods. MASLab will continue to evolve, tracking the latest developments in the field, and invites contributions from the broader open-source community.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["LLMs", "Multi-Agent Systems", "Codebase"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6b98d50786e7004c96806f6f2936d96654c5c2f0.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents MASLab, a unified codebase for multi-LLM systems.\nMASLab integrates 20+ methods and 10 benchmarks, with the goal of removing re-implementation efforts, the possibility of unfair comparisons, and high entry bars for new researchers.\nThe authors conducted extensive empirical studies to analyze the performance, cost (in tokens) and scaling properties.\n\nI think the paper is solving an important problem in multi-LLM research, but I also have 2 concerns.\nI'm wiling to raise my score if they can be addressed."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "* The primary strength of this paper is the codebase, it allows future researchers to conduct experiments in a unified and easier way.\n* The empirical studies presented in the paper are extensive and comprehensive."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* The codebase is not available in this submission, making it hard to evaluate its easiness of adoption.

This is a good indication of a versatile benchmark framework proposed in the paper."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Novelty: While it is reasonable to claim that this work conceptually fills the gap between easily extensible multi-agent frameworks and broad benchmark coverage, prior works are not entirely lacking in this direction. For example, CRAB (https://github.com/camel-ai/crab\n, https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01511) supports a much larger number of tasks (120) while maintaining a modular shared codebase. AgentBoard (https://openreview.net/forum?id=4S8agvKjle), while focusing mainly on unified environments and consistent metrics for comparison, also supports some degree of agent customization. In addition, AgentVerse (https://github.com/OpenBMB/AgentVerse) provides extensibility for agent methods, and CRAB allows extensibility for environments, although not simultaneously. Since this paper does both, such overlap between prior works and this study does not fully undermine the innovative aspect, but the paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of these prior efforts and a clearer explanation of what specifically distinguishes it from them.\n\nClaimed versatility: As a framework and benchmark paper, the usability aspect (especially the claimed contribution in ease of extension) cannot be fully assessed without access to the code. Although the manuscript provides sufficient experimental details, they are not fully convincing without demonstrating actual usability through a released implementation. Even without providing an anonymous repository (understandable if that is not feasible during rebuttal), some code excerpts or minimal skeletons for agents and tasks would still be helpful in demonstrating the framework’s design.\n\nExperiments: Given that the framework aims to be versatile, it should support and test a wider range of LLM models in addition to the already broad coverage of methods and tasks. Currently, it seems that the choice of underlying LLMs (a subset of the Llama, GPT, and Qwen families for each task) is task-specific without clear justification. Ideally, the choice of LLM models should be orthogonal to tasks and environments unless there is incompatibility, so an explanation or a more systematic model-swapping study would be expected.\n\nOverall, these issues are not fundamental flaws but rather reflect unclear novelty and incomplete validation of what appears to be a solid engineering contribution. Currently, this work is slightly below threshold due to unclear novelty, but the score could be increased if these issues are addressed and the unclear points clarified."}, "questions": {"value": "(See the unclarities in Weakness)"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "YbLq1jSxZd", "forum": "gSop0mNnEx", "replyto": "gSop0mNnEx", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19560/Reviewer_qex7"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19560/Reviewer_qex7"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19560/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761978641855, "cdate": 1761978641855, "tmdate": 1762931440270, "mdate": 1762931440270, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
