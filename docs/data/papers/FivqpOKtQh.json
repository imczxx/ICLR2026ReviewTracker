In clinical consensus, multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is indispensable: arterial (ART), portal venous (PV), and delayed (DL) phases jointly depict tumor vascularization, perfusion heterogeneity, and fibrotic evolution, forming the very basis of radiologists’ diagnostic reasoning.  **_Surprisingly, despite this well-established clinical value_**, most AI models still rely on ① single-phase inputs or naïve stacking of multiphase scans, ② ignoring temporal hemodynamics and lacking interpretability.\nTo bridge this gap, we present **Clinically-Guided Spatiotemporal Deep Fusion Network (CSF-Net)**, the first framework that explicitly embeds radiological knowledge into multiphase modeling. **CSF-Net** incorporates three synergistic components: the **multi-phase clinical-quantitative synergy branch (MCQS)** for phase-specific encoding, the **temporal-aware local feature refinement module (TLFR)** for perfusion dynamics, and the **query-interaction enhancement fusion module (QIEF)** for cross-phase alignment. By aligning AI modeling design with radiologists’ logic, **CSF-Net** establishes a clinically grounded interpretability paradigm, which inevitably yields superior performance gains. Extensive experiments on two CECT benchmarks, PLC-CECT and MPLL, demonstrate that **CSF-Net** achieves state-of-the-art performance.

A significant number of studies have already explored the extraction and spatiotemporal fusion of features from multiphase CT images — for instance, [Ref1]–[Ref3] for classification and [Ref4]–[Ref5] for segmentation. The authors themselves cite several of these works in Lines 124–130.\n\nCompared with existing multiphase fusion approaches, certain components of the proposed method may indeed be novel. However, without a thorough discussion and systematic comparison with prior multiphase fusion studies, it is difficult to assess the true level of technical contribution. For example, the proposed model propagates information through a direct graph, but given that the number of nodes is small, it is unclear whether this design offers a meaningful advantage over spatiotemporal attention mechanisms used in previous work. The authors also appear to overemphasize the “clinically guided” aspect, as the method does not seem to incorporate substantial clinical reasoning from this reviewer’s perspective.\n\nI would suggest submitting the paper to a more medical imaging–oriented venue, such as MICCAI or ISBI.\n\nReferences\n[Ref1] A Knowledge-Guided Framework for Fine-Grained Classification of Liver Lesions Based on Multi-Phase CT Images, IEEE JBHI, 2023.\n[Ref2] Lesion-Aware Cross-Phase Attention Network for Renal Tumor Subtype Classification on Multi-Phase CT Scans, CIBM, 2024.\n[Ref3] Sdr-former: A Siamese Dual-Resolution Transformer for Liver Lesion Classification Using 3D Multi-Phase Imaging, Neural Networks, 2025.\n[Ref4] A Tri-Attention Fusion Guided Multi-Modal Segmentation Network, Pattern Recognition, 2022.\n[Ref5] M3Net: A Multi-Scale Multi-View Framework for Multi-Phase Pancreas Segmentation Based on Cross-Phase Non-Local Attention, Medical Image Analysis, 2022.\n\nBesides, many symbols in the equations are undefined.
