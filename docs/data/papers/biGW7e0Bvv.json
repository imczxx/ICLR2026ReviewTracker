These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs. However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both improving performance and reducing costs, assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next, we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments. TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval models.", "tldr": "We create a large scale benchmark for real-world agents that use a large number of MCP tools as the main interface for interacting with the world.", "keywords": ["agent", "tools", "tool-use", "mcp", "retrieval", "llm"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ab47c7de5b447e79c56f1899d942bb8c82325f01.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "```\nI used LLM to fix the grammar of the Official Review, but all opinions are my own\n```\nMany current AI agents rely heavily on general-purpose tools such as web browsers to perform tasks—whether retrieving data or operating software. This approach is inefficient and costly, and it fails to capture how most real-world professional work is done. For example, in enterprise environments that use Azure for cloud services or GitLab for code management, there exist specialized APIs or SDKs that are far more suitable for task automation, but current agents struggle to leverage them effectively.\nTo address this, the authors built a “tool library” that converts common enterprise services—like Azure, GitLab, and internal communication tools—into over 18,000 “AI-native tools” (called MCP tools). For instance, instead of manually updating database settings via the Azure UI, an AI agent can now directly call a dedicated “update Azure database version” tool.\nThey also constructed a simulated company environment (“TheMCPCompany”) to benchmark AI agents in realistic work settings. The environment includes both simple tasks (e.g., labeling files) and complex ones (e.g., fixing a faulty cloud service). A baseline agent (“MCPAgent”) is introduced, which must first discover relevant tools for a given task (e.g., finding “check Azure database version” or “restart service”) and then use them to solve the problem.\n\nAlthough the paper doesn’t introduce a novel method, I find the problem setting very meaningful and the work potentially impactful.

Since your tools appear highly domain-specific, training on them might not help the model handle out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios.
