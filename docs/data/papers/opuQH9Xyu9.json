Conformal inference provides distribution-free guarantees, but existing approaches are either overly conservative, discarding many true-claims, or rely on adaptive error rates and simple linear models that fail to capture complex group structures. To address these challenges, we reformulate conformal inference in a multiplicative filtering setting, modeling factuality as a product of claim-level scores. Our method, Multi-LLM Adaptive Conformal Inference MACI, leverages ensembles to produce more accurate factuality scores, which in our experiments led to higher retention, while validity is preserved through group-conditional calibration. Experiments show that MACI consistently achieves user-specified coverage with substantially higher retention and lower time cost than baselines.

The review of the related works on conformal inference seems not sufficient in my view. The authors do not mention too many papers addressing the group-conditional coverage.

Second, I am concerned about the conditional independence assumption in Definition 1. Since the claims are generated by LLM from **the same one** prompt, it does not intuitive to assume the factuality of each claim is independent. Did authors try to model the probability of claims being true jointly given one prompt? I understand it can break the way to obtain the calibration threshold for the conformal inference. But it might be a good sensitivity check, that the modeling the joint probability of the claims being true is similar to modeling them independently.\n\n3. Third, I am confused by the dataset used in Multi-LLM ensemble. In specific, what is the M here. From my understanding, the prompt is repeated M times. But how can you make sure that the claim $c$ is the same in the repeated prompts to get the ensemble scores?\nDo you consider Some of the atomic claims are considered the same?"}, "questions": {"value": "None"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5RXgFVg5lY", "forum": "opuQH9Xyu9", "replyto": "opuQH9Xyu9", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14675/Reviewer_fF7o"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14675/Reviewer_fF7o"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14675/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760841419209, "cdate": 1760841419209, "tmdate": 1762925045240, "mdate": 1762925045240, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tackles reliable factuality filtering for LLM outputs using conformal inference (CI).

How exactly do you produce estimates $\\hat{p}$ / What is $\\hat{p}$ your experiments? It wasn't clear to me if you were using base uncertainty scores like in prior work (verbalized confidence, frequency scores, model probabilities, P(True), etc.) or if the \"black-box classifier\" is also something you train for each LLM.\n2. For the ensemble, do you mean that you are taking $\\hat{p}$ from each LLM: Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, DeepSeek-V3?\n3. Which model's output are you filtering? Or are you running these methods on outputs from all 3 and then taking an average in Table 1?\n\nSuggestions:\n1. I recommend citing a few other works related to group-conditional conformal prediction.\n- [1] Jung, Christopher, et al. \"Batch Multivalid Conformal Prediction.\" International Conference on Learning Representations.\n- [2] Liu, Terrance, and Steven Wu. \"Multi-group Uncertainty Quantification for Long-form Text Generation.\" The 41st Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence.\n- [3] Hébert-Johnson, Ursula, et al. \"Multicalibration: Calibration for the (computationally-identifiable) masses.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2018.\n- [4] Detommaso, Gianluca, et al. \"Multicalibration for Confidence Scoring in LLMs.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2024.\n\n    In contrast to Cherian et al. 2024 / Gibbs et al., 2024, [1] and [2] frame group-conditional conformal prediction more similarly to works on multicalibration (like [3], [4]), and they also typically consider more groups than in your work or that of Cherian et al. 2024. Potentially, you could also compare to the methods evaluated in [2] (group-conditional versions split conformal and conformal quantile regression) to further bolster your experimental results since at the end of the day, the goal of those methods are also to achieve better group coverage and retention rates. However, I think just mentioning these lines of works would be sufficient.\n2. I don't see the value of comparing to sampling-based methods (SelfCheck, FSC) since as you stated, the goal of those methods are not to achieve some target coverage. I think the point you're making could also be made with any conformal method like just using BCI, so the comparison doesn't highlight to me anything about MACI. Hearing your thoughts on this would be helpful. In my opinion, you could remove these experiments without hurting the paper at all, and it would leave more room to explain other details in the main body.\n\n    Also, since these methods are in some sense, proposing better options for $\\hat{p}$, perhaps a more sensible comparison might have been to see what happens if you use these sampling methods as the base uncertainty score $\\hat{p}$ (instead of the \"frequency score\" that prior work often use) for BCI, CCI, multi-valid split conformal, etc. However, maybe that would make sense if BCI/CCI perform better using SelfCheck/FSC compared to frequency scores and that MACI still performs the best.\n3. Perhaps Figure 3b and c should be bar charts instead of line graphs.\n4. I think 5.2 and 5.3 could be moved to the appendix so that some other experimental details from the appendix can be put into the main body."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "mr3DHS2FbL", "forum": "opuQH9Xyu9", "replyto": "opuQH9Xyu9", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14675/Reviewer_eeqE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14675/Reviewer_eeqE"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14675/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761934456570, "cdate": 1761934456570, "tmdate": 1762925044219, "mdate": 1762925044219, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a subgroup-aware selective prediction procedure that learns a filter and threshold per subgroup to control FPR while maximizing retention and attains valid subgroup-conditional coverage.

If C upper bounds either the change in FPR as a function of the parameter near the operating point or the inverse density, then taking it to be arbitrarily large makes the bound true but uninformative. Can C be tied to an observable quantity, e.g., plug-in estimator of f_S at the quantile with high-prob bounds? Or can it be acknowledged that small density at the threshold leads to large constants and loose rates; can this be characterized and shown more clearly? \n\n4.
