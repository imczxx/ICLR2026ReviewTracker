Instruction-related visual token compression demonstrates strong task relevance, which aligns well with MLLMs’ ultimate goal of instruction following. Previous works generally assume that visual tokens achieve better vision–language alignment in the shallow layers of LLMs, which have led to task-related token compression being primarily applied in intermediate LLM layers. In contrast, our study reveals that with proper selection, task-related token compression is feasible at the input stage of LLM with negligible performance loss. This new paradigm significantly reduces task-irrelevant visual tokens and its model-agnostic design enables application without modifying the LLM architecture. Specifically, we suggest that explainability methods for transformer-based architechtures can evaluate the global importance of each visual token with respect to the given instruction, which can effectively guide the task-related token compression for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose to learn a mapping from the attention map of the first LLM layer to the explanation results, thereby avoiding the need for a full inference pass. Interestingly, this mapping can be learned using a simple and lightweight convolutional network, whose training is efficient and independent of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on 11 image and video benchmarks across three leading MLLMs (Qwen2-VL, LLaVA-OneVision, and VILA1.5) demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness and strong generalization of our approach. Additionally, our new compression paradigm achieves faster inference with reductions in both prefilling time and KV-cache memory.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["multimodal large language model; token compression"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5e194f09a5a3162e1bd0fdb49abd8dec43224604.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a visual token compression method for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) based on explainability approaches, enabling task-related token compression at the LLM input stage.
