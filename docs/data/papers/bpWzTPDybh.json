Class-pose decompositions aim to create disentangled representations by factoring inputs into invariant features and a pose $g\\in G$ defined relative to a training-dependent, \\emph{arbitrary} canonical representation. We introduce \\textsc{recon}, a class-pose agnostic \\emph{canonical orientation normalization} that corrects arbitrary canonicals via a simple right-multiplication, yielding \\emph{natural}, data-aligned canonicalizations. This enables (i) unsupervised discovery of instance-specific symmetry distributions over $G$, (ii) detection of out-of-distribution poses and (iii) test-time canonicalization, which grants model-agnostic group invariance to pre-trained models without retraining, improving downstream performance. We demonstrate results on 2D image benchmarks and extend instance-level symmetry discovery to 3D groups.", "tldr": "An architecture-agnostic framework to align arbitrary canonical representations in class–pose methods with the data symmetries, enabling symmetry discovery and downstream practical applications", "keywords": ["symmetry discovery", "canonicalization", "equivariance"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/199108deaaaef0cab5db2332130ceaf15b9f4206.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper seeks to build on IE-AEs by applying canonical orientation normalization to obtain a different equivalence class than with a typical IE-AE.
