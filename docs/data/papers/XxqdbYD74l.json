Two very different temporal configurations (e.g., times [0,1,10] vs [4,5,6]) can have similar mean embeddings but imply dramatically different dynamics. Time information relevant for rate estimation is the vector of deltas $\\{t_{\\text{target}}-t_i\\}$, not the mean. The current encoding conflates sequences of varying lengths and spacing.

It appears to be the first method to handle real-valued time stamps and multiple input volumes together in 3D image forecasting, filling a gap in the literature.\n\nEfficient flow-based method: The use of Flow Matching (ODE-based velocity learning) instead of iterative diffusion leads to a simpler, memory-efficient solution. CRONOS scales to long input sequences with substantially lower GPU memory usage and runtime, without needing expensive time-step sampling.\n\nStrong results on diverse datasets: The proposed model demonstrates improved performance over prior baselines (including deep video models and a strong last-scan heuristic) across three different modalities. It consistently achieves higher image similarity metrics (e.g. SSIM) on cine MRI, CT perfusion, and MRI longitudinal datasets, indicating robustness across varied medical imaging scenarios.\n\nThorough evaluation and reproducibility: The authors conduct experiments on multiple public datasets and compare against several baseline approaches. They also commit to releasing code and standardized evaluation protocols, which enhances the work’s credibility and potential impact as a benchmark for multi-context forecasting."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Limited algorithmic novelty (major): The approach offers minimal new methodology, essentially applying the existing Flow Matching paradigm to the many-to-one 3D forecasting setting without introducing new algorithmic contributions. The core idea (learning a velocity field via flow matching) is borrowed from prior work, with novelty lying primarily in its application to this domain rather than in the technique itself.\n\nMissing baseline comparisons (major): The evaluation lacks comparisons with several relevant continuous-time or generative baseline methods. Notably, recent (core-level related) approaches like STDiff (Ye & Bilodeau, 2023), LoCI-DiffCom (Zhu et al., 2024), and ImageFlowNet (Liu et al., 2025) are not included, leaving it unclear how CRONOS performs relative to the state-of-the-art in continuous video/volume forecasting.\n\nUnjustified design choice: CRONOS uses a single shared velocity field to warp all input contexts toward the target, but the paper provides no clear justification or ablation for this design. It is not explained why one global velocity field (applied to all past scans) is sufficient, as opposed to using separate or time-dependent velocity fields. This raises concerns that the model might be overly restrictive or suboptimal in capturing differing motions from each context scan.\n\nContinuous-time generalization unproven: While the method is designed for continuous time, the experiments do not explicitly validate interpolation or extrapolation to truly arbitrary time points. There is no demonstration of predicting intermediate frames between given scans or forecasting beyond the maximum training interval. Thus, the claimed continuous-time capability remains speculative, with no evidence that the model can generalize to time points outside the training distribution.\n\nDeterministic outputs (no uncertainty modeling): The framework produces a single deterministic prediction for a given input set and time, with no probabilistic modeling or uncertainty quantification. Unlike stochastic generative models (e.g. diffusion-based methods), CRONOS cannot express multiple plausible future outcomes or estimate confidence in its predictions. This lack of uncertainty modeling is a drawback for medical forecasting, where understanding predictive uncertainty is often important.\n\nGenerality claims not well-supported: The authors suggest the approach is modality-agnostic and broadly applicable, but evidence is limited to the medical imaging domain. All experiments are on medical scans; there is no validation on other data (e.g. natural video or other 4D datasets) to support the claim of general applicability. The strong generalization claims feel somewhat overstated without testing beyond the specific modalities presented.\n\nNo interpretability analysis of flows: The learned velocity fields (which are central to the method) are not analyzed or visualized in the paper. There is no examination of whether the predicted flow patterns are physically or biologically plausible. The absence of any qualitative assessment of these flows is a missed opportunity – it remains unclear if CRONOS learns meaningful motion patterns or if the velocity field could provide insights (e.g. highlighting anatomical changes or disease progression)."}, "questions": {"value": "Novelty: What specific technical contributions does CRONOS introduce beyond applying standard Flow Matching to this multi-volume forecasting task?

If not, what was the rationale for omitting these comparisons, and how would the authors expect CRONOS to perform relative to those methods?\n\nShared velocity field: Why was a single shared velocity field used to warp all input volumes toward the target? Did the authors consider using distinct velocity fields per context or a time-varying velocity field, and if so, how might that affect the results?\n\nContinuous-time evaluation: Can CRONOS generate predictions at arbitrary time points outside the training timestamps (for example, intermediate time interpolation or longer-term extrapolation)? If this was not tested, could the authors clarify how they expect the model to behave for times beyond the training range?\n\nUncertainty modeling: Do the authors plan to incorporate any form of uncertainty or stochasticity into CRONOS? For instance, could a probabilistic extension (e.g. a diffusion-based, VAE, or flow model) be used to capture multiple plausible future outcomes and quantify prediction confidence?\n\nGenerality beyond medical domain: Has CRONOS been evaluated on non-medical temporal imaging data (such as natural videos or other 4D sequences) to demonstrate its generality beyond the medical domain? If not, would the authors consider tempering the claims of broad applicability until such evidence is provided, or could they outline how the method might generalize to other domains?\n\nFlow field interpretability: Have the authors analyzed or visualized the learned velocity fields to assess their interpretability or biological plausibility?
