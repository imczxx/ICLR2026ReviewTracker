Prior work mainly denoises contexts; far fewer methods explicitly balance internal memory with retrieved text. We present IDEAL-RAG, a three-stage, instruction-driven framework that (i) elicits latent knowledge, (ii) forms independent standpoints from internal memory and retrieved passages, and (iii) cross-checks them to produce a traceable rationale—without modifying retrievers or requiring additional labels. Across standard open-domain QA settings, IDEAL-RAG matches strong baselines on clean retrieval and, under adversarial counterfactual contexts, improves exact-match by up to +22.8\\% while roughly halving accuracy loss. Mechanistic analyses explain the gains: a Counterfactual Sensitivity Score (CSS) shows smaller confidence swings, and a layer-wise Parametric Knowledge Score (PKS) reveals steadier reliance on internal memory; ablations further identify parametric-knowledge elicitation as the primary driver of robustness. These results indicate that deliberate negotiation between what an LLM knows and what it reads yields more dependable RAG systems.", "tldr": "IDEAL-RAG strengthens RAG by explicitly balancing what an LLM knows with what it retrieves, enabling more reliable reasoning under noisy contexts.", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Retrieval-Augmented Generation", "In-Context Learning", "Hallucination Reduction", "Prompt Engineering"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/de173e8b53ef3df4ddef567631ff6705ade277df.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces IDEAL-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to improve robustness against noisy or adversarially corrupted retrievals.

The approach is evaluated on four QA datasets (PopQA, NQ, TriviaQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA) under clean and counterfactual settings.

Its main contribution lies in demonstrating that careful prompting can improve robustness to noisy retrieved documents. However, the experimental evidence is not fully convincing, since robustness is evaluated only under a single type of synthetic noise. Moreover, the proposed approach is considerably less efficient than prior methods, requiring multiple large-model calls per query, which makes it difficult to apply in latency-sensitive or large-scale retrieval settings.\n\n## Limited Technical Novelty\n\nThe proposed method adds minimal conceptual or algorithmic innovation beyond InstructRAG [1]. It effectively extends InstructRAG with two additional prompting stages — one for parametric knowledge elicitation and one for dual-standpoint linking. There is no new learning objective, architecture, or retrieval component. The claimed “dual-standpoint” mechanism is largely realized through extra prompt templates rather than a principled or technically novel design.\n\n## Narrow Evaluation of Robustness\n\nThe evaluation of robustness is too narrow and synthetic. The paper focuses on a single type of corruption — counterfactual gold answer spans substitutions — while realistic retrieval errors are much more diverse. For a method that claims to make RAG robust to noisy or misleading contexts, it should test on:\n\n- Conflict Contexts, where retrieved evidence contains factual contradictions (e.g. conflicting evidence from [2] benchmark).\n\n- Irrelevant Contexts, where retrieval includes distractor passages that lower accuracy (e.g. accuracy lowering documents from [3]).\n\nWithout these additional robustness dimensions, it is difficult to assess whether the proposed method generalizes beyond the synthetic perturbations used here.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability Concerns\n\nThe method is likely inefficient compared to baselines. IDEAL-RAG performs three separate forward passes per example (internal elicitation, external standpoint, and linking), each with in-context examples. In Table 2, the authors should report the exact number of LLM calls and forward passes required to produce an answer in comparison to baselines.\nFor reference:\n\nRALM requires 1 call.\n\nInstructRAG requires (#ICLexamples + 1) calls.\n\nIDEAL-RAG appears to require approximately 3 × (#ICLexamples + 1) calls, which could triple inference cost and latency.\nSince efficiency is crucial in retrieval-augmented generation (especially for deployment or long-context tasks), this is a serious missing analysis. \n\n## Minor weaknesses\n\n### Missing Ablation on the Number of In-Context Examples\n\nThe method relies heavily on in-context exemplars (B_int, B_ext, B_link), yet there is no ablation on the number of examples used. The effectiveness and efficiency of the approach might depend strongly on this parameter. The authors should vary the number of in-context examples (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8) and report its influence on clean and noisy accuracy.\n\n### Limited Generality of Experiments\n\nThe study is confined to open-domain QA, with no evaluation on summarization, reasoning, or dialogue tasks where RAG robustness is also critical. It remains unclear whether the proposed multi-stage prompting pipeline generalizes beyond factoid QA settings.\n\n\n[1] Wei, Zhepei, Wei-Lin Chen, and Yu Meng. \"Instructrag: Instructing retrieval-augmented generation via self-synthesized rationales.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.13629 (2024).\n\n[2] Bi, Baolong, et al. \"Context-dpo: Aligning language models for context-faithfulness.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2412.15280 (2024).\n\n[3] Li, Dongfang, et al. \"Explaincpe: A free-text explanation benchmark of chinese pharmacist examination.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.12945 (2023)."}, "questions": {"value": "- How many LLM calls are made per query, and what is the resulting latency relative to InstructRAG?\n\n- Does the performance improvement persist under more realistic noisy retrieval scenarios such as conflicting or irrelevant contexts?\n\n- How sensitive is the approach to the number of in-context examples?\n\n- What does \"*\" mean in tables 2, 3, 6?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "VB8btkm3T7", "forum": "Uo71tJRfrk", "replyto": "Uo71tJRfrk", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17492/Reviewer_Zr5K"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17492/Reviewer_Zr5K"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17492/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761939059838, "cdate": 1761939059838, "tmdate": 1762927374212, "mdate": 1762927374212, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The work proposes IDEAL-RAG to balance intrinsic and retrieved knowledge during open-domain question answering.

An LLM's parametric knowledge is well-versed for easy queries asked in datasets such as NQ, TriviaQA, thereby enough to answer multiple questions present within them. This only shows a one-sided comparison. I would encourage the authors to evaluate more realistic datasets, e.g., including FRAMES [1] or QAMPARI [2], also focusing on Wikipedia with realistic queries. Next, I would also discuss the limitations of the framework. I suspect that for queries in niche domains, such as Biomedical (BioASQ [3]), the parametric knowledge of the LLM is limited. How well does the framework work robustly across niche domains?\n\n2. **Many crucial baselines are missing or not included**: The paper compares their technique against Self-RAG and InstructRAG; however, crucial RAG baselines such as ChatQA [4], RAFT [5], and [6] are missing. I would suggest including them and comparing their techniques against a robust set of baselines.\n\n3. **The clean performance of IDEAL-RAG underperforms InstructRAG, and the counter-all setting is not well-motivated**. From Table 2, we observe that InstructRAG outperforms IDEAL-RAG in the original setting, so by utilizing this technique, we penalize the original retrieval performance. I hope the authors can clarify more on this. Next, real-world noise in document corpora can arise from many factors, such as duplicate passages, counterfactual information present in two documents, or outdated information in time-sensitive documents. I read the paper cited by the authors that produces counterfactual test sets (Fang et al., 2024), and the counter-mix setting is appropriately focused on counterfactual information; however, the counter-all setting was not explored in Fang et al. 2024. I would like the authors to clarify the motivation for evaluating the counter-all setting in the paper.\n\n4. **A minor correction on L218**: The retrieval system is not hybrid, combining different models to retrieve passages and fuse them. According to Table 1, a different retrieval model is used for each dataset, but no model is used together in union, if I understood correctly. A minor note should be that: DPR, Contriever, are rather outdated embedding models. More recent models, such as E5 [7], Stella [8], or Qwen-3-Embedding [9], should be adopted as stronger retrieval baselines.\n\n5. **Contributions over InstructRAG are not mentioned explicitly:** The technique introduced within the paper is very similar to InstructRAG; could they clarify the new additions or differences they introduced wrt. InstructRAG and how much they contribute towards the accuracy?\n\n\n### References: \n\n- [1] Fact, Fetch, and Reason: A Unified Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Krishna et al.
