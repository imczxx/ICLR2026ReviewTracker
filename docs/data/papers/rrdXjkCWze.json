In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.", "tldr": "No-regret convergence to Nash Equilibrium of price competition with non-linear unknown demands.", "keywords": ["Dynamic pricing", "Nash Equilibrium", "Nonlinear Demand Learning", "Regret Analysis", "Sequential Competition", "Shape Constraints"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ac52e0b93de261d8b54fffb1337ba172f845654a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9f348cf540bea1dce4f3827fd25daf57f8188f88.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies a repeated price competition game with N sellers over T periods. In each period, sellers post prices simultaneously and publicly observe the joint price vector, but each seller only observes its own random demand. Seller i’s mean demand is modeled as a monotone single-index function $,\\lambda_i(p)=\\psi_i(\\langle \\theta_i, p\\rangle),$ with $\\theta_i=(-\\beta_i,\\gamma_i)$, $\\beta_i>0$, and $\\psi_i$ unknown, increasing, and $s_i$-concave. The domain of the index is $U=[-p_{\\max},p_{\\max}]$, and noises are sub-Gaussian. Each seller’s goal is to maximize revenue and minimize a regret metric defined against a dynamic benchmark best-response $\\Gamma_i(p_{-i})=\\arg\\max_{p_i\\in P_i} p_i \\psi_i(-\\beta_i p_i+\\langle \\gamma_i, p_{-i}\\rangle)$ while treating rival prices as fixed. The policy uses a common exploration of length $\\tau\\propto T^\\xi$ to estimate $(\\theta_i,\\psi_i)$ in two stages via centered least squares (for $\\theta_i$ under elliptical designs) and shape-constrained nonparametric least squares (for $\\psi_i$ with monotonicity and $s$-concavity), then an exploitation phase applying iterative best responses with the learned models. A key structural identity links virtual valuation curvature $\\phi_i'(u)\\ge c_i$ to $s$-concavity with $s_i=c_i-1$, enabling a tuning-free estimator and equilibrium analysis through a contraction of the best-response map.\n\nIn this paper, the authors prove (1) The existence of a unique Nash Equilibrium, characterized by $p_i^\\star=\\Pi_{P_i}, g_i(\\langle \\gamma_i,p_{-i}^\\star\\rangle)/\\beta_i$ where $g_i(u)=u-\\phi_i^{-1}(u)$, and the joint best-response operator $\\Gamma$ is a contraction when $\\sup_i |g_i'|_\\infty |\\gamma_i|_1/\\beta_i<1$.
