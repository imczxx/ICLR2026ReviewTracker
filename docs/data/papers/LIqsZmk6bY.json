The input is a (hyper)graph where the edges arrive online in a stream, and the goal of the algorithm is to maintain a spectral sparsifier of the graph with few edges. For graph sparsification, they obtain an algorithm that gives an $(1+\\varepsilon)$ sparsifier with high probability in $n$ storing only $n/\\varepsilon^2\\cdot poly(\\log\\log(n))$ edges with $poly(n)$ update time (Theorem 1.1). This improves by several logarithmic factors over what one can obtain using algorithms for  offline spectral sparsification combined with the merge-and-reduce framework and is in fact optimal within $\\log\\log n$ factors. Additionally, they provide an algorithm for streaming min-cut which stores $n/\\varepsilon\\cdot poly(\\log(n),1/\\varepsilon)$ edges and returns a $(1+\\varepsilon)$ approximation to the min-cut improving by a $\\log n$ factor on previous work. I don't know how impressive this improvement is, since it's not quite clear to me on page 2, how big a polynomial dependence on $\\log n$ past work (Ding et al., 2024) incurred. \n\nNext, the paper considers algorithms for hypergraph sparsification. The number of edges needed to store in past work had factors of either $\\log m$, where $m$ is the number of edges, or $r$, where $r$ is the rank of the hypergraph. Both of these are unpleasant, since $m$ could be exponential in $n$ and $r$ could be as large as $n$. In contrast, the present paper provides a streaming algorithm that only stores $n/\\varepsilon^2 poly(\\log n,\\log r\\log\\log m)$, removing these unpleasant dependencies. \nThe paper provides a related algorithm in the online setting where edges have to be either included or not irrevocably upon arrival.\n\nFinally, the paper provides related results in the setting where the edge arrivals are adversarial and can be based on past decisions of the algorithm, and results in the well-motivated sliding window model, where the algorithm only cares about maintaining a sparsifier of the graph defined by the edge arrivals in a past window of time in the past, and all updates that occurred before the window, should be disregarded.\n\nThe techniques seem to be quite sophisticated modifications of past work that aim to sample edges according to effective resistances in the final graph (which turns out to be the right thing to do when constructing spectral sparsifiers).
