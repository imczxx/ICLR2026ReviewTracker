However, due to high computational demands and the sensitivity of training data, 3DGS models face significant intellectual property theft risks, yet current protection mechanisms are insufficient. In this paper, we introduce Mark3DGS, a novel watermarking framework designed to protect 3DGS models. The framework includes perception-aware pruning for efficient Gaussian reduction, uncertainty-frequency-guided HVQ for resilient watermark embedding, tile-based rasterization with early termination and caching for optimized splatting, and adaptive extraction strategies for reliable watermark recovery. Additionally, we present MarkGS-Sim, a platform to evaluate watermark robustness across various 3DGS variants and conditions. Experimental results show that Mark3DGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in watermark capacity, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency, achieving 206 FPS rendering, minimal storage ($\\textless$ 200MB), compatibility with multiple 3DGS variants, and strong robustness to various watermark attacks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Gaussian Splatting", "intellectual property protection", "robust watermarking", "3DGS simulator."], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cdf08a984b587e6a9bf3cda502892d39ec8aa145.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/8b346cc78bac9321fc2f584f4d883173da990949.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Mark3DGS, a watermarking framework for protecting the intellectual property of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models.

Mark3DGS is a combination of the existing methods of 3DGSW, GaussianMarker and NeRFSignature. Although it shows better performance, the contribution of this work is incremental.\n\n2.

The capacity is basically similar to the existing methods [1,2,3], but there is no breakthrough in the capacity.\n\n4.
