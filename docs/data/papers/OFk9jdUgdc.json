Our analysis shows this limitation stems from two factors: datasets face an inherent trade-off between realism and coverage of diverse blur patterns, and algorithmic designs remain restrictive, as pixel-wise losses drive models toward local detail recovery while overlooking structural and semantic consistency, whereas diffusion-based approaches, though perceptually strong, still fail to generalize when trained on narrow datasets with simplistic strategies. Through systematic investigation, we identify blur pattern diversity as the decisive factor for robust generalization and propose Blur Pattern Pretraining (BBP), which acquires blur priors from simulation datasets and transfers them through joint fine-tuning on real data. We further introduce Motion and Semantic Guidance (MoSeG) to strengthen blur priors under severe degradation, and integrate it into GLOWDeblur, a Generalizable reaLwOrld lightWeight Deblur model that combines convolution-based pre-reconstruction & domain alignment module with a lightweight diffusion backbone. Extensive experiments on six widely-used benchmarks and two real-world datasets validate our approach, confirming the importance of blur priors for robust generalization and demonstrating that the lightweight design of GLOWDeblur ensures practicality in real-world applications.", "tldr": "We address dataset bias in image deblurring with Blur Pattern Pretraining (BBP) and Motion and Semantic Guidance (MoSeG), enabling a lightweight diffusion model to generalize robustly across benchmarks and real-world data.", "keywords": ["linear attention; image deblur; diffusion model; blur pattern"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/041633f1c1a5ab374a2a999c575d5596d4a813fa.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a generalizable approach to real-world image deblurring. Observing that existing models suffer significant performance degradation on unseen data, the authors identify the core issue as the lack of diversity in blur patterns within training datasets, as well as an overreliance on pixel-wise losses that ignore structural and semantic consistency. To address this, they introduce a Blur Pattern Pretraining (BBP) strategy, which first learns blur priors from simulated datasets and then performs joint fine-tuning on real-captured data.

Precise Problem Definition with Rigorous Evidence: The paper's motivation is clear and highly persuasive. It moves beyond the conventional discussion of \"realism\" by skillfully combining Table 1 (performance degradation) and Figure 3 (imbalanced pattern distributions). This robustly proves that the root cause of generalization failure is the biased and imbalanced distribution of \"blur patterns\" in the training data. \n\n2.  Shifting Research Focus with a Systematic Strategy: Based on this key insight, the paper successfully shifts the research focus from pursuing \"realism\" to pursuing \"blur pattern diversity.\" It proposes a systematic data strategy to address this issue. It first learns blur priors from simulation datasets with broad pattern coverage and then jointly fine-tunes on real-world datasets to align the distribution.\n\n3. Superior Visual Results: This strategy directly targets the core of the problem, and its effectiveness is intuitively validated by the superior visual results."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Weak Methodological Innovation and Unaddressed Concerns: The paper's novelty is limited, primarily relying on stacking existing modules like MoG and SeG. These additions also introduce significant concerns: the accuracy of MoG's motion estimation is unverified and risks misguiding the restoration. Furthermore, the usage of SeG is ambiguous; if a VLM is required at test time, it introduces an unfair external annotation, and its robustness on low-quality, poorly-described images is unexplored.\n\n2. Contradictory Metrics and Fidelity Concerns: The experimental results show a clear contradiction. The method excels in No-Reference (NR-IQA) metrics like MANIQA, yet it significantly lags behind in traditional Full-Reference (FR-IQA) metrics such as PSNR and SSIM. This strongly suggests that the model sacrifices fidelity for perceptual quality, likely suffering from the common \"hallucination\" problem in diffusion models (generating plausible but inaccurate details). The critical omission of the LPIPS metric fails to resolve these fidelity concerns.\n\n3. Misleading \"Lightweight\" Claim: The paper's claim of being \"lightweight\" is misleading. It selectively highlights optimizations in the diffusion core while ignoring the total system complexity (including the UNet, MoG, and potentially a large VLM for SeG). The lack of FLOPs or actual inference time figures, combined with the mention of high-end training hardware (8x A800 80G GPUs), makes the claims of efficiency highly questionable."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  Is the SeG module required to run during the inference stage? If so, does this imply the model relies on a large external VLM to achieve its advantage, leading to an unfair comparison and contradicting the \"lightweight\" claim? \n\n2.  Is the motion estimation within the MoG module trained end-to-end, or does it use a fixed pre-trained model? If the former, are there specific loss functions or visualizations to prove it generates correct motion guidance? If the latter, how is its accuracy and applicability to your dataset ensured? \n\n3.  How do the authors explain the significant gap where the model lags in PSNR/SSIM but excels in NR-IQA metrics? Does this imply the model suffers from the common \"hallucination\" issue (deviating from ground truth)? Why is the critical LPIPS metric missing to validate the perceptual fidelity against the ground truth? \n\n4.  To validate the \"lightweight\" claim, what are the average inference time, the number of the parameters, and the FLOPs for the proposed method? \n\n5.  Could you please detail the collection and filtering criteria for the self-created RWBlur400 dataset? Does this dataset have corresponding ground truth? If not, is relying solely on NR-IQA metrics sufficient to claim robust real-world performance?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "b9wo7kyxbN", "forum": "OFk9jdUgdc", "replyto": "OFk9jdUgdc", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2344/Reviewer_npVR"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2344/Reviewer_npVR"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2344/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761450076032, "cdate": 1761450076032, "tmdate": 1762916200989, "mdate": 1762916200989, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}, "comment": {"value": "We respectfully request the withdrawal of this submission.
