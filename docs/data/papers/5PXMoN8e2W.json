However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space, promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates training—achieving over 2x speedup with fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Gaussian Splatting", "Efficient 3D Reconstruction"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f8b3b0d66d15bbdccd4be165ab7c7ce33632831e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work addresses slow convergence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) by improving the densification process and Gaussian distribution.

Potential Oversimplification of the Role of Cloning. The paper frames cloning as contributing almost exclusively to local refinement and early-stage redundancy. This might be an oversimplification.

The core assumption is that a global spread phase should always precede a local refinement phase. While this is intuitive for large, complex scenes, it may not be optimal for all types of content.

Rather, I would argue that the split operation not only spreads the Gaussians but also contributes to refining local details, albeit at the cost of generating significantly more Gaussians compared to the clone operation. Figure 2 in the main text also supports this observation, showing that the reconstruction from the split-only model is visually more pleasing than that from the clone-only model.\n- The three main technical contributions of this paper are (1) global-to-local densification, (2) coarse-to-fine densification, and (3) adaptive opacity pruning. However, the coarse-to-fine densification strategy closely resembles that of DashGaussian, though the energy metric used here is slightly different. In addition, the ablation study (Table 4) shows that the coarse-to-fine densification contributes more effectively to both training speed and rendering quality than the global-to-local densification. Moreover, the idea of adaptive pruning has already been explored in EDC (Efficient Density Control). While the details differ, it would strengthen the paper to include a direct comparison with the adaptive pruning used in EDC. These factors somewhat weaken the novelty of the proposed approach.\n- Compared to MSv2 (MiniSplatting version 2), it is difficult to claim that the proposed method achieves a clear state of the art. Although both reconstruction quality and training time are improved over MSv2, the gains are marginal (particularly in training time: 3.55 vs. 3.47), and the proposed method produces substantially more Gaussians. Furthermore, additional comparisons against MSv2 on both the T&T and DeepBlending datasets are needed, and such results should be included in the main experiments.\n- The three key components of the proposed method—(1) global-to-local densification, (2) coarse-to-fine densification, and (3) adaptive opacity pruning—appear to have overlapping roles. Specifically, both global-to-local densification and adaptive opacity pruning aim to accelerate training by reducing the number of Gaussians. To better demonstrate the effectiveness of the global-to-local densification, it would be helpful to include a C2F + Pruning variant in the ablation study for comparison."}, "questions": {"value": "- Why is T2 chosen as the boundary between the global and local densification?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "I4ZdfLrqgk", "forum": "5PXMoN8e2W", "replyto": "5PXMoN8e2W", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6858/Reviewer_7puj"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6858/Reviewer_7puj"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6858/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761920982459, "cdate": 1761920982459, "tmdate": 1762919113133, "mdate": 1762919113133, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
