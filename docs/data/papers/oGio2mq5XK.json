Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass. This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data. For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework towards existing work.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Single-shot Reconstruction", "3D Head Prior", "3D Gaussian Splatting"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6fb63fb8f01f82b79aea5e208c9383b666493886.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head reconstruction from a single unposed image.

The authors leverge two types of queries. The first set of queries is anchored to the vertices of the FLAME mesh, which can be efficiently be upsampled by barycentric interpolation using the FLAME topology. The second set of queries stems from triplanes, which also aggreagte features from the DINOv2 Tokens. The resulting features from set 1 then extract information from the triplane features using samples along 4 rays to a set of 4 fixed cameras. Finally, an MLP learns to map the final features into Gaussian attributes. \n\nNext to standard rendering losses during training, the authors propose to distill infromation from SphereHead, by enforcing that the resulting triplane features can be decoded into RGB using the frozen SphereHead decoder.\n\nImportantly, the method is trained on purely synthetic data generated from SphereHead and PanoHead.

Reconstructing 3D heads (although they are non-animatable) is a relavant task, and having a feed-forward method for it is certainly more useful than running costly comparatively PTI. The quantitative numbers support the proposed method.\n- Thanks to the 3DGS representation, rendering is fast, and 3D consistent. The latter is e.g. evaluated in the supplemental, where the proposed method outperforms all baselines.\n- The paper is well-written and easy to follow."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- While the authors cite LivePortrait3D and TriplaneNet, they do not consider such works as baselines, although they follow the exact same motivation as the propsed method. Therefore, I believe that such method consititue a crucial baselines, and should be compared against using the same training data. This would validate the proposed approach to learn a single-image2-3D-predictor. Due to the existence of such previous work, the novelity is limited on a high leve. However, some technical novelty remains, which should be highlight better experimentally, see below.\n- The results on the real world examples in Fig. 4 show that PanoLAM heavily suffers from identitiy drift. I assume that this is caused by the fact that real images are out-of-distribution for the generated data. In my opinion the paper should include reconstruction evaluation (not just view consistency) on a multi-view dataset such as NeRSemble. The task would be simple: use 1 of the 16 cameras as input, evaluate PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS on the other 15 views. \n- The proposed evaluation heavily favors the proposed method, since 100 subjects from the  exact same training data distribution are used for evaluation. Either baselines, like LAM,  should be trained/fine-tuned on the same data, or other datasets (see previous point) should be used for evaluation. As such, beating the baselines is not very surprising.\n-"}, "questions": {"value": "- What exactly is the benefit of the proposed upsampling approach? Linear interpolation seems quite simple and cannot come up with new information. What about pixel-shuffle upsampling, as done e.g. in GRM, LVSM? Is it mainly about training stability?\n- Overall, the pipeline seems to be rather convoluted. Two sets of query tokens are used to attent to DINOv2 features. And then for resulting positions of the frist set of queries, the information from the second set of queries is extracted. What is the intuiton behind this? At least accroding to my intuition, only using point queries should work fairly well, as e.g. demonstrated in LAM. (yes LAM cannot generate complete heads, but this is caused by its training data).\n- What is the effect of using a frozen SphereHead decoder and additional loss? This forces the resulting triplane features to behave similar to what SphereHead does, or is there more to it? Any effect on the training stability, convergence speed etc.?\n- How is the ground truth for $\\mathcal{L}_{st}$ in eq. (8) obtained?\n- Why is SphereHead obtainined such low numbers in Table 2? After all it was used to construct part of the dataset, and should give reasonable PTI results, e.g. as shown in Figure 4. However the numbers look very bad? Does this e.g. have to do with inproper background segmentation?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "OKBkx1yn72", "forum": "oGio2mq5XK", "replyto": "oGio2mq5XK", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7845/Reviewer_9eHv"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7845/Reviewer_9eHv"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7845/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761960236614, "cdate": 1761960236614, "tmdate": 1762919888319, "mdate": 1762919888319, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, a method for turning a single, unposed RGB image of a human head into a Gaussian head portrait is proposed. The method is based on a neural pipeline with several pathways: the image features are obtained by DINOv2 and merged via cross-attention with point queries coming from the FLAME parametric model, as well as used to condition a network branch that originates from spherical triplanes and produces triplane features. The results of merging image features and point queries are densified due to the limited precision of FLAME and used to produce the Gaussians. Input spherical triplanes are used to distill prior knowledge from a 3D GAN. Due to the pipeline being direct and feedforward, the method is fast and easily scalable, which presents a considerable advantage in practice. The results are demonstrated on the benchmarks of image quality, consistency with the ground truth, inference time measurements."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- Very good results.\n- The method is simple yet efficient. The network is feedforward and fast. The proposed approach is much more efficient than many available approaches that depend on diffusion models and obtain on par or worse results; also, it is more efficient than GAN inversion approaches. Coarse+fine refinement makes sense given a small number of points (5K) in FLAME. The generated portrait is Gaussian, which is much more reliable and easier to use than 2D generations from EG3D-like networks; the training is also simpler, as it does not require adversarial losses.\n- Very thorough and trustworthy experimental section with many comparisons and ablations."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Even though there are visuals from various views shown in Appendix, there are no supplementary video to inspect the quality of the Gaussian reconstruction from different sides better.\n- The method is still relatively limited to the EG3D-style coordinate system, which means it would require a specific focal length and cropping during inference. This should limit the use of the method in applications. However, I could imagine this method retrained on different datasets such as Ava-256 or Nersemble (the only caveat for this would be spherical triplanes coming from SphereHead, since for them to be calculated correctly, the input image must still be in the EG3D-style coordinate system). There are some out-of-domain results shown in the Appendix, but, e.g., no visuals are shown on Nersemble; it's unclear how it would perform e.g., on more wide-angle (selfie-style) or large focal length images.\n- In Table 1, the proposed Ours-Front and Ours-360 datasets are pitched from the standpoint of avatar datasets. For this to be true, 3D-consistency of the generations from different views (in the geometric & photometric sense) has to be measured, as well as completeness of the generation. Also, the demographics might be much less diverse than in real datasets, as well as the resolution, lighting variation, and many other characteristics. In other words, I believe pitching the synthetically generated dataset in the same table as real datasets can be misleading for the reader.\n- In the method figure, triplanes are spherical triplanes but shown as vanilla triplanes.\n- A natural application of this method would be \"live portraits\" -- generating Gaussians in a temporal setting from e.g. a webcam stream. This would likely be a real-world application of this method. I think it is very important to show that; also, without such a test, it is hard to evaluate the temporal consistency of generations.
