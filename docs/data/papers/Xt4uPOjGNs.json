Although the paradigm is effective for pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks, they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In fact, pre-trained GNN models will produces discriminative node representations across demographic subgroups because the downstream graph data itself contains inherent biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute bias in graph prompting, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information via a self-gating mechanism at the input layer, thereby reducing biased inputs at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust the messages from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of the information flow. In the end, ADPrompt optimizes these two prompting modules using a joint optimization objective for adapting the pre-trained GNN model while enhancing model fairness. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.", "tldr": "An Adaptive Dual Prompting method for Hierarchical Debiasing in Graph Neural Networks.", "keywords": ["Graph Neural Networks", "Fairness", "Prompt Learning"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1f5773c2703274ba59e9f770a14baaf856f3e123.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/34f31f7be33f23f8f4e31878e97c7454e4b4031b.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces ADPrompt, a fairness-aware prompting framework for adapting pre-trained GNNs to downstream node classification while improving group fairness.

Specifically,  (i) in Section 1 (Introduction), the authors fail to claim why we need this proposed method instead of existing fairness graph prompt methods, such as [1]. The challenges mentioned in this section are merely some well-known fairness issues of GNN, making the reasons to design the proposed method unclear; (ii) The contributions mentioned in Section 1 should also be largely rewritten. The first two points are literally the same thing.\n\n2. In Section 4 (Methodology), while some limitations of existing methods are mentioned, these points are not convincing. For example, the author claims that FPrompt [1] may disrupt critical topological information. However, it is unclear how and why it will disrupt critical topological information and lead to a performance drop. I can only find the underlying reason when I read Section 4.2. The authors are suggested to rewrite this section to make it clearer to readers. In addition, if possible, please add some preliminary empirical results to validate the claims. And I think the above clarification should also be mentioned in Section 1.\n\n3. While theoretical analysis is provided, the statement in Section 5.2 is not clear enough to conclude Theorem 1. I understand that this subsection aims to give proofs and propose Theorem 1 to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. However, a detailed proof for Theorem 1 should be included. Otherwise, it is unclear how Theorem 1 comes from and why Eq. (16) can lead to Theorem 1.\n\n4. Computational overhead. AMC learns edge- and layer-specific structure prompts, which may impose significant memory and time costs on dense graphs or deep GNN backbones. The paper omits complexity analysis and runtime/memory profiling relative to baselines. \n\n5. It seems that the framework presumes a binary sensitive attribute is known for all nodes. The AFR and adversary rely on this supervision. Real-world graphs often have missing or multi-valued sensitive labels. More discussion and analysis on this scenario can benefit this paper.\n\n6. Current ablation studies focus on removing AFR or AMC. However, it is also important to investigate the sensitivity of the hyperparameter,s such as $\\lambda$, and the transferability of the proposed method. And the impact of layer numbers of GNNs is also important to investigate the effectiveness of the layer-specific techniques.\n\n7. Too many critical analyses are put into Appendix.

The paper's primary motivation—using graph prompting for fairness—rests on the assumption that pre-trained GNNs are a valuable and widely adopted resource that should be efficiently adapted. However, this premise is not thoroughly debated. In contrast to large language models or vision transformers, GNNs are often task-specific and can be trained from scratch relatively quickly and efficiently. The claimed benefit of prompting—parameter efficiency by freezing the backbone—is less compelling when the backbone itself (a GNN) is not an exceptionally large or general-purpose model. The paper would be stronger if it provided a more convincing justification for why prompting is the right paradigm for this problem, compared to simply building a fairness-aware objective into an end-to-end GNN training process, which is common in graph fairness literature.\n\n2.
