Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, this effect is fundamentally limited by the context window of the base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens \nconsumed during training.\nWe revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality.\nBuilding on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity;  (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, such as IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.", "tldr": "This paper introduces a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning.", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Test-Time Scaling", "Human-in-the-loop"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/31cf23914271b42b0b56ba66ba099dcd5292b55c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This submission introduces 3D test-time scaling, an integration of existing test-time enhancement techniques in three dimensions: context, batch, and turn.

The contribution of this work is more like empirical tests about three existing (context, batch, turn) approaches' performance along with the performance when combing the three methods together. There is no fundamental breakthough in model design or algorithm side. The proposed framework seems to be a simple concatenation of existing approaches together.\n\n2. Human evaluation was the key to the experimental results. However, lots of details about human evaluation design were missing. During evaluation, the authors mentioned that \"every LLM-generated solution is rigorously verified by human experts following the scoring guidance\". How were such 'human experts' recruited and how to prove such expertise? How to ensure that the scoring process is fair across different models and different questions? Are there any repeated-measure design to rate each response by different experts and aggregate the scores together? \n\n  Similarly, for innovative tasks, the authors stated that \"we recruit human volunteers to vote for their preferred behaviors\". What are the voting criteria? How were volunteers recruited and how many volunteers were responsible for each response? Did the human volunteers sign the consent forms and was this human-subject study approved by the local institute? I found one statement in line 1006: \"The volunteer judged the overall quality of the humanoid’s jump behavior instead of just the metric of leaving the ground\". This statement itself looks confusing. And how was such \"overall quality\" measured?\n\n  Another statement in line 1007 was that \"the volunteer successfully guided the humanoid towards a more human-like jump by selecting behaviors that, while initially not optimal, displayed promising movement patterns\". Does this mean that the volunteer serves as both human judge and human evaluator? And is there only one volunteer in the embodied experiment of Gym?\n\n3. It seems that the authors mixed the human judges (Appendix A1) and human evaluators (Appendix A4) together. Here the human judges were used to provide feedback to improve LLMs' problem solving, while human evaluators were used to evaluate different models, including the one model with human judges' feedback. If human judges and human evaluators were the same participants, then the major concern is that such evaluation is not fair and can probably introduce bias into results.\n\n4. The testing sample was limited in Section 4.2, i.e. only three problems were tested and each was tested over five trials.\n\n5. It is not surprising that involving human judges can result in better performance, especially when the recruited human judges are experts in Olympiad, as depicted in line 602-603. Involving human judges into LLMs' problem solving itself is not a fair comparison. Although human judges did not provide any information about the reasons for their choices, providing best and worst solutions as feedback to the LLM was probably enough to guide further self-refinement. This is not surprising as well.\n\n\n6. The goal of this work is ambitious, i.e., extending the capacity of test-time scaling. However, the exploration and testing only used one language model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), which significantly reduced the rigor, significance, and generalization of this work."}, "questions": {"value": "Please check my concerns and questions in Weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["Yes, Responsible research practice (e.g., human subjects, annotator compensation, data release)"]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "No information about human subject recruitment procedure.

This cross-domain scope is valuable, even if the methodological rigor varies.\n\n- **Human-in-the-loop aggregation:**  \n  The paper operationalizes expert selection as an aggregation function. Human selection often outperforms the LLM-judge, aligning with practitioner experience.\n\n- **Transparency in limitations:**  \n  The authors clearly discuss saturation and failure modes. They note that batch scaling can degrade at large $B$, and that turn scaling can propagate errors through judge decisions.\n\n- **Creative embodied RL case study:**  \n  The IsaacGym experiment is innovative. Algorithm 1 is well-described, and the design of three automatic feedback channels (component values, differences between historical bests, and reward traces) reflects a thoughtful blend of numeric and textual feedback."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **Ambiguous compute accounting:**  \n  The \"total thinking budget\" is defined as the theoretical maximum token count, yet 3D methods introduce additional LLM calls (judge, reflection) and expanding prompts across turns. These overheads are not clearly accounted for, making Figure 3 comparisons unreliable and potentially attributing gains to untracked compute. The authors should explicitly include judge tokens and prompt growth on the x-axis and report compute-matched baselines.\n\n- **Small, high-variance testbeds with limited statistical reporting:**  \n  The IMO/CPHO evaluations use only six problems each, and reported standard deviations are large. No confidence intervals or statistical tests are provided in the figures, making claims such as “3D scaling extends test-time scaling” statistically fragile. The paper should include confidence intervals, more problems, or use public benchmarks such as GSM8K-hard, MATH-500, or AIME-like datasets.\n\n- **Inconsistent or weak aggregator definitions and baselines:**  \n  The Batch (Vote) aggregator is reasonable for numeric outputs but not meaningful for derivational physics or math. For math, process correctness is required; for physics, the metric reduces to end-answer correctness (as noted by the authors), undermining comparability between vote-based and judge-based methods. Clarify scoring functions and incorporate process-aware verifiers for reasoning-heavy tasks.\n\n- **Underperformance of automated LLM-judge in coding:**  \n  On IOI 2025, Best-of-*N* (30.79) outperforms 3D (LLM-judge) (18.65), contradicting the claim that the LLM-judge is a reliable general-purpose aggregator. The paper should report judge accuracy against ground truth or human agreement and include prompt variants and verifier-backed judges.\n\n- **Methodological flaws in embodied RL evaluation:**  \n  The claim of “same token budget” between Best-of-*N* and 3D Human is irrelevant for reinforcement learning, where the dominant cost lies in PPO training, rollouts, and rendering. Compute comparisons should be matched in environment steps or wall-clock time.\n\n- **Statistically unsound reporting of final task scores:**  \n  Appendix B defines the final task score (FTS) as the maximum across five runs (“we run 5 experiments and report the highest TS as the final task score”), which biases results toward 3D. Means ± confidence intervals (or medians) should be reported instead, with corrections for multiple comparisons.\n\n- **Limited human-preference study:**  \n  The HumanoidJump human-preference experiment (17/20) involves too few trials and lacks details on randomization, inter-rater reliability, or control conditions. While interesting, the results are not robust.\n\n- **Missing fixed-budget ablations across (C, B, T):**  \n  To substantiate the “3D scaling” claim, experiments should fix total token budget (including judge and history tokens) while varying decomposition across axes (e.g., high-*C*/low-*B*/low-*T* vs. low-*C*/high-*B*/low-*T*) to demonstrate synergy beyond raw sampling. Such ablations are missing."}, "questions": {"value": "**Compute accounting:**  \nHow exactly is “total thinking budget” computed in Figs. 2–3?
