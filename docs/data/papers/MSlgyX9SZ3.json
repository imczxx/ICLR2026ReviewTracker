As the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry accelerates, the importance of data utilization has grown, but the existing centralized approach involves data leakage risk and network load issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a three-layer federated learning architecture consisting of cloud–anchor–edge. In particular, the anchor layer applies a stacking ensemble technique that combines predictions from multiple models to accurately identify complex anomaly patterns that are difficult to detect with a single model and maximize the robustness of model predictions. Compared to the accuracy of 0.5585 achieved by a single 1D-CNN model, the model applying stacking to federated learning significantly improved performance to an accuracy of 0.7438. Furthermore, to address the continuously changing data distributions in manufacturing environments, we propose a data distribution change detection and edge reallocation mechanism to enhance system flexibility and adaptability. The proposed system demonstrates significantly faster inference times than centralized learning models, presenting it a powerful alternative that ensures data privacy.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Manufacturing Management System", "Federated Learning", "Anomaly Classification", "Stacking Ensemble", "Distribution Shifts", "Frozen Encoder"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/55847e3ba110b0c2020669558adf9529a3a7fea2.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c904bb7197ac5989060aa4c5011fd7affc6187bc.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a Decentralized Manufacturing Management System (DMMS) that addresses data privacy, communication efficiency, and anomaly detection challenges in smart manufacturing.

The key innovation is combining multiple anchor models trained via federated learning (FedProx) with a meta-learner (XGBoost) to achieve better anomaly detection accuracy. Additionally, the system includes an adaptive mechanism using Wasserstein distance to detect data distribution shifts and reallocate edges to optimal anchors.

Severely limited evaluation scope undermines generalization claims: The paper evaluates only on a single dataset (AI-Hub partial discharge data) from one specific manufacturing scenario (electrical equipment anomaly detection). No validation is provided for other manufacturing tasks mentioned in the introduction (vibration analysis, temperature monitoring, pressure anomalies, predictive maintenance). This raises serious concerns about whether the proposed architecture and stacking approach generalize beyond this specific use case. The authors acknowledge this limitation in the conclusion but do not sufficiently justify why readers should believe the approach will work elsewhere. Additionally, the dataset has only 9 edges and 5 classes—scalability to larger, more realistic deployments remains unproven.\n\n2. Insufficient justification and analysis of key design choices: Critical design decisions lack proper justification or ablation studies: (1) Why use 5 anchors specifically? No ablation on varying this number. (2) Why XGBoost as meta-learner? No comparison with alternatives like neural networks or other gradient boosting methods. (3) The Wasserstein distance threshold of 0.1 appears arbitrary without sensitivity analysis. (4) All anchor models use the same 1D-CNN architecture, which may limit diversity benefits in stacking—why not heterogeneous base learners? (5) The frozen encoder mechanism is poorly explained: when/how is it trained, why keep it frozen vs. adaptive, and what's the performance impact? These gaps make it difficult to understand what truly drives performance and how to configure the system for new deployments.\n\n3. Missing critical cost and overhead analyses: While inference time is reported (2.3882ms), the paper omits crucial practical considerations: (1) Training time comparison between centralized and federated approaches—how much longer does FL+Stacking take to converge? (2) Communication overhead during aggregation and edge reallocation—the SYN-ACK-ACK protocol adds rounds of communication but costs are not quantified. (3) Memory requirements for storing multiple anchor models and frozen encoders on resource-constrained edge devices. (4) Frequency and computational cost of Wasserstein distance calculations for distribution shift detection. Without these analyses, practitioners cannot assess the true deployment costs. The claim of \"real-time\" performance needs more rigorous validation including end-to-end latency measurements."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
