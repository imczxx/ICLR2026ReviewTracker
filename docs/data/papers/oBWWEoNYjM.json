Prior studies mainly target large language models, leaving multimodal scenarios underexplored. We introduce the Stealthy Fine-Grained Editing Attack (SFG-Attack) and the Stealthiness Attack Dataset, designed for multimodal models. Unlike traditional datasets, ours provides professional and fine-grained data: unique entities with multiple knowledge facts per image, and attacks focused on specific keywords for precise control. We further propose a new metric, Stealthiness, measuring the impact on other knowledge within the same image. In addition, we redefine Reliability, Locality and Generality, introduce a new dimension of Robustness to assess model stability under perturbations. Together, these advances provide both data and methodology for strengthening the safety evaluation and defense of multimodal models.
