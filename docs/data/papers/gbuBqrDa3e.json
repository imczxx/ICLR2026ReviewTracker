Although compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine spectral details. We propose the \\textit{Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network} (FMU), which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction quality.

The overall architecture—including the GAP unfolding scheme, Trident Transformer, and two-stage training pipeline—closely follows LADE-DUN (Wu et al., 2024). The main novelty lies in replacing latent diffusion with flow matching, which is a component-level modification rather than a substantial architectural innovation. Given that LADE-DUN itself is very recent, the incremental novelty here is limited.\n2. The mean-velocity constraint, while useful, is essentially a simple regularizer with limited theoretical depth. The manuscript also lacks a deeper analysis of how the generative prior quality correlates with reconstruction performance, and why flow matching provides intrinsic advantages over diffusion in this context.\n3. The main quantitative results (Table 1) are reported only on the optical-filter-based HSI system. Since CASSI is the dominant benchmark in the community, the lack of quantitative CASSI comparisons weakens the general SOTA claim. The qualitative CASSI results (Fig. 6) are insufficient to fill this gap.\n4. Reproducibility is affected by missing key details: sampling steps for the flow prior, epoch numbers for the two training stages, and comparison of inference speed with baseline methods.\n5. The manuscript claims SOTA performance on an optical-filter-based HSI system, whose forward model should produce measurements with no spatial shift and the same spatial size as the RGB image. However, the measurement in Fig. 5 clearly exhibits the spatial shift artifacts that are unique to CASSI. This contradiction raises serious concerns about the correctness of the experimental setup and the reliability of all related conclusions."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
