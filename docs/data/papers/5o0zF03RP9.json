Existing approaches typically rely on fixed trade-offs between extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, limiting adaptability across tasks. We introduce IncentRL, a cognitively inspired framework that unifies external rewards with internal preferences through adaptive incentive shaping. The central novelty is treating the incentive weight $\\beta$ as a Bayesian random variable, updated online to balance exploration and exploitation without manual tuning. In addition, IncentRL augments task rewards with a KL-based penalty that aligns predicted outcome distributions with preferred outcomes. Theoretically, this connects to dopamine-based reward prediction error and the Free Energy Principle. Empirically, on MiniGrid and MountainCar, IncentRL improves sample efficiency and final performance over standard RL and fixed-regularization baselines. These results demonstrate that Bayesian adaptation of preference gaps removes the need for manual trade-off tuning, a core limitation of intrinsic motivation methods.

The presented framework is general, since the KL between the desired and expeted outcomes is a general idea that allows many different variants in the way both the dynamics and preference models are learned or used. \nThe discussion around different ways of encoding the preference model is sound, and the links to the cognitive motivation and free-energy principle are sound."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I find this paper to be very poorly contextualized. There are very few citations to other work in intrinsically-motivated RL [1,2,3,4,5,6] (just to list a few), or adaptations of the free energy principle and active inference theory to the RL framework [7,8]. There is a large body of work in these fields published over the last decade which the paper ommits. The related work section is very brief, and skips progress in these directions. Not only empirical progress in the form of new intrinsically-motivated RL algorithms being recently proposed, but also discussion and other practices which make intrinsic rewards work in RL [6].\n\nI wouldn't relate to the idea of adapting $\\beta$ dynamically during training as the \"central novelty\" of this work in the Abstract, since the runs with adaptive $\\beta$ are not even in shown in the paper, but are said to achieve a similar performance to the fixed $\\beta$ ones. I find the ideas of using the KL divergence between predicted and desired outcomes in the environment to be more sound.\n\nThe authors introduce the distribution $p(o|s,a)$ right after having defined fully-observed MDPs. To be correct, you should either specify that you are predicting the transition dynamics over states $p(s'|s,a)$ (which I believe is the case because the toy MDP used, MountainCar and MiniGrid are all fully-observed MDPs) or otherwise you should introduce partially-observed MDPs (POMDPs) making an explicit separation of the state space $\\mathcal{S}$ and observation space $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nI find Section 3.3 is not needed in the main paper since the discussion on the role of $\\beta$ is straightforward and can be made more concise. I have a similar opinion of Sections 4.2 (the discussion and the equation is repeated in 4.1 and 4.2) and 4.3 (discussing latent representations for encoding the preference model, but not used anywhere in the paper). Instead, the authors should allocate more space in covering related work in the area and extending their evaluation.\n\nI wouldn't call the toy MDP presented in 5.2 a \"sparse-reward\" problem, since with a single (state,action) pair, the agent can experience a reward in the environment with 0.3 probability, offering enough supervision for training any vanilla RL agent to solve the task.\n\nCrucially, I don't think the provided empirical evidence supports the claims of the paper. I think the paper is missing a much broader evaluation of the method in more complex and recent benchmarks used for exploration (e.g., a subset of tasks from MiniGrid, ProcGen, Atari, Crafter ,etc.) and importantly, comparisons with existing methods designed for improved intrinsic exploration. The paper does not cover, cite, or explicitly state the differences of their method in the related work area, neither it evaluates and compares existing methods that are similar in design, have been used in the same environments, and hence are relevant baseline comparisions.\n\n[1] Pathak, Deepak, Dhiraj Gandhi, and Abhinav Gupta. \"Self-supervised exploration via disagreement.\" International conference on machine learning.

To start with, the work only loosely discusses prior work on intrinsic motivation and reward shaping in Section 2.1. There is a rich space of literature that ranges from future predictions (ICM and RND being cited), state visitation counts [4], density functions of states [3], and combinations of several schemes [1, 2] just to mention few -- all propose ways to determine \"novelty\" or interestingness of states for exploration. I would advice to look at the literature in this space in more detail.\n2. In addition to a rich space of literature on defining intrinsic rewards for sample efficient learning, there also exists prior literature on balancing intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, similar to the proposed Bayesian approach of adapting $\\beta$. Some examples are [5, 6]\n3. The work continually makes connections to the free energy principle and dopamine frameworks, but these are merely described as loose connections. It would be helpful if the authors would provide citations, definitions, and clearly outline any connections that they believe add to their work.\n\n[1] Raileanu, Roberta, and Tim Rocktäschel. \"Ride: Rewarding impact-driven exploration for procedurally-generated environments.\" _arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.12292_ (2020).\n\n[2] Zhang, Tianjun, Huazhe Xu, Xiaolong Wang, Yi Wu, Kurt Keutzer, Joseph E.

The introduction and Section 3 that defined the proposed IncentRL approach, makes use of \"outcomes\" in the form of predicted and preferred outcome distributions. However, it is never defined and not quite clear to me what these outcomes are. Are outcomes future states that might be predicted, or some specific quantity of states?\n\t1. Related to what outcomes are, it is not clear to me where the outcome distributions are coming from either and what assumptions are being made. It appears that the work assumes that preferred outcome distribution are specified to determine a preference over outcomes. But how do you specify the predicted outcome distribution $p(o | s, a)$? Section 3.1 mentions that this quality \"[...] may be obtained from a forward model or from environment dynamics\" but it is unclear to me which of these is being done throughout experiments. Do you train a forward model from experience tuples or do you assume access to the environment transition function?\n5. In Section 5.4 of the experimental section, a Bayesian adaptation of $\\beta$ is being evaluated, however, none such adaptation scheme of $\\beta$ is described when the method is introduced in Section 3?\n6. The theoretical contributions in proposition 1 and 2 both lack formal proofs. I would expect these to be at least provided as part of the Appendix. Also, both of these propositions do not appear to be particularly insightful since they merely talk about the extreme cases of extremely small and large $\\beta$ values to draw fairly obvious conclusions.\n### Experiments\n7. In Section 5.1, the \"Algorithm\" paragraph mentions that the agent estimates its belief about possible next outcomes, but it is never defined how these predictions are obtained (connected to weakness 4.1).\n8. The predicted and preferred outcome distributions for most experiments are incompletely defined or entirely undefined. Given these are central part of the main contribution of this work, this appears to be a lack of critical details.\n\t1. For Experiment 1 (Section 5.2) only defines predicted and preferred outcome distributions for the 2-state MDP for state $s_0$. The rest of the distributions appear undefined. \n\t2. For Experiment 2 (Section 5.3) in MountainCar, the distribution is described as \"preferred outcome assigning all probability to the goal ($x \\geq 0.5$), and $p(o | s, a)$ is the predicted outcome distribution\" but those are still vague to me. The described preferred outcome distribution appears to now be defined as a property of states $x \\geq 0.5$ rather than full states as before (connected to problem of lack of definition of what outcomes are, see weakness 4), and the predicted outcome distribution is fully undefined.\n\t3. For Experiment 3 (Section 5.4), these quantities appear entirely undefined.\n9. According to the description of training details in Section 5.4 on Experiment 3, the results are averaged over 3 independent seeds but Figure 2 visualizes no indication of dispersion/ deviation. I would expect a visualisation of the mean and shading to indicate dispersion (e.g. standard deviation, standard error, min/ max). Similarly, the caption of Table 2 states \"$\\pm$ std over 3 seeds\" but then no such deviations are shown in the table.\n10. It appears that in experiment 2 and 3, IncentRL provides no clear benefits. According to Table 2, only for one value of $\\beta$ did IncentRL slightly outperform the base algorithm ($\\beta = 0$) and it is not clear that these gains are significant without indication of deviation. For other values of $\\beta$, performance dropped significantly with IncentRL compared to the baseline. In Figure 2, results also don't seem to show a very significant change from the base algorithm to IncentRL.\n11. Figure 3 visualizes the (undefined; see weakness 5) Bayesian adaptation of $\\beta$ and claims that \"the posterior mean quickly concentrates near the effective region ($\\beta \\sim 0.1$)\" but the Figure more so suggests that the posterior mean moves away from $0.1$ over several rounds and might converge closer to $0.02$ which I would not consider near the effective region of $0.1$.\n\n## Significance\n12. From a high-level perspective, this work states that, when given preferred outcomes, the algorithm can leverage this information under (somewhat unclear) assumptions to shape rewards and then learn more efficiently. This does not appear like a very novel or significant contribution but represent a typical instance of reward shaping. This puts into question whether this work makes significant contributions that warrant publication."}, "questions": {"value": "1. How would you define \"outcomes\" that the predicted and preferred outcome distributions are defined over? (Weakness 4 for more details)\n2. How do you obtain the predicted outcome distributions?

How are the predicted and preferred outcome distributions defined for each of the experiments? (Weakness 8 for more details)\n5.
