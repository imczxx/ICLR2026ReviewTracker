[ALT 2019] and Fallat et al. [JMLR 2023] introduced non-clashing teaching and proved that it is the most efficient batch machine teaching model satisfying the collusion-avoidance benchmark established in the seminal work of Goldman and Mathias [COLT 1993]. Recently, (positive) non-clashing teaching was thoroughly studied for balls in graphs, yielding numerous algorithmic and combinatorial results. In particular, Chalopin et al. [COLT 2024] and Ganian et al. [ICLR 2025] gave an almost complete picture of the complexity landscape of the positive variant, showing that it is tractable only for restricted graph classes due to the non-trivial nature of the problem and concept class.\n\nIn this work, we consider (positive) non-clashing teaching for closed neighborhoods in graphs. This concept class is not only extensively studied in various related contexts, but it also exhibits broad generality, as any finite binary concept class can be equivalently represented by a set of closed neighborhoods in a graph. In comparison to the works on balls in graphs, we provide improved algorithmic results, notably including FPT algorithms for more general classes of parameters, and we complement these results by deriving stronger lower bounds. Lastly, we obtain combinatorial upper bounds for wider classes of graphs.", "tldr": "We establish new results for computing the non-clashing teaching dimension in graphs, including fixed-parameter algorithms, lower bounds under the Exponential Time Hypothesis, and combinatorial upper bounds.", "keywords": ["Machine teaching", "non-clashing teaching", "VC-dimension", "graphs", "parameterized complexity", "treedepth", "vertex cover number"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/46dc23bfaff8c5862c1e2511d7d7b64218e08495.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper considers computational complexity aspects of a generalization of the Non-Clashing Teaching Dimension (NCTD) of concept classes. The basic definition of the NCTD, introduced and analyzed in previous works, is as follows. There is a finite binary concept class $C$ and a (computationally powerful) teacher $T$. The teacher maps each $C$ to a set of labeled examples $T(C)$ representing $C$. The constraint is that for each $C \\neq C'$, we should have an example in $T(C) \\cup T(C')$ that is consistent with only one of the concepts. There is also a version NCTD+ that only allows positive labels.\n\nIt turns out that the concept of NCTD can be equivalently represented using balls in graphs. The current work focuses on a more specific case, where the balls are only of radius 1 (\"closed neighborhood\").

This approach makes the paper engaging and easy to follow. I believe this style should be extended to other proofs as well, with additional illustrative examples where appropriate.
