In this work, We take a data-driven approach to address this question by analyzing \\textbf{interpretable, monosemantic features} extracted from deep multimodal models. Specifically, we introduce the Modality Dominance Score (MDS) to attribute each multimodal feature to a specific modality. We then map  the features into a more interpretable space, enabling us to categorize them into three distinct classes: vision features (single-modal), language features (single-modal), and visual-language features (cross-modal). Interestingly, this data-driven categorization closely aligns with human intuitive understandings of different modalities. We further show that this modality decomposition can benefit multiple downstream tasks, including reducing bias in gender detection, generating cross-modal adversarial examples, and enabling modal-specific feature control in text-to-image generation. These results indicate that large-scale multimodal models, when equipped with task-agnostic interpretability tools, can offer valuable insights into the relationships between different data modalities.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["multimodal", "interpretability", "monosemanticity"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b4c82fce42ba5ebcdce53786681f076555c585a1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies how VLMs (actually only CLIP) encode modality-specific versus cross-modal information.

(2022) modality gap measure.

More concerns about this below.\n* **missing statistical significance** or confidence intervals for key comparisons.\n* **Quite anecdotal results**. I have trouble following much of the paper, maybe because of the poor presentation quality. What is missing from the results section is a clear and structured analysis of what exactly is being fused in the representation space and what remains separated. For instance, does the degree of modality fusion differ across linguistic categories, such as nouns (objects), verbs (actions), or prepositions (spatial relations), etc.? A more systematic and rigorous analysis along these lines would substantially strengthen the interpretability and explanatory power of the work. Right now, the results are very anecdotal.\n\n### Related work:\nThe related work section could benefit from a rewriting. It currently looks like it was done last minute (e.g. see typos below), but my main concern is that the term \"modality gap\" is used *inconsistently*. In the introduction it is \"a modality gap in VLM, revealing that image and text embeddings often reside in two disjoint regions of the shared embedding space.\". In the related work Section 5 it is \"The study of modality gaps, or the differences and limitations in how different modalities represent information, has been a topic of interest in cognitive science\". This discrepancy is confusing and makes it unclear which definition the paper actually builds on. The authors should clarify and maintain a consistent interpretation throughout.\n\nThe paper discusses multimodal fusion and representation gaps, but the issue of fusion is inherently linked to that of multimodal impact: meaningful fusion presupposes that information from each modality is actually incorporated into the model’s representations. The related work section would be stronger if it acknowledged that some modality-specific information may never be taken into account at all (and is therefore absent from the representation space). Relevant prior work such as MM-SHAP (Parcalabescu & Frank, 2022) and its extensions (Wang & Wang, 2025; Goldshmidt & Horovicz, 2024; Goldshmidt, 2025) explicitly estimate each modality’s relative contribution to model outputs, offering a complementary perspective on modality integration and representational gaps.\n\n\n### Typos and Grammar:\n\n* L 011: \"In this work, We\" should be \"In this work, we\"\n* L 044 missing reference to table\n* L 070 \"enhance modality fusion. , a persistent modality gap\" please fix this\n* L 122: \"classficaition\" typo\n* L256 and L 258: Isn't it against the rules to hack the template's vspace so much?

Because there can be features that can be activated by both individual modalities and cross-level interactions, it is unclear why formulation in section 2.1 is justified.\n* The need for multimodal NCL needs improvement as well. For example, one way to integrate multimodal to SAE is to simply use late fusion on the unimodal features and reconstruct the same.\n* The performance difference is not really significant without confidence intervals to show the degradation. Further, this gap is highly specific to the task being evaluated but the downstream task is not incorporated in the proposed method.\n* The inspection of features in a high dimensional space remains a challenging task, limiting the overall scalability of the proposed method.\n* The clarity of parameterization of $g$ can be improved. Is $g$ shared? If yes, how is the disentanglement in individual modalities preserved? This might be a reason for the entanglement observed in sub section 3.2.2.\n* The score is further averaged in eq 5 further adding to the confusion on the requirement of dissection.\n* The paper further lacks an investigation of different methods and datasets (see references below), especially methods that focus on reducing the modality gap and datasets that contain these gaps. It'd be important to show if the method can capture the reduction in modality gap claimed by existing methods. \n\nI do not consider the following points for my review but the paper writing can be improved:\n* Incomplete reference to Table on Page 1\n* Usage of words that are slightly vague and not self-evident. For instance within the abstract, words like data driven approach, more interpretable space  and so on. The title can be more specific as well. \n* The vspaces in the paper break the reading flow. For instance, Table 1, Section 3, Section 3.2, headings of section 4 and 5 and so on. \n* There are grammatical errors like focusing -> Focusing in 3.2.2, such colorful shifts in section 4.1. \n\nReferences.   \n[1] Goyal et al.

This paper is not written well. Some sentences are not clear and there are many typos. For example, in abstract line 11, \"We take a data-driven approach to address this question\", what question do you want to address? Such unclear description happens several times in main paper, which makes me feel hard to follow.\n2. Section 2.3 is not make sense. To evaluate modality-specific information, only selecting 2 samples is obvious not promising to me. You can always \"select\" some cases that provide some meanings in your setting, but without statistics and quantitative analysis, it is not very convincing. For greater promising, I recommend complementing this qualitative analysis with statistical measures, for example, computing intra-group embedding variance, feature–modality mutual information, or cross-modal activation correlation, to verify that ImgD, TextD, and CrossD features differ significantly in their semantic consistency and modality dependence.\n3. The monosemanticity evaluation relies on selecting the top-20 most-activated samples per feature, but the choice of 𝑚=20 is fixed and unexamined. Since the interpretability scores (EmbSim and WinRate) may be sensitive to this threshold, it would strengthen the validity of the analysis to include an ablation study varying m (e.g., 10, 30, 50). This would clarify whether the observed monosemanticity improvements of SAE and NCL are robust to the sample selection parameter.\n4. The paper does not include quantitative comparisons with existing interpretability or modality-disentanglement methods. All evaluations (e.g., EmbSim, WinRate, and MDS-based analyses) are performed within the authors’ own framework, mainly comparing CLIP, DeCLIP, and their proposed post-hoc variants (SAE/NCL). While this effectively isolates the effect of their techniques, it leaves unclear how the proposed metrics relate to prior interpretability benchmarks or human evaluations. Including quantitative cross-method comparisons would considerably strengthen the empirical validity of the claims. It would be great if the authors can explain why the don't (need) compare with previous work, otherwise, providing some quantitative comparison is more convincing for this work.\n\nOverall, I am open to be challenged by other reviewers or AC or authors. I am open to change my score if authors can solve all my concerns."}, "questions": {"value": "1. What is the table in line 044?\n2. In Section 2.2, when features from different modality groups are removed, the performance drop caused by deleting CrossD features is the smallest. However, since CrossD features represent the shared common information between image and text, one might expect that removing them would cause a larger performance degradation — for example, in image classification, removing shared cross-modal features should disrupt the semantic grounding between image and text more than removing purely textual ones. Why, then, does the paper show that deleting CrossD features leads to less performance drop than deleting TextD or ImgD features?\n3. In Section 3.1, the authors include DeCLIP—a separately trained model with a different training objective—as part of their comparison for feature disentanglement and monosemanticity. Could the authors clarify the rationale behind using DeCLIP here? Since DeCLIP alters the pretraining procedure rather than applying a post-hoc disentangling method to CLIP features (as done with SAE and NCL), this comparison may conflate training-level improvements with representation-level interpretability. How do the authors ensure the fairness and validity of this baseline within the context of Section 3’s analysis?\n4. How many samples are you selected for experiments CASE STUDY 1? It is not very intuitive that \"feminine concepts are primarily preserved in ImgD, whereas male concepts are more affected by the removal of TextD\", although according to the table it is. Could author provide a more detailed analysis on this conclusion? It is not intuitive for me because female/male are parallel concepts and they are homogeneous, so they should at least follow the same interpretable pattern.
