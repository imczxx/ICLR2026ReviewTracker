Related work coverage. It is not yet comprehensive for a planning paper. The section emphasizes decomposition and regression planning but misses four pillars that serious planners consider essential: uncertainty and belief tracking, plan repair and rollback, tool-grounded interaction, and memory or context management. It also needs a brief evaluation critique.\n\n2. Native LLM limitations unaddressed. Context loss on long horizons is a known problem. Self-validation is inherently limited in light of Gödel’s incompleteness results. The paper does not discuss these issues.\n\n3. Cost of backward search. Backward search can explode when many goal configurations are admissible. What constraints are used (landmarks, goal ordering, HTN templates, causal graphs) to prevent exponential cost? The empirical study should examine efficiency and effectiveness trade-offs.\n\n4. Persistent memory. LeCun has noted that LLMs lack persistent memory and therefore struggle with long-horizon planning. This fundamental issue should be addressed.\n\n5. Evaluation realism. The empirical study uses rudimentary problems and does not stress-test the proposed schemes. The authors are encouraged to consider planning work from the database and systems community since the 1980s, including the recent SagaLLM work (VLDB 2025)."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Does search complexity and pruning follow rigorous theories?\n\nBoth forward and backward reasoning can exhibit exponential branching. How do you constrain backward alternatives in practice? Specify the constraints and heuristics you use, for example landmarks, goal ordering, HTN templates, causal graphs, bidirectional search, or admissible heuristics, and report their effect on complexity and token cost.\n\n3.

You did mention in \"limitations\" that commonsense could be an issue.  \nHow does DRIP handle commonsense and locale dependent logistics that break pure context reasoning, for example landing time versus airport exit time, baggage claim, customs, or rental queues?
