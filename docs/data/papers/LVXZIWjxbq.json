This problem is most severe in unbalanced response groups, paradoxically degrading the signal precisely when it should be most informative. To address this challenge, we propose Stable Group-Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO), a principled enhancement that derives optimal, noise-aware advantage weights to stabilize training. Our comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate S-GRPO's effectiveness and robustness. On various models, S-GRPO significantly outperforms DR. GRPO, achieving performance gains of +2.5\\% on Qwen-Math-7B-Base, +2.2\\% on Llama-3.2-3B-Base, and +2.4\\% on Qwen-Math-1.5B-Instruct. Most critically, while standard GRPO fails to learn under 20\\% synthetic reward noise, S-GRPO maintains stable learning progress. These results highlight S-GRPO's potential for more robust and effective training of large-scale reasoning models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reasoning Model", "Large Language Model", "Group-Relative Policy Optimization", "Noise Model", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ec949933d6102419ae3c3f349733c66119c2930b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6380ec0fc3baa947ff8038c37af222b22ed432c8.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focuses on mitigating the thinking-answer mismatch issue of RL for LLM reasoning.

First, there are no strong evidence (e.g., objective statistics) to validate that the so-called thinking-answer mismatch would result in critical vulnerability when one try to scale the performance with outcome rewards. As far as I can tell, in mathematical and coding tasks, the rule-based reward signals are very clear and reliable. Besides, there have been a few observations demonstrate that RL with outcome rewards can automatically compress the incorrect CoTs with coincidentally correct answers [1]. Lastly, even if the rewards are unreliable, traditional value-based RL method like PPO can capture the flaws in reasoning traces. And thus the novelty and contribution of the proposed method is relatively limited in my view.\n- There is no clear guidence on how to estimate the true reward noise ratio p. Estimation on the real noise ratio necessitate verification of the correctness of reasoning traces, which is non-trivial and in my view, rather challenging.\n- The experiments setup is relatively outdated. The authors only tune 2 Qwen2.5 Math series model and 1 Llama3.2-3B model on 8.5K samples. It is doubtful that if the scale of RL training in this manuscript is enough for validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n- Serveral sota baselines are missing. For example, DAPO and GSPO.\n- The authors claim that the reported accuracy is averaged among the top-3 checkpoints. How exactly do they choose the checkpoints? I wonder if there exists data leakage in model selection.\n- The visualization in this manuscript is hard for me to follow up with. Most figures are small, and the conveyed information is ambiguous and limited.\n\n[1] Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards Implicitly Incentivizes Correct Reasoning in Base LLMs"}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "UnwbX7d59h", "forum": "LVXZIWjxbq", "replyto": "LVXZIWjxbq", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15005/Reviewer_Zh5R"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15005/Reviewer_Zh5R"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15005/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760958700621, "cdate": 1760958700621, "tmdate": 1762925334634, "mdate": 1762925334634, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Stable Group-Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO), a principled method that uses optimal, noise-aware advantage weights to mitigate the \"Think-Answer Mismatch\" vulnerability in GRPO, thereby stabilizing training and significantly improving reasoning model performance."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.
