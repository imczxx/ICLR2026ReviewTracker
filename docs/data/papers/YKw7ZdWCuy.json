Unlike traditional binary edge maps, this task aims to predict a categorical edge map, where each edge pixel is assigned a granularity level reflecting the likelihood of being recognized as an edge by a human annotator. Our contributions are threefold: 1) we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset for granular edge prediction, where each edge is labeled with a quantized granularity level, and introduce a graph-based edge representation to enforce consistency in edge granularity across the dataset, 2) we develop a novel edge consensus loss to enforce granularity consistency within individual edges, and 3) we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework, including granularity-aware edge evaluation and two quantitative metrics to assess the consistency of granular edge prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generalizes well in zero-shot evaluation across four standard edge detection datasets, closely aligns with human perception of edge granularity, and ensures high consistency in edge-wise granularity estimation.", "tldr": "We propose a new task, Granular Edge Prediction, supported by a synthetic dataset and a novel model with consensus-based training, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization and consistent, human-aligned edge predictions", "keywords": ["Edge detection; Granular edge prediction"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/11663e4e360b4b773fbae6937c09e6bdf30c9e31.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper constructs a synthetic dataset for granular  edge detection and proposes an efficient model that outputs edge maps of multiple granularity levels in a single forward pass, treating the task as a multi-class prediction problem.

The dataset is built by first extracting object boundaries using SAM and then performing refinement via graph-based representation, resulting in a large-scale granularity-aware edge detection dataset.\n2. The proposed formulation effectively avoids the need for multiple forward passes required by previous methods to infer different granularity levels. By converting the problem into a multi-level classification task, the method can produce all granularity results with a single inference.\n3. A new loss function and evaluation metric are introduced, which can potentially promote further research in granularity-aware edge detection."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Choice of granularity levels. The dataset is initially annotated with 36 granularity levels, but experiments later quantize these into 4 or 6 levels due to distribution imbalance (line 325–327). (1) How were the *original 36 levels* chosen? What advantage does the approach of annotating 36 levels *first and then merging* have over *directly annotating fewer granularity levels*? (2) When the granularity level is extremely small (level = 1), how does this differ from conventional deterministic edge detection? (3) In Fig. 12, one would expect that the smallest granularity level preserves only instance-related boundaries without background clutter. however, the results still appear influenced by background textures. Could the authors comment on this?\n2. Model architecture clarification. The main paper does not clearly describe the model architecture. It only becomes clear in Appendix Table 3 that it follows a diffusion-model U-Net backbone. Were pretrained diffusion model weights used?\n3. Inconsistent cross-dataset generalization. In Table 1, MuGE trained on SGED performs worse on NYUD compared to zero-shot inference from models trained on BSDS. However, performance improves on BIPED and Multicue. (1) Does this suggest that SGED yields weaker cross-domain generalization than BSDS? (2) Similarly, in Table 7, the performance gap between naive SAM and GEPM is small on BSDS and NYUD but large on BIPED and Multicue. Why does SGED training benefit some datasets but not others? (3) How does the current SOTA DiffusionEdge model perform when trained on SGED and tested on BSDS?\n4. Model size comparison. In Table 7, what architecture does *naive SAM* refer to? Is it SAM-ViT-B? The base model used in the paper contains substantially more parameters than both SAM-ViT-B and the EfficientNet models used in MuGE. A direct parameter comparison table would clarify fairness in evaluation.\n5. Class imbalance handling (Eq. 2). Since larger granularity levels have fewer annotated samples, does Eq. 2 account for this imbalance? Would class-balanced weighting or focal-type reweighting help further alleviate the imbalance noted in line 325–327?"}, "questions": {"value": "The strength of this paper lies in proposing a dataset, introducing a granularity consistency loss, and transforming prediction tasks of different granularities into multi-class classification tasks.\n\nThe main issue, however, lies in the experiments. The results on BSDS are nearly comparable to those of SAM's zero-shot performance. Additionally, the constructed dataset was expected to be entirely at the instance level when the granularity is set to 0, but this requirement has not been fully met."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "gY0s0inJtm", "forum": "YKw7ZdWCuy", "replyto": "YKw7ZdWCuy", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6772/Reviewer_8iwt"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6772/Reviewer_8iwt"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6772/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761378152066, "cdate": 1761378152066, "tmdate": 1762919048467, "mdate": 1762919048467, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new edge detection paradigm, termed Granular Edge Prediction (GEP), which redefines edge detection from binary classification into a granularity-aware prediction problem.
