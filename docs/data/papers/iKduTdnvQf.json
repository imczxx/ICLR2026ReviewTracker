Differentiating through combinatorial optimization problems represents a central challenge, and recent approaches tackle this difficulty by introducing perturbation-based approximations that enable end-to-end training. In this work, we focus on estimating the objective function coefficients of a combinatorial optimization problem. We analyze how the effectiveness of perturbation-based techniques depends on the intensity of the perturbations, by establishing a theoretical link to the notion of solution stability in combinatorial optimization. Our study demonstrates that fluctuations in perturbation intensity and solution stability can lead to ineffective training. We propose to address this issue by introducing a regularization of the estimated cost vectors which improves the robustness and reliability of the learning process. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that this regularization consistently improves performances, confirming its practical benefit and general applicability.", "tldr": "This article introduces cost regularization to address an issue in decision-focused learning found by establishing a link between perturbation-based approaches and the notion of solution stability related to combinatorial optimization literature.", "keywords": ["ML and Optimization; Combinatorial algorithms; Decision-focused learning; Implicit differentiation by perturbation; Regularization"], "primary_area": "neurosymbolic & hybrid AI systems (physics-informed, logic & formal reasoning, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2868537bba50f804d88786af66e3af286b548db7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper analyzes gradient estimators for decision-focused learning/differentiation through discrete optimization and provides theoretical arguments that the \"scale\" of extra ingredients in these estimators (e.g., random perturbations) should be set appropriately relative to the scale of coefficients in the objective function."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "Stability is a real issue in any attempt to include differentiable optimization in machine learning pipelines.

The authors consider a classical DFL setting, which involves a ML estimator used to output the cost function coefficients for an optimization problem with a fixed feasible space.\n\nThey focus on methods that work by perturbing the estimated parameters and the impact of such perturbation on the decision problem solution. Scale has a key role here: too small perturbations do not cause the solution to change and hence provide no useful information for gradient descent; too large perturbations lead to radical changes of the optimal solution and risk causing instability.\nThe paper also explains how a poorly chosen scale can make a number of \"experience based\" DFL method to become equivalent to (usually less performant) \"imitation based\" methods.\n\nThe authors then propose to address the issue by applying a mapping to the predicted parameters (perturbed on unaltered) that normalizes the scale of the vector.

Here are some of them:\n\n* The lack of differentiability is not the real issue in the considered setting (the solution function is differentiable almost everywhere).
