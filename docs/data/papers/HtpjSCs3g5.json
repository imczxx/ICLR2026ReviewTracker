Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning; however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. \nBuilding on this foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism. \nMoreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning.", "tldr": "We propose PixelCraft, a novel multi-agent system that unifies high-fidelity tool agents with a flexible reasoning workflow for structured images such as charts.", "keywords": ["chart understanding", "multi-agent system", "visual reasoning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f61bb0f569951e3b81ca71e9e9ff09b2787ecc81.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents PixelCraft, a novel multi-agent system designed to address significant failings in MLLM-based visual reasoning for structured images like charts and geometric diagrams. The authors identify two primary weaknesses in existing methods: low-fidelity image processing, which leads to perceptual errors, and rigid, linear reasoning patterns (like visual CoT) that cannot correct mistakes. PixelCraft's core contribution is a dual-pronged solution. First, it achieves high-fidelity processing by synergizing a compact MLLM, fine-tuned on a new synthetic corpus for precise pixel-level grounding, with classical CV algorithms that act as tool agents. Second, it enables\nflexible, non-linear reasoning through a dynamic workflow involving a planner, reasoner, and critics. A key innovation is the \"image memory,\" which allows the planner to adaptively revisit, recall, and branch from earlier visual steps, facilitating backtracking and exploration of alternative reasoning paths.

Well-motivated and significant problem. The paper addresses the challenging problem of visual reasoning on structured images, a well-known weak point for current MLLMs. This task is difficult because it requires precise perception of details (like axis values or geometric points) and multi-step logical deduction, where small perceptual errors can cascade into completely wrong answers. The paper clearly identifies these failings as a critical and practical area for improvement.\n\n2. Comprehensive experimental setup. The authors validate their system on a strong suite of recent and difficult benchmarks, including CharXiv, ChartQAPro, and the auxiliary-line subset of Geometry3K. Testing against these diverse datasets demonstrates the system's robustness and generalizability. Furthermore, the comparison is not limited to simple baselines; it includes advanced agentic methods like Debate and Reconcile, which makes the consistent and significant performance gains of PixelCraft more convincing.\n\n3. High-quality presentation and readability. The paper is very easy to read and well-organized, making the complex multi-agent architecture and reasoning process accessible to the reader. The figures are a standout component for presentation; Figure 1 provides an excellent, intuitive comparison of why standard CoT and Visual CoT fail while PixelCraft succeeds, and Figure 2 clearly illustrates the entire agentic workflow, from selection to discussion and correction."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Significant efficiency and latency issues. The multi-agent workflow, which involves a dispatcher, planner, reasoner, and multiple critics, inherently requires numerous sequential LLM inference calls for a single query. This leads to a substantial increase in latency and computational cost compared to simpler CoT methods, as confirmed by the paper's own analysis (e.g., 16.45s vs. 3.75s on CharXiv), which may limit its practical applicability.\n\n2. Limited methodological novelty in the agentic framework. While the application to structured images is effective, the core agentic workflow (combining a planner, tool-use, and a reasoner) is a widely adapted paradigm in recent LLM research. The novelty of the agent framework itself is somewhat incremental, with the main contributions lying in the specialized toolset and its application rather than a fundamentally new agentic reasoning process.\n\n3. Constrained generalizability and flexibility due to a fixed toolset. The system's success is heavily reliant on its manually-curated set of visual tools, which were specifically designed for charts and geometric diagrams. This presents a generalization bottleneck; the system would likely fail in scenarios with novel image types or tasks requiring tools not in its predefined set. This lack of flexibility to adapt or generate new tools on the fly is a key limitation, which the authors also acknowledge."}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Pjol7tflOl", "forum": "HtpjSCs3g5", "replyto": "HtpjSCs3g5", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5711/Reviewer_hJXi"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5711/Reviewer_hJXi"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5711/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761607766926, "cdate": 1761607766926, "tmdate": 1762918210660, "mdate": 1762918210660, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes PixelCraft, a multi-agent system to perform complex reasoning over charts and geometric figures.

Unclear Cost and Scalability\n\nThe multi-agent architecture (planner, critics, tool agents, etc.) implies high computational and communication overhead. The paper doesn’t report inference latency, average agent calls, or cost per sample — critical factors for assessing practical deployability. Since they use a strong vision-language backbone (Qwen2.5-VL), much of the pipeline’s gain might come at the cost of efficiency. Report computation and cost metrics, average number of reasoning turns, total API calls, and latency per image — to give a fair sense of scalability.\n\n2. Overreliance on Synthetic or Narrow Benchmarks\n\nMost experiments use structured-image datasets (e.g., ChartQA, Geometry3K), which are quite specialized. This limits generalization to open-domain or real-world structured reasoning tasks like document or diagram understanding. It’s not shown whether PixelCraft scales to noisy or natural images where structure is less explicit. I suggest adding a small evaluation on broader multimodal datasets (e.g., DocVQA, InfographicsVQA) or including a discussion on how the system might handle unstructured visuals."}, "questions": {"value": "I am confused about the Figure. 4.
