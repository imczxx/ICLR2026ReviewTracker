Current computational methods for CDR design utilize reconstruction losses and do not jointly optimize binding energy, a crucial metric for antibody efficacy. Rather, binding energy optimization is done through computationally expensive Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipelines rely heavily on unreliable binding energy estimators. In this paper, we propose AbFlowNet, a novel generative framework that integrates GFlowNet with Diffusion models. By framing each diffusion step as a state in the GFlowNet framework, AbFlowNet jointly optimizes standard diffusion losses and binding energy by directly incorporating energy signals into the training process, thereby unifying diffusion and reward optimization in a single procedure. Experimental results show that AbFlowNet outperforms the base diffusion model by 3.06% in amino acid recovery, 20.40% in geometric reconstruction (RMSD), and 3.60% in binding energy improvement ratio. AbFlowNet also decreases Top-1 total energy and binding energy errors by 24.8% and 38.1% without pseudo-labeling the test dataset or using computationally expensive online RL regimes.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Protein", "Antibody", "CDR Design", "GFlowNet", "Diffusion", "Sparse Reward"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/723de8b4ffa644b338a7e7de5e3e0fc4e564750f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces AbFlowNet, a framework that unifies diffusion models and GFlowNets for antibody–antigen design.The core idea is to reinterpret each denoising step in a conditional diffusion process as a trajectory transition within a GFlowNet, where the terminal state corresponds to a fully denoised CDR sequence + backbone, and its reward is proportional to binding energy (computed offline via Rosetta InterfaceAnalyzer).

In my experience, the Rosetta energy evaluation is quite cheap and i do not think online RL is an issue. Especially considering the protein design area, the real cost is never the simulation efforts but the wet-lab evaluation. So i think online RL makes more sense\n\n2. The Rosetta evaluation is not that reliable. Does the author have any wet-lab exps?\n\n3. Eq.(18) introduces an extra hyperparameter w. It can be quite tricky to tune this w for different datasets.\n\n4. In fact, there has been work using RL to fine-tune diffusion models by treating denoising trajectories as paths. https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13301 but i did not see the authors compare it or mention it. RL is closely relateed to GFlowNet so this denoising traj as path contribution is not that strong considering this paper. \n\n5. The authors seem to retrain diffab but there is already diffab checkpoint. Why re-train it? \n\n6. Also, the authors seem to emphasize the same gradient update step for baselines. I do not think that is the real metric we should care about or i think we should not care that metric at all. First, the real metric should be sth like FLOPS, as the gradient step for different model/algo can be different. Second, as i mention before, we should not care about much about computational cost in the protein domain, and it does not matter as much as we did in general ML area (the comp is not large in bio domain or that important)."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "snaa6jwbkD", "forum": "J4x33LgjiL", "replyto": "J4x33LgjiL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15393/Reviewer_Rcth"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15393/Reviewer_Rcth"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15393/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761403328220, "cdate": 1761403328220, "tmdate": 1762925674042, "mdate": 1762925674042, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposed AbFlow, a combination of diffusion models and GFlowNet for antibody design.
