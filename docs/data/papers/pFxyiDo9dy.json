However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on partitioning the scene into chunks - a strategy that introduces artifacts at chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously.\nWe introduce A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU - without partitioning. Our method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to minimize the loading overhead. Together, these innovations enable seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex scenes - from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.", "tldr": "Out-of-core memory can be used to expand the scale of 3D Gaussian Splatting training without requiring scene partition.", "keywords": ["Gaussian Splatting", "Neural Rendering", "Level of Detail", "city-scale", "Sequential Point Trees"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b01e6c620df3a08fb7c573e5f1c7aa97cc029093.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/485cccb9f410a30134dc29673644e1e1dfcf896f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "His paper presents A LoD of Gaussians, a method that overcomes GPU memory limitations in city-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting by introducing a hierarchical LoD system combined with external memory management."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.
