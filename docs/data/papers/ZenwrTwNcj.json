Conceptual Soundness\n- The authors ground their approach in predictive coding and latent dynamics modeling, both well-established ideas in neuroscience and machine learning.\n\n- The theoretical motivation, that perception arises from predicting sensory changes is sound.\n\n- The authors identify a clear gap: self-supervised models typically learn either recognition (DINO, iBOT) or motion (CroCo, FlowE), not both.\n\n### 2. Architectural Novelty\n- The architecture is a careful combination of: 1. Inverse dynamics (midway path) to infer motion, 2. Forward prediction (dense feature-level) to learn temporal coherence, and 3. Hierarchical refinement (inspired by optical flow networks e.g., PWC-Net, RAFT).\n\n- The design is justified by analogies to biological systems and prior SSL hierarchies (e.g., Ladder Networks, DINO).\n\n- The inclusion of gating units in transformer residuals is thoughtful as it prevents trivial identity mappings, a known issue in predictive models.\n\n### 3. Experimental Soundness\n- Comprehensive evaluations across recognition (semantic segmentation) and motion (optical flow).\n\n- Extensive comparison against relevant baselines: DINO, DoRA, PooDLe, CroCo v2, DynaMo, etc.\n\n- Consistent use of natural video datasets (BDD100K and Walking Tours) supports the claim of \"learning from natural data only.\"\n\n- Sufficient ablation studies test each architectural component's impact on both semantic and motion metrics.\n\n### 4. Interpretation Soundness\n- The \"forwarded feature perturbation\" method is a novel and interpretable way to visualize what the dynamics model learns.\n\n- It qualitatively demonstrates non-trivial motion correspondence — a rare strength in SSL papers."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "### 1. Conceptual Limitations\n- While conceptually coherent, \"latent dynamics\" is borrowed from control/planning literature and adapted here somewhat heuristically — the paper lacks a strong theoretical derivation connecting latent dynamics to semantic learning in videos.\n\n- The link between motion prediction and semantic invariance is intuitive but not formally analyzed.\n\n### 2. Architectural Limitations\n- The midway and backward paths add significant complexity; it’s unclear if all components are essential (though the ablation studies help).\n\n- The architecture might overfit to short temporal correlations (1-second gaps between frames) and may not generalize to longer-horizon motion.\n\n### 3. Experimental Limitations\n- Only two pretraining sources (BDD and WT-Venice). That’s small compared to large-scale pretraining regimes (e.g., Kinetics-700, Ego4D). Therefore, it is hard to tell if results scale to diverse or indoor/outdoor mixed environments.\n\n- The authors do not measure performance over multiple time steps (e.g., predicting motion 10 frames ahead).\n\n- Some of the baselines (e.g., PooDLe) use higher resolution or external flow networks, making cross-comparison imperfect.\n\n- Few metrics report standard deviation or multiple seeds.\n\n### 4. Interpretation Limitations:\n- The forward feature perturbation analysis is qualitative. There’s no quantitative measure of how well it aligns with ground-truth motion.\n\n- The theoretical justification for why this analysis reflects \"high-level correspondence\" is intuitive but not formalized."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the discussion in weakness section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "J5um38HQkK", "forum": "ZenwrTwNcj", "replyto": "ZenwrTwNcj", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14976/Reviewer_m9iU"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14976/Reviewer_m9iU"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14976/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760770483473, "cdate": 1760770483473, "tmdate": 1762925308272, "mdate": 1762925308272, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Midway Network, a self-supervised learning framework that jointly learns object recognition and motion understanding from natural videos through latent dynamics modeling.

No guarantee of motion: The paper does not theoretically ensure that the learned latent $m_t$ encodes motion rather than directly leaking target feature information ($𝑧_{𝑡+1}$). Although empirical analyses (optical flow results, Sec. 4.4 perturbation study) suggest motion-like behavior, the model could still “hack” the objective by embedding target information in $𝑚$ making the representation less interpretable.\n\nW3. Limited quantitative analysis of motion learning:\nSection 4.4 provides compelling qualitative examples, but the conclusions would be stronger with quantitative validation. For instance, comparing perturbation-based correspondence against pseudo ground-truth from an off-the-shelf tracker could more rigorously substantiate the claimed motion alignment.\n\nW4. Marginal effect of design components: As seen in Table 3 (e.g., 2→7, 3→8, 4→9 comparisons), adding design components (e.g., backward layers, gating) only yields small incremental gains, which questions their relative contribution to the overall improvement.\n\nW5.
