We present ChiFlow, a chirality-aware backbone generator based on flow matching on toroidal Riemannian manifolds. ChiFlow models backbone dihedrals $\\phi,\\psi,\\omega$ as points on $\\mathbb{T}^3$, extending PPFlow to backbone variables and using periodicity to avoid boundary artifacts. Unlike the previous SE(3)-based flows such as Frameflow and Foldflow2, ChiFlow operates directly on the hypertorus, simplifying computations for angles. We also introduce a Riemannian mirroring operator and impose asymmetry on the learned vector field to enforce L-chirality. And we extended the methods in Foldingdiff by reconstructing the 3D atomic coordinates using fixed bond lengths and trigonometric calculations. To increase the diversity that was lowered by the chirality constraint, we added Stochastic Flow Matching to ChiFlow, resulting in an increase in diversity of the generated backbone. With extensive experiments on real-world protein datasets, ChiFlow approaches the leading flow models in the benchmark while maintaining absolute chirality purity.

The authors extend the deterministic flow matching to a Stochastic Flow Matching (SFM) formulation on the torus, introducing a toroidal Brownian reference process governed by the Laplace–Beltrami operator. By reinterpreting SFM as a Schrödinger bridge problem, they improve sample diversity without violating chirality constraints."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  The contribution of the paper is rather limited. The core novelty mainly resides in three aspects:\n\t- 1).\tthe application of flow matching on a toroidal manifold for generative modeling of backbone torsional angles,\n\t- 2).\tthe explicit chirality enforcement mechanism to ensure the generation of valid L-chiral protein backbones,\n\t- 3).\ta stochastic flow matching (SFM) extension to improve sampling diversity.\n\nWhile each component is conceptually reasonable, none represents a fundamentally new methodological advance beyond existing flow matching or manifold-based generative frameworks. The toroidal formulation is a straightforward adaptation of Riemannian flow matching to periodic coordinates which has been explored by PPFlow, PocketFlow and etc., and the chirality constraint is an elegant but relatively simple antisymmetry regularization. Therefore, the overall contribution appears incremental rather than transformative.\n\n2.The experimental validation is not sufficiently comprehensive, and the observed performance gains are relatively limited. Although the paper compares ChiFlow against several SE(3)-based baselines such as RFDiffusion, FrameFlow, and FoldFlow, the evaluation focuses primarily on backbone-level reconstruction metrics (e.g., scRMSD, designability, and chirality purity). However, there is a lack of functional or structural validation, such as fold-class conditional generation or long-chain generation tasks as proposed in Proteina. Conducting only standard and relatively simple experiments does not convincingly demonstrate the strengths or overall capabilities of the model — such as its scalability or functionality-guided generation potential.\n\nMoreover, the quantitative improvements over baselines are marginal. The proposed approach actually performs worse than several state-of-the-art methods, with the only notable advantage being chirality purity — an unsurprising result given the explicit enforcement mechanism. In addition, the paper does not include a thorough comparison with other torsion-based generative models (e.g., FoldDiff), making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the true benefits of using flow matching or chirality constraints. As a result, the experimental section does not convincingly substantiate the claimed advantages of the proposed method.\n\n3. The literature review is not sufficiently comprehensive. In line 80 and abstract, the authors claim that “unlike sidechain-focused torus approaches (Lin et al., 2024a)”, their work uniquely applies toroidal flow matching to backbone torsional angles. However, as far as I know, PPFlow also models torus-based flows directly on backbone torsion angles $(ϕ, ψ, and ω)$. This prior work should be properly discussed and cited, as it addresses a very similar problem formulation. Without acknowledging PPFlow and related torsion-space generative models, the paper’s claimed novelty is overstated and may give an inaccurate impression of the existing landscape.\n\n4. Minor Issues and Typos\n\t-\tLine 125: should use \\cite{} instead of \\citet{} for proper citation formatting.\n\t-\tLine 126: should use \\citep{} instead of \\cite{} to maintain consistent reference style.\n\t-\tEquation (15): the comma after the equation should be removed.\nand etc. The paper seems not mature enough to be published."}, "questions": {"value": "1.\tNovelty of Flow Matching on the Torus\nThe proposed flow matching on the torus appears methodologically identical to PPFlow, which also performs flow matching directly on backbone torsion angles $(ϕ, ψ, ω)$. Given that PPFlow already formulates backbone generative modeling in a torus manifold, it is unclear what specific methodological innovation ChiFlow introduces beyond that prior work. The authors are encouraged to clarify the conceptual or algorithmic differences relative to PPFlow — for instance, whether the improvements lie in training objectives, vector field parameterization — to substantiate the claimed novelty.\n\n\t2.\tNecessity of Explicit Chirality Modeling\nAs shown in the ablation study, SE(3)-based baselines such as FoldFlow already achieve around 0.95 chirality purity without any explicit constraint. This raises the question of whether chirality violation is truly a significant issue in practice. Given that the proposed torsion-space modeling substantially degrades RMSD and designability performance compared to stronger methods like RFDiffusion and Proteina, is it worthwhile to sacrifice structural accuracy for marginal improvements in chirality purity? A clearer justification or quantitative trade-off analysis would be valuable for assessing the real benefit of introducing the chirality constraint.\n\n3. Presentation and Focus\nThe paper contains substantial redundancy in the methodological exposition. Sections describing conditional Riemannian flow matching and the NeRF reconstruction algorithm repeat well-established concepts that have already been thoroughly introduced in previous literature. \n\nTo improve the paper’s focus and balance, it would be advisable to streamline or shorten these background sections, and instead allocate the saved space to additional experimental validation. For example, incorporating experiments similar to those in Proteina—such as function-conditioned generation or scaling to longer chains—would significantly enhance the depth, credibility, and overall impact of the experimental evaluation. This shift would help demonstrate the practical advantages of ChiFlow more convincingly than reiterating well-known methodological details."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "3UC405ONt7", "forum": "2Np82XlB34", "replyto": "2Np82XlB34", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6786/Reviewer_LNFf"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6786/Reviewer_LNFf"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6786/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761576591237, "cdate": 1761576591237, "tmdate": 1762919062713, "mdate": 1762919062713, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}, "comment": {"value": "# Subject: Withdrawal of Manuscript 6786\n\nDear ICLR Editors and Reviewers,\n\nThank you for providing the constructive review comments on our manuscript titled \"ChiFlow: Torsional Asymmetry Flow Matching For Chirality-Aware Protein Backbone Generation\"\nWe have carefully reviewed all the feedback and agree that the paper requires significant revisions to meet the high standards of the conference.
