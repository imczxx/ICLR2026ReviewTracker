Synthetic data offers a promising solution for developing and training models. However, synthesizing disease-specific datasets is challenging, as neurological disorders induce progressive changes in the brain that are subtle and often obscured by normal brain variability. Contrastive analysis provides a framework to learn generative factors that deconvolve variation shared between background (e.g., healthy) and target (e.g., diseased) datasets from variation unique to the target, making it particularly effective for capturing as well as modeling subtle disease effects. In this paper, we reformulate this framework to synthesize tabular neuroimaging-derived features, specifically brain regional volumes from T1-weighted structural MRI. Given unpaired neuroimaging samples of healthy and diseased participants, we learn to generate paired healthy and disease feature representations that emulate real disease effects. We show that paired synthesis enables fine-grained, individual-level modeling of disease effects, improving downstream analyses, and supporting more precise exploration of disease heterogeneity. We validate the models on both semi-synthetic and real-world brain regional volume datasets, specifically designed to highlight the heterogeneity parsing capability of contrastive analysis.

Lines 111-114 claim the method \"facilitates access to derived features that are otherwise tedious to obtain\". However, image processing and segmentation pipelines such as Freesurfer and SynthSeg are readily available, automated and quick to run [5,6].\n\n•\tMethodology: The link between Equations 1 & 2 and Equation 5 is not explained. The paper claims Equation 5 is \"equivalent to the sum of (1) and (2)\" (line 181), but Equation 5 has one KL term for z while Equations 1+2 have two KL terms for z (one from x, one from y). How do these become equivalent under the decoupling assumption (Equation 6)? The connection between Equation 5 and the final objective (Equation 7) should be better justified. Also, the original contrastive VAE [4] includes a Total Correlation (TC) term (their Equation 5) to enforce independence between z and s latent variables. This paper does not appear to include this term, and it doesn’t appear that the authors have implemented an alternative. \n\n•\tConfusing logic:  It is unclear whether the model is trained on raw neuroimaging features or residuals (age, sex, ICV corrected). The semi-synthetic experiment adds covariates back after being regressed out (lines 286-291), but this is not mentioned for real data. If trained on raw features: It would make sense to match demographics between healthy/disease samples, but this doesn't appear to be done. If trained on residuals: What is z capturing? Can the model generate volumes for specific demographics? Otherwise the practical utility of this method seems limited.\n\n•\tNo baseline evaluation: There are no baseline comparisons in the paper or quantitative analysis to evaluate how well their method is working. I appreciate there may be limited/no AD specific synthetic data generation methods existing in the literature, however there are several methods (eg. [7,8]) which generate healthy counterfactuals of disease images. The authors should compare their method to these baselines in the AD to healthy scenario for the ADNI dataset. \n\n•\tQuestionable performance and limited results: Figures 2a and 3a show synthetic distributions (bottom rows) appear to have notably less variance than original data (top rows), particularly for healthy samples. This could be attributed to setting s=0 for healthy samples. It would have been nice for the authors to include some statistical tests to quantify these effects.\n\nMinor:\n\n•\tTypos and missing links: Abstract states \"The models are available at: [link]\" but no actual link is provided. Also, there are several typos throughout the text.\n\n•\tAssumptions: Setting s=0 for all healthy individuals assumes no \"healthy-specific\" variation exists. Is this realistic? Do we believe all healthy variation is captured by the adjusted demographic features? This is debatable. \n\n•\tMissing references: The authors should reference [1] and [2] in relation to synthetic disease sample generation, and [3] in background contrastive VAE methods. \n\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Unraveling Normal Anatomy via Fluid-Driven Anomaly Randomization, Peirong Liu, Ana Lawry Aguila, Juan E.

Claims of multi-study integration and facilitating access to derived features are not backed by controlled comparisons showing concrete advantages over standard VAEs, cVAEs, or recent contrastive-disentanglement variants under matched capacity and training budgets.\n\n4.  Evaluation is primarily qualitative (distribution overlays, scatter plots) with a single scalar trend (MAD between observed and counterfactual healthy) rather than rigorous quantitative utility metrics, such as: downstream diagnostic/prognostic tasks trained on synthetic vs. real data, subtype recovery scores in semi-synthetic settings, or calibration/fidelity measures beyond Gaussian 2-Wasserstein approximations.\n\n5.
