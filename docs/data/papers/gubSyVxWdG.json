In this article, we propose a robust evaluation framework based on relative error, which quantifies performance differences between two HTE estimators. We first derive the key theoretical conditions on the nuisance parameters that are necessary to  achieve a robust estimator of relative error. Building on these conditions, we introduce novel loss functions and design a neural network architecture to estimate nuisance parameters, thereby obtaining a robust estimation of relative error. We provide the large sample properties of the proposed relative error estimator. Furthermore, beyond evaluation,  we propose a new learning algorithm for HTE that leverages both the previously HTE estimators and the nuisance parameters learned through our neural network architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evaluation framework supports reliable comparisons across HTE estimators, and the proposed learning algorithm for HTE exhibits desirable performance.", "tldr": "We propose a robust relative error-based evaluation framework for heterogeneous treatment effect estimators.", "keywords": ["Causal Inference", "Conditional Average Treatment Effect", "Relative Error", "Robust Evaluation"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ab2d92ba372e075fe36d2e7344eda7688d8ea657.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/91fdb582b7e532c0cba3ac395fc5bf5518e947a8.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new *evaluation framework* for HTE estimators, extending a recently proposed relative error–based framework that compares the performance of two estimators.

In contrast, the new framework only requires the propensity score model to meet this condition, allowing the outcome regression and propensity model to be misspecified. Building on this evaluation framework, the authors further develop a new HTE estimation method and evaluate it on some very often used semi-synthetic datasets, including IHDP, Twins and Jobs, demonstrating improved performance compared to several baseline estimators.

The main strengths are:\n\n- Valuable Problem: The paper focuses on the reliable evaluation of HTE estimators, which is a critical issue for real-world applications. The idea of using \"relative error\" to compare models is novel and meaningful.\n\n- Strong Theoretical Contribution: The highlight of this paper is its theoretical work. It successfully relaxes the strict assumptions from prior work (Gao, 2025), notably by removing the requirement for the outcome model to be correctly specified. This makes the proposed framework much more robust and practical for real-world scenarios, which is a significant and elegant theoretical improvement.\n\n- Clear and Solid Method: The paper is very clearly written and easy to follow. The proposed new loss function and network architecture are well-motivated and tightly connected to the theoretical derivations. The overall approach feels very solid.\n\n- Thorough Experiments: The authors provide convincing results from experiments on several standard datasets. The experimental design is comprehensive, including ablation and sensitivity analyses, which effectively validate the proposed method's effectiveness."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The paper's primary weakness is the unclear practical motivation for using \"relative error.\" While the metric is theoretically interesting for comparing two estimators, its real-world applicability is not well-established. The paper would be significantly stronger if it could provide clear use cases where practitioners would prefer this comparative measure over standard absolute performance metrics like PEHE. This is particularly important for the ICLR audience, which values practical impact.\n\n- The paper is mathematically dense, and while this contributes to its theoretical rigor, it also appears to have led to several typos and minor inconsistencies. To ensure the paper's core contributions are communicated accurately, a thorough proofreading of all definitions, assumptions, and equations is highly recommended."}, "questions": {"value": "- The paper focuses on HTE estimation but only provides formal definitions for ITE and CATE in the problem setup. For clarity, please provide a precise definition of the HTE you are targeting.\n\n- There appears to be a typo in Assumption 1(i). It should likely be the standard unconfoundedness assumption: $(Y_i(0), Y_i(1)) \\perp A_i \\mid X_i$. Please clarify and correct this.\n\n- Choice of Evaluation Objective: Line 109 states that the goal is to select the estimator with the highest accuracy on a given test dataset. Could the authors elaborate on why this objective was chosen over the more common goal of finding an estimator that accurately models the CATE function over the marginal distribution of covariates, $P(X)$?\n\n- Example 1 illustrates model misspecification, which is a well-understood concept in statistical machine learning. To improve conciseness, this example could be simplified or moved to the appendix.\n\n- The neural network architecture described in Section 4.3 appears to be the Dragonnet architecture. Could the authors clarify the novelty of their proposed network, or explicitly frame it as an adaptation of Dragonnet for their specific loss functions?\n\n- Experimental Comparison: The paper's main theoretical contribution is relaxing the assumptions of Gao (2025). It would be valuable to include a baseline that represents the Gao (2025) approach or can you clarify how the proposed estimator outperform it?\n\n- Minor Typos: Line 173: \"violating Assumption 2\" should likely refer to \"violating Condition 2\".

It is strong but also reasonable. It is reasonable because orthogonal ML literature always assumes the convergence rate of nuisance parameters. It is strong because we are treating them as \"plug-in\" quantities, instead of the nuisance parameters that the estimator should be doubly robust to.

What does the robust evaluation exactly mean? After reading this paper, I guess the author wants to claim the relative error estimator is \"doubly robust\", so it is robust to nuisance parameter estimation. \n\n2. What's the difference between your loss and R-loss (R-loss is also doubly robust)?\n\n3. The problem of robust evaluation of the CATE estimator has been studied in [1], where they also consider the worst-case performance of the CATE estimator selected by the proposed evaluation metric. Does this paper also provide any information on the worst-case performance? I guess Figure 1 provides such information, and I suggest emphasizing this point as it can strengthen the efficacy of \"robust\".\n\n4. A brainstorm: I think the whole framework can be extended to policy/estimator adaptation, e.g., following the setting in [2]. Maybe we can design a new policy evaluation metric that is doubly robust to nuisance parameters, which is very useful when distribution shift presents, and it has not been discussed in previous literature.
