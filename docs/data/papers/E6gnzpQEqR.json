In this setting, multiple satellites potentially in different orbits must coordinate to capture images of ground targets under time constraints. While real-world satellites involve complex sensing and control dynamics, SatBench abstracts these into an agent-based learning framework with a standardized, user-friendly interface. This enables the application of reinforcement learning (RL) methods while preserving critical realism in the environment. SatBench supports a diverse set of configurable scenarios that capture varying EO requirements, including different satellite formations, target distributions, and prioritization schemes. We evaluate representative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms across these scenarios, highlighting key challenges such as coordination under temporal coupling and scalability. SatBench aims to foster progress in both autonomous satellite coordination and the development of more robust, generalizable MARL methods.
