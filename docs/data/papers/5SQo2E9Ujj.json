Instead of sampling all goals uniformly, we bias sampling toward underachieved goals, thereby shifting the state–goal distribution seen by the agent. Using universal value function approximators (UVFAs) with potential-based reward shaping in GridWorld, we compare uniform and curriculum-guided training. Our results show that curricula alter goal coverage, reduce approximation error, and improve success on difficult edge goals. These findings highlight curriculum learning as a principled mechanism for selective data acquisition, suggesting a pathway toward more persistent and open-ended agents.", "tldr": "We demonstrate that curriculum-guided training significantly improves UVFA generalization in open-ended RL by adaptively focusing on difficult goals, yielding faster convergence and higher success rates compared to uniform goal sampling.", "keywords": ["Curriculum Learning", "Universal Value Function Approximators (UVFA)", "Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning", "Open-Ended Learning", "Reward Shaping"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f32d85c2d3faa3a6c008b50c8f7d898ebff743e3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies curriculum learning in GCRL.
