This growth, however, is accompanied by significant security risks such as illicit accounts engaged in fraud. Effective detection is further limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the evolving tactics of malicious accounts. To address these challenges with a robust solution for safeguarding the DeFi ecosystem, we propose $\\textbf{SLEID}$, a $\\textbf{S}$elf-$\\textbf{L}$earning $\\textbf{E}$nsemble-based $\\textbf{I}$llicit account $\\textbf{D}$etection framework. SLEID uses an Isolation Forest model for initial outlier detection and a self-training mechanism to iteratively generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled accounts, enhancing detection accuracy. Experiments on 6,903,860 Ethereum transactions with extensive DeFi interaction coverage demonstrate that SLEID significantly outperforms supervised and semi-supervised baselines with $\\textbf{+2.56}$ percentage-point precision, comparable recall, and $\\textbf{+0.90}$ percentage-point F1---particularly for the minority illicit class---alongside $\\textbf{+3.74}$ percentage-points higher accuracy and improvements in PR-AUC, while substantially reducing reliance on labeled data.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Decentralized Finance", "Ethereum Blockchain", "Illicit Account Detection", "Self-Learning", "Semi-Supervised Learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b1a308ec21684df4a224b2c40de36862823f8fa3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "While the work presents a framework (SLEID) that demonstrates promising detection performance against baselines by integrating pseudo-labeling, ensemble learning, and iterative self-training, several aspects of the methodology and evaluation require clarification and further justification to substantiate its contributions."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "Novel Semi-Supervised Framework: The SLEID method cleverly combines an Isolation Forest for initial outlier detection with a self-learning ensemble model (Random Forest and XGBoost) for iterative optimization, effectively addressing the core challenge of scarce labeled data in real-world scenarios."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited Methodological Novelty: The contribution highlights a framework built upon Isolation Forest and ensemble learning. However, these are established and widely used techniques in the domain of anomaly detection, as evidenced in prior work [1]. Consequently, the primary innovation of the framework is not fully substantiated. Furthermore, the iterative self-training component, presented as another part of the methodology, appears to offer only marginal performance improvements, which raises additional questions about the framework's practical significance. \n\n2. Insufficient Component Analysis: The paper lacks a comprehensive ablation study to validate the design choices of the SLEID framework. Consequently, the individual contributions of the ensemble learning and iterative self-training modules to the final performance remain unclear. To strengthen the paper, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis isolating the impact of each component.\n\n3. Lack of Detail in Feature Selection: The methodology states that Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was employed to acquire a compact dataset. However, specific details regarding this process are omitted.\n\n4. Hyperparameter Justification: The iterative self-training mechanism is critically dependent on a confidence threshold. The manuscript, however, fails to provide a rigorous experimental justification or sensitivity analysis for the selection of this specific value. To enhance the robustness of the methodology, the authors should include evidence supporting their choice of this threshold.\n\n[1] Kamran, Muhammad, et al. \"ARCADE—Adversarially Robust Cost-Sensitive Anomaly Detection in Blockchain Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence.\" Electronics 14.8 (2025): 1648."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "2KH18ei9gA", "forum": "jOZCfCvH4c", "replyto": "jOZCfCvH4c", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24189/Reviewer_hKPq"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24189/Reviewer_hKPq"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24189/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761814610647, "cdate": 1761814610647, "tmdate": 1762942981636, "mdate": 1762942981636, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a self-learning ensemble-based framework for detecting illicit accounts in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.
