In safety-critical tasks such as driving, degraded signal quality can severely compromise prediction accuracy, limiting the deployment of existing models outside controlled lab conditions. To address this challenge, we propose CogMoE, a signal quality–guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that dynamically adapts to heterogeneous and noisy inputs. CogMoE flexibly integrates physiological modalities, including EEG, ECG, EDA, and gaze, through quality-aware gating, enabling context-sensitive fusion. The framework operates in two stages: (1) quality-aware multi-modal synchronization and recovery to mitigate artifacts, temporal misalignment, and missing data, and (2) signal-quality-specific expert modeling via a cross-modal MoE transformer that regulates information flow based on signal reliability. To further improve stability, we introduce CORTEX Loss, which balances reconstruction fidelity and expert utilization under noise. Experiments on CL-Drive and ADABase show that CogMoE outperforms strong baselines, delivering consistent improvements across diverse signal qualities.", "tldr": "We propose an adaptive mixture-of-expert framework for cognitive load prediction on multi-modal physiological data.", "keywords": ["Cognitive-load", "multi-modality", "mixture-of-experts"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a4bdcc3433f8ff29515337eb5778b068baf3873a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The manuscript presents a potentially valuable idea emphasizing signal quality during multimodal fusion but currently falls short in exposition, motivation, and experimental rigor, evaluation."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "CoGMoE / CogMoE"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Manuscript readability and presentation require improvement; the method is not explained in sufficient technical detail to assess reproducibility or novelty.\n\n- Terminology is inconsistent (e.g., CoGMoE vs CogMoE); a single canonical name and notation should be used throughout.\n\n- The problem statement and its significance are not clearly articulated; it is difficult to judge the scope and impact of the contribution.\n\n- Related work discussion is insufficient: prior techniques and their specific limitations are not described in depth, leaving motivation for a new method unclear.\n\n- Evaluation is limited in scope, both in metrics and experiments, preventing strong conclusions about effectiveness and generalizability."}, "questions": {"value": "- Justify the claim: “However, the fundamental bottleneck is not the lack of sensors or models, but the variable quality of physiological signals.” What empirical evidence or literature supports this assertion?\n\n- Provide motivation: Why was the decision made to “shift the focus of multimodal fusion to signal quality, the true bottleneck in practical CL prediction”?

Several choices are taken as givens without ablation (the ablation section is one paragraph). For example, why CWT for representing a signal?

The method CMWT representation for alignment/recovery is introduced in the work, but does not compare to reasonable alternatives (e.g., STFT features, time-domain DTW variants, learned alignment modules). The custom loss also appears as a package rather than with per-term deltas, which makes it hard to attribute gains or evaluate the necessity of each element. On evaluation, the paper discusses “alignment” and “robust fusion” but does not analyze how the number of signal sources and their measured quality jointly affect accuracy; instead, it relies on aggregate tables. \n\nMinor: Acronyms are introduced inconsistently (sometimes before definition, sometimes multiple times). \n\nThe work likely contains a solid idea, but it needs clearer writing, a sharper statement of what is novel, and targeted ablations to make the methodology and its advantages unambiguous."}, "questions": {"value": "No further questions at this stage."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 0}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "WZmM0CBCuT", "forum": "UtbSWdWv0F", "replyto": "UtbSWdWv0F", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13512/Reviewer_4mhF"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13512/Reviewer_4mhF"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13512/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762066083664, "cdate": 1762066083664, "tmdate": 1762924122016, "mdate": 1762924122016, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
