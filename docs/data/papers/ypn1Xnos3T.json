The exponential growing size of bacterial databases poses the need for succinct yet informative representations of these vast microbial collections, allowing for fast and efficient genome classification and comparison. To address this, we propose Hyperbiome, a metric learning framework that takes advantage of the geometry of the Poincarè ball to reconstruct the bacterial taxonomy and compute a latent space where distances reflect biological similarities between genomes. By incorporating the taxonomic hierarchy in hyperbolic space, we learn representative proxies at both the species and genus level, which guide the embedding of each bacterial assembly. Finally, using the species-level proxies, we build a compact index that enables rapid classification of new assemblies while avoiding exhaustive query-vs-all scans of the database. Experiments on AllTheBacteria, the largest bacterial database, demonstrate that \\hbiome effectively captures biological relationships. Moreover, we show that our proxy-based index achieves high accuracy, substantially reduces computational querying costs, and generalizes successfully to previously unseen species, supporting continuous updates without retraining the metric model.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Genomics", "Hyperbolic Metric Learning", "Hierarchical Embeddings"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0688b4f08eadfb88007731b0d6a5e955fb09736e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes HyperBiome, a metric learning framework that takes advantage of the geometry of the Poincaré ball to reconstruct the bacterial taxonomy. \nEach genome is represented by a tensorial sketch of k-mer statistics.\nA hierarchical multi-proxy loss organizes embeddings by both genus and species.\nThe experiments show that the proxy-based index achieves high accuracy, substantially reduces computational querying costs, and generalizes successfully to previously unseen species."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "(i) Novelty: Leveraging hyperbolic space for taxonomic hierarchy.\n\n(ii) The experimental results are positive, showing the effectiveness of their method.\n\n(iii) Clear visualization: UMAP plots illustrate hierarchy preservation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "(i) The writing is very poor, especially since the presentation of the table is not beautiful.\n\n(ii) No statistical uncertainty or robustness analysis in the experimental results."}, "questions": {"value": "(i) Is there some statistical uncertainty or robustness analysis, e.g., the standard deviation?\n\n(ii) The results in Table 1 do not show much difference,  e.g., 0.9969 vs. 0.9997.

A schematic or block diagram illustrating the full pipeline would substantially improve clarity.\n\n- Experiment 1 serves mainly as a hyperparameter search (over curvature c and clipping radius τ) rather than yielding substantive scientific insights. This analysis should be framed as an ablation or sensitivity study rather than a main experiment.\n\n- The work does not explore or justify the choice of k-mer length. Because k critically affects representational granularity and computational cost, a systematic evaluation of different k values is needed to support the modeling decisions.\n\n- The empirical analysis is relatively narrow in scope. Additional biological validation or interpretability analyses would strengthen the claim that the learned hyperbolic embeddings capture meaningful genomic organization beyond a single proxy accuracy metric.\n\n- Experiment 3 is insufficiently defined. The experiment lacks a clear quantitative framework for evaluating the learned representation. Currently, the comparison relies on UMAP visualizations, which are sensitive to initialization, hyperparameters, and stochastic effects, making them an unreliable proxy for geometric evaluation. Instead, using something like Poincaré disk plots with geodesic overlays would provide more interpretable insights. Also, results should be averaged over multiple random seeds with confidence intervals to ensure robustness.\n\n- There is a need for objective, geometry-aware metrics. Experiment 3 should incorporate quantitative measures that assess embedding quality directly in hyperbolic space, such as (1) class compactness and separation (e.g. within-class Fréchet variance), (2) label–embedding agreement (e.g. kNN accuracy), and/or (3) hierarchical fidelity (e.g. tree reconstruction accuracy).\n\nOverall, the paper presents an intriguing and potentially valuable framework, but it currently lacks sufficient methodological clarity, architectural exposition, and experimental depth to support its main claims."}, "questions": {"value": "- Why does the framework restrict the hierarchical modeling to only the species and genus levels? Would extending the hierarchical loss to higher taxonomic ranks (family, order, class) provide additional representational or biological benefits? It would be interesting to explore these tradeoffs further in the paper. \n\n- The comparison to PanSpace (Experiment 2) appears limited to a single embedding dimensionality (for HyperBiome) and an otherwise fixed configuration. Given that this constitutes the main experimental result, could the authors provide a more comprehensive evaluation under varying hyperparameters and embedding sizes? Additionally, how does HyperBiome compare to PanSpace and other baselines in terms of training and inference efficiency? Including comparisons to simpler deep learning or metric-learning baselines could strengthen the empirical claims.\n\n- How are new proxies generated and integrated into the model? Does proxy creation depend on the original set of trained proxies, or can it be performed independently using new embeddings?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "SAOGJdakjP", "forum": "ypn1Xnos3T", "replyto": "ypn1Xnos3T", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17282/Reviewer_cCeE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17282/Reviewer_cCeE"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17282/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761949700678, "cdate": 1761949700678, "tmdate": 1762927224753, "mdate": 1762927224753, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The manuscript describes HyperBiome, a framewirk for for embedding of k-mer charcteristic verctors in a low dimensional hyperbolic space.\nRepresentaiton includes genus- and species-level proxies\nHyperbiome is compared to a sOTA bacterial indexing method"}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "* compelling idea of using hyperbolicity for an exponentially-diversifying evolutionary space\n* demonsstrated non-euclidean curvature for the training (seen) data\n* demonstrated generalaziability (performance on unseen data beyond SOTA\n* demonstrated interpretability through UMAP visualization"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1 there is no seprataion of the ideas potentially contributing \n2 the seen data does not support hyperbolicity. \n3 randomness ignored\n4 no computational resources analysis\n5. the number (2) of hierarchical levels is arbitrary\n6. the data filtration leaves a very small dataset\n7.

This suggests something in the method and its objective funciton is off.  This often comes up when regularization facilitates test-set generalizability at the expense of train-set accuracy. However in this work regularization only comes up only in the context of clipping strategy and the less-regularized version prevails. The authors should find a consistent penalty funciton or otherwise explain what is going on here.\n\n3. Sketching involves random subsetting, and so does the evaluation (by selecting the unseen set). The single-run results leave concern of cherrypicking. Repeating the analysis, say. 10 times with wach source of randomess, and reporting means + STDs would reassure this is not the case.\n \n4.
