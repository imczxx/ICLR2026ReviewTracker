While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical results demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known, data-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural language tasks that demand prudent exploration.", "tldr": "We demonstrate how LLMs can be used to implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) and, in doing so, inherit the efficacy of its exploration.", "keywords": ["Exploration", "Large Language Models", "Bayesian RL"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2b9c7bee30ea741b92b8558f7766c3497db1c260.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This submission studies how large language models can be used to solve text-based decision-making problems under uncertainty. While prior work has largely focused on prompting or fine-tuning language models to solve decision making tasks, this work instead uses LLMs to implement certain aspects of classical RL algorithms. \n\nIn particular, the authors show how to use language models to implement the classical Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning (PSRL) algorithm (an extension of Thompson sampling from bandits to the RL setting) to text-based tasks. At a high level, they do so by instantiating PSRL with three LLM oracles: one to sample from a “textual posterior”, one to select actions given the current state that maximize value in a way that is consistent with the posterior sampling LLM, and one to update the PSRL agent’s knowledge and residual uncertainty about the world, akin to an (approximate) posterior update. \n\nThe authors empirically evaluate their LLM-based PSRL algorithm on both tabular RL tasks and on text-based tasks on which classic tabular RL algorithms are not applicable.

While paper does present Regret plots, it omits statistical significance tests. Can the authors please report those? \n2. From my point of view, the paper has limited novelty. The core contribution is an application of PSRL through LLMs rather than a theoretical or methodological advance in RL or LLM architectures. Please let me know if I have misunderstood or didn't fully notice another novelty presented. \n3. I understand that the authors are trying to present more transparent results to understand the importance of PSRL. But, to me, the experiments remain toy and fall short of demonstrating scalability or robustness in realistic open-ended tasks. Maybe the authors could consider adding more realistic domains? Embodied AI could be an option, maybe? \n4. I am not convinced that the posterior that the uncertainty the authors refer to is actually calibrated. There’s no formal analysis of whether LLM-generated samples reflect valid uncertainty quantification or just linguistic variability. \n5. There are many LLMs used in this paper. I would like to ask the authors to show an efficiency comparison (e.g., token or cost per reward improvement), especially with the models that are used. \n6. There are some claims that I am not sure I understand: 'one might hope to see an LLM-based implementation of PSRL exhibit similar robustness in practice' - I am not sure what this means. This is not substantiated very well in the paper. There are no new regret bounds provided within the non-convex world of LLMs. So, I am not sure how to understand such claims.

The approach is compared against the classical PSRL formulation and other LLM-based agents such as Reflexion and ICRL.
