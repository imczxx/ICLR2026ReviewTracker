Given a test instance, IPT generates lightweight parameter adaptations that unlock additional model capacity for each instance. Across mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, GSM8K etc), IPT delivers substantial performance gains compared to strong baselines.  We further run a series of ablation studies to reveal the effects of the key design choices of IPT. IPT opens a new frontier for test-time scaling by reasoning directly in parameter space.", "tldr": "a method to perform cot in the latent space", "keywords": ["cot", "latent", "adaptation", "reasoning", "hypernetwork"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
