Here, we introduce a framework to leverage week-long intracranial and audio recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, effectively increasing the training dataset size by over two orders of magnitude. With this pretraining, our contrastive learning model substantially outperforms models trained solely on classic experimental data, with gains that scale log-linearly with dataset size.Analysis of the learned representations reveals that, while brain activity represents speech features, its global structure largely drifts across days, highlighting the need for models that explicitly account for cross-day variability. Overall, our approach opens a scalable path toward decoding and modeling brain representations in both real-life and controlled task settings.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Pretraining", "representation learning", "speech decoding", "neuroscience"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f4c082054ecce40759246b11cfb86eddcb0e1f8f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a framework to scale intracranial (iEEG) speech decoding by leveraging week-long, continuous brain and audio recordings as supervised pretraining data.

The study reveals that pretraining performance improves log-linearly with the amount of data and that downstream performance on controlled tasks benefits robustly from large-scale pretraining followed by supervised finetuning.

The experimental evaluation included only 3 subjects from [1] and lacked comparison with advanced sEEG decoding baselines [3-6], which makes it difficult to position the contribution of this article.\n\n3. Although the idea of using sEEG-audio signal pairs during the non-task phase to improve decoding performance during the task phase is interesting, the experimental design itself is to ensure that the subjects focus on carefully designed cognitive tasks and that the recorded sEEG signals contain information about language perception, which makes the neuroscientific basis and reproducibility of this work questionable.\n\n**References**:\n\n[1] Défossez A, Caucheteux C, Rapin J, et al.

Real-world relevance: The authors effectively leverage week-long clinical iEEG recordings paired with ambient audio—data typically discarded—to scale training data by over two orders of magnitude. This represents a meaningful step toward real-world, scalable brain-speech decoding and is clearly motivated and illustrated (Figure 1).\n\n2. Rigorous and comprehensive experimental validation: The pretraining framework consistently improves downstream speech decoding across all three subjects, with statistically significant gains (Figure 2A). The log-linear scaling with pretraining data quantity (Figure 2B) and sensitivity analyses (e.g., finetuning data ablation in Figure 4A) further strengthen the claims.\n\n3. Representational and distribution shift analysis: The paper provides a clear analysis of the distribution shift between ambient and true audiobook sounds (Figure 3) and demonstrates the necessity of finetuning. The comparison between wav2vec 2.0 and melspectrogram features (Figure 5) offers valuable insights into which acoustic representations align better with neural activity.\n\n4. Neurophysiologically informative embedding analysis: The UMAP visualizations and linear decoding analyses (Figures 6, 10) reveal meaningful structure in the learned embeddings, particularly the day-to-day drift in neural representations—a finding with important implications for future model design and clinical translation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited comparison to recent state-of-the-art baselines: The paper does not adequately situate itself within the rapidly evolving literature on neural decoding. Key recent works—such as self-supervised pretraining on iEEG [1,2] and cross-subject or cross-session transfer learning [3]—are not discussed or compared. This omission weakens the claim of methodological novelty.\n\n2. Incomplete coverage of pretraining innovations in brain decoding: While this paper emphasizes supervised pre-training on environmental data, it lacks a detailed overview of the results from related foundational models [4,5] that also utilize large-scale neural network data. Therefore, a deeper exploration is needed regarding the connections between this work and these methods, and in what ways they represent breakthroughs.\n\n3. Lack of neural-level interpretability and spatial ablation: The embedding analyses are informative but do not directly link to neural anatomy or functional localization. Ablations over electrode groups (e.g., auditory vs. non-auditory cortex) or analysis of how different brain regions contribute to the learned representations would strengthen the interpretability and biological plausibility of the model.\n\n4. Superficial handling of temporal non-stationarity: Although the paper identifies day-to-day drift as a key challenge, the proposed model does not explicitly account for it. Incorporating temporal adaptation mechanisms—such as domain-adversarial training, sliding-window normalization, or time-aware embeddings—could improve robustness and generalization, and should be explored or at least discussed as a future direction.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Wu, D., Li, S., Feng, C., Cao, L., Zhang, Y., Yang, J., & Sawan, M.
