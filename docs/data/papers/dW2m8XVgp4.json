While pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful feature extractors, existing forensic methods often default to using final-layer features, which may discard crucial forensic traces. We embark on a systematic probe into the latent representations of various ViTs and uncover a universal phenomenon we term the \"Forensic Singularity\": a narrow region within the ViTs' mid-level layers where forensic separability culminates before giving way to semantic abstraction. To harness the immense potential of this \"singularity\" layer while mitigating its high risk of overfitting to limited training data, we propose a Regularized Hyperbolic Framework. Our framework learns a polar representation in the Poincaré Ball by disentangling semantic content and forensic evidence: the final-layer semantic feature guides the direction, while the singularity-layer forensic feature determines the radius. This inherent geometric constraint regularizes the model, promoting a more generalizable decision boundary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only establishes a new state of the art on multiple datasets, and exhibits superior generalization performance on unseen generative models. Our work provides both a powerful new tool for AI forensics and a deeper insight into how the hierarchical representations of ViTs can be effectively harnessed.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multimedia Forensics", "AI Generated Image Detection"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3229dfd647bd2d414b556ff586a0f986830424d5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies detection of AI-generated images (AIGI). Prior work predominantly relies on the final, most semantic layers of ViT-style encoders. The authors challenge this convention and report a consistent mid-layer “forensic singularity”—a relatively narrow band of layers where real vs. fake separability peaks. Motivated by the observation that mid-layers carry strong but potentially overfitting-prone forensic cues, while final layers are semantically stable but less separable, the paper proposes a Regularized Hyperbolic Framework (RHF). Concretely, it fuses mid-layer “forensic” features and final-layer “semantic” features, maps them to the Poincaré ball via a polar construction (direction = semantics; radius = forensic strength), and uses a radial hyperbolic classifier for detection.

The authors first identify a phenomenon they term the **\"Forensic Singularity\"**: a consistent peak in forensic signal found in the **mid-level layers** of Vision Transformers (ViTs), rather than the commonly used final layer. They observe that while these mid-level features are highly discriminative, they are also prone to overfitting.\n\nTo address this, the paper proposes a **Regularized Hyperbolic Framework (RHF)**. This novel approach uses hyperbolic geometry to disentangle features: it maps the final-layer semantic features to the *direction* and the mid-level forensic features to the *radius* of a point in the Poincaré Ball.

Is this assumption rigorous? For instance, images of the same category (e.g., all \"cats\") may be affected by content, making them consistently closer in the ViT space (which is trained for category discrimination tasks) compared to images of other categories (e.g., \"fish\"). Therefore, would it be more appropriate to use semantic categories as a baseline before clustering real and fake images? It is recommended to conduct a more in-depth discussion on the assumptions of this problem.\n- Regarding the \"Natural Center-Periphery Structure\" in Line 287, the paper states that \"anchor the singular normal class of real images at the geometrically unique origin\". Is it possible to anchor generated images at the origin instead? In other words, could real images be more widely distributed in the \"forensic space\", while generated images are closer to each other due to the artifacts inherent in GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and Diffusion Models? It is recommended to add a comparative experiment using generated images as the origin to verify this reversely.\n- Weak technical innovation: Although the idea of using Polar Construction/Poincaré Ball is interesting, the adopted calculation processes (e.g., Equations 1–3 only simply define the in-class/out-class distances of two clusters, and Equation 4 for constructing the polar directly uses geometric regularization) are all based on existing works.\n- Lack of ablation studies: Although the experimental section evaluates the method on multiple test sets/ViT backbones, it does not explore other separation methods for semantic/forensic vectors. For example, can simple linear classification or clustering (instead of Polar Construction) achieve good performance? Or, if global features or only the features of the last layer are used in the front-end multi-feature fusion, can this also bring performance improvements?\n- It is recommended to unify the font for referring to the same content, such as \"SD v1.4\", which is sometimes in \\texttt font and sometimes in regular font."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "NA"}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "BiPLs2Moni", "forum": "dW2m8XVgp4", "replyto": "dW2m8XVgp4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission107/Reviewer_jyTK"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission107/Reviewer_jyTK"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission107/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761827573270, "cdate": 1761827573270, "tmdate": 1762915452137, "mdate": 1762915452137, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose to use features from multiple layers from a CLIP or PE network, and train a network with a cross-entropy-classification branch over the last layer, with added intermediate layers and logits obtained from hyperbolic distances between feature maps and some center.
