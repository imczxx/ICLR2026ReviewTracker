We revisit this paradigm and show that such dense guidance is unnecessary: a small set of **time-independent** classifiers, trained on data from selected timesteps, suffices to produce high-quality, class-consistent samples. Theoretically, we first analyze the feasibility of using a single time-independent classifier trained on clean data to guide generation under certain conditions which are unrealistic in practice. To address the limitations of real-world image data, we then extend this approach to a small set of classifiers trained on noisy data from some timesteps and derive a convergence bound that depends on the number of classifiers employed.

Although the authors acknowledge this, empirical validation on real-world data is only performed for the multi-classifier regime. There is a substantial gap between theory and practice unaddressed for the single-classifier setting.\n2. **Missing or Limited Comparison to Related Alternative Guidance Approaches:** While classifier-free guidance is briefly mentioned, there is insufficient experimental or conceptual comparison, especially given classifier-free guidance’s considerable practical importance. For instance, Table 1 and Table 2 compare only varying counts of time-dependent classifiers and lack strong baselines from other guidance paradigms.\n3. **Empirical Evidence for Robustness to Classifier and Data Bias:** Experiments such as those visualized in Figures 9, 10, and 11 focus on varying guidance strength and initial distribution bias, but they predominantly demonstrate results for a handful of selected classes. The breadth and depth of robustness testing are not thoroughly quantified.\n4. **Limited Discussion of Limitations and Potential Failure Modes:** The discussion lightly touches on the failure of single-classifier guidance for manifold data, but does not explore or visualize where/why this approach might entirely fail for more complex datasets or tasks (e.g., text-to-image, compositionality, or classes with high inter-class visual similarity). Similarly, sensitivity to classifier architecture and capacity is not explored.\n5. **Insufficient Empirical Comparison with Robust/Adversarial Guidance:** Recent works such as Kawar et al. (2023), which explore the robustness of classifier-guided diffusion via adversarial training, are not discussed or compared in depth. Such comparisons could reveal whether the proposed approach has complementary or inferior/robustness properties.\n\n***Reference***\n- Kawar B, Ganz R, Elad M.

While the paper discusses classifier-free guidance in the related work, no experimental comparison is provided.
