However, accurately forecasting long-horizon trajectories from initial states remains challenging, due to complex particle interactions and entangled multiscale dynamics involving both low- and high-frequency components. \nTo address this, we propose a novel knowledge-distillation-based framework, SGDD (Spectral-Guided Dynamics Distillation), which integrates a spectral-guided enhancement to adaptively prioritize key frequency components within a unified spatio-temporal representation. Through knowledge distillation, SGDD leverages future trajectories as privileged information during training, guiding a teacher encoder to generate comprehensive dynamics representations while a student encoder approximates them using only the initial state. This enables the student can generate effective dynamics representations at inference, even without privileged information, thereby enabling accurate long-horizon trajectory prediction. Experimental results on molecule, protein, and human motion datasets demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate and stable long-term predictions than previous physical dynamics models, successfully capturing the complex spatio-temporal structures of real-world systems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Physical dynamics", "Knowledge distillation"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/768a1e9acf7119702492eea604e0f03d929a788b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work proposes Spectral-Guided Dynamics Distillation (SGDD) for long-horizon trajectory forecasting from only initial states.

Because SGDD predicts future trajectories from only the initial state, it appears unable to handle such exogenously driven series. This is the main reason I lean toward a **weak reject**.\n- As I understand it (see Question 2), the method relies on a spatiotemporal joint basis $B_{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{NT \\times K}$. While this enables joint spatiotemporal modeling, it introduces two concerns:\n  - Because the shape of $B_K$ explicitly depends on the number of time steps $T$, SGDD may only forecast a **fixed** number of steps at inference, limiting practical applicability.\n  - For very high-dimensional systems or very long sequences, storing $B_{K}$ could become memory intensive.\n- The primary experiments are in scientific domains, yet the method does not enforce physical constraints; the physical consistency of the forecasts is therefore uncertain.\n- Experimental results should report mean ± standard deviation across multiple random seeds.\n- If possible, evaluating SGDD with different encoders and decoders would better demonstrate the method’s robustness and generality."}, "questions": {"value": "- I am a bit confused about the “spatial graph.” Each temporal graph $G_t$ already encodes the physical connections among particles.
