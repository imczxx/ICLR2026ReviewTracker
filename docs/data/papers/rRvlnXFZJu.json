While 3D unsupervised domain adaptation methods aim to address this issue, they still struggle with two key challenges: insufficient cross-domain feature alignment and ambiguous foreground-background decision boundaries. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Multi-Prototype Grouping Alignment framework that addresses these challenges. Our method automatically discovers and dynamically updates feature groups, enabling adaptively cross-domain feature alignment in a fine grained manner. Additionally, we develop two techniques to address the issue of ambiguous foreground-background decision boundaries: Noise Background Hybrid Augmentation that leverages labeled source instances to enhance adaptation in uncertain regions, and Noise Foreground Contrastive Learning that improves foreground-background discrimination by pushing low-confidence features away from prototypes. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain 3D detection benchmarks and the results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["domain adaptation", "3d object detection"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/01f659477cbd826e8571ca083195b180e98cdc57.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ca76ba2c3609bb7ec97eb9d0c2993fcfdb0a4a42.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a new framework for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in 3D object detection. \n\nThe proposed method, Adaptive Multi-Prototype Grouping Alignment, aims to address insufficient feature alignment and ambiguous foreground-background boundaries.
