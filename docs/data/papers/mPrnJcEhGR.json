For ATE estimation, we estimate the propensity score through direct bias-correction term estimation.

In ATE estimation, the bias-correction term $h_0(X_i, D_i) \\coloneqq \\frac{{1}[D_i = 1]}{e_0(X_i)} - \\frac{{1}[D_i = 0]}{1 - e_0(X_i)}$ plays an important role, where $e_0(X_i)$ is the propensity score, the probability of being assigned treatment $1$. In this study, we propose estimating $h_0$ (or equivalently $e_0$) by directly minimizing the prediction error for $h_0$ without knowing $h_0$ in advance.

Making such a case is important since, when Cauchy-Schwarz is applied to the von Mises expansion, the L2 distance between the estimated and true Riesz representer emerges naturally in an upper bound. Hence, clearly making the L2 distance small will also reduce the bias. A clear case would be needed to explain why some other Bregman divergence would be preferred.

Since $h_0$ is directly estimated, I am wondering if there are theoretical advantages that can be demonstrated?
