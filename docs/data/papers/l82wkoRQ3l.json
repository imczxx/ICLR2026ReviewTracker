To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a trimodal adaptation mechanism (\\textit{i.e.}, schema updation, schema evolution, and schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency.\nOur empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks, confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.\nThe source code of PISA and data of AggQA are available at \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PISA-421/}", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Agent Memory", "Memory System", "Knowledge Representation"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/622079a3fe9e7d2ca5fb08a817e5a6f3103f9fe3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new memory system designed to enhance AI agents in long-term conversational and data analysis tasks.

The memory is organized hierarchically into schemas containing meta (category), element (specific instance), element-value (attributes), and experience ID (linking to original conversation).

Concepts introduced in the \"Notation and Symbols\" table (line 220) are insufficiently explained in the main text and Figure 3, such as multiple elements belonging to the same schema.\n\n**Unclear attribution of contributions**: For the Retrieval Module (Section 2.4 and Figure 4), the distinction between components taken from Yao et al. (2023) and those newly introduced or adapted for PISA is not clearly delineated.\n\n**Ad-hoc design concerns**: Throughout the paper, extensive notation is introduced (Memory Pool, Buckets, Schema, Element, etc.) without clarifying whether these are created specifically for this work or inspired by existing literature. The categorization of queries in Section 2.4 appears constructed to target specific task types found in the evaluation datasets (e.g., Regional Fact Retrieval -> LOCOMO's single-hop, Multi-Fragment Reasoning -> LOCOMO's multi-hop and temporal, Aggregation -> LOCOMO's open domain and AggQA).\n\n**Evaluation metric inconsistencies**: Original publications of compared models (Section 3.2) for which LOCOMO evaluations exist consistently report F1 and BLEU scores, while this paper relies solely on LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Only Chhikara et al. (2025) reported LLM-as-a-Judge scores. Notably, relative LLM-as-a-judge scores between models show near-zero correlation with scores reported by Chhikara et al. (e.g., for open-domain: Chhikara reported Zep=77, A-mem=54; this paper reports Zep=39, A-mem=50; for multi-hop: Chhikara reported Zep=41, LangMem=48; this paper reports Zep=14, LangMem=32). This suggests the metric is unreliable or should be complemented by additional metrics such as F1 or BLEU.\n\n**Questionable importance of core mechanism**: Figure 5 demonstrates that changing $\\theta_{meta}$ from 0.85 to 0.95 causes substantial behavioral changes (shift from assimilation to schema creation in Figure 5b), yet evaluation scores remain relatively stable (Figure 5a). This suggests the schema/bucket organization may not be critical for task performance.\n\n**Missing computational efficiency analysis:** The authors never report computational performance metrics (e.g., inference time, memory consumption, number of LLM calls, retrieval latency) of PISA compared to baseline methods.\n\n**Incomplete experimental analysis**: The $\\theta_{meta}$ hyperparameter sweep is only performed on the LOCOMO dataset.

At that stage, a conflict analysis is also performed. Finally, the system contains a retrieval module, that can query the memory pool with different tools (RAG, SQL, calculator).\n\nThe system is evaluated on LOCOMO and AggQA.

While I agree with the authors, the experiments against the full context size are not convincing on this aspect: comparing Tab. 2 and Tab. 3 on the AggQA financial dataset, without the retrieval module (fair comparison with full context), the results show that PISA (without the retrieval module) is not doing better than full context.\n\n- Q.

Is it possible to compare in a fair way whether the proposed memory management is useful w.r.t. full context?\n\n## Other questions\n\n- Q. I don't understand clearly the initialization stage.
