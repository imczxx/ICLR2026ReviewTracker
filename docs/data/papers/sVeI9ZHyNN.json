Addressing the limitations of conventional multimodal models in processing massive web knowledge, this study develops an innovative attention-guided knowledge infusion framework through the construction of a structured knowledge-enhanced dataset. The proposed method achieves progressive transmission of web knowledge from coarse to fine granularity via a carefully designed prompt localization system and a hierarchically controlled masking mechanism. Specifically, structured prompt templates encode web knowledge into learnable semantic units, while dynamic attention editing governs the knowledge injection process, enabling the model to adaptively filter and integrate heterogeneous multi-source web knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only significantly improves the model's efficiency in capturing implicit web knowledge but also effectively mitigates knowledge conflicts and redundancy issues. Our work establishes a new technical paradigm for knowledge distillation and transfer in multimodal retrieval systems.", "tldr": "This paper introduces an attention-editing framework for Compositional Image Retrieval that efficiently integrates web-scale knowledge through structured prompting and dynamic masking.", "keywords": ["Multimodal Models", "Compositional Image Retrieval", "Attention Editing", "Web-Scale Retrieval", "Hierarchical Masking", "Prompt Localization"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5becf8fdc92f991941a0a4a93a7fc0bf4ed96e0c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces WebCIR, a new dataset for Compositional Image Retrieval (CIR) focused on internet culture semantics, generated through distillation from a large language model (GPT-40).

The model is trained on WebCIR, a dataset synthetically generated by GPT-40, and its strongest out-of-distribution performance is reported on the POKEMON benchmark , which was also synthetically generated by another large model (Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct). This evaluation is circular; it primarily shows that a model trained on LLM-generated data excels on other LLM-generated data, rather than proving robust generalization to real-world, human-generated web content.\n* Weak Performance on Human-Curated Benchmarks: The proposed method fails to demonstrate clear superiority on established, real-world datasets. On FASHIONIQ, the authors admit the performance is merely \"comparable,\" with their model even trailing a baseline (MCL) in the Recall@5 metric. This lack of a convincing win on a standard benchmark significantly undermines the claimed effectiveness and superiority of the framework.\n* Methodological Clarity: The proposed attention-editing mechanism is presented with a series of complex formulations (semantic gating, context enhancement, cross-unit suppression) that lack clear intuition and justification. It is difficult for the reader to understand why this specific, complex design is necessary or superior to simpler alternatives. The ablation study confirms its components are useful but does not sufficiently justify the design choices themselves."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

While leading in Recall@1, the model trails MCL significantly in Recall@5. The authors correctly identify this as a limitation, but the explanation (\"inherent ambiguity,\" \"subjective fashion semantics\") is somewhat hand-wavy. A deeper analysis of why their web-culture-focused approach doesn't translate as well to this domain is needed.\n\n- Computational Cost omission: The paper claims \"superior computational efficiency\" but provides no concrete data (e.g., FLOPs, training/inference time, parameter counts beyond the backbone) to support this claim. Compared to a 20B parameter model (GME), this is plausible, but a comparison of training costs and inference latency with the other baselines (Pic2Word, MCL) is missing.\n\n- Clarity on Knowledge infusion: The term \"knowledge infusion\" is used throughout, but the mechanism is primarily the curated WebCIR dataset and the attention-editing module. It's not entirely clear if any external knowledge base beyond the generated (image, text, modified text) triplets is being used. The process seems more like \"knowledge-aware training\" rather than dynamic infusion from an external source.\n\n- Ablation on Dataset Size: The ablation study shows that using the full Flickr-32k dataset is better than smaller subsets, but it does not include an ablation where the model is trained without the WebCIR data (i.e., only on standard data).

The data generation method is not clearly explained, either in the text or in Figures 1 and 2.\nThe CIR task involves extracting and modifying components within an image, but the data generation process seems to only refine textual descriptions.

Do you imply that merely focusing on textual data is sufficient for the model to learn \"culturally contextualized expressions\"?\nIf Section 2.2.2 involves processing the images, it is recommended to clarify this part further so that other researchers can quickly understand it.\n2. The authors claim that the proposed framework is designed to address dynamically evolving, culturally contextualized expressions in the CIR task. While the data-level design may account for the culturally contextualized expressions, it is not clear how the framework handles the dynamic adaptation aspect. Is there any mechanism or module specifically addressing the dynamic evolution of expressions over time or across contexts? This point requires further clarification and explanation.\n3. I wonder the reason why Section 2.3 is named \"INSTRUCTION-FOLLOWING PIPELINE\", as this part includes the explanation of model-level improvements. \n4. Since the stated goal of this paper is to address dynamically evolving, culturally contextualized expressions in the CIR task, the evaluation dataset should arguably place greater emphasis on benchmarks that capture internet-specific phenomena such as memes or other culturally dynamic content. Are such benchmarks currently available? If so, it is recommended that the evaluation focus more on these datasets, as they better reflect the real-world characteristics and challenges of culturally and temporally evolving visual-textual expressions."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "yAO1m4PkAL", "forum": "sVeI9ZHyNN", "replyto": "sVeI9ZHyNN", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12431/Reviewer_BWPg"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12431/Reviewer_BWPg"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12431/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761834094255, "cdate": 1761834094255, "tmdate": 1762923317960, "mdate": 1762923317960, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces WebCIR, which brings contemporary web-culture concepts (memes, slang, stylized aesthetics) into CIR.
