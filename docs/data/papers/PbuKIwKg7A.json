This dependence limits scalability, invites reward hacking, and produces brittle, hard-to-interpret behaviors that constrain the discovery of non-human—but potentially superior—reasoning strategies.\nWe introduce Atomos, a training-free framework that achieves reliable reasoning by composing absolutely controllable atomic steps verified by the same base model. \nThe core insight is that while generating complex solutions is hard, strong models can already solve and, more importantly, verify atomic subproblems with high accuracy. \nCrucially, verification is typically far cheaper than generation. \nAtomos leverages this asymmetry by wrapping each step in a low-overhead self-checking loop, where the same base model acts as its own verifier. \nThis transforms the challenge of global reliability to test-time compute scheduling.\nWe show that this reliability is governed by how compute is split between two fundamental axes: world sampling (exploring diverse reasoning paths) and path sampling (deepening the verification and retries within a single path). \nThis trade-off yields predictable isoperformance curves and a simple rule for optimally allocating a compute budget. \nOur theory further reveals that the cost to achieve a target level of correctness grows only linearly with problem complexity but polylogarithmically with the reliability requirement itself, making extreme reliability surprisingly affordable.\nEmpirically, using the Gemini-2.5-Pro model, Atomos can provide the correct answer and proof for IMO2025 P6 within 2 hour.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reasoning System", "LLM"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8922ac375ce1ba377db03328d398f9ecbd670758.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a hierarchical reasoning pipeline to let the LLM smarty allocate the computation in parallel sampling and step-level self-verification.

As a main contribution (line 861), the work proposes a compute law and scheduler: a rule that states how much compute to allocate to generating multiple pathways versus -per pathway.

Furthermore, the main contribution, the compute allocation laws, is not discussed within this problem instance. It is unclear what compute went into what phase and if suboptimal results were more likely to be achieved otherwise. I.e., the proposed 'laws' are not tested.\n\nDetailed proof of IMO P6 in appendix is unclear. It starts with \"Input:\", which then seems to include not only the problem statement but also a problem analysis, case analysis, induction and derivation, ... final conclusion; and it ends with \"Now you start thinking about how to prove the conclusion\". So it appears that the LLM receives much more than simply the problem statement. Furthermore, there appears to be user interaction as opposed to autonomous reasoning? Related, how do we come up with `` use at least **10** methods, and give **100** solutions to the subpath nodes'' (line 1372-1374)?\n\n**presentation**\n\nThe presentation is very pompous. E.g., \"trinity of systemic flaws\", \"genesis of hallucinations\", \"systematically dismantles the sources of unreliability\", \"operational proxy\", \"profound insight into the economics of reliability\", \"from a probabilistic gamble to a predictable science of compute allocation\".\n\nThe presentation is overly verbose and the space could be used for a more thorough explanation of the contribution. E.g., section 2.1, could easily be summarized in 3 sentences; Eq 1 and 2 are unnecessary and obvious. Sect 2.2 and 2.4 could similarly be summarized. The practical usefulness of Eq 3 is not clear to me, since the \"model-specific cognitive threshold\" A_max is unquantiable and unknown. I would also guess that such a threshold should depend on the topic, etc., and would not be a single value for the entire model. In contrast, a more detailed related work section is moved into the appendix instead of the main text.\n\nIt is unclear how to deal with a dependency between the results of units (line 881). E.g., the formula hypothesis of one atomic unit that is used in the next. How did it get to this hypothesis formula without actually executing the first atomic unit before planning the remainder. The related work states that the Tree and graph-structured prompting approaches are brittle to cascading errors in serial generation, but when there are dependencies Atomos has the same problem? In case there is no dependence between the units, as in they are really atomic, then the approach becomes equivalent to verification after chain generation?\n\nSeveral times symbols are used without explicitly defining them. For example, line 107 C_p^* and C_w^*, line 264 c_{ver}, c_{gen}. the reader must induce this from the rest of the text. Also, if symbols are not used elsewhere it may not be necessary to introduce them (i.e., epsilon on line 301 is not used afterwards).\n\n**novelty**\n\nThe compute laws and scheduler are stated to be the main contribution (line 861).\n\nThe first law deals with an optimal time allocation for budget C between exploring more chains (C_w) and improving their reliability (C_p). The law states that the optimal allocation is given by $C_p = \\alpha C$; $C_w = (1-\\alpha) C$. This is unclear to me. It seems that $\\alpha$ is either defined as the optimal fraction already, in which the case law is obviously following from that definition and is not useful, or $\\alpha$ has a different meaning in which case how to obtain the law is insufficiently explained.\n\nThe second law I could not verify, it skips to the conclusion too fast. It starts with $\\delta$, that is defined as global budget, such that $\\delta/N_s$ is the budget you have per step to ensure no failure. This is then repurposed as a probability \"with a global failure probability not exceeding $\\delta$\", and also becomes a reliability requirement \"the reliability requirement $1/\\delta$."}, "questions": {"value": "## Questions\n\nHow are results of each world combined (line 895)?\n\nLine 398 mentions a reasoning graph. From previous text I concluded a set of separate pathways (chains)) that are never merged into a more general tree/DAG, is that correct?\n\n\"Complex problems can be decomposed into verifiable atomic units whose unitary difficulty stays within the model's reliable operating regime\". [...] \"This enforced decomposition guarantees that the model is never asked to perform a cognitive jump it cannot reliably make.\" How does Atomos guarantee that this is indeed the case, since it knows neither A_max, nor C_u(s_i)?\n\nTable 3 assigns a Conceptual Leap as the cause of the baseline's failure. However, a conceptual leap relates to a model's cognitive threshold. It is unclear to me why we are allowed to conclude a conceptual leap from a single failed execution.\n\nTable 3 shows Atomos Trajectory. The Plan already contained a hypothesis formula. How is this possible without first solving previous tasks?\n\n\n## Remarks\n\nI assume the LLM is used as the verifier; this seems not to be mentioned explicitly except for in the appendix (line 854).\n\nThe critique generated by the verification step is not used in the next generation step (line 901, 904).\n\nIn the abstract, what exactly is \"extreme reliability\" as opposed to just reliability?\n\nFigure 2 caption mentions a,b,c but there are no a,b,c in the figure.\n\nWhy 'laws' instead of 'theorems'?\n\n\n\nTypos:\n* \"stepsan\"\n* \"goal-seekingthat\n* \"flawsbrittle\"\n* \"atomic\"meaning\n* \"authorityclear\"\n* \"** Self-Checking Loop: **\""}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 0}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "UTzFA5jfW0", "forum": "PbuKIwKg7A", "replyto": "PbuKIwKg7A", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission498/Reviewer_swQb"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission498/Reviewer_swQb"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission498/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761817624678, "cdate": 1761817624678, "tmdate": 1762915531861, "mdate": 1762915531861, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the critical problem of unreliability in large language model (LLM) reasoning, which suffers from cascading errors in multi-step tasks and a bias towards probabilistic, \"hasty\" shortcuts.

However, as the authors admit in the \"Limitations\" section, this planning phase is itself not verified. This is a critical weakness, as it suggests Atomos may simply push the \"brittle chain\" problem up one level, from execution to planning. A flawed plan, even if executed with perfect reliability, will lead to a wrong answer.\n\nUninterrogated Verifier Accuracy: The framework is built on the assumption that the base model is a reliable verifier for atomic steps.
