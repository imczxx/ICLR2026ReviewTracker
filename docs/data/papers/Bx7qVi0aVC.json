However, their asynchronous and sparse data format poses a significant challenge for conventional deep learning methods. Existing solutions to this incompatibility often sacrifice temporal resolution, require extensive pre-processing, and do not fully leverage GPU acceleration. Inspired by word-to-vector models, we draw an analogy between words and events to introduce event2vec, a novel representation that allows neural networks to process events directly. This approach is fully compatible with the parallel processing and self-supervised learning capabilities of Transformer architectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of event2vec on the DVS Gesture, ASL-DVS, and DVS-Lip benchmarks. A comprehensive ablation study further analyzes our method's features and contrasts them with existing representations. The experimental results show that event2vec is remarkably parameter-efficient, has high throughput, and can achieve high accuracy even with an extremely low number of events. Beyond its performance, the most significant contribution of event2vec is a new paradigm that enables neural networks to process event streams as if they were natural language. This paradigm shift paves the way for the native integration of event cameras with large language models and multimodal models.

We also compare the training costs and find that our method only uses 41% of the memory consumption and 6.3% of the GPU training time of their method.\n\n# Fair comparison with data augmentation\n\nTransformers (including linear attention) lack inductive bias and thus require more data for learning. We used data augmentation methods to expand the data volume to a certain extent, thereby improving performance. Specifically, we did not use data augmentation on the ASL-DVS dataset because we found that SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance could be achieved without it—this is likely due to the sufficient scale of this dataset: the number of samples in its training set is approximately 80,640, while that of DVS Gesture is 1,176, and DVS Lip is 14,896.\n\nWe clearly provide all the details of data augmentation, as well as complete code, hyperparameter configuration files, and training logs to facilitate readers' reproduction. Most of the previous studies also used data augmentation. Since we have not proposed a plug-and-play module, such as a new network layer or learning algorithm, but rather a brand-new framework, we believe it is reasonable to use data augmentation and compare it with existing SOTA (State-of-the-Art) studies.\n\nThe following Table R2 are the data augmentation methods used in the articles in Table 1\\.

Otherwise the reader will need to infer things themselves, as I had to. There are still some questions at large.  \n\nUltimately what matters is single-stream latency, as in the wild a camera won't be processing 1000 sequences at once when live, but just one. From that perspective, due to the transformer's bulk and large input context, I see that the authors' approach is actually slower than others except the FARSE-CNN approach. This significantly changes the narrative. The parameter efficiency is not useful if the actual deployment latencies are larger than other approaches, while the performance being worse (e.g. SNN+ Frame exhibits almost half latency while being more accurate on DVS-Gesture). Also, it is not clear if the single-stream latency also includes the pre-processing of those events within the stream. Even if it does not, I note that the results in Table 2 essentially suggest that the pre-processing time for the first four approaches are negligible, as these are \"total\" times across 1000+ total samples, which significantly reduces the pre-processing time per-sample. \n\nI think the temporal embedding here is a bit of an issue. I feel the authors' tried a bunch of encodings (which is demonstrated in Tab. 4) and the narrative seems to have been shaped around what empirically worked. I was not convinced by 3.3, as it seemed that due to the fact that time can be open-ended (and thus the risk of \"out-of-distribution\") to ensure it is not, the authors picked some range limiting approaches and went with what worked best. Their final choice also does not align well with the original NLP based motivation (lines 71-92). In the transformer context a \"position encoding\" is usually given to the information corresponding to a input's position, and usually uses sin/cosine embeddings or even learnable ones. So the natural choice for PEs in this context would also be sin and cosine (as the authors have indeed explored). Lines 71-92 motivates either a direct normalized map of times or a function imposed on them (sin/cosine). However, the authors go with a function of the time difference of consecutive events, and for me the motivation for this is lacking. Firstly, having worked in this space, I'm aware of the quite random nature of the arrival of events, and I'm not sure how interpretable or sensible the consecutive temporal difference of two events would be, as the events themselves could come from very different parts of the input. I suppose what is happening is that in such datasets (like DVS-Gesture), the temporal difference embedding is essentially just capturing the rate at which the events are happening, which causally links to the current \"speed\" of the motion. Faster motion will simply yield (on average) lower $\\Delta t$ and vice-versa. That to me makes sense more than what the authors' outline in 3.3, which is temporal shift invariance and the role of convolutions. I also do not see the actual utility of using a convolutional encoder, as the authors seem to be working with a single $\\Delta t$ input to the conv-encoder in Figure 2 anyway (please correct me if I'm wrong). Either way, I don't see the proper motivation behind using a convolutional encoder versus any other from the authors' motivations. The only way it makes sense to me is perhaps from the fact that conv architectures are more parameter efficient. The design choices in Figure 2 appear somewhat ad-hoc as well. \n\n\nFollowing up on the previous point, this leads to one of the core issues for me in this work. The authors' main motivation is to avoid dense event-to-frame representations which can lead to \"degradation or complete loss of high temporal resolution\" (line 124). However, given the relatively noisy nature of these cameras in capturing the events, and given the random nature of the consecutive temporal event differences other than just giving a rough indication of the degree of motion overall in the scene, it is not clear to me how the framework resolves the aforementioned issues without creating these new ones. Excessive dependence on temporal information with event-based cameras can be counter-productive, and that is why framing/aggregating has happened in the first place with most works in literature. Lastly, I note that even in this work, where not sacrificing temporal information is key, the authors inevitably end up using an aggregation approach. The motivation is cited as maintaining the fixed context length L, but I believe aggregation also yields the necessary invariance to noisy local temporal information. The clustering approach mentioned here essentially does that, while the random sampling approach seems to lose information as it is subsampling the events. \n\n\nI note that the authors indeed follow a very rigorous data augmentation procedure for all datasets, however, I don't see any references for the set of augmentations used, so it is not clear whether accuracy wise all the quoted methods are being compared on equal grounds, as data augmentation can significantly enhance accuracy. \n\n\nI feel the experiments would benefit from more baselines, as DVS-Gesture is one of the oldest datasets and there are many approaches out there. A survey from 2023 outlines higher sota accuracy (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10298106) than the methods discussed in the paper."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "qAvLPErQew", "forum": "Bx7qVi0aVC", "replyto": "Bx7qVi0aVC", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5167/Reviewer_4MEw"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5167/Reviewer_4MEw"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5167/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761982764935, "cdate": 1761982764935, "tmdate": 1762917923210, "mdate": 1762917923210, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
