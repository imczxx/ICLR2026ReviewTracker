Existing efforts have achieved impressive performance in imitating a wide span of general motions. However, most existing efforts could still suffer from unnatural movements due to the lack of biomechanical and physiological priors. Given this, we project our sights to advances in behavioral energetics, which demonstrate how energy use shapes human movements. In contrast, current character controllers typically assume the character is equipped with infinite energy over time. Inspired by these, we propose to adopt fatigue as a proxy of the finite energy limit, inject it into general character animation, and thoroughly investigate how fatigue introduces new characteristics to physics-based character control. Leveraging the Three-Compartment Controller (3CC) model, we managed to obtain a policy for general motion imitation under different fatigue statuses. Furthermore, extensive analyses are conducted to demonstrate how fatigue could influence the naturalness, scalability, and robustness of character animation. Our code would be made public.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Character Control", "Fatigue", "Character Animation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e6f515cfcbc4cda7017c32267ccdfc8c1967bb56.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/1862f176ec7ef69fc20f1ae4f99241c1a8bc5622.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Tired Actor, a fatigue-informed and enery-aware character controller that incorporates human-like fatigue machenism into physics-based motion imitation.

While it introduces some interesting, human-like fatigue behaviors, it remains questionable whether such a precise fatigue mechanism is actually necessary. 1) From the animation perspective, Tired Actor sacrifices global tracking performance for subtle local fatigue effects. Even in out-of-domain cases, it performs worse than PHC. The qualitative results in Fig. 1 (e.g., the jump and nearly immobile left leg) do not convincingly suggest more natural motion. 2) From energy efficiency perspective: In robotics and control, energy efficiency is usually improved through simple regularizations such as penalizing torque or action rate (He et al., 2025a) a. The proposed fatigue modeling does not demonstrate a better trade-off between tracking accuracy and energy consumption or the adaptive behavior among different motion tracking. Since human muscle fatigue mechanisms differ greatly from robots, it is unclear why a human-like fatigue model should be applied here without clear evidence of efficiency or performance benefits.\n\n2. The experimental validation of the proposed methods is still insufficient. First, the paper lacks comparisons with simple baselines, such as directly limiting joint outputs to 20% of maximum or adding a soft penalty, so the claimed benefits of Tired Actor are not clearly demonstrated. Additionally, a clear curve showing the evolution of MF during motion play would better illustrate how Tired Actor actually works. Second, the effectiveness of the reweighted fatigue initialization is not convincingly shown, as there is no direct comparison with uniform initialization to support its contribution. Third, the authors claim that the resulting motion is more natural, but there is no objective comparison such as a user study, it is actually difficult to convince others. \n\n3. Others related to analysis in experiments part: 1) The dependence on data size raises questions. If the fatigue mechanism indeed introduces distributional variety, it is unclear why Tired Actor generalizes poorly on small-scale data while performing better in-domain. 2) Additionally, the part-wise analysis, although showing some human-like behaviors, does not seem inherently related to the fatigue mechanism—for example, left-right asymmetry could likely emerge from a simple asymmetric torque penalty."}, "questions": {"value": "1. I am quite curious about the failure cases of PHC and the baseline. Specifically, in which types of motions does the Tired Actor achieve a higher success rate? Understanding this could help clarify why Tired Actor exhibits better generalization.\n\n2. I am not sure if I understand correctly, but if the Tired Actor performs poorly in global tracking, why is its pelvis tracking performance better than the baseline?\n\n3. The performance still seems sensitive to MF initialization. I wonder whether different motions exhibit different sensitivities—for example, jumping may rely more on leg control, while dancing may require more active arm movements. If a single MF initialization cannot work well across all motions, how should the method handle training on a large dataset containing diverse and challenging motions?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "sSIf1sQi0k", "forum": "45QfLCLBS6", "replyto": "45QfLCLBS6", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7467/Reviewer_ZZH3"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7467/Reviewer_ZZH3"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7467/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761395752311, "cdate": 1761395752311, "tmdate": 1762919582609, "mdate": 1762919582609, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the unnatural motion issue in physics-based character control caused by the lack of biomechanical and physiological priors.
