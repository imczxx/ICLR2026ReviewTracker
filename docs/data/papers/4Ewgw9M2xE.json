While recent advancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and training data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the effectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how to activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling. Specifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL task. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such as Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even collapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this issue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods. These refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior performance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from diverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the StableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance on multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Compared to previous SOTA models, R1-Reward achieves a 8.4% improvement on the VL Reward-Bench and a 14.3% improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench. Moreover, with more inference compute, R1-Reward's performance is further enhanced, highlighting the potential of RL algorithms in optimizing MRMs.", "tldr": "This paper introduces StableReinforce, a novel RL algorithm designed to stably and effectively train Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs), leading to the R1-Reward model which significantly outperforms previous SOTA models on key benchmarks.", "keywords": ["Multimodal Large Language Model", "Multimodal Reward Model", "Stable Reinforcement Learning", "Long-CoT Reasoning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/24bae1071a5548e0dc9e3a20b18ee6754df3a518.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces R1-Reward, a multimodal reward model trained using a novel StableReinforce algorithm that reformulates reward modeling as a rule-based reinforcement learning task.

While the paper claims novelty in applying RL to multimodal reward modeling, it lacks adequate justification for why RL is specifically beneficial for MRMs, since there have been several works (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02387) in text-based RL reward modeling. The paper does not clearly articulate what unique challenges multimodal data presents that necessitate the proposed RL approach, nor does it sufficiently differentiate itself from existing generative MRM methods (like MM-RLHF-Reward).\n2. The paper's main technical contributions appear to address numerical stability. However, they seem unnecessary in comparison to commonly used GRPO. (1) The claimed (log_probs - old_log_probs).exp() overflow issue is commonly handled with clipping in most RL implementations and rarely occurs. (2) Extreme advantage values after normalization are less problematic in GRPO with reasonable rollout numbers. (3) GRPO has default clipping strategies.
