Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6 models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at 0.25° resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble high-resolution climate projections.

The model is then applied to a transfer learning task, where it is trained on ERA5 (0.25°) conditionally on a down-sampled resolution of 1.5° and used to downscale samples from expensive general circulation models (GCMs), natively at resolutions ranging from 1.4° to 2.5°.\n\n### Contributions\nThe contributions of this paper are limited. Many multi-resolution diffusion and flow matching models are present in the literature, but many of them (e.g. [1,2], the closely related cascaded diffusion models [3], and many others) are not even the cited. The few that are [4,5,6] are only cited *en passant*, and are not properly discussed or used as baselines in the experiments. This makes it very hard to decipher what is novel about the proposed Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling model, beyond the fact that it is a multi-resolution diffusion model applied to a downscaling task. \n\n\n[1] Gu et al.
