These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, de Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields small sampling error in Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive.\nIn this paper, we prove that a *polynomially small stepsize* suffices to guarantee small sampling error in total variation distance, without any assumption on the smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold. The main ingredients in our proof are Li-Yau estimate for log-gradient of heat kernel, and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion for perturbed heat equation.

While the paper gives a theoretical guarantee for the Riemannian diffusion model, the empirical results from De Bortoli et al already validated that it worked in diverse settings.

This framework, known as the Riemannian Score-Based Generative Model (RSGM), is motivated by the observation that many datasets, such as those arising in climate science and high-energy physics, naturally lie on Riemannian-like manifolds. De Bortoli et al. demonstrated that, in such settings, performing diffusion directly on the underlying manifold can substantially improve generative performance. However, their approach suffered from a severe limitation: achieving a small divergence between the model and target distributions required an exponentially small discretization step size, leading to prohibitive computational costs. The current paper overcomes this issue by proving that, under mild assumptions on the manifold structure, one can instead use a polynomially small step size to achieve comparable accuracy. This result dramatically improves the practical feasibility of RSGMs and paves the way for their broader application in real-world generative modeling tasks."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The work has several notable strengths:\n\n1.

On the other hand, one might think that the total absence of experimental validation could appear as a weakness of the work. De Bortoli et al. (2022) compare RSGM with other manifold-based diffusive routines on manifold supported datasets, like climate science spherical data. They quantify the quality of the performance in terms of the log-likelihood achieved by the model. I was wondering whether the authors of the current paper ever evaluated the idea of running similar experiments with both RSGM and other procedures (e.g. Mixture of Kent, Moser Flow etc.) and show that RSGM can reach a comparable degree of the performance still employing a polynomial number of steps. Such scaling could be analyzed as a function of relevant control parameters, including manifold size and early stopping time. Another possible, and possibly equivalent, experiment would instead imply verifying that Riemann supported real datasets verify the assumptions of the current analysis.  \n\nIn addition to addressing the questions outlined in the following section of this review, I would appreciate if the authors could argue around this point more in detail."}, "questions": {"value": "I will now proceed to ask questions and raise issues that I would like the authors to address in order to both finalize my personal judgment over the paper and improve the manuscript. \n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Why do I re-start from the uniform distribution if the diffusion step from $Y_k$ exits the injective radius ? What happens if one restarts from $Y_k$ and samples new noise? How often would the reset take place in practical applications? \n2. In the continuous-time variance-exploding prescription, a common choice for the prior distribution in backward diffusion is a wide Gaussian distribution, with zero mean and variance equal to the horizon $T$. Are there other prior distributions, alternative to the uniform one, that can reduce the initialization error? Can Urakawa (2006) be generalized to other initializations?\n3.

(2025) \"Diffusion Models Learn Low-Dimensional Distributions via Subspace Clustering\", Stanczuck et al. (2024) \"Diffusion Models Encode the Intrinsic Dimension of Data Manifolds\" show that, when data are supported by a low-dimensional manifold, the geometry of this manifold  progressively emerges in the backward diffusion in the Euclidean space, without the need of constraining the trajectory on the manifold itself. I would ask to the authors whether it would be possible to study the time dependence (that I guess translates into studying the $\\delta$ dependence) of the TV and see whether its upper bound becomes tighter at smaller times, when the geometry of the target manifold already emerges even when diffusing in the Euclidean space. \n\n**Readability issues:**\n\n1.

Both in [306-307] and the very beginning in [088] the authors may introduce a bit better the role of the error constant 𝜀, as a quantity employed to tune the horizon time $T$ and from that the discretization stepsize. \n5.
