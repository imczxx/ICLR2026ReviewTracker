However, they often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a \"lost in the middle\" phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context. To validate the practical utility of our approach, we conduct experiments on two online benchmarks for GUI task. Our best results demonstrate an average success rate improvement of 14.53% across the two benchmarks, a significant outperformance of the 8.56% gain achieved by the standard PRM baseline.", "tldr": "We introduce GUI-PRA, a training-free judge agent that resolves key failure modes in GUI task supervision, through the lens of dynamic memory and adaptive UI perception.", "keywords": ["GUI Agent; Judge Agent; MLLM; Task Automation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9391fb890175f5f3d1b327b894b3f5ca43ca99b6.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/243974fbc05e3c8c63d2a13432ca9066248b2f63.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors want to improve the GUI agent in a training-free process, thus proposed GUI-PRA, a multi-step process that first uses a judge agent that guides the reward better, and deploys a visual verification module for \"perceive-reson-verify\" on UI actions, and finally create a selection mechanism to enhance the results.

For example, GUI-Rise: Structured Reasoning and History Summarization for GUI Navigation (Liu et al.) also introduces a dedicated “history summarization” subtask. Thus, the novelty lies more in applying such summarization within a PRM context rather than in the idea itself. Outside of GUI there are lot of papers that do the sumarization to handle long context. Summarise earlier interaction chains (ReAct style) to fetch relevant history on PRA for GUI is very incremental in terms of novelty. \n\n2. Allowing the model to select between “coarse” and “fine” visual tools resembles prior multi-granularity perception designs (e.g., Read Anywhere Pointed, Attention-Driven GUI Grounding). The contribution appears to be a selection mechanism over pre-existing tools, rather than a fundamentally new perception module. Again this means the conceptual jump is small. Unless I missed a key point, I think the proposed pipeline overall lacks novelty.\n\n3. The benchmarking is limited to two datasets (AndroidWorld and MobileMiniWoB++). Several popular and relevant long-horizon benchmarks—such as WebArena, Mind2Web, OS-World, and WorkArena—are omitted, despite being directly adaptable to the proposed setting.\nThe ablations are also not exhaustive, and many strong baselines and concurrent works are missing from comparison (e.g., Aria-UI, Autonomous Evaluation and Refinement of Digital Agents, GUI-LLM). Even excluding the arxiv ones, there is prior work like 'Autonomous Evaluation and Refinement of Digital Agents' to be adapted to and compared with proposed method. They study different evaluators and improve the performance of existing agents via fine-tuning and inference-time guidance. \nNot a reason for lower rating but the quantitative improvements reported (e.g., Table 2) are relatively small and not always consistent across datasets or settings. The results appear as early evidence rather than conclusive validation.\n\n\n4.
