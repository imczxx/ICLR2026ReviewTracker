However, the lack of abundant annotated data in certain domains often necessitates training models on synthetic data, which frequently fail to generalize to real-world scenarios due to significant domain shifts. To address this challenge, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques offer a promising solution by enabling models to leverage labeled synthetic data while adapting effectively to unlabeled real-world data. Many approaches rely solely on self-supervision in the target domain, which has inherent limitations, and some perform only global feature alignment, potentially aligning semantically irrelevant features while neglecting task-specific cues critical for accurate adaptation. This paper introduces CAPLR, a unified keypoint-based UDA framework for 6-DoF object pose estimation that bridges the synthetic to real domain gap through contrastive alignment and pseudo-label refinement. CAPLR comprises three key components: (1) Cross-Domain Pairing to enable structured knowledge transfer by identifying corresponding image pairs across domains; (2) Contrastive Alignment to perform patch-level feature alignment at both intermediate backbone and task-specific head layers; and (3) Consistency-Based Pseudo-Label Refinement to improve reliability by encouraging stable predictions across augmented views of the same image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAPLR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple well-known 6-DoF pose estimation benchmarks featuring diverse and challenging scenarios.", "tldr": "A unified keypoint-based UDA framework for 6-DoF object pose estimation that bridges the synthetic-to-real domain gap via Contrastive Alignment and Pseudo-Label Refinement.", "keywords": ["6DoF pose estimation", "keypoint regression", "unsupervised domain adaptation", "contrastive learning"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d563051933dbb2bb7961ab5cb779789ac1d2e78d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes CAPLR, a keypoint-based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework for 6-DoF pose estimation.

In particular, the discussion of self-supervised learning is too general, using broad statements such as “Many approaches rely solely on self-supervision in the target domain, which has inherent limitations” and “However, these methods are limited when the domain gap is large,” without providing concrete analysis. Consequently, the advantages of the proposed method over these limitations are not clearly highlighted in these sections.\n- For cross-domain pairing, I have the following concerns:\n    - I am concerned about the robustness of the confidence-weighted embeddings. In keypoint regression, the features of different keypoints are expected to remain distinguishable; however, this design relies on the consistency of both keypoint features and confidence scores across domains. The results in Table 5 do not provide ablation studies to assess this, for example, comparisons with simple average pooling over keypoint features or using masked foreground features. Considering the widespread use of DINOv2 features for template matching in pose estimation, would it be more robust to instead use the CLS tokens from DINOv2?\n    - In Table 5, the results based solely on pose prediction outperform those using feature-based selection. Why not reverse the order of the two steps, i.e., perform pose-prediction-based selection first, followed by feature-based selection?\n    - Each target image is paired with an optimal source image. Is there a filtering strategy to avoid highly mismatched pairs?\n- For pseudo label refinement,  I have the following concerns:\n    - What are the augmentations used?\n    - Since $L_{task}$ in Eq. (10) is not used at this stage, i.e., no ground-truth supervision is applied, how is it ensured that training progresses in the correct direction rather than falling into shortcuts? Could you provide the performance on the test or validation sets across training epochs? \n- For the results in Tables 1 and 2, it is recommended to provide the lower and upper bound performance of CAPLR, i.e., using only S and using S+R, to better illustrate the gains attributable to the UDA method rather than the baseline model."}, "questions": {"value": "- For the source domain, why are the predicted poses and keypoints used in cross-domain pairing and contrastive alignment instead of the ground-truth annotations?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "fhrLu4fgR1", "forum": "jfI5iWylNf", "replyto": "jfI5iWylNf", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7392/Reviewer_Givv"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7392/Reviewer_Givv"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7392/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762161491762, "cdate": 1762161491762, "tmdate": 1762919514412, "mdate": 1762919514412, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
