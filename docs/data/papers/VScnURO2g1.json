In this work we design an Adaptive Physics-Informed Latent Network (APILaNet) that learns a latent field and enforces conservation of physics law in the weak form using a learned, normalized space--time measure. Normalization makes physics enforcement insensitive to quadrature resolution and concentrates it on transient violations. A monotone, Lipschitz measurement layer maps latent variables to observed targets, improving identifiability from a single sensor. An adaptive, bounded scheduler scales the physics and smoothness loss terms with meaningful representations, emphasizing conservation of physics laws during events while preserving training stability. Learning a space-time measure for weak-form enforcement, combined with a monotone mapping and adaptive scheduling, enables accurate, data-efficient single-sensor forecasting in physics-governed systems. We evaluate APILaNet through a hydrological case study, APILaNet outperforms strong sequence baselines and reduces MSE during extreme events, while improving Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency.

The monotone mapping between discharge and stage is a sensible touch: it mirrors how water levels in rivers actually rise with flow instead of letting the network invent unrealistic relationships.

The theoretical component, particularly the “learned measure” weak form, seems to build on established weak PINN concepts with limited conceptual advancement.
