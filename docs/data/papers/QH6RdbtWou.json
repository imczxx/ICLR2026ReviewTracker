Conventional LP design relies on large-scale radiation-hydrodynamic simulations coupled with manual iterative refinement, resulting in high computational cost and limited scalability. Recent advances in generative modeling provide an alternative pathway for data-driven inverse design. In this work, we present the first systematic comparison of generative paradigms for LP design. To enforce physical plausibility, we introduce domain-specific loss formulations. Our results constitute the first principled comparison of generative methods for LP design in inertial confinement fusion, providing guidance for the development of scalable, physics-constrained design frameworks for fusion energy applications.", "tldr": "GenICF presents a systematic benchmark of generative AI methods for designing laser pulse shapes in inertial confinement fusion, comparing data-driven approaches with physics constraints against costly traditional simulation-based design methods.", "keywords": ["ICF", "Fusion", "Inverse Modeling", "Generative models", "Benchmarking", "Laser Pulse"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7f112e0fc733809f3699897878ecce9bc3e344e8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors present a systematic comparison of various generative models, ranging from traditional (e.g., LSTM) to state-of-the-art (e.g., Transformer-based, Diffusion Models), to address the challenge of designing laser pulse shapes (LPs) for Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF).

A qualitative discussion of method trade-offs would strengthen the work.\n\n3. The experimental setup, including the 1 million-example dataset (DF) and test set (DFtest), is outlined, but critical details, such as data distribution, model selection criteria (e.g., why Tabsyn or VLD were chosen), and training specifics (e.g., hyperparameter tuning), are insufficiently explained in the provided pages, potentially impacting reproducibility.\n\n4. The paper focuses heavily on empirical evaluation and practical contributions (e.g., loss formulations), but it offers limited theoretical insights, such as convergence properties or optimality conditions.
