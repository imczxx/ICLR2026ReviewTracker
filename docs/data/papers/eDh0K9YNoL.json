While effective at balancing computational efficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which ultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose OneSearch, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative framework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three innovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE) module, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes while maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view user behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user IDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences to model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward System (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive reward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive offline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's superior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The online A/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure position, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\\% item CTR, +2.40\\% buyer, and +3.22\\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces operational expenditure by 75.40\\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from 3.26\\% to 27.32\\%.

The RM seems like a traditional ranking module, which seems the most critical part to the online AB test improvements shown in Table 4. If OneSearch still needs a \"three-tower SIM\" as the reward model to rerank the list, it is not fully \"end-to-end\". The proposed model is actually recall+pre-ranking?\n2. Why the results in Table 2 uses HR@350 for both online MCA and w/o ranking? 350 seems like a length for testing pre-ranking or recall, not very suitable for the ranking model. Considering the proposed OneSearch (w/ RM reranking) is essentially recall+pre-ranking, its performance on HR@350 is not as good as \"w/o ranking\". \n3. In section 3.4, the paper claims to reduce the OPEX for 24.6%. How is it calculated? Because OneSearch with RM reranking still use a traditional ranking model with the recall&pre-ranking part replaced by Transformer structure, it is still a multi-stage complex system."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "SLBbP9y0n1", "forum": "eDh0K9YNoL", "replyto": "eDh0K9YNoL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8967/Reviewer_kUbD"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8967/Reviewer_kUbD"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8967/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761297010664, "cdate": 1761297010664, "tmdate": 1762920701851, "mdate": 1762920701851, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces OneSearch, an end-to-end generative framework designed to replace traditional multi-stage architecture in e-commerce search.

It additionally reads like a system report rather than a research paper a lot of the time, making it difficult to assess its scientific novelty and contribution. In particular,\n\n- The paper's clarity of writing could be greatly improved. In parts, the text is dense and convoluted, making it difficult to follow. There are several abbreviations that are used without proper introduction, forcing the reader to look up their definitions elsewhere and preventing the paper from being a stand-alone text. Since the paper proposes a pretty complex and intricate architecture, these shortcomings impact its readability and, to some extent, obscure its actual contributions.\n- The proposed OneSearch method consists of a lot of components, and the paper does not always clarify which of these are novel contributions, and which are taken from previous work. These omissions cause the method section to partially read like a system report rather than a research paper.\n- Some key methodological details are missing. For example, the loss functions in Section 2.1 are not self-contained. Terms like the \"hard sample relevance correction loss\" are introduced without any definition. While many of the non-explained terms are standard in retrieval systems, these omissions and the resulting ambiguity make it difficult to fully understand and appreciate the proposed method.\n- The experimental evaluation lacks transparency. The dataset is described only as \"TEST,\" which is not informative. The baseline, \"onlineMCA,\" is a proprietary system, making it impossible to judge whether the reported gains are due to the novelty of OneSearch or simply differences in engineering and feature tuning. The paper sometimes states that OneSearch improves metrics by a certain percentage without clearly stating what it's being compared against in that specific context.\n- Figures 2 and 3 are very large and cause physical lag on some PDF readers.

Which of the design choices of the method are specific to the chosen platform, and which would be expected to translate to other settings?\n- The experiment section is based on the comparison to and relative improvement over the \"onlineMCA\" baseline.
