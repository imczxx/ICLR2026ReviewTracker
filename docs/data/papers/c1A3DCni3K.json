While sequence models have advanced per-unit temporal prediction, capturing cross-sectional effects often still relies on hand-crafted summary features. We propose Set-Sequence, a model that learns cross-sectional structure directly, enhancing expressivity and eliminating manual feature engineering. At each time step, a permutation-invariant Set module summarizes the unit set; a Sequence module then models each unit’s dynamics conditioned on both its features and the learned summary. The architecture accommodates unaligned series, supports varying numbers of units at inference, integrates with standard sequence backbones (e.g., Transformers), and scales linearly in cross-sectional size. Across a synthetic contagion task and two large-scale real-world applications—equity portfolio optimization and loan risk prediction—Set-Sequence significantly outperforms strong baselines, delivering higher Sharpe ratios, improved AUCs, and interpretable cross-sectional summaries.", "tldr": "When numerous time series are exchangeable, the Set-Sequence model efficiently captures cross-sectional dependencies", "keywords": ["Set modeling", "Sequence modeling", "High-dimensional time series", "Cross-sectional dependencies", "Interpretable AI", "Synthetic data", "Mortgage risk prediction", "Exchangeability", "Time series prediction", "Financial AI", "Deep learning"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/af39a1344d262612bd1bf64c15a33dbcc3a7f6ea.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/325e76334150d1a8a8e96c235d088931acd8c9ae.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Set-Sequence, a model for large-scale time series prediction.

If each entity were viewed as a “variable,” the proposed Set-Sequence formulation would resemble feature aggregation rather than feature selection. However, the paper does not clarify this distinction nor position its contribution relative to multivariate temporal modeling, leaving its conceptual novelty somewhat ambiguous.\n\n2) While the paper motivates itself by the need to capture cross-entity interactions, it does not explicitly model pairwise or structured dependencies as in graph or attention-based methods. Instead, it addresses a different, more specific challenge: efficiently summarizing population-level context under exchangeability when the number of entities is extremely large. This makes the contribution one of scalability and global aggregation, rather than relational modeling in the strict sense.\n\n3) The dataset includes only the top 500 market-cap equities per period and excludes missing returns, which may introduce survivorship or selection bias. It is recommended to include a less-filtered baseline (e.g., fixed universe or delisted stocks) and year-by-year sensitivity analyses to ensure robustness.\n\n4)  The model assumes exchangeability and uses pooled moments, which may fail under strong non-exchangeable or localized dependencies. A small synthetic experiment comparing Set-Seq with attention or graph models under such conditions would clarify its expressive limits.\n\n5) The paper demonstrates the expressive capability of the model; however, in practical testing, its performance shows a clear gap compared to attention-based mechanisms. The paper does not clearly explain the cause of this discrepancy and only highlights the model’s superiority in terms of time complexity.\n\n6)  The paper mainly uses mean and polynomial pooling.

A single scan and per-unit temporal update reduce FLOPs by an order of magnitude relative to self-attention when M≥2500. Units can be added or dropped at inference without retraining, and memory grows linearly, so one A6000 GPU handles 5 M samples.\n\nStrength 3: Consistent, measurable gains are observed on synthetic contagion, equity-portfolio, and mortgage-default tasks.

It simply combines an existing permutation-invariant set encoder with a standard sequential backbone, following the design principles of Deep Sets and Set Transformer with only minor modifications.

Overall, the contribution feels more like an engineering integration than a novel modeling paradigm.\n\nOutdated and insufficient experimental comparisons: The experiments rely on relatively old baselines and omit recent state-of-the-art time-series architectures such as iTransformer, TimeMixer, PatchTST, and Mamba. The reported improvements over older models therefore do not convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Moreover, the empirical evaluation lacks comprehensive analyses such as cross-task generalization, robustness, or hyperparameter sensitivity.\n\nShallow theoretical and architectural analysis: The claimed linear scalability is only valid under a simple mean-pooling assumption, which is not evaluated in heterogeneous or strongly correlated scenarios.
