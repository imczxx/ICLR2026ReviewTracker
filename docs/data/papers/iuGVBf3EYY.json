It is commonly approached with deep learning and pretraining methods; however, these approaches suffer from three major limitations: overfitting to semantic features with poor generalization, heavy reliance on prior knowledge with weak cross-domain robustness, and constrained scalability to large and complex traffic datasets. To address these challenges, we propose S$^2$-ETR (Semantic-Structure Encrypted Traffic Representation), a novel framework that integrates traffic semantics with communication topology graph. The framework includes a Hyper-Bipartite Graph (HBG), which takes two branches to fuse topology and semantic features. The topology branch models structural relations with an IP–flow bipartite graph, decoupling flows from communication entities to mitigate overfitting. The semantic branch employs a lightweight adapter to capture flow semantics, enhancing cross-domain robustness; meanwhile, it constructs semantic hyperedges via implicit hypergraph learning, propagating global semantic representations without extra information. Finally, a conditional probability–based hierarchical classification strategy is introduced to augment scalability on massive traffic graphs. Furthermore, through a mathematical proof, we demonstrate that HBG reduces long-range dependencies and over-squashing, leading to better efficacy and generalization compared to traditional topology graphs. Experimental results show that S$^2$-ETR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across 4 datasets of varying scales, outperforming 11 baselines by 2.4%–17.1% on encrypted application classification datasets, and surpassing the best baseline by 9.2% on the more complex and challenging IoT dataset.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Encrypted Traffic Classification", "Hypergraph Learning", "Bipartite Graph"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/da031a98c892d8f4ed4fd7da0e589a868fc4eb15.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes S²-ETR, a novel framework for encrypted traffic classification that integrates semantic and topological features via a Hyper-Bipartite Graph (HBG).

The proposed method is centered on a model, the S^2-ETR, which implements a Hyper-Bipartite Graph (HBG) structure.\n\nThe framework utilizes a dual-branch architecture to process both semantic and topological information from network traffic. For the semantic branch, the system preprocesses PCAP data by extracting the first six packets of each flow, consisting of an 80-byte header and a 240-byte payload. Within this branch, IP addresses and port numbers are anonymized. The resulting data is then passed to a configurable encoder, referred to as an adapter (e.g., 1D/2D CNN, ResNet, Linear), to generate a content-based representation. For the topological branch, the original, non-anonymized IP information is used to construct an IP-Flow bipartite graph. The model learns embeddings for the IP nodes within this graph to represent structural relationships.\n\nThe paper's theoretical analysis posits that the HBG structure is intended to mitigate the over-squashing problem common in graph neural networks. It is argued that this is achieved by replacing long, multi-hop information paths with constant-depth aggregation steps, thereby reducing long-range dependencies. The framework was evaluated on three datasets (CICIoT2023, ISCXVPN2016, and USTC-TFC2016) using the four different encoder configurations."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The main new idea in this work is the \"Hyper-Bipartite Graph\" (HBG), which is a framework with two parts. The first part (the topological branch) models the problem in a smart way by representing how IP addresses and data flows are connected. The second part (the semantic branch) uses an attention mechanism to cleverly learn more complex relationships.\n2. The authors present and provide a mathematical proof explaining why their proposed HBG architecture is superior to traditional IP topology graphs.\n3. The method was evaluated through comprehensive comparative experiments against eleven deep learning-based, pre-training-based, and graph neural network-based models across three distinct datasets. Some of the dataset choices are intriguing."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. This paper is heavily packed with technical details and expresses many concepts and designs through mathematical formulas. However, most of these equations do not actually aid understanding; instead, they significantly reduce the readability of the paper. I suggest reducing the use of formulas in the main text. Rigorous definitions and proofs can be moved to the appendix, while the main body should use simpler and more intuitive representations such as figures.\n2. The authors claim that S^2-ETR addresses the limitations of deep learning methods, pretraining-based methods, and topology-based GNNs. However, the paper only discusses improvements over topology-based GNNs. The authors should elaborate more on why a topology-based approach was adopted and what theoretical motivations underlie this choice, in order to strengthen the overall motivation.\n3. A short overview at the beginning of Section 3—summarizing Figure 1’s workflow and core idea—would greatly improve readability and prepare readers for the detailed designs later on.\n4. Accuracy and efficiency are claimed as major contributions, possibly explaining why the authors did not employ large models. However, as far as I know, the most efficient methods remain traditional machine-learning approaches such as FlowPrint and AppScanner. Even when using raw packet bytes as input, traditional models like XGBoost can still achieve high accuracy. It is therefore suggested that the authors include comparisons with such traditional baselines.\n5. In the experiments, it would be useful to include comparisons with NetMamba, which likewise emphasizes efficiency. In addition, the reported accuracies on ISCX-VPN2016 are noticeably lower than those in the original papers (e.g., YATC and TrafficFormer). This may reflect differences in pretraining data or other factors; please report the exact pretraining datasets used and explain the lower accuracy.
