Existing solutions face critical limitations: training-based methods rely on heavy computation and large datasets; training-free approaches, while avoiding retraining, demand excessive memory or complex auxiliary modules. In this paper, we first reveal a key property overlooked in prior works that the identity-relevant signals, termed Identity-Preserving Embeddings (*IPemb*), are implicitly encoded in textual embeddings of frame prompts. To address the consistent T2I generation with the *IPemb* embedding, we propose Boost Identity-Preserving Embedding (*BIPE*), a training-free yet plug-and-play framework that explicitly extracts and enhances the *IPemb*. Its core innovations are two complementary techniques: Adaptive Singular-Value Rescaling (*adaSVR*) and Union Key (*UniK*). *adaSVR* applies singular-value decomposition to the joint embedding matrix of all frame prompts, amplifying identity-centric components (dominant matrix features) while suppressing frame-specific noise; crucially, it is integrated into every text encoder transformer layer to prevent *IPemb* dilution during non-linear feature transformations. *UniK* further reinforces consistency by concatenating cross-attention keys from all frame prompts (not just the current one), aligning the T2I backbone’s image-text attention across the entire generation sequence. Experiments on the *ConsiStory+* benchmark demonstrate *BIPE* outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics. To address the gap in evaluating a broader range of scenarios with diversified prompt templates, we introduce *DiverStory*, which confirm the scalability of *BIPE*.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Generative Models", "Consistent Generation", "Personalized Image Generation", "Controllable Generation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0eeca5be77a4f3d7a5dfa5bff68dd64f0c1cc038.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose BIPE (Boost Identity-Preserving Embedding), a training-free for consistent text-to-image generation.

The authors claim that previous works overlook the fact that identity-relevant embedding components are already implicitly encoded within the aggregated textual embeddings of a full frame-prompt sequence. However, this limitation does not seem particularly significant, nor is it obvious that it would strongly affect results.\n2. The description of the method is difficult to follow and not clearly structured. It required substantial time and effort to understand the novelty of BIPE and how it differs from 1Prompt1Story. Nevertheless, the proposed approach appears quite similar to 1Prompt1Story. For instance, the UniK component in BIPE seems analogous to Prompt Consolidation (PCon) in 1Prompt1Story, as both combine all prompts. Likewise, adaSVR in BIPE appears to resemble Singular-Value Reweighting (SVR) in 1Prompt1Story. The primary difference seems to lie in the explicit use of IPemb in BIPE. However, the distinction between explicit use in adaSVR and implicit use in SVR is not clearly explained.\n3. The paper contains several typos.

Clarity is generally high, with an end-to-end pipeline and ablations that isolate adaSVR vs UniK contributions.

Identity consistency is mostly measured by CLIP-I and DreamSim with background removal; a small human study or per-attribute identity analysis would strengthen conclusions on visual identity.
