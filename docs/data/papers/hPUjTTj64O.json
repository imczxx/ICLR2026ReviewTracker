However, current methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming due to the need for numerous samplings. To address this, this paper introduces path-consistency, which leverages the confidence of earlier-generated answers to identify the most promising prefix and guide the generation of subsequent branches. By dynamically guiding the generation of subsequent branches based on this prefix, path-consistency mitigates both the errors and redundancies from random or less useful sampling in self-consistency. This approach reduces errors and redundancies from random sampling, significantly accelerating inference by minimizing token consumption. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that path-consistency improves inference latency by up to 40.5\\%, while maintaining task accuracy across various tasks, including mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning.", "tldr": "We propose path-consistency which achieves optimization of self-consistency, extracting information from early branches of self-consistency in the form of \"prefix\", guiding the generation of subsequent branches more efficiently.", "keywords": ["Large Language Model", "Efficient Inference", "Reasoning", "Chain-of-Thought Prompting", "Self-Consistency"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ce0ad2a85e0237e0b3956c3ac38d57ae52cf7b50.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f8eca6d0958b3e0e5c29c0eef1bc63f7ed968db1.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes path-consistency, an improved variant of self-consistency that aggregates reliable prefixes across a small batch of completions to reduce the token cost during sampling.
