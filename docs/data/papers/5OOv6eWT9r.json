These models constitute the large majority of training compute and time and they are subsequently used to train actors entirely in simulation, but once this is done they are quickly discarded. We show in this work that utilising these models at inference time can not only boost performance but also sample efficiency. We propose a novel approach that anticipates and actively seeks out high-entropy states using the world model’s short-horizon latent predictions, offering a principled alternative to traditional curiosity-driven methods that chase once-novel states well after they were stumbled into. While many model predictive control (MPC) based methods offer similar alternatives, they typically lack commitment, synthesising multiple multi-step plans at every step. To mitigate this, we present a hierarchical planner that dynamically decides when to replan, planning horizon length, and the commitment to searching entropy. While our method can theoretically be applied to any model that trains its own actors with solely model generated data, we have applied it to Dreamer to illustrate the concept. Our method finishes Miniworld's procedurally generated mazes 50\\% faster than base Dreamer at convergence and in only 60\\% of the environment steps that base Dreamer's policy needs; it displays reasoned exploratory behaviour in Crafter, achieves the same reward as base Dreamer in a third of the steps; planning is shown to accelerate and improve even Deepmind Control performance.", "tldr": "We use the models in MBRL methods to estimate uncertainty and nudge sampling from the environment towards this uncertainty to both train faster and optimise performance.", "keywords": ["MBRL", "Planning", "sample efficiency", "dreamer", "world models", "information gain", "uncertainty", "entropy", "optimism"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d7fa0ff64a480e3e86b80c8d2d62cfc50ad9b475.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose to train Dreamer(/like) world-model-based-agents by acting with an exploration policy that is inferred in real time by planning with the world model.\nThe main contribution is the usage of latent-transition-model entropy to direct the policy towards novel states."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "The methods seems rather simple.\n\nPresentation is rather clear.\n\nI like the direction that makes the planner adaptive, deciding when to spend compute for replanning, and when to simply follow the existing plan."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Soundness:\n1. It is not clear to me that the method is sound. In stochastic environments, maximizing the sum of individual transition entropies amounts to searching for the most noisy trajectories, which is opposed to exploration, which should look for novel transitions. The authors acknowledge this in lines 176-180. \n2. In det. environments, the entropy of the learned transition model can be used as a pseudo-metric for the novelty of the state. If we limit this method to det. environments, it's not clear to me why we should take the entropy instead of the variance, where the variance directly produces theoretically motivated and well investigated UCB exploration (see [1]).\n2. Even in det. envs., It's not clear to me why the entropy of the learned transition model should be a better metric for novelty than the disagreement of the model ensemble (i.e. plan2explore). This seems to me to suggest problems in the evaluation setup. Can the authors explain why plan2explore can be expected to fail in maze? Isnt it essentially the same method, only operating based on a theoretically sound metric for novelty (ie a metric that can seperate aleatoric from epistemic uncertainty)?\n3. The method seems unnecessarily myopic. Why not learn the intrinsic-reward (the entropy in this case) in a value function, train a policy with respect to this value function, and produce an agent that is able to explore in the direction of novel states, even if these states are not reached in the rollout-length? This is a rather standard method, which again amounts simply to UCB-exploration (see [1] for more details).\n\nEmpirical evaluation:\n1. A very small number of seeds is used in evaluation, resulting in no statistical significance of the results in most enivornments.\n2. Stat. signif. is measured as STD. I don't think STD is the right metric, as it relates to the deviation between the seeds, not the deviation of the mean (ie stat. signif. of the performance gain). I would suggest 2 SEM (i.e. ~95% Gaussian CI).\n3. Missing baselines: [1] provides a structured and better theoretically motivated method for planning-for-exploration in MBRL, which is applicable to Dreamers.

I dont understand (/agree with) the seperation of intrinsic reward into \"retrospective and anticipatory\" methods. If we have access to the model, the one \"correct\" (or \"complete) way to take intrinsic-reward into account is by learning the intrinsic reward inside a value function (retrospective?) and using planning / search to combine the value predictions and the intrinsic reward predictions (anticipatory?) to find an even-better-for-exploration action. If we don't learn the reward in a value function, it seems to me we are myopic - ie suboptimal - for no reason. If we don't have access to the model, we can only use the value function that learned the intrinsic reward. So isn't the better seperation between model-based and model-free methods (i.e. planning vs. no-planning?).\n2. line 088: MCTS has been extended to stochastic and cont. envs. (sampled MZ and stochastic MZ [1,2]).\n3.

In detail:\n\n1. I have read section 3 and 4 multiple times, and I am still not sure what the authors exactly propose to do. This is partly because the formalism is incomplete. Section 3 needs a clear introduction of MDP and POMDP. Much of the math in Section 4 is incomprehensible (at least to me). For example: I assume the idea is that IG in Equation 3 is minimized by RSSM training (as the \"KL divergence loss can also be interpreted as the model's information gain\"). Large prior entropy means large prior standard deviations $\\sigma_p$ (for Gaussians), leading to *smaller* IG. But how does choosing trajectories (or more precisely random outcomes in the trajectories) that artificially lower the IG incentivize the agent to explore less visited states in the environment? What is the max operation in Equation 5 over? To \"choose the [trajectory] with the highest entropy\"? This biases the imagined environment, but how does it affect the choice of actions in the environment towards epistemic uncertainty? \nAnother example of unclear formalism is the following discussion on $\\hat p$, which conditions on different terms every time it is mentioned. What is this distribution? A thought experiment or something that is learned somewhere? What are the states $s_t$ that is reasoned over, the true environment states? But those do not depend on $h_{0:t}$. Finally, I did not understand why a meta-planer is even necessary. Assuming that the authors reasoning on lowering the IG in correct, why stochastically do it only every now and then? Why not do it all the time (called MPC style later)?\n2. In the second half of Section 4.1 the authors seem to develop an argument  when the prior entropy is a good stand-in for epistemic uncertainty (I believe) and when not. However, I find it hard to understand why this should be the case in the first place. As the authors note, high prior entropy will *after sufficient training* on a data set correspond to high aleatoric uncertainty. But why should it be related to epistemic uncertainty about the agent's knowledge of the environment? This is what exploration (in the environment) should be based on, as only epistemic uncertainty is reducible with more samples. Or did I misunderstand what the authors call \"exploration\"?\n3. All presented arguments only hold if the neural network produces the \"correct\" prior entropy. This will only be the case in or near the training set. However, exploration is about finding states that have *not* been explored, that is, which are not in (or even near) the training set. So why do the authors expect the prior entropy to be a good exploration signal? The paper misses a discussion on this.\n4. While there are a lot of experiments, and the discussion of the results often contextualizes them correctly (\"gains are modest but consistent\"), it must be observed that only in ```walker_walk``` and ```hopper_hop``` the proposed methods shows a significant advantage over the \"no plan\" baseline.  In particular the ```Crafter``` experiments do not show **any significant** improvement. Given that the paper's motivation is somewhat hard to follow (at least for me), this is not a sufficient level of evidence to claim that the proposed method has any systematic effect whatsoever. Without clearly separated standard deviations (or a more rigorous measure of statistical significance), none of the paper's claims can be relied on."}, "questions": {"value": "- See the questions above.\n- What does the \"state\" in Equations 4 and 5 refer to?
