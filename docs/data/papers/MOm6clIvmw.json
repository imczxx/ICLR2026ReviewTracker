Despite recent progress, current methods fall short when data and computation are limited—--precisely the conditions under which this task is most critical. We introduce a novel architecture-agnostic training paradigm to improve fMRI-based visual reconstruction through a subject-agnostic common representation space. We show that it is possible to leverage subject-specific lightweight modules to develop a representation space where different subjects not only lie in a shared space but are also aligned semantically. Our results demonstrate that such a training pipeline achieves significant performance gains in low-data scenarios. We supplement this method with a novel algorithm to select the most representative subset of images for a new subject. Using both techniques together, one can fine-tune with at most 40\\% of the data while outperforming the baseline trained with the minimum standard dataset size. Our method generalizes across different training paradigms and architectures, producing state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating that a subject-agnostic aligned representation space is the next step towards efficient Brain-Computer Interfaces.", "tldr": "We introduce a training paradigm for brain signal to image reconstruction by developing an aligned and shared cross-subject representation space that is especially powerful in low-data settings", "keywords": ["Computational Neuroscience", "fMRI", "Neuroimaging", "Diffusion", "CLIP", "alignment", "neuroAI"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4248c3b0f17571df01a597bdfc0d33258cd50c35.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c22548f3663648bf3aa0859cc9293eaff2132fc2.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new fMRI decoding method to improve the cross-subject decoding performance.

It could be strengthened by extending the method to more datasets rather than NSD and THINGS (e.g. Bold5K, DeepRecon), architectures other than ME1/2, and more subject-embedding techniques (concat, add, ...).\n- Given the now well-know flaws of the NSD dataset (low categorical diversity, categorical leakage, ..) the use of NSD as the only reference dataset is a potentially weak point of the paper, but could be addressed by doing at least one other transfer ablation (e.g. between THINGS and Bold5K)."}, "questions": {"value": "- it is not entirely clear to me if the SVD analysis for Image selection is carried out on the 1000 fMRI representations  of the common image set (in reference subject-space), or if it is done on the CLIP embeddings of the corresponding images\n- It seems that only single-subject models are trained, but it is sometimes ambiguous whether the subjects 2,5,7 are fine-tuned simultaneously with a single model (with one adapter per subject, yielding a single model for all 3 subjects), or one by one, separately (yielding 3 different models)\n- Tables in the main paper gray out the pixel-wise metrics because it is said the pipeline does not optimise for these. This could be clarified so that it is clearer that the results are still valid for these metrics. It would also be interesting to report metrics for the low-level pipeline of ME1/2.\n- It is not clear to me what the strategy is, in the end-to-end fine-tuning stage, for re-using common images or not. Some parts of the text mention that the common-images are used only for AA (e.g. 4.3), but it is unclear if other experiments follow this same strategy or reuse the common images in the end-to-end stage.\n- There are other strategies than mapping fMRI to a common space (e.g. adding a subject-embedding at various levels in this pipeline), it would be interesting to have a discussion of these other types of strategies for embedding subject information\n- The transfer results on THINGS that shows you don't need a common set of identical images across subjects, but just semantically-matching collections of images across subjects is most interesting and I believe it could be emphasised more strongly as a core contribution of the paper (i.e the method is also agnostic to having a common set of images across subjects).\n- Unless I'm mistaken there is a typo at L275: it should be the 'total number of empty bins across all dimensions' for $Gap(S)$\n- It is not clear to me whether the IS algorithm keeps a constant number (250) of images and tries to minimise the number of empty bins under this constraint or varies the number of images to allow for fewer empty bins.
