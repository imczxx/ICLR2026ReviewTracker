These inverse problems -- estimating ODE parameters from observational data -- are particularly challenging when the data are noisy, sparse, and the dynamics are nonlinear. We propose the Eigen-Fourier Physics-Informed Gaussian Process (EFiGP), an algorithm that integrates Fourier transformation and eigen-decomposition into a physics-informed Gaussian Process framework. This approach eliminates the need for numerical integration, significantly enhancing computational efficiency and accuracy. Built on a principled Bayesian framework, EFiGP incorporates the ODE system through probabilistic conditioning, enforcing governing equations in the Fourier domain while truncating high-frequency terms to achieve denoising and computational savings. The use of eigen-decomposition further simplifies Gaussian Process covariance operations, enabling efficient recovery of trajectories and parameters even in dense-grid settings. We validate the practical effectiveness of EFiGP on three benchmark examples, demonstrating its potential for reliable and interpretable modeling of complex dynamical systems while addressing key challenges in trajectory recovery and computational cost.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Physics-Informed Gaussian Processes", "Ordinary Differential Equations", "Inverse Problems", "Fourier Truncation", "Eigenvalue Truncation"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c38b7cd144ded12a28cc99761e763d7d85f4fa23.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The proposed Eigen-Fourier Physics-Informed Gaussian Process (EFiGP) framework demonstrates a certain degree of theoretical novelty by integrating Fourier transformation and eigen-decomposition into a physics-informed Gaussian process framework, aiming to enhance the efficiency and stability of ODE parameter inference and trajectory reconstruction."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.Embedding the Fourier transform and eigen-decomposition into the GP framework is a non-trivial idea that strengthens the physical constraints from a frequency-domain perspective while reducing computational complexity.\n\n2.The authors clearly identify the limitations of the MAGI framework—specifically, its high computational cost and poor convergence under dense discretization—and propose targeted solutions through frequency-domain and eigenspace dimensionality reduction.

Although the idea of transferring ODE physical constraints into the Fourier domain is inspiring, its mathematical validity and convergence analysis are entirely absent. The paper provides no theoretical guarantees such as consistency, bias bounds, or truncation error analysis. Key derivations (e.g., Equations (9) and (11)) rely on statements like “by Lemma 2.2 we can obtain...” without rigorous justification of whether these transformations preserve the equivalence of the physical constraints. Moreover, there is no discussion of alignment with Bayesian inference theory (e.g., posterior consistency or marginal likelihood).\n\nAlthough the proposed EFiGP framework shows computational advantages over MAGI, the experimental validation remains insufficient in both scope and depth.\nAll experiments are conducted on classical low-dimensional ODE benchmarks (FitzHugh–Nagumo, Lotka–Volterra, Hes1). These are toy systems with simple oscillatory dynamics, and the observation noise is i.i.d. Gaussian with uniform sampling—conditions that are relatively easy for GP-based methods. The paper does not test EFiGP on high-dimensional, chaotic, or real-world scientific datasets (e.g., climate models, fluid dynamics, or neural population dynamics), where scalability and robustness are critical. The comparison is restricted to MAGI and a simple numerical solver (Runge–Kutta). There are no experiments against more recent and competitive baselines such as FNO (Fourier Neural Operator, Li et al., ICLR 2021), AutoIP (Da Long et al., NeurIPS 2022), and Fenrir (Tronarp et al., ICML 2022), all of which address physics-informed kernel or operator learning in related contexts. The results mainly highlight faster computation, but accuracy improvements are marginal (Tables 2–5 show only small RMSE differences), and there is no systematic analysis of the trade-off between speed and inference accuracy as discretization increases.\n\nThe paper’s claims about computational complexity and scalability are also somewhat vague. The authors state that the complexity is reduced from O(n²) to a constant level (due to fixed j and l), but this is not theoretically rigorous—if j and l grow with system complexity, the computation may still scale linearly or quadratically. No detailed runtime environment or complexity–n scaling curves are provided; only static tables are shown.\n\nThe paper’s positioning and comparative analysis are also limited. It does not compare with recent works on physics-informed kernel learning (e.g., AutoIP) or FNO-style spectral operator methods. The Fourier domain truncation approach resembles the idea behind the Fourier Neural Operator, yet the paper does not clarify its relation or distinction from operator-learning frameworks. \n\nThere are also issues in writing and academic presentation.

The proposed spectral and eigen-based reparameterization reduces computational complexity from O(n^2) to near-constant runtime with respect to discretization size, outperforming existing approaches such as MAGI. \n - Moreover, EFiGP maintains convergence under dense discretization settings where the baseline MAGI algorithm fails to converge."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Despite its efficiency gains, the claimed improvements in estimation accuracy over baseline MAGI remain modest. In particular, while EFiGP slightly outperforms MAGI for dense discretization (≥161 points), MAGI has comparable accuracy for sparser datasets, shown in Table 2 and Table 3, where EFiGP’s trajectory estimation accuracy improves only when the discretization becomes sufficiently dense. The algorithm did not deal with the challenge posed by data sparsity. The approach remains sensitive to data sparsity, and the paper’s results suggest that additional observations are required to mitigate degradation in parameter estimation performance.\n - Furthermore, parameter identifiability issues persist, especially for weakly identifiable parameters such as b in the FN system. Although EFiGP improves over MAGI in this respect, the mean of absolute error for b (0.176 at 41-point discretization) remains substantial compared to the true value of 0.2, and the authors do not propose any strategies to address this limitation.\n - The main evaluations are on three oscillatory systems (FN, LV, Hes1), with only a brief mention of a chaotic system in the supplement. Since the algorithm’s efficiency relies on Fourier-domain representations that are naturally suited to oscillatory behavior, broader testing on non-oscillatory or chaotic systems would be essential to substantiate claims of general applicability and robustness."}, "questions": {"value": "For the reduce in computation cost, how much comes from eigen-decomposition and how much comes from Fourier truncation?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "b4DC8hQ8Ln", "forum": "bOvXDlMC1E", "replyto": "bOvXDlMC1E", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1698/Reviewer_99Ym"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1698/Reviewer_99Ym"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1698/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761158150885, "cdate": 1761158150885, "tmdate": 1762915859623, "mdate": 1762915859623, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper is about using Gaussian processes (GPs) for calibrating dynamical systems governed by ODEs in a Bayesian manner.
