Existing methods exhibit a strong dependence on the number of sources and are difficult to parallelize, which hinders their scalability on large graphs. We propose Cost-Distance Policy Gradient (CDPG), the first gradient-based framework for this problem. CDPG relaxes the discrete subgraph selection into a probabilistic adjacency matrix and formulates the Cost-Distance objective as an expectation, enabling efficient optimization via policy gradients. Our algorithm achieves the time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(m\\log n)$, faster than the previous fastest approximation algorithm's $\\mathcal{O}(|S|(m+n\\log n))$ in graphs with dense sources. Extensive experiments across 9 real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) logistics scenarios in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area demonstrate that CDPG significantly outperforms approximation algorithms, continuous relaxation baselines, and heuristic search methods.

While there are indeed RL methods that sample actions at evaluation time, the much more standard RL setup would be to train a policy and draw actions from it *greedily* at evaluation time (i.e., always choose highest probability action).

Some are listed below.\n\nThe work needs a better motivation for addressing the cost-distance problem in relation to designing the UAV network. The abstract and intro cite the UAV network planning as the main motivation for their study of the cost-distance problem. However, very little attention is paid to how to realistically model UAV network design problem to the studied formalism. I can only see one or two paragraph in the intro to the somewhat high-level connection of UAV logistics and cost-distance problem. There are several unclear points such as what are root, source nodes, edges in UAV terminology? Rarely a real world problem such as UAV logistics translates itself into a clean abstraction such as the cost-distance framework. The work should provide an clear, and detailed connection to UAV logistics by discussing appropriate background work in UAV network design and cost-distance problem.\n\nThere needs to be more effort as to why the cost-distance problem is relevant to the ICLR community. Most of the prior work in this problem is in the theoretical computer and OR community. Most of the baselines are also from the OR and approximation math optimization literature (Held and Perner). A main issue is that there is not a clear and agreed upon definition of the UAV network design problem available based on the cited work. Thus, an effort should be made to connect the cost-distance problem to other well-studied problems (with relevance to ICLR) which have baselines and datasets available.\n\nThe writing of the paper requires substantial improvements. Technically, several dense mathematical terms have been introduced without clear intuition and explanations. Some examples are below:\n\n– The paper straightway goes into the problem formulation from the third para of introduction. It should be moved to the problem formulation section\n\n– In Eq 1, it is not clear if (i, j) belong to X or X’ in \\sum_{i, j}\n\n– Same confusion for \\sum_i in Eq 1\n\n– Why Eq4 guarantees P is acyclic, no citation or intuition is provided \n\n– What are different terms in Eq 5, what does the p^\\theta . X . A provides us? How this mask really works? There needs to be a clear working example.\n\n– The definition of \\phi in line 191 is not fully explained. In particular, how different terms in \\phi definition justify the logic explained in lines 191-196\n\n– Given that computing W* is NP-hard, it is quite strange to approximate it using a constant matrix (line 204). This seems adhoc.  Why that can be a good approximation for real world problems is far from clear.\n\n– The penalty term in in Eq11 is not fully explained. It seems quite dense, and its exact role and understanding is not clear. \n\nThese are only few of the concerns in technical section. As a result of these issues, the reader is unable to grasp the relevance and significance of contributions clearly.\n\nThe authors claim their approach is faster. However, unlike previous works by Meyerson, they do not provide what kind of bounds their method can achieve. In general, even a random approach can be faster, but it of course may not provide any quality bounds. Thus, the authors should clarify this point when discussing the runtime benefits of their method.\n\nEmpirical evaluation is somewhat limited. Results are on synthetic instances that are constructed by authors themselves by deriving them from a part of the greater bay area. However, these are not real world UAV logistic design problems that are widely accepted in the community. There are several design assumptions made as noted in section D to interpret them as UAV problem. \n\nI also find baselines methods quite limited. The author claim that method by Held and Perner is most relevant. However, this work seems like a arxiv report, I could not verify if this was published in a conference/journal. Thus, it does not inspire confidence to have comparisons against such unpublished work.\n\nTotal 9 graphs is also quite limiting. Ideally, the authors should chose a large, publicly available UAV design problems not constructed by them. It is quite difficult to draw any firm conclusion from this small dataset provided by the authors themselves."}, "questions": {"value": "See above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "0aNGXKflyX", "forum": "WoaqbHjU03", "replyto": "WoaqbHjU03", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7874/Reviewer_eCPK"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7874/Reviewer_eCPK"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7874/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762260435980, "cdate": 1762260435980, "tmdate": 1762919906060, "mdate": 1762919906060, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
