While cardinal utility functions offer a detailed representation of preferences, voters often cannot precisely quantify their affinity towards a given candidate. As a result, modern voting systems rely on ordinal rankings to simplistically represent preference profiles. In quantifying the suboptimality of solutions due to the loss of information when using ordinal preferences, the metric distortion framework models voters and candidates as points in a metric space, with distortion bounding the efficiency loss. Prior works within this framework use the distance between a voter and a candidate in the underlying metric as the cost of selecting the candidate for the given voter, with a goal of minimizing the sum (utilitarian) or maximum (egalitarian) of costs across voters. For deterministic election mechanisms selecting a single winning candidate, the best possible distortion is known to be 3 for any metric, as established by Gkatzelis, Halpern, and Shah (FOCS'20). In contrast, for randomized mechanisms, distortions cannot be lower than $2.112$, as shown by Charikar and Ramakrishnan (SODA'22), and there exists a mechanism with a distortion guarantee of $2.753$, according to Charikar, Ramakrishnan, Wang, and Wu (SODA'24 Best Paper Award). Our work asks: can one obtain a better approximation compared to an optimal candidate by selecting a committee of $k$ candidates ($k \\ge 1$), where the cost of a voter is defined to be its distance to the closest candidate in the committee? We affirmatively answer this question by introducing the concept of bi-criteria approximation within the metric distortion framework. In the line metric, it is possible to achieve optimal cost with only $O(1)$ candidates. In contrast, we also prove that in both the two-dimensional and tree metrics -- which naturally generalize the line metric -- achieving optimal cost is impossible unless all candidates are selected. These results apply to both utilitarian and egalitarian objectives. Our results establish a stark separation between the line metric and the 2-D or tree metric in the context of the metric distortion problem.", "tldr": "We show that selecting a small committee improves approximation guarantees over single-winner selection in metric distortion, achieving optimal cost in line metrics but not in tree or 2-D metrics.", "keywords": ["Social Choice Theory", "Metric Distortion"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6873b1f2439a2c76775dc77b97155abf0c8b8b8c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the following problem in social choice theory under the metric distortion framework: if, instead of selecting a single winner, a deterministic mechanism is allowed to select multiple candidates (where the cost to a voter is their distance to the nearest selected candidate), then can this lead to smaller distortion relative to the optimal single candidate?\n\nThe authors obtained the following results:\n\n1.

This to some extend related with k-committee selection, but the main question posed here is different. The paper obtains strong and non-trivial results both both the utilitarian and egalitarian objectives, and both the 1D case and more general metrics. The results on the line are particularly surprising: a constant number of candidates (and in fact a small constant at that) always suffices to guarantee optimality. I find this result very interesting and informative in practice. In cases where one can potentially select more than one candidate, the results of this paper explain how one can navigate the tradeoff between picking a small number of candidates and guaranteeing small distortion. The paper also provides an interesting impossibility result, showing that a similar guarantee cannot be attained in general metrics. In fact, selecting all but one candidates will always fail to guarantee optimality. This provides an interesting separation between 1D and more general metrics, something which hasn't been investigated a lot in this line of work, with some exceptions. Overall, the paper makes a concrete contribution to a natural problem. It provides a comprehensive understanding under different objectives and metric spaces, together with matching lower bounds. \n\nFurthermore, the writing of the paper is very good.
