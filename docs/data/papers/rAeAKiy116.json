To avoid confusion, we changed Assumption 3 to “Let $\\delta > 0$ such that the function $g$ is $\\delta$-smooth.” \n\nIn principle, one needs to know the $L$ parameter as well to run even the zero-sum algorithm, which can also be nontrivial to estimate in general. For monotone zero-sum games, we have not noticed any parameter-free algorithm that achieves the fast rate of $\\frac L {\\sqrt {\\mu \\nu}}$. This is indeed a common and non-trivial issue in many optimization problems. \n\nWe, however, argue that in practice we never meet pure black-box optimization [Nesterov 2005; Nesterov 2018]. When the games are given in closed form, the parameters of $\\delta$ and $L$ can often be estimated. For instance, in section 5.1, we have explained how to compute the parameter $\\delta$ from $\\beta = \\lVert \\frac { A + B } {2} \\rVert$ in regularized matrix games; and in section 5.2, the parameter $\\delta$ corresponds to the smoothness of the collaboration incentive. \n\nIn the cases where it is, however, difficult to estimate these parameters, typical procedures in convex optimization are to perform line searches or to design parameter-free algorithms (like in the seminal paper of AdaGrad [Duchi et al. 2011]). Since for zero-sum cases such extensions are still open, we leave the further extensions of our near-zero-sum algorithm for future work. \n\n*References:*\n\n*Von Neumann, John, and Oskar Morgenstern. \"Theory of games and economic behavior.\" Theory of games and economic behavior.

We chose the regularized matrix game as our test bed due to its clean structure and amenability to generate random examples at a relative scale. Our basic numerical experiments successfully validate our core claims: \n\n1. Our proposed ICL algorithm converges faster as the game approaches the zero-sum structure ($\\delta \\to 0$); \n\n2. Classical variational inequality methods (EG/OGDA) do not benefit from the near-zero-sum structure; and \n\n3. Consequently, our ICL algorithm is faster than the classic methods when the game is sufficiently near-zero-sum. \n\nWe believe that in the paper we already have suitable numerical results to support the main theoretical claims of the paper. \n\nReviewer AbM8 gives more detailed feedback on the convergence plot of Figure 1. While all 21 entries (seven entries for each of the three algorithms) are plotted, the perceived \"lack of distinct lines\" for EG and OGDA is, in fact, **a crucial empirical result consistent with our theory**. The seven lines for EG (Green) and OGDA (Red) almost entirely merge because the convergence rate of classical variational inequality methods is determined by $\\frac{L} {\\min \\\\{\\mu, \\nu \\\\}\\}$, and cannot exploit the near-zero-sum parameter $\\delta$. Conversely, the seven lines for our proposed Black-Box Reduction Algorithm (Blue) are visibly separated, demonstrating its dependence on the $\\delta$ parameter and empirically validating its ability to harness the near-zero-sum structure for faster convergence. \n\nTo make this point clearer for the reader, we have updated the description of experiment results (section G.2) to explicitly state that the overlap of the OGDA and EG lines is an expected empirical result consistent with existing theory. \n\n### Application examples:\n\nThe examples provided in our paper serve as canonical abstractions showing how the near-zero-sum structure naturally arises in games: \n\n- For instance, *matrix games with transaction fees* are analogous to (a) betting sites often set odds such that there is overall no loss-gain (zero-sum game) but charge a small transaction fee; or (b) negotiation between two clients via a trusted-third party that charges a brokerage fee is another example of a case with small transaction fee. \n\n- Similarly, we have already presented a lot of citations for games where *competition and cooperation co-exists* (see the list of references at the end of Example 2). Our work studies the parameter range where the cooperation incentive is small. For example, repeated Prisoners' dilemma with a stochastic number of rounds with small benefit-to-cost ratio is an example of competition with small cooperation incentive (as benefit-to-cost ratio $b/c$ is small) [Chapter 8.7, Nowak 2006]. \n\nThis paper is the first formal introduction of a new class that precisely models the near-zero-sumness often ignored in existing literature—for instance, the impact of third-party effects or small external factors:  \n\n- Before our work, we were not aware of any study of near-zero-sum games, hence existing modellings were forced to choose between *either* the **inaccurate, perfectly zero-sum simplification** *or* the **computationally costly general-sum model**; \n\n- Now, with our work, we provide a *mathematically elegant framework* to analyze the missing issue in these real-world competitive scenarios. \n\nHence, the applications provided in the paper illustrate that the near-zero-sum structure is a general feature that our algorithm is the first to efficiently exploit. \nIn our revision, we added these additional explanations in section 4 and the more concrete illustrations in Appendix F.

The removal of the additional logarithmic factor from the current upper bound, and the extension to adaptive/line-search algorithms; \n\n5. The derivation of tighter lower bounds for the non-zero-sum classes; \n\n6. The generalization to multiplayer (near-zero-sum) settings; \n\n7. Additional experiments on more or larger examples; \n\n……\n\nWhile our work makes the first core analysis towards faster rates for near-zero-sum games, as noted in our paper and as mentioned by the reviewers, there are many non-trivial and exciting avenues for future research. Indeed, many of them (e.g., 4 & 6) are still open for the (basic) zero-sum games. \n\nIn our general response, we address some common issues raised by the reviewers. \n\n### Extensions to multiplayer games:\n\nOur work focuses on achieving fast convergence rates for two-player monotone non-zero-sum games, a crucial first generalization of the two-player monotone zero-sum games. A natural inquiry raised by the reviewers is whether these fast rates can be extended to multiplayer near-zero-sum games. We emphasize that this generalization would require solving two highly non-trivial challenges: (a) extending the previous results of the fast rate from the two-player monotone zero-sum case to the multiplayer monotone \"zero-sum\" case, and (b) subsequently generalizing the resulting multiplayer \"zero-sum\" framework to the \"near-zero-sum\" class. Given that the default rate for an $n$-player monotone game is slow, $\\mathcal{O}(L / \\min_i { \\mu_i })$, the extension of the previous results in step (a) is already a challenging open problem. Thus, the full extension of our result to multiplayer games is a major open problem that we leave for future work. \n\nReviewers F4W2 and BPVS ask for technical reasons why we did not generalize the faster rates to multiplayer games. We are happy to share some insights in this regard. The primary difficulty lies even in the first step (the multiplayer zero-sum case), which is largely unexplored: \n\n- Conceptually, the zero-sum assumption in two-player games implies strict competition, which is not guaranteed to hold between any two players in a general multiplayer zero-sum game.\n\n- More technically, classic results (e.g., von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1947) show that an $n$-player general-sum game can be reduced to an $(n+1)$-player zero-sum game by letting the $(n+1)$th player take the negative of the summation of the first $n$ players. This implies that three-player zero-sum games are inherently no easier than two-player general-sum games. \n\nThe above discussions suggest that achieving a fast convergence rate in the multiplayer setting will likely require significantly stronger structural assumptions than the simple summation of utilities to zero. \nGiven such complexity, a comprehensive treatment of multiplayer games is beyond the scope of this paper. \n\nWe have included the above discussions in the future work paragraph."}}, "id": "m9GbwP30eg", "forum": "rAeAKiy116", "replyto": "rAeAKiy116", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12736/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12736/Authors"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12736/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763565612503, "cdate": 1763565612503, "tmdate": 1763628228114, "mdate": 1763628228114, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper examines a new class of games that interpolates between zero-sum monotone games and general-sum monotone games.
