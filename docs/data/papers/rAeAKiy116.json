In particular, the authors define the class of monotone $\\delta$-near-zero-sum games, where the $\\delta$ parameter denotes that the coupled component of the game $g(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is $\\delta$-smooth. This class interpolates between zero-sum ($\\delta=0$) and general-sum ($\\delta=L$) monotone games. While the zero-sum case has been well studied and admits minimax optimal algorithms, the general-case complexity from Tseng (1995) remains less well-studied. The paper describes a new algorithm called Iterative Coupling Linearization (ICL), which is shown to converge faster than existing methods when $\\delta$ is small enough, in both strongly and non-strongly monotone games. The algorithm relies on a linearization of the coupling part $g$, leading to a sequence of zero-sum subproblems.
