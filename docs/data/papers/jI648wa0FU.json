However, these approaches still exhibit two major limitations: (i) insufficient restoration and enhancement of fine details, and (ii) the introduction of semantically inconsistent artifacts due to semantic ambiguity in heavily hazed regions. To overcome these challenges, we propose SCDE-Dehaze, an image-dehazing framework explicitly designed for simultaneous haze removal and detail enhancement. Our framework comprises two components: Anti-Perturbation Cycle-Consistent learning (APCC) for detail enhancement and Semantic-Consistent Domain Transfer (SCDT) for haze removal. APCC enhances fine image details by enforcing cycle-consistency against intentionally injected perturbations. Meanwhile, SCDT guides semantically consistent domain translation by injecting semantic priors derived from clear images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods in real-world dehazing while achieving ~1.5 dB improvement in PSNR on challenging O-HAZE dataset.", "tldr": "The first self-supervised haze-agnostic detail-enhancement learning task with semantic-consistent style translation module for real-world image dehazing.", "keywords": ["real-world dehazing", "unsupervised learning", "detail-enhancement", "semantic-consistent dehazing"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
