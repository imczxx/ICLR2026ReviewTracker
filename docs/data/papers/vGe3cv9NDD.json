Prior work, like IBM Project Debater, focused on generating isolated persuasive speeches in highly simplified and shortened debate formats for lay audiences. We introduce a novel autonomous system capable of participating in and winning a full, unmodified two-team competitive policy debate. Our system employs a hierarchical architecture of specialized multi-agent workflows, where teams of LLM-powered agents collaborate and critique one another to perform discrete argumentative tasks. Each workflow utilizes iterative retrieval, synthesis, and self-correction using an existing massive corpus of policy debate evidence: OpenDebateEvidence, mirroring the creative and strategic processes of elite human debate teams at real debate tournaments. We demonstrate through a continuously running live spectacle debate performance that our agents can autonomously construct logically sound, evidence-backed cases and engage in multi-turn debates, generate full speech transcripts and intelligently cross-examine each other. In preliminary evaluations against human-authored cases, our system produces qualitatively superior argumentative components and consistently wins simulated rounds as adjudicated by an independent autonomous judge. We also find that expert human debate coaches consistently prefer the arguments, evidence, and cases constructed by our system vs human debaters. We open source all of our code to the public here: <redacted>", "tldr": "Basically a sequal to IBM Project Debater that's implemented using fully autonomous agents who debate against each other using competitive debate rules", "keywords": ["Debate", "debating", "argument mining", "argumentation", "persuasion", "superpersuasion", "AI agents", "agents", "creative AI"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/418bd0e6fed2a9ccbea5e0ba4e69c7d635d4a4bd.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/34f8cb668340f3ff172af8494ce68ced044b8dab.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates argument modeling and introduces a multi-agent system for policy debate.

In my view, the paper does not offer any technical novelty - the gist of it is that the authors tailored a multi-agent pipeline to their problem and dataset and used gpt-4.1 mini along with agent frameworks and retrieval with BM25. While a limited technical novelty can be OK for a paper in the applications track, it does certainly increase the burden to deliver strong contributions in other aspects (e.g., comprehensive analyses, useful code, surprising results, valuable resources etc.), which unfortunately I personally thought were lacking as well. Moreover, when claiming that \"our core contribution is a novel multi-agent architecture\" I would have expected something more than a keyword search with a pipeline of LLM-based nodes that look quite standard (generate -> search -> review quality, as described in Figure 2).\n2. There is no analysis, and really very little in terms of results - the entire empirical section consists of human evaluation of 3 system outputs and the evaluation of 20 simulated debates using an LLM judge (with no additional validation). So this raises some doubts about the robustness and significance of the work, but just as importantly in my opinion does not provide much insights to the reader, whether in terms of ML, LLM reasoning, implementation challenges or even debating-specific insights. As I see it, the paper content can be accurately summed up as \"we tailored a multi-agent pipeline with retrieval and according to an LLM judge it beats humans\". In my view, this is simply not enough as a contribution for a conference paper. \n3. The description of the pipeline is composed mainly of a large amount of debating jargon, making it largely incomprehensible to the naive reader.\n4. I felt that the paper somewhat misrepresents prior works. Notably, the authors state as an advantage of the present work that it relies on a human curated evidence dataset, whereas prior works synthesized arguments from broad corpora. But importantly, argument mining and synthesis from a large-scale general-purpose corpus is precisely the technical challenge that many of the prior works aimed to tackle; and relying on a debate-specific corpus, where relevant debate arguments and debate evidence are readily accessible, mainly means that the present work tackles a very different, and in certain ways easier, technical problem. Also regarding specifics, stating for example that Slonim et al. \"produces a single, monolithic speech with very limited reference to evidence\" is incorrect (they produced more than one speech per motion and did employ evidence as a central component)."}, "questions": {"value": "* Why does the abstract talk about a \"continuously running live spectacle debate performance\"?
