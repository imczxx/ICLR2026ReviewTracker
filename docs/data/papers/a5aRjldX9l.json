The incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) has attracted increasing attention and achieved significant success. Although existing imputation-based IMVC methods perform well, they still face one crucial limitation, i.e., view recovery and subspace representation lack explicit alignment and collaborative interaction in exploring complementarity and consistency across multiple views. To this end, this study proposes a novel IMVC method to Align collaborative view Recovery and tensorial Subspace Learning via latent representation (ARSL-IMVC). Specifically, the ARSL-IMVC infers the complete view from view-shared latent representation and view-specific estimator with Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion regularizer, reshaping the consistent and diverse information intrinsically embedded in original multi-view data. Then, the ARSL-IMVC learns the view-shared and view-specific subspace representations from latent feature and recovered views, and models high-order correlations at the global and local levels in the unified low-rank tensor space. Thus, leveraging the latent representation as a bridge in a unified framework, the ARSL-IMVC seamlessly aligns the complementarity and consistency exploration across view recovery and subspace representation learning, negotiating with each other to promote clustering. Extensive experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate the powerful capacity of ARSL-IMVC in complex incomplete multi-view clustering tasks under various view missing scenarios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Incomplete Multi-view Clustering", "Collaborative View Recovery", "Tensorial Subspace Learning", "Cross-view Correlation Alignment"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cbd9773b8ba41db500e890be93824c265abb4965.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/33149a10e547c31205bb95d608e8b2b7d4bc8b88.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel method, ARSL-IMVC, to tackle the task of incomplete multi-view clustering.

The semantic alignment between view recovery and subspace representation is new, its innovation needs further clarification, especially the difference from existing methods.\n\n2. Exploring the criteria of cross-view consistency and complementarity has been widely used in multi-view learning. What is the contribution of this study in this regard?\n\n3. If the latent representation has already been trained to capture shared semantics, does the introduction of a low-rank constraint on the subspace representation tensor result in redundant regularisation?\n\n4. The HSIC regularisation term can use different kernel functions. Why does ARSL-IMVC choose to use the inner product kernel?\n\n5. The latent representation H and the centralised matrix H use the same notation.\n\n6. The authors introduced a view-specific orthogonal matrix $P^{(v)}$ to recover the view-specific features. I have a concern about whether $(P^{(v)})^\\top P^{(v)} = I$ can still hold when the dimension of view-specific features is lower than $k$.\n\n7. The choice of HSIC: why this paper chooses HSIC as a diversity measurement here rather than some others, e.g., Gromov-Wasserstein distance.\n\n8. What are the global semantics and local cluster structures in Eq. (4) ?\n\n9. This paper utilises a rotation operator to transfer a $N\\times N\\times (V+1)$ tensor to a $ N\\times (V+1) \\times N$  tensor, making the results of the tensor low rank constraint sensitive to the orders of samples arranged in the input features.
