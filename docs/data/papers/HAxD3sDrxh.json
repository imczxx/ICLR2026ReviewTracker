Unlike previous voxel-based approaches such as PCGCv2, SparsePCGC, and Unicorn, SurfelSoup models 3D geometry as a composition of probabilistic surfaces (G-Surfels) rather than discrete voxels. Each G-Surfel is formulated as a bounded generalized Gaussian distribution, parameterized by a mean, covariance, quaternion rotation, and shape coefficient, which can flexibly represent local planar or curved surface patches. The method further organizes these G-Surfels hierarchically in a G-SurfelTree, analogous to an adaptive octree, where a decision module learns whether to subdivide or terminate a node based on rate-distortion optimization. During inference, the model reconstructs point clouds by binarizing occupancy probabilities, selecting voxels with the highest likelihood.
