Past research has focused on optimizing prompts specific to a task. However, much less attention has been given to optimizing the general instructions included in a prompt, known as a system prompt. To address this gap, we propose SPRIG, an edit-based genetic algorithm that iteratively constructs prompts from prespecified components to maximize the model's performance in general scenarios. We evaluate the performance of system prompts on a collection of 47 different types of tasks to ensure generalizability. Our study finds that a single optimized system prompt performs on par with task prompts optimized for each individual task. Moreover, combining system and task-level optimizations leads to further improvement, which showcases their complementary nature. Experiments also reveal that the optimized system prompts generalize effectively across model families, parameter sizes, and languages. This study provides insights into the role of system-level instructions in maximizing LLM potential.", "tldr": "System prompt optimization is powerful, highly generalizable, and complementary to existing methods", "keywords": ["prompting", "system prompt", "prompt optimization"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fc2fa61ee95dcc9ca14c31a10be2fcc70a2c575f.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e5596052aae680a7f20e8afcdcd8fb596241e4bb.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper investigates how to optimize system prompts rather than task-specific prompts.
