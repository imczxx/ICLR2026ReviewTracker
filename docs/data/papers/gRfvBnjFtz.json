Recent methods propose to use vector quantization to map nodes or subgraphs into discrete token IDs. However, it remains unclear whether these quantized tokenizers truly capture high-level, transferable graph patterns across diverse domains. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to analyze the representational consistency of quantized graph tokens across different datasets. We introduce the Graph Token Information Discrepancy Score (GTID) to quantify the alignment of structural and feature information between source and target graphs for each token. Our results reveal that current graph quantized tokenizers often assign the same token to structurally inconsistent patterns across graphs, resulting in high GTID and degraded transfer performance. We further demonstrate that GTID is positively correlated with the generalization gap in downstream tasks. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective structural hard encoding (SHE) strategy to enhance the structural awareness of the tokenizer. SHE leads to lower GTID and improved transferability, highlighting the importance of explicitly encoding transferable graph structure in token design.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph Transferring Learning", "Quantization Tokenizer"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f2092ec0781036887412cb38699d5d5a09657628.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates whether graph quantized tokenizers (using VQ/RVQ methods) capture transferable structural patterns across different graph domains.

The motivation is well-articulated and grounded in practical applications.\n\nMotivation and Analysis: GTID provides an intuitive decomposition of token consistency into feature-based and structure-based components. The separation enables targeted analysis of tokenizer failures and could inform future design choices. Theorems 1 and 2 formalize the intuition that code-conditional discrepancies in feature/structural spaces directly contribute to transfer error. The bounds connect IPM-based discrepancies (W₁ distance for features, MMD for structures) to generalization gaps .\n\nEmpirical Results: SHE show measurable reductions in structural GTID and performance gaps (Figure 5) which validate the hypothesis that explicit structural inductive biases matter."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Dataset: \n- Only citation networks and e-commerce graphs are tested. More critical domains like molecular graphs (where structural motifs determine properties), biological networks, and social networks are absent. Largest graph has 173K nodes, which is small. GTID's behavior and computational feasibility at scale (millions of nodes/edges) is unknown. From my understanding, GTID requires computing centrality for every node, which may prohibitively expensive for large graphs.\n\nBaselines: There are a lot of missing baselines from this paper.\n- No non-quantized transfer baselines: The paper does not compare against established continuous GNN transfer learning approaches such as GraphCL [1], SimGRACE [2], or GROVER [3] for molecular graphs, nor domain adaptation methods like AdaGCN [4] or UDAGCN [5]. Without these baselines, it is impossible to determine whether the observed GTID-related issues are fundamental limitations of discretization or simply artifacts of suboptimal VQ/RVQ implementation. The paper does not justify why quantization is necessary when continuous fine-tuning remains a viable alternative.\n- Alternative tokenizer comparisons: The paper focuses exclusively on VQ/RVQ but does not compare to other graph tokenization paradigms mentioned in related work, such as GFT's transferable tree vocabulary [6], OneForAll's task-level tokenization [7], or subgraph-mining approaches [8]. This makes it unclear whether high structural GTID is specific to vector quantization methods or a general challenge across all discrete graph representations.\n- Single encoder architecture: Only MPNN encoders are tested. Recent work has shown that Graph Transformers with structural encodings [9, 10, 12] and attention-based architectures like GPS [11] exhibit fundamentally different inductive biases. These architectures may interact with quantization differently. For instance, global attention mechanisms might better preserve structural information during discretization, or conversely, might suffer more from quantization artifacts.\n\n[1] Zhu et al., Graph Contrastive Learning with Augmentations, NeurIPS 2020. \n[2] Xia et al., SimGRACE: A Simple Framework for Graph Contrastive Learning without Data Augmentation, WWW 2022. \n[3] Rong et al., Self-Supervised Graph Transformer on Large-Scale Molecular Data, NeurIPS 2020. \n[4] Dai et al., Graph Transfer Learning via Adversarial Domain Adaptation with Graph Convolution, IEEE TKDE 2022. \n[5] Wu et al., Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Graph Convolutional Networks, WWW 2020. \n[6] Wang et al., GFT: Graph Foundation Model with Transferable Tree Vocabulary, NeurIPS 2024. \n[7] Liu et al., One for All: Towards Training One Graph Model for All Classification Tasks, ICLR 2024. \n[8] Jin et al., Towards Graph Foundation Models: A Survey and Beyond, arXiv 2024. \n[9] Rampaśek et al., Recipe for a General, Powerful, Scalable Graph Transformer, NeurIPS 2022. \n[10] Rampášek et al., Exphormer: Sparse Transformers for Graphs, ICML 2023. \n[11] Rampaśek et al., GraphGPS: General Powerful Scalable Graph Transformers, NeurIPS 2022. \n[12] Ling et al., UNIFIEDGT: Towards a Universal Framework of Transformers in Large-Scale Graph Learning, IEEE BigData 2024. \n\nPresentation:\n- TIDS (abstract) vs GTID (body)?
