Although existing Large (Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results, they still suffer from hallucinations, limited domain adaptation, and heavy reliance on extensive fine-tuning datasets. We introduce SynDoc, a novel framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these challenges. SynDoc features a robust synthetic data generation workflow that extracts structural information and generates domain-specific queries to produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific knowledge. In parallel, a recursive inference mechanism iteratively refines outputs from both models to achieve stable and accurate predictions. This integrated framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding, bridging the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world knowledge for key information extraction tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Document Understanding", "Multimodal Large Language Model", "Synthetic Data", "Key Information Extraction"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7c4a61c9a66fe401933c184cbe33d89041f3a1b3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes SynDoc, a hybrid framework for Key Information Extraction(KIE) from complex, domain-specific, visually rich documents. SynDoc's method has two main parts. First, it uses a Synthetic Data Generation workflow, where an MLLM automatically creates verified question-answer pairs from unlabeled documents. Second, this synthetic data is used to train a discriminative \"Warmer\" model, turning it into a domain expert. During inference, this \"Warmer\" provides domain-specific hints to a generative MLLM. The two models work together in a recursive loop, iteratively refining the answer."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper's originality stems from its creative combination: a hybrid discriminative-generative framework coupled with a \"recursive inferencing\" mechanism for iterative refinement. It also includes a synthetic data workflow with a multi-step verification process to enhance data quality.\n2. The paper demonstrates quality through its well-defined, multi-component SynDoc framework. This framework is logically decomposed into four modules, each fulfilling a specific purpose.\n3. The paper is clearly written and well-structured. The methodology is broken down into distinct components, and the use of diagrams visualizes the model architecture and the recursive workflow.\n4. This work addresses the significant problem of zero-shot key information extraction in domain-specific documents. By proposing a framework that avoids reliance on manual annotations, it offers a scalable approach for adapting models to specialized domains."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The framework's novelty requires clearer articulation. The proposed SynDoc architecture appears to effectively integrate several familiar techniques, such as synthetic data generation and iterative refinement. It would strengthen the paper to more clearly define the specific conceptual novelty that distinguishes this architecture from a sophisticated engineering of existing components.\n2. The empirical validation of SynDoc's effectiveness could be strengthened. The results in Table 1 show performance gains that appear marginal over the baseline MLLMs. Furthermore, the comparison is limited to these off-the-shelf models. Including comparisons against other recent, state-of-the-art methods in domain-specific KIE would provide a more robust validation of the framework's advantages.\n3. A more granular ablation study of the \"Warmer\" component is recommended. The \"Warmer\" is a core contribution, yet its \"Semantic Adaptation\" step is not independently validated in the ablation studies. While Table 2 shows the value of \"Structural Adaptation,\" a more detailed breakdown of the semantic tuning components would be necessary to fully justify the Warmer's design.\n4. The paper would benefit from an analysis of the accuracy-latency trade-off. The recursive inference mechanism inherently increases computational costs and latency with each iteration. A discussion is needed on whether the resulting accuracy improvements are significant enough to compensate for this added overhead."}, "questions": {"value": "Q: The empirical gains shown in Table 1, while positive, appear quite marginal over the baseline MLLMs in several cases.
