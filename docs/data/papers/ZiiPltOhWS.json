This challenge is amplified by the curl of the fitness landscape, which induces cyclic trajectories -- especially in competitive settings. To address these challenges, we propose Diffusion Co-evolution, an evolutionary learning framework inspired by diffusion processes. Our method facilitates robust opponent matching by enabling broad exploration across a diverse agent population. It leverages quality diversity to identify multiple high-performing strategies, even in environments with cyclic learning dynamics. Experiments in a StarCraft II combat environment demonstrate Diffusion Co-evolution’s superior stability and strategic diversity compared to conventional co-evolutionary baselines.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["competitive multi-agent environment", "real-time strategy games", "diffusion evolution"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/18e46cdd8151b40636d17fe10eb702e3ab8813ad.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper incorporates the idea of using diffusion into multi-agent competitive games.

Several notation, including major notations such as 'u,v,y' is not made clear.

While the hyperparameters are explained well, the other details, such as how the policy is represented as, is not explained well. Also, it would be nice to give a quick summary on the types of missions included in the Starcraft Benchmark, including the qualitative and quantitative summary on the tasks involved.\n\nWhile the idea is interesting, just comparing the algorithm with CMA-ES alone doesn't seems to be enough, as just one baseline isn't enough for a comprehensive comparison. Places to start for baselines would be Quality-Diversity papers. As diffusion in the context of this paper is used to generate diverse set of high-performing policies, Quality Diversity algorithms would highlight whether the diffusion algorithm indeed excels by giving diverse set of policies to choose from.\n\nFinally, some of the writing style can be improved.

Ablating temperature shows a tangible performance–diversity trade-off (Table 2), which is at least honest about the dial you are really turning."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. “Diffusion models are evolutionary algorithms” and Diffusion Evolution per se are established; this paper mostly slots them into a co-evolution loop with a temperature control and a simple surrogate. The core idea (use a diffusion-like denoising step as an ES to preserve multiple optima) is already articulated by Zhang et al. (ICLR’25) with stronger analyses and broader baselines.(https://openreview.net/forum?id=xVefsBbG2O) Here, there is no rigorous connection to PSRO / Nash-seeking procedures widely used for cyclic, non-transitive games (Lanctot et al.’17; surveys and fast EPSRO variants). (https://openreview.net/pdf/f5f84bde2c5f67e595132f7d301d41e2d57d7026.pdf) and (https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2024/0880.pdf) Simply evolving two populations without meta-game reasoning is not new in SC2; league training / exploiters / PSRO are the de-facto baselines.(https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphastar-grandmaster-level-in-starcraft-ii-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/)\n\n2. a) Reporting best/mean win-rate against random Dirichlet-sampled opponents (Eq.12) and distances as “diversity” (Eq.13) says nothing about exploitability, Nash mixing, or population robustness. Competitive evaluation needs Nash averaging / meta-game analysis, exploitability, or at least response-to-a-league (Balduzzi et al.’18; PSRO literature).(https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02643) and (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/file/cdf1035c34ec380218a8cc9a43d438f9-Paper.pdf)  \n\n2. b) The paper never computes exploitability or a Nash-averaged score. With cyclic rock–paper–scissors structure (Fig.2), your “best strategy” metric is meaningless.\n\n2. c) No league-style baselines (AlphaStar framework; robust opponent selection; goal-conditioned exploiters), despite SC2 being the canonical domain. (https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphastar-grandmaster-level-in-starcraft-ii-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/)\n\n\n\n\n3. The entire algorithm optimizes on (Alg.1 lines 16–31), yet we see no calibration curves, OOD stress, or human-grounded error bars A single MLP trained with CE on a synthetic dataset of size 10^5 (80/20 split) is extremely fragile for SC2 combat dynamics. What happens when f is mis-calibrated in a cyclic region? You may be diffusing towards a simulator artifact. \n\n4. You drop micro-management entirely and reduce SC2 to a static resource allocator (Sec.2.2; Alg.3). That is acceptable as a toy, but then comparing to CMA-ES only on two hand-picked budgets is not a result for ICLR. Modern SC2 works test league growth, robustness, offline datasets, PSRO-style meta-game—none of which appear here.(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372962307_AlphaStar_Unplugged_Large-Scale_Offline_Reinforcement_Learning)\n\n5. Using pairwise L_1/L_2 distances in the allocation vector (Table 2) is behavior-agnostic. QD literature emphasizes behavior descriptors (e.g., army time-to-kill profiles, matchup-specific outcome vectors, micro-robustness) and MAP-Elites/QD grids for maintaining truly functionally diverse elites (Mouret & Clune’15; QD surveys). (https://members.loria.fr/jbmouret/qd.html) and (https://quality-diversity.github.io/papers.html) and (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319619.3321904) A cosine in parameter space is not “strategy diversity”.\n\n6. A few curves with different c_T show a performance–diversity trade-off (Table 2), but there’s no seed variance, no training-time oscillation analysis, no Red-Queen/cycling diagnostics, no PRD/DOM population metrics. In competitive learning, “stable” means resistant to cycles under adversarial best responses; that is never tested.\n\n7. If the goal is “diverse, high-performing strategies in cyclic games,” the minimal baselines are: PSRO / EPSRO, Nash averaging, league training with exploiters, and QD (MAP-Elites) with behavior descriptors. None are present.(https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/94796017d01c5a171bdac520c199d9ed-Paper-Conference.pdf)\n\n8. Eqs.(1)–(4) are standard diffusion-evolution denoising with schedule \\alpha_t, noise \\sigma_t, and a reweight g. There is no theorem or stability analysis in the co-evolution setting (two interacting pops with cyclic payoffs). You owe at least a fixed-point or contraction discussion or meta-game view."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Report Nash averaging (Balduzzi’18), exploitability, and meta-game response graphs. Otherwise your results are not meaningful for cyclic SC2.\n\n2. You claim robustness and diversity in a non-transitive game; PSRO family is the baseline. Add PSRO/EPSRO and a league with goal-conditioned exploiters (Huang et al., NeurIPS’23).\n\n3. Provide calibration, error heatmaps over the strategy-strategy grid, OOD tests, and end-to-end re-evaluation of evolved populations in the true simulator (not \\hat f). Quantify the sim-to-surrogate gap per scenario.\n\n4. Replace L_p in allocation space with QD-style behavior descriptors and MAP-Elites coverage/PRD. Show that your “diverse” set spans functionally distinct strategies, not just different vectors.\n\n5. Is your diversity just temperature? Try alternative re-weights, schedules, and show sensitivity across seeds.\n\n6. Drop your evolved populations into a PSRO/league and show how quickly they are exploited. If quickly, your “stability” claim collapses. \n\n7. Add micro or at least perturbation robustness (fog of war, noisy micro skill). Right now this is a static allocator with a convenient surrogate—far from SC2.\n\n8.
