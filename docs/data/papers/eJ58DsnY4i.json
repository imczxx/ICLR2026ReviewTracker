We propose a neuro-symbolic framework that augments Swin Transformers with focal set reasoning and differentiable fuzzy logics. Rather than treating labels as isolated categories, the model induces focal sets by modelling overlaps in the learned embedding space, which helps capture epistemic alternatives beyond single labels. These focal sets form the basis of a belief-theoretic layer that uses fuzzy membership functions and $t$-norm conjunctions to encourage consistency between fine- and coarse-grained predictions. A learnable loss further balances calibration, mass regularisation, and logical consistency, allowing the model to adaptively trade off symbolic structure with data-driven evidence. In experiments on hierarchical image classification, our framework maintains accuracy on par with transformer baselines while providing more calibrated and interpretable predictions, reducing overconfidence, and enforcing high logical consistency across hierarchical outputs. Overall, our results suggest that combining focal set reasoning with fuzzy logics provides a practical step toward deep learning models that are both accurate and epistemically aware.", "tldr": "We propose a neurosymbolic epistemic framework that integrates fuzzy logic t-norms and focal sets into Swin Transformers.

However, the paper does not provide a comparison against the state of the art in the field. The authors can find a sizeable list of alternative methods even in an almost half-decade long paper [1]. The paper claims to have a comparison against the old Guo et al. baseline, but it is not available anywhere in the paper.\n\n* The paper exhibits a convoluted and unstructured presentation practise. It starts from an abstract that lacks a meaningful progression of arguments and continues with a similar introduction. For example, the second sentence says the deep neural nets are miscalibrated and logically inconsistent. These two are different problems. Which one is our focus? The third sentence says these problems are problematic in structured classification tasks. What does this mean and why uncertainty calibration is problematic particularly in structured tasks? The paper introduces the studied data sets in the methodology section and does not really introduce a concrete methodology anywhere.\n* The suggested combination of techniques such as differentiable fuzzy logic and focal set reasoning have not been justified anywhere. Their value added over the alternative tracks of uncertainty calibration have not been pointed out. The related comparisons to the state of the art are also missing.\n* The logical trail of the suggested solution doesn‘t follow a clear rationale. Section 4 introduces the architectural elements of a standard hierarchical classifier. It then jumps to introducing some basic elements from fuzzy logic in Section 5 and an existing application of it to probabilistic deep learning called RS-CNN. However it does not explain what this prior work is doing, which aspects of it are relevant for the problem at hand, and which limitation of it will be overcome. Then Section 6 admits to follow the ROAD-R approach without explaining or motivating it, which follows some performance scores definitions. These pieces do not really come together to make a concrete scientific hypothesis. As I point out in the questions section below, all this endeavour is also missing a clearly stated purpose.\n* Section 9 doesn’t specify an experiment plan. It is not possible see the big picture from the way the results are presented.

The Swin transformer is a very specific architecture. Why should it be the only considered backbone architecture? Why does it have to be such central in the story line? Which property of this architecture makes it representative?\n* Having read the whole paper, I am left a bit confused about the end goal of the paper. Is it to improve the calibration of the uncertainty predictions of deep learning algorithms as studied in the experiments or to improve the structural consistency of the calibration methods as claimed in the first sentence of the abstract? This is not a merely aesthetic concern. If the only measurable effect of the suggested improvement will be improved calibration scores, I am missing why we need all the complications introduced by the subjective logic concepts. Furthermore, I will also then wonder why the state of the art in post-hoc uncertainty calibration is sidestepped. I would at least expect to see a comparison against temperature scaling.

The authors assume the reader is familiar with belief functions, focal sets and other hyper-specialized concepts (like the architectures of RS-NN and ROAD-R). This is not necessarily the case. Equations are provided without any intuition as to what they are supposed to do. It *is* possible to make out what the authors mean, but the text doesn't make it easy. I strongly recommend the authors to provide clear intuitions for each and every equation.  Adding a figure depicting the inteded information flow in the model would also help.\n\nMoreover, standard quantities (like the definition of Gaussian distribution, which appears twice) can be removed.\n\nOverall, clarity is impaired by these issues and the paper as a whole feels unpolished.  It is also shorter than 9 pages (although this is just a symptom, not a problem by itself).\n\n**Quality**: The experiments are not convincing, for several reasons.\n\n - They only consider two datasets. The original works by Giunchiglia (cited by the authors as an inspiration -- Coherent hierarchical multi-label classification networks; NeurIPS and its journal version) provide a **twenty** already implemented hierarchical classification tasks that could be used for evaluation. It's not clear why the authors focus on just two.\n\n - The choice of competitors is not ideal.  Giunchiglia's own approach is not compared against.  More recent follow-ups, such as semantic probabilistic layers [1], are not compared against.  In a nutshell, the experiments do not consider the state-of-the-art in NeSy hierarchical classification.\n\n - The authors also neglect NeSy approaches specifically designed for calibration, such as BEARS [2] and NeSy diffusion [3].  (Admittedly, the last one might be *too* recent, feel free to disregard it if so; BEARS, however, is not.)\n\n- The choice of evaluation metrics is also not well motivated. Why top-1 accuracy? Why not using the same metrics used by Giunchiglia in their work and follow-ups?\n\nGiven the above, it is difficult to gauge the relative effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.
