However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing, performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available. In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained. As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata. Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series, show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging cases with higher part counts (>10). Importantly, our method surpasses traditional training-free inference-time approaches (standard few-shot, self-consistency) and further demonstrates strong improvements even on open-source models (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct).", "tldr": "Training-free framework that uses Error Notebooks + RAG to guide VLMs for specification-aware part retrieval in CAD assemblies, yielding significant accuracy gains (e.g., +23.4% on human-preference data).", "keywords": ["Vision–Language Models", "Error Notebook", "Specification-Aware Part Retrieval", "CoT Reasoning", "Human-Preference Dataset"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/edef1f6a2710c6b376f59ac00d2386ab7a26e22c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/18d30f7a879b4977bf1d82bce0f994ecfd73e8cf.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This manuscript discusses the specification aware part retrieval in complex 3D CAD assembly, which is a task that leads to VLM failure due to long context and poor reasoning ability.

However, the experiment (Table 1) only compared \"w/E-Notebook\" (its method) with \"w/o-E-Notebook\" (zero sample). Missing a key baseline: a standard few shot method based on RAG that only retrieves correct examples (i.e. (query, correct_CoT, correct_answer)).

What is the average token length and inference time per query? This is quite important for practical applications, as it is difficult to apply if the output result is too slow due to the long time of doing CoT.\n\n3.
