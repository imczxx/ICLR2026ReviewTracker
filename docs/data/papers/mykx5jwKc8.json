This assumption enforces symmetric modeling with shared encoders, yet real-world datasets often reveal distinct primary cycles for different variables. To address this gap, we introduce the Temporal Convolutional Association Block (TCAB), a flexible temporal convolution module that combines the strengths of attention and convolution to enable efficient asymmetric modeling of temporal and causal relationships. TCAB performs patch-wise equivalent sequence modeling by replacing attention score computation with learnable weights while preserving relative positional information. Building on TCAB, we propose the Temporal Convolutional Association Network (TCAN), a framework designed to capture asymmetric long-term dependencies and causal relationships across variables and patches. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that TCAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of TCAB and providing a robust solution for efficient asymmetric modeling in multivariate time series forecasting.

The presented periodicities are actually attention weight patterns, not ground truth periodic characteristics. The paper could be improved with a more solid proof that the identified research problem is actually a problem.\n\n**W3:** Experiments are missing for a thorough analysis.
