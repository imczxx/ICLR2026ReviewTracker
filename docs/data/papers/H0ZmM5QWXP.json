Gradient-based approaches are efficient but imprecise, while perturbation-based approaches achieve high fidelity at prohibitive cost. Visual Precision Search (VPS) represents the current state-of-the-art, but its greedy search requires a quadratic number of forward passes, severely limiting practicality. We introduce Faster-VPS, which replaces VPS’s greedy search with a novel Phase-Window (PhaseWin) algorithm. PhaseWin combines phased pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and adaptive control mechanisms to approximate greedy attribution with near-linear complexity. Theoretically, Faster-VPS retains approximation guarantees under monotonous submodular conditions. Empirically, it achieves over 95\\% of VPS’s faithfulness using only 20\\% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms all other attribution baselines on tasks such as object detection and visual grounding with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. Faster-VPS thus establishes a new state-of-the-art in efficient and faithful attribution.", "tldr": "Our paper proposes an accelerated algorithm for visual and multimodal attribution tasks, which reduces the time by about 90% while maintaining most of the performance.", "keywords": ["Explainable AI; attribution; visual grounding; multimodal"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1a5ec6ca570782110e8a1000a89d21cbcd1562db.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper focuses on accelerate the previous method called Visual Precision Search (VPS), which is designed to explain results by foundation model-based object detectors, such as GroundingDINO and Florence-2.

This could cause me to misunderstand parts of the paper. Nevertheless, I list some notable weaknesses below.\n\n- The paper is hard to follow as it extensively uses terminologies without definitions. For example, it is unclear what \"faithfulness\" and \"Insertion AUC\" mean in Figure 1. The paper does not define them before using them. Due to this, I cannot understand the terms and their relations, e.g., how \"Insertion AUC\" measures \"faithfulness\".\n\n- Line 182 explains \"for maximizing the ordered insertion-AUC objective\" but it does not define \"insertion-AUC objective\" in the paper. \n\n- Figure 2 is confusing. For example, the right panel means to illustrate \"Phasewin Internal Loop\" but the diagram does not display loops.\n\n- Line 075 mentions \"a dynamic supervision policy\" and Line 208 formally introduces \"two policies\". Are these policies designed manually or by learning?\n\n- Line218 states \"Greedy search is both a curse and a shackle in the development of submodular function maximization algorithms\". Can authors clarify what \"a curse\" means? What \"a shackle\" means? Do authors mean that greedy search is an inferior method here?\n\n- The theories in Section 3.4 are either from (Nemhauser et al., 1978; Fujishige, 2005) or based on them with an assumption that \"the objective F is monotone submodular\" (Line235). However, the paper does not justify whether the objective F is monotone submodular. Refer to Line 260 which mentions \"the submodularity assumption\".\n\n- The paper lacks important details or explanations on the crucial modules. For example, Algorithm 1 uses two functions \"PartitionCandidates\" and \"WindowSelection\" but neither of them is sufficiently explained in terms of implementations. As the difference of this paper and the VPS paper is whether to use Algorithm 1 or greedy search, the reader cannot fully understand the technical contributions without the important details.\n\n- The visual results are expected to discuss how the method can be used to explain failures of foundational detectors, beyond their success. To note, the VPS paper contains such. Moreover, the visual results are hard to read. For example, the texts in Figure 3 are too small to identify. The colors in this figure are also confusing."}, "questions": {"value": "The reviewer asks the authors to address each point in weaknesses listed above and does not repeat them in this Questions box."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "dZwG5pQRlb", "forum": "H0ZmM5QWXP", "replyto": "H0ZmM5QWXP", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3472/Reviewer_ZnqN"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3472/Reviewer_ZnqN"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3472/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761452690108, "cdate": 1761452690108, "tmdate": 1762916743239, "mdate": 1762916743239, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "QmnYojpyPF", "forum": "H0ZmM5QWXP", "replyto": "H0ZmM5QWXP", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3472/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3472/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763067592272, "cdate": 1763067592272, "tmdate": 1763067592272, "mdate": 1763067592272, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose an improvement to the VPS attribution method by introducing a new algorithm to improve the search space constraints of the original work.

It cannot be denied that this is a less significant contribution overall than the baseline VPS work.  \n\nMany figures and tables are too small or hard to read. The tables are overly aggressive in their use of text resizing. Heatmaps in Figure 3 are not presented in a very interpretable color. It is hard to differentiate regions.
