Numerical solvers typically provide reliable solutions but are burdened by prohibitive costs due to fine-grained discretization and iterative procedures. Recent machine learning (ML)-based approaches attempt to accelerate computation through fast ML inference, yet they are often trained on trajectories produced by numerical solvers, resulting in reduced accuracy and limited generalization. Designing a TDDE solver that achieves good accuracy and high efficiency remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we introduce DS-TG, a novel TDDE solver that employs Dynamical Systems (DS) as Trajectory Generators (TG), exploiting the intrinsic connection between DS and TDDEs. DS-TG leverages a DS-based processor whose physical states evolve continuously in real time according to carefully designed dynamics that directly emulate the target TDDE. This approach represents a novel paradigm fundamentally distinct from traditional discrete-time methods, offering inherent advantages in both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the continuous evolution of DS-TG can be seen as partitioning the target trajectory into a continuum of infinitesimal time steps, thereby reducing the problem to learning the trajectory gradient at each intermediate state of evolution. Building on this foundation, we further introduce two hardware-friendly techniques to enhance the dynamics design: (1) Laplacian-style interactions for effectively capturing spatial derivatives and (2) higher-order interactions for better representing higher-order temporal derivatives. Extensive experiments across representative TDDEs demonstrate that DS-TG achieves superior accuracy while delivering up to $10^4\\times$ efficiency improvement compared to baseline methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Dynamical Systems", "Time-Dependent Differential Equations"], "primary_area": "infrastructure, software libraries, hardware, systems, etc.", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/be51d04c78ff0162c802bdbf00527d82c59b12bf.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a novel approach for solving time-dependent differential equations by leveraging dynamical systems as trajectory generators.

Overall, it is very unclear what exactly was implemented by the authors. The authors state that they build on the BRIM framework, but it is unclear if the authors actually did create a real-life hardware version of their model and ran their experiments on it, or if they just simulated the BRIM architecture using conventional machine learning libraries. The paper does not include any information on how the parameters of their DS-TG models were tuned, adding to the confusion.\n\n\n2. The experiments seem inadequate for the problem setting considered. It seems like the paper is concerned with solving PDEs that are fully known in advance. However, the FNO and UNet models do not use this PDE information, and are just trained on some examples of the solution field (unknown equation problem). Therefore it is not surprising at all that FNO and UNet result in larger errors than the proposed method.\nPINNs do use PDE information, and is the only baseline that seems relevant to the problem. However, PINNs are usually trained with much finer grid than the 16x16 grids considered in this paper, making it a very easy baseline to beat.\nI believe, for the problem setting, a more adequate baseline is to use classical numerical solvers for ODEs / PDEs of lower order than the one used to generate the data. \n\n\n3. I also feel that the \"gradient-based trajectory mapping\" lacks novelty. The idea of learning the vector field generating the time series data, instead of trying to model the solution values themselves is not entirely a new idea. Neural ordinary differential equations is an example of such a method, where the neural network is used to learn the unknown vector field from data.\n\n\n4. The PDEs considered by the authors (as well as the resolution) are quite simple compared to the benchmark systems used in recent papers."}, "questions": {"value": "In additions to the points raised in the Weaknesses section, here are some additional questions:\n\n1. So what exactly was done? Did the authors actually create hardware implementation of their proposed framework, or did they just run numerical simulations? If the former, can the authors provide more detail on how the hardware was constructed?\n\n2. The authors mention that the alignment between the PDE to solve and the processor dynamics is established by discretizing the original PDE into grids and mapping them on to the processor nodes. This seems to be the key learning algorithm. How was this done? Did the authors manually determine the parameters of the processor nodes? Is there an automated algorithm?\n\n3. Regarding the experiments, how were each of the models trained? For PINN, did the authors just use 16x16 collocation points? For FNO and UNet, how were the training and test datasets constructed? For each model, how many parameters did each have? \n\n4. Noting that derivative operations are also just linear operations, at the end of the day, the proposed model is just a high dimensional linear coupled differential equation with learnable coefficients. Is a linear model sufficient to model nonlinear phenomena? Can the authors explain why this linear model is able to predict the Burger's equation with good accuracy? What about other nonlinear equations?\n\n5. Figure 5 does not contain the results for the authors' method. Please provide the relevant information.\n\n6. Implementing this framework in the real world will introduce noise effects and other imperfections not present in the model formulation. Are such effects negligible or do the authors have a way to counteract those influences?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 0}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "gzTUFBaVl3", "forum": "GFpgsUzq8w", "replyto": "GFpgsUzq8w", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21433/Reviewer_rtWe"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21433/Reviewer_rtWe"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21433/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761897207885, "cdate": 1761897207885, "tmdate": 1762941769413, "mdate": 1762941769413, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
