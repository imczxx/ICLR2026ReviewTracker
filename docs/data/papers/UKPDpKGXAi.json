Despite attempts to make the community aware of this\nconfound, a significant number of publications continue to use the\nconfounded dataset, thereby drawing unsupported conclusions.  We\npresent a new experiment that conclusively demonstrates that the\nidentified confound in the dataset cannot be explained away by\nrecourse to factors such as block design, session duration, number of\nsubjects, or pooling multiple subjects.  We advise caution when\ndesigning, conducting, and interpreting the results of experiments\nthat use this problematic protocol.", "tldr": "We demonstrate that the protocol used to collect about 18 datasets used in nearly 100 papers in irreparably flawed.", "keywords": ["EEG"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/718119c8a877056197a006a78cf460aae52fbc14.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper focuses on temporal drift as a confound or 'embedded clock' in prominent EEG experimental designs.

On this point, the paper itself comes in at under 5 pages, with no appendices. This itself is not a showstopper for me: some of the best papers are short. However, if the quantity of content is limited, I expect the content in the main text to be information-dense and of very high quality. I do not find that it is, both in presentation and content.\n\nIn particular:\n1. The paper primarily replicates and extends prior refutation studies with minor methodological variations, offering limited new theoretical or analytical insight.\n2. Only six subjects were tested, which constrains generalisability and statistical power, especially given EEG’s high inter-subject variability.\n3. While the study controls the temporal confound, other possible sources of bias (e.g., fatigue, attention drift, order effects beyond class blocks) are acknowledged but not experimentally tested."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
