However, the cross-domain generation remains a persistent challenge, as existing methods model time-series interactions either at the granularity of individual points or fragmented segments. This limits their ability to capture and adapt to complex periodic patterns inherent in diverse domains. Specifically, point-wise attention struggles with long-range dependencies, while standard patch-based approaches may break important cyclical structures. To address this, we introduce Winformer, a novel diffusion model framework built on a window-wise Transformer. We shift the fundamental processing unit in the attention mechanism from pairwise points similarity to continuous windows comparison of the entire horizon. By operating on semantically richer window representations, the proposed approach effectively learns and transfers complex periodic patterns across domains. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate Winformer's effectiveness, achieving an average performance gain of 10.67% over SOTA baselines.", "tldr": "We propose a new generative model for time-series with window-wise alignment.", "keywords": ["time series generation; diffusion model; frequency modeling"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5a83ae7d06e12e4d3115625e707eb10835aafbbb.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d345da7b28dec5bc58ad4da0f92b42527cb1fd06.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focus on time series generation problem.

Limited Scope of Applicability: While the paper motivates time-series generation as a foundational step for broader applications (e.g., imputation, feature augmentation, domain adaptation, and foundation modeling), the proposed methodology appears tightly coupled to diffusion-based generation tasks, particularly imputation via denoising. The Ample attention and window-wise processing are innovative for capturing periodic patterns in generative settings, but the paper does not demonstrate or discuss their utility in other core time-series tasks, such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, or clustering. For instance, it's unclear how Winformer would integrate into non-diffusion pipelines, where attention mechanisms typically operate differently. This narrow evaluation raises questions about the generalizability of the contributions to the wider time-series field, potentially limiting its impact beyond specialized generation scenarios.\n\n2. Methodological Novelty and Integration: The Ample attention builds on established ideas like Fourier decompositions (e.g., from Alaa et al., 2021) and window-based processing, but the expansion to window-to-window alignments via learnable convolutions feels somewhat incremental rather than transformative. The overall architecture (e.g., combining diffusion with Transformer layers) echoes recent works like CSDI or TimeDiff, and it's not evident how the window-wise shift uniquely resolves limitations in pairwise or patch-wise approaches beyond empirical gains. Additionally, hyperparameters like window size (p) and stride (s) could introduce sensitivity, but without thorough ablations, their robustness is unclear.\n\n3. Experimental Validation: The claimed average improvement is promising, but the experiments seem confined to cross-domain generation metrics, without extensions to downstream tasks. .The 12 datasets are diverse, but details on domain shifts or failure cases are limited in the provided sections. Cross-domain focus is emphasized, but without metrics like domain discrepancy measures.\n\n4.
