The core of APLA lies in fine-tuning only a random subset of columns in the attention output projection layer (Wo). Although the experimental results are impressive, the method itself lacks theoretical depth or architectural innovation, resembling more of an \"empirical observation\" than a rigorous methodological breakthrough.\n2. The number of columns fine-tuned in Wo, denoted as r, is a hyperparameter. As shown in Figure 7, the optimal r varies significantly across different datasets. Moreover, the authors claim to have used hyperparameter search to determine the best r. I argue that this may lead to reported metrics that merely reflect cherry-picked favorable outcomes from random trials, without sufficient evidence demonstrating the method’s genuine effectiveness.\n3. The authors claim that applying other methods to Wo also yields improvements; however, as shown in Table 10, the gains are marginal at best, and the FACT method even shows a slight performance drop. This undermines the persuasiveness of the authors’ conclusions.\n4. Prior studies[1] suggest that certain columns in Wo may correspond to core capabilities of the model, and fine-tuning these regions can lead to catastrophic forgetting.
