However, most existing watermarking methods require access to the decoding process, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. One illustrative example is the use of LLMs by dishonest reviewers in the context of academic peer review, where conference organizers have no access to the model used but still need to detect AI-generated reviews. Motivated by this gap, we introduce In-Context Watermarking (ICW), which embeds watermarks into generated text solely through prompt engineering, leveraging LLMs' in-context learning and instruction-following abilities. We investigate four ICW strategies at different levels of granularity, each paired with a tailored detection method. We further examine the Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) setting as a specific case study, in which watermarking is covertly triggered by modifying input documents such as academic manuscripts. \nOur experiments validate the feasibility of ICW as a model-agnostic, practical watermarking approach. Moreover, our findings suggest that as LLMs become more capable, ICW offers a promising direction for scalable and accessible content attribution.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["LLM", "Watermark", "In-context Learning"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/38e765e14cd87af98e02d7b713a20d5e09a7e2a4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper explores In-Context Watermarking for LLMs, a kind of approach that embeds watermarks into LLM-generated text solely through prompt engineering.

The adaptive attack experiments (Table 10) showing partial watermark removal are included transparently. This intellectual honesty strengthens the paper's credibility.\n- The Indirect Prompt Injection setting for detecting AI-generated academic reviews represents a timely motivated use case."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The paper's primary weakness lies in presenting existing techniques as novel contributions while failing to properly acknowledge prior work. In-context watermarking is not a new concept. The idea of using prompts to embed watermarks has been explored in multiple prior works, yet the authors provide no discussion of this existing literature in their Related Work section. More critically, the four proposed ICW strategies lack originality and are straightforward applications of well-known techniques. Unicode ICW using zero-width characters is an extremely common information hiding technique that has been extensively studied for decades, representing standard steganography practice rather than a novel contribution. The Lexical ICW directly borrows the green/red-list concept from KGW, the only difference is implementation via prompts rather than logits manipulation. Acrostic steganography has centuries of history, and recent work has already demonstrated using ChatGPT for acrostic-based information hiding (https://daniellerch.me/stego/text/chatgpt-en/), yet this precedent is not mentioned. Furthermore, the paper provides no meaningful insights beyond these straightforward applications. The contribution essentially reduces to showing \"you can ask LLMs to follow watermarking instructions via prompts\", which is a trivial observation given modern LLMs' instruction-following capabilities.\n\n- Even setting aside novelty concerns, the proposed methods demonstrate fundamental practical limitations that severely constrain their real-world applicability. As the authors acknowledge, these heuristic approaches significantly compromise output text quality. The methods are also fragile against simple attacks: even without knowing the specific watermarking scheme, adversaries can substantially remove watermarks through text rewriting. This fundamental vulnerability undermines the practical utility of ICW. Additionally, the approach exhibits strong model capability dependency, only working with the most advanced models like GPT-o3-mini.\n\n- The proposed ICW methods can be understood as straightforward applications of well-established concepts without meaningful innovation. The IPI setting is essentially a benign variant of indirect prompt injection attacks, the novelty of \"using this for watermarking instead of attacks\" is incremental at best. Similarly, instructing models to embed hidden patterns via prompts is conceptually identical to in-context backdoor insertion, yet the paper does not acknowledge or discuss this connection. \n\n- The ICW methods suffer from fundamental compatibility issues with diverse writing scenarios. For instance, Acrostics ICW, which constrains sentence-initial letters to follow a predetermined sequence, is unsuitable for many real-world applications such as technical documentation and code comments. \n\n- The paper claims to be the \"first\" to explore ICW, but provides no systematic literature review to support this claim."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
