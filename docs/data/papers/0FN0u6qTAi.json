We introduce the \"Protein-as-Second-Language\" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs sequence–question–answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot setting, without any further training. To support this process we curate a bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein–QA instances spanning attribute prediction, descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4o, achieving up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs, when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation models.", "tldr": "We propose a protein–language framework and bilingual dataset that enable LLMs to reason about protein function via context-driven learning without fine-tuning.", "keywords": ["Large language models; Protein–QA dataset; Context-Driven Learning; Zero-shot learning"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/68dc93b54dfdeefd77080a635770b44d29c1e969.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces the \"Protein-as-Second-Language\" framework, which aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to interpret protein (amino acid) sequences as if they were acquiring a second symbolic language.

The paper cleverly reframes protein sequences as a \"second language,\" allowing general-purpose LLMs to build protein-function mappings in a zero-shot regime. This paradigm bridges symbolic biological and natural languages, bypassing the need for task-specific fine-tuning or retraining and creatively leverages LLMs' in-context learning strengths.\n2. A substantial and well-constructed bilingual (protein-natural language) dataset is curated, addressing redundancy at both sequence and annotation levels. Figures 1 and 3 illustrate a careful, step-wise reduction of redundancy with diverse coverage across species, protein families, superfamilies, and ontology categories.\n3. The method is evaluated on multiple datasets (ProtDescribe, Protein2Text-QA, Mol-Instructions) with frozen, general-purpose LLMs (Qwen, GPT-4o, Mistral, Kimi) and compared against strong protein-LLM baselines (BioT5-plus, ProLLaMA). Main results (Table 1) and multiple figures demonstrate robust performance gains in both automatic (ROUGE-L) and human evaluations, frequently surpassing or matching fine-tuned specialized models."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Weaknesses\n1. The methodology’s underpinnings, particularly the bilingual context construction mechanism (Section 3.2), lack precise mathematical formalization. While Equation-based thresholds (for sequence and annotation deduplication, Section 3.1.1/3.1.2) are provided, the procedure for query-to-context matching (how candidate exemplars are scored and integrated, and any ranking or aggregation formulae) is only described at a high level. For instance, does selection use hard thresholds or similarity-weighted composition? What is the precise mathematical form of the query-context similarity metric for textual and sequence components? Without a formal definition of, for example, the joint scoring function or aggregation, it is difficult for others to re-implement or to affirm the reproducibility or generalizability of the context construction process. Explicit equations or algorithms are expected for a submission at this technical level.\n2. While the empirical evaluation is extensive by the standards of current protein-language model research, critical baselines are missing:\n   - Direct comparison with leading analogy/reasoning-augmented LLM paradigms, such as those leveraging knowledge graphs (e.g., ANALOGYKB[1]), hierarchical retrieval (e.g., BeamAggR[2]), or reinforcement-learning-based self-correction (e.g., SeRL[3], AlphaEdit[4], Self-Correct RL[5]), is not present.\n   - There is also a missed opportunity to benchmark efficiency: the computational cost of in-context \"second language\" understanding (which requires substantial prompt assembly with many exemplars) is never compared directly to the one-time fine-tuning cost of protein LLMs, or to parameter-efficient adaptation approaches (e.g., S-LoRA[6], MoDeGPT[7]). Without this, claims of scalability remain qualitative.\n3. The central claim—LLMs can generalize protein understanding more efficiently through contextual exemplars—is only validated empirically under a restricted set of Q/A regimes. There is no attempt to analyze theoretical properties: e.g., under what assumptions does the contextual analogy paradigm guarantee generalization or compositional reasoning for proteins? What are failure modes if distributional shifts exist (out-of-distribution proteins/annotations not covered by exemplars)? The paper could benefit from at least some basic analysis or a discussion of the limitations.\n\nreferences\n[1] Yuan, S., Chen, J., Sun, C.

As far as I understand, a group of proteins might be very different from each other even though they share similar GO annotations.
