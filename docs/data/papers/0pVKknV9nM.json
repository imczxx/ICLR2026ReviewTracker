Our framework introduces $\\textit{SIC-Detection (SIC-D)}$ that spots style imitation by making style-imitating texts less unexpected through probability analysis conditioned on human-style instructions, and $\\textit{CIC-Detection (CIC-D)}$ that filters content interference by difference analysis between probability distributions conditioned on contrasting style instructions, exploiting the insight that identical models exhibit equivalent content-related surprises.\nThe final detection score is composed of SIC-D and CIC-D components.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that SaFT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 4.9\\% in average AUROC and 20.4\\% in average TPR @ 10\\% FPR.", "tldr": "We propose a novel framework termed SaFT to improve LLM-generated text detection accuracy by spotting style imitation and filtering content interference.", "keywords": ["LLM-Generated Text Detection", "Zero-Shot"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0572af61dad55988d8383d65489025eeaa415701.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit advanced text generation abilities, underscoring the need for reliable detection to mitigate misuse.

To tackle these challenges, the authors propose SaFT, a novel framework that employs a Style-Oriented Instruction Prefix (SOIP) to guide probability analysis. SaFT integrates two modules: SIC-Detection (SIC-D), which identifies style imitation through human-style conditioning, and CIC-Detection (CIC-D), which mitigates content interference via differential probability analysis between contrasting style instructions.

From Appendix A.4, this paper seemingly adapts a default setting of each detector, and thus the proxy model is different for each detector. Based on previous findings [1,2], selecting which models for the proxy would heavily affects the detection performance. Therefore, for fair comparison, it would be necessary to use a common proxy model consistently for each detector. (For instance, why does the proposed method choose Llama-3.1-8B-instruct as a proxy?)\n- **The unclear necessity of CIC-detection:** It is unclear how the value of β varies across samples. For instance, does β change for texts generated with special prompts compared to more general ones? If it remains constant, the necessity of introducing β itself is questionable. Moreover, Table 3 shows that the detection performance is substantially low when using only CIC-D, yet combining it yields higher performance than SIC-D. It would be helpful to clarify why this occurs.\n- **The choice of instructions:** The motivation of using “Express ideas using concise sentences” and “Express ideas using detailed sentences” as instructions to represent human and LLM writing style is ambiguous. Moreover, the human (or LLM)-style instruction in Appendix C is not always the case for real-world scenarios. People will use more tailored and special prompts to mimic human-writing or prompting with few-shot human-written texts, for instance.\n\n---\n### References\n\n[1] Mireshghallah et al.

This assertion appears questionable. Conditioning an LLM on a human-style instruction $I^h_{SIC}$ should not intuitively make its \"regular\" outputs less probable or more surprising. Since regular LLM text already reflects an average human style inherent in its pretraining distribution, such conditioning would likely either decrease or increase perplexity (based on how well the model has been pre-trained); but it would not remain unaffected by this conditioning. If the goal is to identify differences between human text, human-style LLM text and regular LLM text, this method would be flawed.\n- The hypothesis behind SIC-C appears fragile and highly dependent on the specific choice of $I^h_{SIC}$. If model developers were to craft or optimize this instruction carefully, it could yield even lower perplexity outputs, even for human-written text, thus invalidating the detector’s assumption. Since $I^h_{SIC}$ is realistically a black-box component, this would reduce robustness of the proposed method. The authors should also provide sensitivity analysis across diverse instruction variants.\n- Formally, human-style LLM text can also be thought of the model sampling from regions of the probability space that are uncommon but represent human-like diversity. Prior work [1] demonstrates that such diversity can be achieved through alternative means, such as diverse prompts or high-temperature sampling. Since high-temperature sampling also increases diversity and reduces predictability, it could interfere with the detectors. Evaluating the detector's behavior on texts generated under varying temperature settings would be helpful here.\n- In Eqn. 5, the inequality direction appears incorrect. Given that $\\alpha(t)$ is expected to be low and $\\beta(t)$ is expected to be high for LLM-generated text, $\\text{SaFT}(t)$ should naturally be lower for such samples. Therefore, the condition should likely be $< \\tau$, not $> \\tau$. The authors should revisit and verify this formulation.\n- It is unclear how the two proposed detectors collectively contribute to distinguishing between LLM-generated and human-written texts. The paper suggests they are primarily effective in identifying human-style LLM outputs, but not for standard LLM vs. human text discrimination. Clarification or additional justification is required.\n- The experimental setup (Appendix B.2) evaluates only human-style LLM texts and genuine human texts. The authors should include pure LLM-generated text in order to avoid any bias. \n\n\n---\n\nMinor Errors:\n- L88: \"poduce\" to \"produce\"\n\n[1]  Zhang et al.
