A DT policy predicts actions by attending to a limited history of tokens that encodes states, actions and returns-to-go. Two existing extensions of DT, namely Online Decision Transformers (ODT), and Critic Guided Decision Transformers (CGDT), are re-implemented and applied to the Gym-$\\\\mu$RTS environment. In CGDT, a critic learns to predict reward distributions conditioned on sequences of interwoven states and actions to overcome DT's issues with stochasticity. In ODT, an additional entropy term and hindsight reward relabeling enable online fine-tuning. A dataset is generated from 3000 games between CoacAI and Mayari, two previous Gym-$\\\\mu$RTS competition winners, on procedurally generated 8x8 maps. We further explore the combination of both CGDT and ODT methods to create a novel model called the Online Critic-Guided Decision Transformer (OCGDT). Training proceeds in three phases: (1) supervised learning of the critic using a fixed dataset of 3000 trajectories, (2) supervised learning of the policy from the same dataset, and (3) online fine-tuning of the policy, using the dataset as a starting point for a replay buffer. The critic and offline networks are validated against 500 held-out trajectories, while the final policy’s performance is measured by its win rate against four benchmark scripted bots (CoacAI, Mayari, lightRushAI, and workerRushAI). The agent obtains a win rate of $26.2\\\\%\\\\pm4.3\\\\%$ against CoacAI and a win rate of $40.1\\\\%\\\\pm4.8\\\\%$ against Mayari over 4 seeds per match-up and 100 games per seed for a total of 400 games per match-up on held-out procedurally generated 8x8 maps.

Several other examples show up in the paper as well.\n\nThe idea is clever and the setting is quite interesting given that most offline RL papers are applied to the same benchmarks. There is some technical innovation in converting the problem and getting both the DT-based algorithms and IQL to fit within the $\\mu$RTS setup."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The contribution of OCGDT needs to be made more clear. Is this novel? Non-trivial? The re-implementation of ODT and CGDT on $\\mu$RTS problems is interesting in its own right, but again it is unclear if this is the contribution or if it is the creation of a new architecture / algorithm.\n\nIn general it is unclear if this approach actually worked. This is perhaps fine given that this is a new foray into this setting from offline RL. But the paper itself mentions that recently ML-based approaches have achieved competitive results in RTS settings. Why, then, is the proposed approach not competitive?\n\nn my opinion, there are several important things to add to the paper (e.g. a more robust IQL description), and hopefully in the main body. Therefore as an editorial suggestion, things like line 334-338, \"Training is performed on a Windows 10 machine...\" can then be moved to an appendix. These and other similar details are much appreciated and necessary but can likely be moved without degrading the quality of the paper."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The results are somewhat puzzling. My understanding is that the offline data consists of games between CoacAI and Mayari. In the parlance of Offline RL, one might call these \"expert\" datasets. Why, then, do the methods not achieve parity with either of these baselines? In the case of IQL this is somewhat explanable as it is largely doing imitation learning, and CoacAI/Mayari may be doing things out of distribution at test time. (And if that is the case, is the buffer size appropriate? Should it be larger?) Then, for the online methods, i.e. those of this paper, why don't they perform better?\n\n2. In Table 2, the most interesting thing to me is that CGDT appears to be essentially even wtih IQL (or IQL with sufficient resources). Both of these are offline and therefore, they are imitating each other. Does this suggest that the DT part of the architecture doesn't really matter, and that online finetuning and/or online experience is of first-order importance?\n\n3. Line 423, \"This suggests a larger and more diverse dataset...\". I agree with this conclusion but I do not think the ablation was necessary to reach it. The fact that IQL has parity with the DT approaches, and that neither are competitive with the expert baselines, suggest that something is amiss with the dataset or perhaps that offline RL is not the correct approach. In standard offline RL datasets, the underlying distributions of the environments are stationary; in the case or RTS, the agent is actually playing a game with the environment, and it (the \"environment\", which is CoacAI or whatever) changes its distribution according to how OCGDT (or whatever) is behaving. It seems like offline RL will never work for such a case, although the exploration of different and better datasets is encouraged.\n\n4. Line 284: \"The actor, the critic, and the value function have separate parameters for state representation\". Is this simply saying that there are 3 different neural networks? What is meant by \"state representation? The paper could be improved by adding an architectural figure for IQL (probably in the appendix) and making the distinction between IQL details and the various DT details. These are very different things; for example, one doesn't do return-to-go conditioning in standard IQL. Furthermore, is there a transformer in the IQL set up? In other words, is IQL set up with the standard IQL loss functions, the set of neural networks, etc, but that the various neural networks also have transformers? How are they tokenized, and how is this different than DTs (which need return conditioning)? Section 3.3 is probably the least clear part of the paper, and IQL is not really described anyway (while the two variants of DT actually are explained, as well as their combination).\n\n5. The setup to ensure a fair (or \"reasonably\" fair, or the most fair possible) comparison between IQL and OCGDT is much appreciated. To play devil's advocate, however, this might require a bit more justification. The argument here seems to be about getting an approximately equal number of \"experiences\" of the data and/or online interactions, and/or gradient steps. This is a solid foundation to start. But each (IQL and OCGDT) have their own hyperparameters at play. So just as a thought experiment, what if Approach A has 100K tunable parameters and Approach B has 100B. In this admittedly extreme example, is it really appropriate to say that having the same \"experience\" yields a \"fair\" comparison?\n\nAgain, in line 362, DT-based methods require an order of magnitude fewer updates, but are they parameter efficient with respect to IQL? The subsequent text appears to explain this somewhat (i.e. the text about training for wall-clock time and number of gradient steps).\n\n6.
