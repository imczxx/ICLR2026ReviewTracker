However, biological processes like transcription are directional, and genes can be encoded on either the plus or minus strand.

This claim requires justification, as canonical splice sites (e.g., GT-AG dinucleotides) are strand-specific motifs. Their reverse complements are not functional splice sites. The authors should provide a justification for applying an RC-invariance prior to this task.
