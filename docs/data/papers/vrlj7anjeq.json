DP calibrates noise to be on the order of an individual's contribution. Due to this calibration, a private estimate obscures any individual while preserving the utility of the estimate. Since the original definition, many alternate definitions have been proposed. These alternates have been proposed for various reasons including improvements on composition results, relaxations, and formalizations. Nevertheless, thus far nearly all definitions of privacy have used a divergence of densities as the basis of the definition. In this paper we take an information geometry perspective towards differential privacy. Specifically, rather than define privacy via a divergence, we define privacy via the Rao distance. We show that our proposed definition of privacy shares the interpretation of previous definitions of privacy while improving on sequential composition.", "tldr": "Rather than use divergences to define differential privacy, we introduce the first distance metric based definition of DP via the Rao metric.", "keywords": ["Differential Privacy", "Information Geometry", "Rao metric"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/414d61221b8f48ee33ae0ce518ab570616fda85a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new variant of Differential Privacy (DP) called “Rao Differential Privacy” (Rao DP).

What is the use case for Rao DP? Is it a promise of tighter composition in general? If so, the paper would benefit from an example where it improves over e.g., GDP.\n2. There are no conversion theorems in the paper from Rao DP to other DP variants (or vice versa). Is this endemic to how Rao DP is defined (the avoidance of divergence), or is it possible to give meaningful conversion theorems? In the case of Gaussian DP there are conversion results from Gaussian DP to zCDP and approximate DP.\n3. You analyzed the Laplace and Gaussian mechanism, for which you could derive the Rao DP guarantee cleanly. Do you expect the guarantee for other DP primitives such as randomized response, sparse vector technique, report noisy max, exponential mechanism etc., to follow as cleanly? Generally speaking, is proving Rao DP for an algorithm easier or harder compared to e.g., approximate DP?\n4. Conversely, is there any structure in the definition of Rao DP that make it amenable to showing strong lower bounds?\n5. How would you explain the guarantee afforded by 1-Rao DP, without discussing the output distribution of the algorithm satisfying it?\n6. On page 3, you have a footnote saying you only consider sequential composition, and not e.g., parallel composition. Does Rao DP satisfy parallel composition?

However it is not properly cited i.e., it is not apparent that the equations given in Sec 2.3 Example 1 have been derived in [1] when it is the case. Please refer to them like \"from the result in Section 4.2 of [1]\". The same is the case in Sec 3.1 (the equation just above Lemma 3.2) where a result from [1] is directly written as well as applied in Lemma 3.2. Wherever direct equations from a source paper are re-written, it is expected to cite the source clearly.\n\n2) Apart from the post-processing proof Sec 3.2, the paper lacks novelty of theoretical contributions, although the idea of using the Rao distance for DP is interesting. The theoretical analyses could have been extended for a 2-dimensional manifold, as most of the results for 1-dimensional case has been derived in previous works already as pointed out above\n\n3) Line 453 seems to be a misleading statement and seems to indicate a strong advantage for the Rao DP framework which is incorrect. Gaussian noise mechanisms will lead to non-zero privacy leakage since the privacy loss RV is unbounded. By changing  the notion of DP to the Rao DP framework one cannot  claim the following statement \"As opposed to approximate DP, we do not have a second\nparameter such as $\\delta$. This is a strength of our framework since, as noted previously, this $\\delta$ is the\nprobability of privacy leakage. Our formulation does not allow such a case\" (line 453-455 of the paper). In fact most works in DP usually give a conversion from their notion of DP to the standard $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ notion of DP since that is the widely accepted operational notion of DP. Gaussian mechanism will lead to non-zero privacy leakage and the fact that Rao DP does not reveal this is actually worrisome.\n\n4) The impact of the derived results is not clear since  here differential privacy (ie Rao DP) is defined in\nterms of a distance metric for densities while other notions are divergence based, hence, how will one compare across these different notions of DP?  To get a better perspective some empirical results would help. It would be useful to see an application where this notion of Rao DP helps \n\n\nminor comments\n1) At certain places, the writing style of the paper is not formal.
