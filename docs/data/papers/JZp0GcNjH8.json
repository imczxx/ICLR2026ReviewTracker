The empirical evaluation tests the model on three real-world datasets specifically chosen to represent different non-stationary scenarios (stable, positive-shift, and negative-shift).

The framework offers a specific form of explainability by visualizing the mechanistic uncertainty (Fig. 3).

Limited and Incomplete Definition of \"Robustness\"\n\nThe paper's claim of superior \"robustness\" is based on a limited and incomplete definition. The experiments define robustness almost exclusively as the ability to handle non-stationary distribution shifts, such as the covid-JP outbreak. However, the experiments fail to test for robustness against other critical, real-world data challenges, namely (1) missing values and (2) noisy data.\n\n2. Limited Experimental Scope\n\nThe experimental scope is limited. The range of horizons and lookback window sizes studied is narrow, and there is a lack of experiments on larger datasets that feature more nodes and complex temporal patterns.\n\n3. Narrow Uncertainty Quantification and Misleading Explainability\n\nThe method's uncertainty quantification is relatively narrow. It only quantifies parameter uncertainty (e.g., $\\beta, \\gamma$), while ignoring the far greater model uncertainty (that SIR is a flawed model) and data uncertainty (reporting noise). Basing the system's \"trust\" on this incomplete uncertainty model undermines the central claim of reliability. Consequently, the \"explainability\" is also misleading; visualizing the model's internal uncertainty is merely a self-referential explanation of its components, not a true epidemiological insight into the causes of an outbreak."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

However, the SIR model used in the study is defined for a single location. It is well established that when modeling spatiotemporal dynamics, the SIR framework must incorporate connections between locations to capture the exchange of cases across them (see, for example, [1]). In addition, it is well known that the SIR model is not suitable for modeling COVID-19 dynamics, see [4] for a review on more appropriate models. Therefore, the mechanistic model employed in this paper is not appropriate for the spatiotemporal setting considered.\n\n* The methodology section includes an extensive discussion on uncertainty quantification, yet the experiments do not report a single metric evaluating uncertainty calibration. The paper’s motivation highlights the “lack of sufficient flexibility to handle uncertainty,” but it remains unclear why the authors chose not to present any uncertainty analysis. This omission is particularly notable given that several recent works on diffusion models for forecasting explicitly emphasize and evaluate uncertainty calibration (see, for example, [2]), whereas this paper appears to disregard it entirely.\n\n* The mechanistic guidance is not a novel technical contribution, despite the authors’ emphasis, as similar ideas have already been explored in several prior works (e.g., [3]).\n\n* While the authors claim that the mechanistic model enhances explainability, no experiments are presented to demonstrate or validate this claim.\n\n[1] Lloyd, A.L. and Jansen, V.A., 2004.
