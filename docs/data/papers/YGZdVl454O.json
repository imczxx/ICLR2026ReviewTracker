Existing approaches rely heavily on human review or unimodal AI models, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To bridge this gap, we propose IPR-GPT, a novel multimodal framework that redefines automated IPR auditing by integrating a Multi-Agent Audit Framework and an Audit Reversal Data Augmentation mechanism. MAAF leverages a structured multi-agent collaboration strategy, combining specialized experts in visual analysis, textual reasoning, legal compliance, and exemption handling. By systematically exploring the trade-offs between Vision-Language Models and lightweight vision models, MAAF achieves a performance boost of up to 24.26% in key IPR audit tasks. AR further enhances model robustness by synthesizing hard-to-classify audit cases, improving generalization in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IPR-GPT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, setting a new benchmark for multimodal IPR enforcement.

unspecified e-commerce platform over one year, lacking diversity across regions, product categories (e.g., luxury goods, pharmaceuticals), and IPR violation types (e.g., patent infringement), limiting the framework’s generalization to global or niche e-commerce scenarios.\n- Opaque Expert Collaboration Logic: The paper does not detail how the Comprehensive Expert synthesizes outputs from other experts (e.g., weight assignment to different experts, conflict resolution for contradictory expert decisions), reducing the framework’s interpretability and reproducibility.\n- Neglect of Dynamic IPR Regulation Adaptation: E-commerce IPR regulations vary by jurisdiction and evolve over time (e.g., new exemption rules for second-hand digital goods), but IPRGPT’s rule-based Exemption/Law Experts lack mechanisms to automatically update to regulatory changes, requiring manual intervention.\n- Insufficient Comparison with Domain-Specific SOTA: While the paper compares IPRGPT to general LLMs/VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5), it fails to benchmark against existing domain-specific IPR auditing models (e.g., specialized trademark detection systems or e-commerce compliance tools), making it hard to contextualize its novelty in the broader IPR research landscape.\n- **This paper appears to be generated by LLM, but there is no LLM usage statement.**"}, "questions": {"value": "- The small sample size (1,837) of the IPR-Audit dataset may lead to overfitting, as the model may learn platform-specific patterns rather than general IPR violation characteristics, reducing its applicability to other e-commerce platforms.\n- The lack of dataset diversity (e.g., no coverage of non-physical goods like digital software or regional IPR variations) means IPRGPT may fail to detect violations in underrepresented categories or jurisdictions.\n\n- Unclear synthesis logic of the Comprehensive Expert hinders reproducibility, as other researchers cannot replicate how expert outputs are aggregated to form final audit decisions.\n\n- The absence of dynamic regulatory adaptation means IPRGPT requires continuous manual updates to comply with new IPR laws (e.g., EU’s Digital Services Act), increasing operational costs and delaying enforcement.\n\n- The failure to compare with domain-specific SOTA models leaves uncertainty about whether IPRGPT’s performance gains are incremental or transformative relative to existing IPR-focused tools.\n\n- MAAF-β’s reliance on precomputed embeddings for lightweight models may limit real-time adaptability, as updating embeddings for new brands or logos requires retraining, slowing response to emerging counterfeit tactics.\n\n- The paper does not evaluate IPRGPT’s performance under adversarial attacks (e.g., sophisticated logo manipulations or text obfuscation), leaving gaps in understanding its robustness in real-world scenarios where counterfeiters actively evade detection.\n\n- **This paper lacks an ethics statement, an open-source

It argues that breaking down the identification process into smaller partially independent tasks and giving them to specialized experts is (1) cheaper and (2) better performing than using a single unified foundational model for making the decision. In specific, the identification process is split among four domain experts and the final one which based on the previous expert's outputs makes a single Approve/Reject decision. This pipeline is named Multi-Agent Audit Framework (MAAF), and two variations of it are proposed, in the first variation, $\\text{MAAF-}\\alpha$, foundational LLM and VLM models serve as experts, while in the other $\\text{MAAF-}\\beta$ specialized smaller models serve the same purpose. The authors also fine-tune Qwen2.5 model to serve as a dedicated comprehensive expert named IPT-GPT. This model is fine tuned on IPR-Audit dataset introduced in the paper and uses audit reversal data augmentation during the training process to improve robustness and consequently performance of the resulting model on the given task. The results show that using smaller specialized experts in $\\text{MAAF-}\\beta$ almost always outperforms using bigger foundational models as experts in $\\text{MAAF-}\\alpha$ across a variety of models.

While the authors state that there is a lack of prior work on IPR, they clearly cite some of it intended for single modality in Section 2.1. Why not take a single state of the art approach out of those listed in the given section and use it as a baseline to see how this work ranks among existing body of research? One would expect that multimodal nature of this work would give it a significant advantage and show that moving forward multimodality is the way to go. In line with this, what's the reasoning for not evaluating the approach on already available datasets so that the results can be compared with the existing work. Moreover, if there is no intention of publicly releasing IPR-Audit dataset, in isolation the evaluation results would not mean much as they would not be comparable with other past or future methods.\n\nWhat is the reasoning for focusing exclusively on accuracy based metrics in the evaluation? Confusion matrix based metrics (such as recall, precision, TPR, FPR and F1 score) are much more informative for this use case, especially when the prevalence of infringement cases in the test data is not specified. On that note, could it be possible to list BFI and TMI pass@1 of classifiers that always return Approve/Reject respectively? It would help to see how the proposed methods compare even to these \"dumb\" classifiers.\n\nThe arguments presented in 4.2 about tensor swapping are relatively weak, as the two parts of $\\text{MAAF-}\\alpha$ can be done in batches one after another rather than subsequently for each sample (or using separate GPUs for each part of the pipeline). Moreover, even reasoning expert alone takes a substantial amount of memory of the GPU, which may cause tensor swapping or out of memory error as key value store size increases during generation and activation requires additional memory on top of the model weights.

From my understanding their inputs are just included in the input of comprehension expert, so excluding some information wouldn't make much difference from the engineering standpoint. Considering that IPR-GPT is fine-tuned on specific inputs, it can be excluded in that study and focus on $\\text{MAAF}-\\beta$ instead. This is important in order to see how important each modality is for the given framework and whether there are redundancies in the proposed solution.\n\nIPR-Audit dataset appears to be a significant contribution.
