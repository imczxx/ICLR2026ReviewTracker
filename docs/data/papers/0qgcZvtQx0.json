We propose a novel theoretical lens for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs.  Under this paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program, where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. This paper introduces a framework to operationalize this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure. Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong, verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our work provides a principled bridge between the emergent, often opaque reasoning of LLMs and the rigorous semantics of formal systems, proposing a new direction for the mechanistic interpretability of complex, multi-step reasoning.", "tldr": "We treat Chain-of-Thought as a formal proof using the Curry-Howard correspondence to mechanistically verify its faithfulness", "keywords": ["Reasoning", "Programs", "Verification"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/57d845c28979033a527352ea308b58ea8e44d0a3.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/13557e3d4dac13a9eaee69e400750adf750694db.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper describes an approach to certifying the faithfulness of a given Chain of Thought used to perform a numerical calculation, by translating a given CoT into a computational flowgraph of type operators in a functional language.

In this manner, the process of certification can be used as a precision filter for a reasoning model's output on this class of problems (GSM8K is the benchmark used in the paper), and higher thresholds for coverage and precondition satisfaction yield improved accuracy at the cost of coverage."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "In this reviewer's opinion, the application of the Curry-Howard isomorphism to LLM trustworthiness is innovative.
