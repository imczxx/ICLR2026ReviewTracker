We introduce $\\textbf{S}$tructure-aware $\\textbf{Q}$uantum $\\textbf{Diff}$usion (SQ-Diff), the first full quantum diffusion model for this task, designed to leverage potential quantum advantages in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era. Structural priors (e.g., inter-atomic distances) are encoded into the initial quantum state via a novel state preparation procedure that yields a unified normalization scheme dependent only on the number of atoms. The denoising process is driven by a Quantum U-Net, a fully quantum architecture that combines learnable variational quantum circuits with parameter-free operators. Training is guided by these structural priors enforced through a graph-based objective function to maintain structural consistency. Experimentally, SQ-Diff generates valid and diverse 3D molecules and shows improved performance over existing quantum-based methods. While a gap in generation quality compared to leading classical models remains, our model matches the inference speed of the fastest classical approaches with only a few quantum parameters, setting a new benchmark for pure quantum generative models.", "tldr": "We propose the first fully quantum diffusion model (SQ-Diff) for efficient 3D molecule generation, leveraging a quantum U-Net architecture and novel structural encoding.", "keywords": ["Quantum Machine Learning", "Quantum Diffusion Model", "3D Molecular Generation"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ecc742eca233a61cd2a27d72a41d05ce56209ff2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce the first quantum diffusion model for 3D molecule generation.
