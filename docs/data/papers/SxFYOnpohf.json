The proposed codec has a multiplication-free encoder with only 124-bit lightweight parameters, which is suitable for deployment at the edge of an iBMI system. To reduce the parameter size, a dynamic weight generation mechanism for parameter sharing within the window is implemented in the encoder design. On the decoder side of the codec, a conventional multilayer convolutional neural network with a specially designed loss factor – Energy Aware Loss (EAL) is adopted, which adds adaptive attention to the total loss function to improve reconstruction performance by emphasizing the signal energy intensive regions of the input data section. The parameter storage is reduced by 97% on the encoder side, compared to a conventional FC-based autoencoder with INT8-quantized weights. Large-scale evaluations show that NSC is capable of restoring high-fidelity neural signals and preserving the biological features across diverse neural signal datasets, making it a promising data compression approach for high-throughput iBMI systems. Furthermore, preliminary generalization experiments on other biomedical signals such as ECG (MIT-BIH) further demonstrate the potential of NSC as a general resource-efficient compression framework for streaming biosignals.", "tldr": "We proposed a hardware resource efficient codec with light weight encoder used for neural signal compression in brain machine interface systems, maintaining high fidelity as well holds the cluster information.", "keywords": ["Codec", "neural signal compression", "hardware resource efficient", "implantable", "brain machine interface"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2a4a5e9172983e8cd244ed489b0b2f7ad8c5ce62.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/382fd001294fe541f8d5ac12c88f513fd9eb565f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a Neural Signal Codec (NSC) designed specifically for implantable brain-machine interface (iBMI) systems.

Equation 7 indicates the NSC produces discrete codes, but it's unclear whether compared methods (especially AE_FP32) also produce discrete representations. If not, the comparison becomes unfair. Additionally, the paper doesn't specify if all methods were compared at equivalent bitrates, which is essential for meaningful compression performance evaluation.\n​​Incomplete Results Interpretation:​​ Table 4 shows significant performance gaps in clustering metrics (F1 score: 0.98 for AE_FP32 vs. 0.72 for NSC), but the paper doesn't adequately discuss whether this level of performance degradation is acceptable for practical neural signal analysis.

Additionally, Tables 4 and 5 are difficult to read, as there is no visual indication of what the reader should focus on, given the plethora of data presented.\n3. The design choices and the algorithm are not motivated well: \n- a) In the “Ablation Studies”, the authors point out that “The general trend across datasets is that performance improves with larger w”, but later claim that “larger window counts increase storage without consistent gains across datasets”, showing inconsistencies in design choices and reasoning. \n- b) Moreover, the increase in memory is not quantified. \n- c) Moreover, some parts of the algorithm are not explained. In the energy-aware loss, the authors mention smoothing e (line 248) and then smoothing it again with Equation 8. \n4.
