The model leverages keyframes as conditioning signals to inject target identities and combines them with full-pixel source video references to preserve non-identity attributes. To solve the scarcity of paired training data for reference-guided tasks, the authors construct the Face2FaceSwap dataset using an inverse data strategy—treating GAN-generated swapped videos as inputs and original videos as ground truth. Additionally, the model uses temporal stitching to ensure smooth transitions in long videos split into fixed-length chunks.

By directly using full-pixel source videos as references, it effectively preserves fine-grained attributes like micro-expressions and lighting.\n- Dataset: The Face2FaceSwap dataset and inverse training strategy are practical and effective. By reversing the roles of GAN-generated swapped videos (inputs) and original videos (ground truth), the model obtains high-quality, artifact-free supervision—addressing a critical bottleneck for reference-guided training.\n- Applicability: The keyframe-based identity injection and temporal stitching modules are tailored to real-world needs. They support variable-length long videos, reduce manual frame-by-frame editing effort, and maintain robustness in challenging scenarios (occlusions, side profiles), making it suitable for professional film/TV production."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The model relies on InSwapper (an industrial face-swapping tool) to generate high-quality keyframes. While the paper mentions robustness to suboptimal keyframes, it does not clarify how the model performs if the keyframe generator (e.g., InSwapper) fails severely (e.g., extreme occlusions, blurred faces), which limits its adaptability to low-quality source videos.\n- Training requires 8 NVIDIA H200 GPUs, and inference splits videos into 81-frame chunks. The paper lacks analysis of computational efficiency (e.g., inference time per frame, memory usage) compared to lightweight methods (e.g., InSwapper, SimSwap), which may hinder deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.\n- The model focuses on preserving facial attributes (lighting, expressions) but does not discuss how it handles non-facial context (e.g., hair, accessories, background shadows linked to facial lighting).

In general, this section is very vague, I did not find any point where you actually describe how the identity is injected. In Figure 3 it is just shown as \"Per-frame edit\", but never said how this is done. It is quite frustrating to read. Furthermore you say \"we seleect video frames meeting industrial face-swapping criteria\". What are these criteria ? How are the frames chosen ? If the process is not automatic, then it makes the process significantly heavier, so this should be really clear.\n\n- Section 4.4, the dataset construction. In this section, you say that there is not enough data with source/target pairs of the same person, and that you therefore (line 297) \"generate synthetic data using face-swapping models\". This seems extremely problematic ! You are basing your method on a database which is created with another editing method, so how can you hope to do better than this method ? While I accept that this is just to extract the non-identity attributes, it is still problematic. Furthermore, to compound the problem, you do not even say which method you used to do this (or I could not find a reference) ! And finally, you do not compare to this method, which would be the minimum to do. Or if you did compare to the method, we cannot know, since you never give the name of the method. Even if there is a reason why the first argument (you cannot do better than your dataset) is not valid, I would have at least expected you to discuss it.\n\n- In Figure 3, you have an arrow saying \"loss\" but I can find nowhere in the paper where you explain this loss ? Is this just the reconstruction loss ? You should at least say this once. The inly time you talk about training is in section 5, the experiments, in the \"Implementation Details\" paragraph. It seems to me that stating that the model is fine-tuned and how it is fine tuned is more than a simple implementation detail.\n\n- Section 5.3, line 465: \"As shown in Table 1, Living face achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics and average ranks\". This is not true !! In none of the metrics are you better than the state-of-the-art. I do not at all think that it is necessary to beat the state of the art consistently in every situation, nor even in any situation if your method possesses some useful attribute (faster, simpler to implement/understand etc.).\n\nOther details:\n\n- p.3, line 161. \"significantly fewer steps\": fewer than what ?

Although the authors claim they try to better preserve the attributes of the source video by conditioning on the full source video, the reviewer is not convinced this can be achieved by the proposed framework. The authors constructed the \"inverse\" dataset using existing per-frame swapping methods, using the swapped video as input. However, with this strategy, the swapped video (which serves as the input) and the original video (which serves as the GT) cannot be guaranteed to have the same attributes. Therefore, using these data pairs for training does not ensure the preservation of attributes from the source video. Moreover, the input videos (the GAN-swapped results) are not temporally consistent, which will further enlarge the gap between the training and inference stages.\n\n2. The proposed pipeline is not an end-to-end solution. It has a critical dependency on a pre-existing per-frame face swapper (e.g., Inswapper) to generate the initial keyframes. If the keyframe editing fails, the final swapped video will likely fail as well.\n\n3. Regarding the evaluation results, the quantitative metrics do not show clear superiority over existing methods. Meanwhile, the reviewer recommends that the authors also report the model's runtime to better demonstrate its practical advantages.\n\n4.
