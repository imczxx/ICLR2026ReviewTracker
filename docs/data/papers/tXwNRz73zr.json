To address this, we introduce Adaptive Localized latent outlier Synthesis and Exposure for Time-series (ALSET), designed to operate within the latent space of any representation learning backbone, leveraging learned embeddings to enhance OSR performance for time-series.\nALSET is an outlier exposure mechanism that generates outliers by modeling the empty space around the samples from known classes using multiple Gaussians and sampling from them. It constructs local Gaussian distributions centered on known samples in the latent space, with learnable, per-dimension standard deviations, which are estimated by a neighborhood estimator. These distributions expand during training through a feedback loop between the classifier and the neighborhood estimator, which learns the structure of these Gaussians while preventing overlap with known samples.\nFor evaluation, we adapt several state-of-the-art OSR techniques, originally designed for computer vision, to the time-series domain for the first time, establishing a comprehensive baseline for this underexplored area. Extensive experiments on UCR, UEA, and HAR benchmarks demonstrate that ALSET consistently surpasses these baselines, achieving state-of-the-art OSR performance while preserving known-class F1. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.", "tldr": "ALSET improves open-set recognition in time-series by generating latent-space outliers via adaptive local Gaussians, boosting unknown detection while preserving known-class accuracy.", "keywords": ["Open Set Recognition", "Outlier Exposure", "Time Series"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/759f3ee0c2ebe39d58eb375ebb1986ee8f62154b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ALSET, a method for open-set recognition (OSR) in time-series data.

The paper would be significantly strengthened by a more rigorous analysis or theoretical intuition explaining why this adaptive mechanism is necessary and how it better captures the OSR space compared to a well-tuned fixed variance.\n3. **Experimental Setup Concerns:**The strategy of designating the \"last class\" as unknown for UCR/UEA is arbitrary and may not reflect realistic OSR scenarios where unknown classes can be semantically or distributionally \"near\" or \"far.\"\n4. **Baselines Lack Timeliness:** The empirical comparison is not state-of-the-art.

The proposed ALSET framework operates entirely in latent space and does not exploit any temporal or sequential characteristics of time-series data. The approach is modality-agnostic and could be directly applied to image embeddings. It is therefore unclear what makes ALSET a time-series-specific OSR method beyond the dataset choice and encoder architecture\n\n2. ALSET generates synthetic unknown samples by drawing from a Gaussian distribution centered on each known embedding. This implies that the generated unknown samples are close to known data, whereas true unknowns can lie anywhere (potentially on the tails of the Gaussian). Although the adaptive variance mechanism may expand the space, there is a high probability that the synthetic unknowns do not represent truly out-of-distribution examples.\n\n3.
