Due to the prohibitive cost of fine-grained annotations, current reward models typically learn from holistic response scores to determine outcome rewards. However, this coarse-grained supervision makes it difficult for the reward model to identify which specific components within a response trajectory truly correlate with the final score, leading to poor generalization of unseen responses.\nIn this paper, we introduce an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to propagate coarse, response-level supervision into fine-grained learning signals. Inspired by a Bayesian framework, our method enforces a simple principle: The rewards of adjacent generation processes should be more consistent when the connecting token has a higher generation probability.\nWe apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization yields better DPO-aligned policies and achieves superior best-of-N inference-time verification results.

Main claim not empirically supported: The paper claims that ICRM improves credit assignment along trajectories, but the presented heatmaps primarily reflect accumulative error effects (probabilities naturally decay toward later tokens in autoregressive models). Without disentangling this from the regularizer’s effect, it is unclear whether credit assignment actually improved.\n\n2. Visualization is confounded by probability decay: Figure 3’s token-level heatmap shows reward decline mainly in later segments, which likely results from accumulated log-probability decay rather than effective intra-step credit redistribution. No analysis isolates the effect of the regularizer from this autoregressive bias.\n\n3. Selective reporting and overstatements: Claims such as “ICRM surpasses all GRMs” are overstated. Tables show categories where GRM still performs better (e.g., Chat domain). The improvements are average, not universal.\n\n4. Lack of statistical rigor: Standard deviations and multiple random seeds are missing for most key metrics. RLHF evaluations rely solely on a single automatic judge (QRM-Llama3.1) rather than human ratings, making results less reliable.\n\n5. Credit signal concentrated at sequence end: Section D.10 shows that ICRM primarily improves error detection in later parts of the trajectory, with little gain in early steps. This suggests that the method strengthens terminal penalties rather than distributing credit more effectively throughout the process.\n\n6. No control for probability influence: Since the regularization explicitly uses next-token probability as its weighting factor, the correlation between probability and reward consistency should be empirically verified. The authors provide no statistical analysis (e.g., correlation plots or regression residuals) to support the assumed relationship.\n\n7. Weak comparison baseline: The paper only compares against GRMs, but recent implicit PRM and DPO-Q works (e.g., Yuan et al., 2024; Rafailov et al., 2024) already achieve process-level supervision from outcome labels. Without including those baselines, it is unclear whether ICRM offers any genuine advantage.\n\n8.

Have you compared ICRM directly against implicit PRM or DPO-based Q-value approximations, which also derive process-level feedback from outcome labels?\n5. Can you visualize cases with early or mid-sequence errors rather than only late errors to test whether ICRM truly improves step-level credit assignment?\n6.

On the other hand, the distribution of the actor model can shift considerably as training progresses. Although the authors conducted related experiments in the Appendix, I believe these are insufficient and require more ablation studies involving different model sizes, model series, and training steps.\n3.

The main purpose of using a BT model is to address reward modeling issues in PPO. For algorithms like DPO, which only require preference information, directly training on the original preference dataset would be more straightforward.

This mechanism hinders the model's ability to identify specific high-quality segments within a response, often leading to poor generalization. \n\nTo mitigate this, the authors introduce Intra-Trajectory Consistency Regularization (ICRM), a novel method designed to propagate response-level supervision to a more fine-grained, process level. The core mechanism enforces consistency between the reward values of adjacent generation steps, weighted by the next-token generation probability from a separate, frozen generator model. This encourages the reward model to learn smoother and more meaningful reward landscapes without incurring the high cost of manual, process-level annotations. \n\nThe empirical validation is comprehensive, demonstrating that ICRM achieves statistically significant improvements on the RewardBench benchmark and that these gains translate directly into superior performance in downstream applications, including guiding DPO policy optimization and enhancing selection accuracy in Best-of-N inference-time verification. \n\nHowever, primarily, the discussions of reward modeling in this context typically center on PPO-like or GRPO-like RL methods; therefore, the paper would be strengthened by presenting more extensive results in this area. Furthermore, a key motivation for DPO is its relative simplicity and convenience compared to traditional RL-based methods. This paper, however, trains a separate reward model to generate improved preference data, arguably re-introducing complexity and additional overhead. To improve the paper's soundness, the authors should provide more direct comparison experiments with established RL-based methods, such as PPO and GRPO, RLVR ,including the result comparison and the time&resource cost. \n\nIn summary, while the proposed method is interesting, the paper requires significant revision to address these limitations before it can be considered for acceptance at the ICLR 2026 conference."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The primary strength of this paper is its novel, intuitive, and highly practical regularization method.

Basically, the discussions of reward modeling are often about PPO-like or GRPO-like algorithms; thus, the paper would be strengthened by presenting extensive results comparing ICRM-enhanced DPO against these methods on more benchmark datasets. Furthermore, a key motivation for DPO is its simplicity relative to complex RL-based pipelines. The proposed method re-introduces a separate, trained reward model, which adds complexity and overhead. To establish the paper's soundness, a direct comparison with methods like PPO, GRPO, and RLVR-based methods is essential, and this comparison should evaluate not only downstream performance but also the associated time and resource costs.\n\n2) The theoretical motivation in Section 3.1 is presented as a formal derivation from a Bayesian framework, yet it appears to be overstated. The step equating a scalar reward value with a conditional probability is a significant conceptual leap rather than a mathematically rigorous step. This framing undermines the credibility of the stated theoretical foundation. The work would be more defensible if this section were reframed as providing the intuition and motivation for the approach, rather than presenting it as a formal proof.\n\n3) The methodology introduces several complex mechanisms, such as the mean-centered calibration technique and the mutually weighted binary cross-entropy loss, without adequate justification in the main text. The authors do not sufficiently explain why these specific formulations were chosen over simpler alternatives, such as a standard L1 or L2 loss. While these justifications are provided in the appendix, their absence from the core methodology section makes the design feel arbitrary and less compelling. Integrating these critical design rationales into the main paper is recommended.\n\n4) The introduction and related works session is not sufficient. The authors should more explicitly differentiate their work from process-supervised models like PRM, emphasizing the primary advantage of achieving fine-grained supervision without requiring fine-grained labels. Furthermore, a sharper distinction should be drawn between ICRM, which regularizes the final reward values based on generation dynamics, and other methods (e.g., GRM) that regularize the model's hidden states."}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "41rWAajboL", "forum": "Q7YwCym2jH", "replyto": "Q7YwCym2jH", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6830/Reviewer_rzdv"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6830/Reviewer_rzdv"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6830/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761721001396, "cdate": 1761721001396, "tmdate": 1762919093539, "mdate": 1762919093539, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Reward model training usually uses coarse, response-level supervision, which can miss which parts of a trajectory actually drive the final score and can overfit to spurious cues (e.g., length).
