However, current LLMs often generate incorrect answers with high confidence, causing significant risks in downstream decision-making. Prior approaches for inducing verbalized confidence, including reinforcement learning or external probing, have shown limited generalization across complex reasoning and unseen tasks. We introduce Confidence-Supervised Fine-Tuning (CSFT), a simple method that trains models to output both an answer and an explicit confidence statement. CSFT substantially reduces calibration errors while also improving accuracy, induces emergent self-verification behaviors such as self-checking under low confidence, and reshapes token distributions into a locally smooth structure around correct answers. Furthermore, although trained only on reasoning tasks, CSFT generalizes to non-reasoning benchmarks such as MMLU. These results establish verbalized confidence as a scalable mechanism for improving calibration, reasoning, and generalization in LLMs.", "tldr": "CSFT trains LLMs to verbalize confidence, yielding better calibration, accuracy, self-verification, and cross-task generalization.", "keywords": ["calibration", "reasoning", "LLMs", "self-verfication"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b8857b1f5781186957ee6dd362e5942c235e3584.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/317de47731fe94181fe9e33e6580dcde344dcf10.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents confidence-supervised fine-tuning (CSFT), a training paradigm where models are trained to express verbalized confidence.

There have been previous works from as long as 3 years ago [1] which use a very similar setup. \n- **Experimental Design and Strength**: No baselines (except a simple pre-trained model) are presented in the results, making it difficult to identify the strengths of the method relative to existing works in the field. Some results presented in this paper are also surprising, and merit deeper analysis. In particular, it is unclear to me how this method improves accuracy without optimizing for it in any way. \n- **Writing**: The writing of the paper is informal at times and can be significantly improved. For example “we basically do not apply loss to the reasoning trace” (Line 185) makes it unclear whether a loss to the reasoning trace is being applied or not. \n\n[1]: Lin, S., Hilton, J., & Evans, O.

Teaching models to express their uncertainty in words. arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.14334."}, "questions": {"value": "- **Confidence supervision**: Why is empirical accuracy used as a proxy for confidence? This approach marginalizes out the reasoning trace, which is often key to determining confidence (e.g., models may realize mid-reasoning that a solution is correct).\n\n- **Relation to classifiers**: How does this method differ from training a standard classifier that predicts correctness given a reasoning trace? If the model simply outputs a confidence score without reasoning about it, the setup seems equivalent to classification fine-tuning.\n\n- **Novelty**: How does this work differ from prior studies (e.g., [1]) that fine-tuned verbalized confidence using accuracy supervision? How exactly is this different from training a classifier?\n\n- **Accuracy Improvement**: Given that no loss is applied to reasoning traces or answers, why does accuracy improve? A deeper investigation of why this is happening is important, as this is an unintended by-product. Please clear my understanding if I am wrong, but since there is no optimization over the reasoning traces and final answer, and there is a KL to the original model, then optimizing such an objective should not alter the reasoning traces or accuracy at all. Also, the claim of accuracy improving does not seem to be generally substantiated. The accuracy improvements in table 1 for the Qwen model are negligent, suggesting that this trend does not hold generally. \n\n- **Confidence variance**: What is the variance of predicted confidence across different reasoning traces or answers for the same question? \n\n- **Confidence-Guided Reasoning Path Refinement**:  Please provide more details on this. Is this method only applicable for the prefix confidence variant? If a model is prompted for confidence directly after the question, then how will resampling when it outputs low confidence increase accuracy, even if the prompt is different? The resampling prompt asks it to consider an alternative approach but based on my understanding, it has not considered any approach yet (since the confidence was directly after the question). What does alternate refer to in such a scenario? Instead, a better alternative might be to do sequential sampling with the suffix prompt. If the confidence turns out to be low, reprompt the model with its original attempt and predicted confidence, and ask it to generate a new answer with higher confidence.  \n\n- **Figure 1:** Fig 1 is not a good way to present results. The bars in the graph represent different metrics and thus the deltas are not easily comparable. Table 1 is a better way to summarize these results. \n\n- **Baselines**: Please add more baselines to allow placing this work relative to existing work: \n     - *Shared Classifier*: Train a classifier on top of the reasoning model. This baseline should also have the same accuracy as the pre-trained model, but it uses representations of the model which is generating the answers.\n     - *Separate Classifier*: Train a separate classifier model conditioned on generations from the reasoning model. This baseline should have same accuracy as the pre-trained model.\n\n[1]: Lin, S., Hilton, J., & Evans, O. (2022).
