Existing learning-based planning methods follow a deterministic paradigm to directly regress the action, failing to cope with the uncertainty problem. In this work, we propose a probabilistic planning model for end-to-end autonomous driving, termed VADv2. We resort to a probabilistic field function to model the mapping from the action space to the probabilistic distribution. Since the planning action space is a high-dimensional continuous spatiotemporal space and hard to tackle, we first discretize the planning action space to a large planning vocabulary and then tokenize the planning vocabulary into planning tokens. Planning tokens interact with scene tokens and output the probabilistic distribution of action. Mass driving demonstrations are leveraged to supervise the distribution. VADv2 achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance on the CARLA Town05 benchmark, significantly outperforming all existing methods. We also provide comprehensive evaluations on the NAVSIM dataset and a large-scale 3DGS-based benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

There are already several methods to construct vocubulary for trajectories in autonomous driving, such as K-disks sampling in Trajeglish [1] and uniform quantization in Motionlm [2].

The idea from motion tasks of [1] and [2] is easy to apply to end-to-end planning. Thus, the probabilistic planning lacks significant novelty as the major contribution of the paper.\n4.

Also, the pre-defined vocabulary can be seen as a prior, and it can be different across datasets. I want to know the zero-shot cross-dataset performance of your method.\n2. Since the vocabulary is very important, I would like to see more discussion on different ways of discretization, and its discretization error, a discussion on how this error would affect the performance would make your work more comprehensive.\n3. In terms of the loss function, since you have discretized the whole action space, why use cross-entropy instead of the KL-divergence?\n4. The ablation study on Tab. 4 is really hard to give useful information. For example, I want to know whether the conflict loss is useful; I can't find the exact setting that only w/ or w/o this loss.
