Generative approaches promise faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods, but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. \nBuilding on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates (RMSD <2 &  PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8% reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent generalisation to unseen proteins.

Presumably the authors start with a holo structure that is already altered towards accepting the ligand in question (?), thus making the task easier and unsuitable for fair screening across apo structures (or holo structures corresponding to different ligands). Reaching AF3 performance now does not make the method \"the first\" deep learning method to surpass physics based docking. \n\nComparisons are not to the state of the art methods. E.g., DiffDock (2023) has already been surpassed by its own refinements and by other methods.
