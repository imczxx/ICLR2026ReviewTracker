However, existing technologies depend on static linguistic features, which can be evaded as advanced models increasingly mimic a wide range of writing styles. The study reveals two crucial vulnerabilities in existing detection systems:(1) State-of-the-art detectors suffer a substantial accuracy decline, reaching up to 11.43% when exposed to style-based adversarial rewrites generated by LLMs. (2) While general-purpose LLMs exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities, their performance in detecting adversarially manipulated text is significantly lower than specialized detectors fine-tuned for robustness. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel style-agnostic detection framework named SAFD that enhances detection accuracy and robustness by prioritizing content-driven features over stylistic attributes. Our approach integrates a style-invariant training paradigm to disentangle content semantics from stylistic variations. We leverage adversarially enriched datasets constructed using LLMs fine-tuned for diverse style-based rewrites. Furthermore, we utilize advanced representation learning techniques to extract content-centric features, emphasizing semantic coherence, logical consistency, and factual alignment. Experimental results across multiple datasets and detection models validate the effectiveness of our framework, showing significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness against diverse adversarial manipulations.

SAFD augments both human and machine texts by rewriting them into multiple styles with a large language model (e.g., newswire, academic, colloquial), then optimizes a tri-objective loss: a standard classification loss, a style-consistency loss that aligns predictions across the style variants via pairwise KL divergence, and an attribution-guided loss that uses auxiliary LLM signals to supervise content-level indicators. Across Story, PolitiFact, and Science domains and several style-attack regimes, SAFD achieves consistent improvements over strong baselines such as DetectGPT, GLTR, COCO, and others, and the gains hold across diverse detector backbones (OPT, GPT-Neo, LLaMA, Qwen, NeoX).

The core motivation is also unconvincing. Below I list the deficiencies in order of severity:\n\n1. In the paper you claim as a core motivation that “State-of-the-art detectors for generated text are found to be impacted by LLM-driven stylistic variations.” However, the table used to support this claim—Table 1 (which the authors mistakenly label as Figure 1)—lists detectors such as GLTR (2019), DetectGPT (2023), and LLMDet (2023), which cannot reasonably be considered current SOTA. Moreover, your prompts for generating adversarial examples take the form: “Rewrite the following text using the style of [publisher/book]: [input text],” which is essentially a paraphrasing attack. Many recent studies indicate that paraphrasing attacks alone can substantially reduce detection accuracy. It is therefore unclear whether the observed drop is due to paraphrasing per se or to stylistic transfer. In other words, if one simply used the prompt “Rewrite the following text: [input text],” how would the accuracy change?\n\n2. Several claims are insufficiently supported. For example, at line 38 you write “Many state-of-the-art detection methods heavily rely on stylistic attributes...,” yet recent SOTA baselines such as Fast-DetectGPT and Binoculars do not appear to rely on stylistic attributes. In addition, at lines 61 and 65 you repeatedly state that “this is the first...,” which seems overstated and likely exaggerates the paper’s contribution.\n\n3. Critical implementation details are vague. In the paper (and in the appendix, which I also checked) I could not find details of your detector implementation (e.g., the base model behind the Table 1 results, learning rate, batch size, etc.). Furthermore, what are P1-P4 in Table 4? The paper appears never to define them.\n\n4. There are numerous spelling and citation errors. An immediate impression is that the paper confuses `\\citep` and `\\citet` in many places (e.g., lines 35, 38, 39, etc.), and you claim that GECScore is published in ACL 2025 in Table 1, line 294, but this paper was published in COLING 2025. There are also multiple table/figure mislabelings—for example, Figure 1 should clearly be Table 1, and Figure 4 should be Table 4. In addition, the text in Figure 5 is too small to read. Finally, what is “LMM” in Figure 2 and Figure 4? Is it a typo for “LLM,” or does it mean something else (e.g. **L**arge **M**ultimodal **M**odel, but I don't think so, because this is a text classification task)? \n\n5. Though this paper **does** contains many baselines, it still misses some important baselines like ImBD [a].\n\n[a] Chen, Jiaqi, et al. \"Imitate Before Detect: Aligning Machine Stylistic Preference for Machine-Revised Text Detection.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
