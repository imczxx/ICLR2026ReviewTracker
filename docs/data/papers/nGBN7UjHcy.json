Although foundation  models achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored, despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e., over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.", "tldr": "We evaluate model calibration of time series foundation models and find that they are generally well-calibrated.", "keywords": ["Time Series", "Foundation Models", "Calibration", "Confidence"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/de5a64cd52281b3e2f6d3c076b615276ce646eb4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the calibration of time series foundation models.
