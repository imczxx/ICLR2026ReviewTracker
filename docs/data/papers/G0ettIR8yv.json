Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled flexible query-driven reasoning; however, video-based frameworks like Video Chain-of-Thought lack direct training signals to effectively identify relevant frames. Current approaches often rely on heuristic methods or pseudo-label supervised annotations, which are both costly and limited in scalability across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ViaRL, the first framework to leverage rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing frame selection in intention-driven video understanding. An iterated amplification strategy is adopted to perform alternating cyclic training in the video CoT system, where each component undergoes iterative cycles of refinement to improve its capabilities. ViaRL utilizes the answer accuracy of a downstream model as a reward signal to train a frame selector through trial-and-error, eliminating the need for expensive annotations while closely aligning with human-like learning processes. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including VideoMME, LVBench, and MLVU, demonstrate that ViaRL consistently delivers superior temporal grounding performance and robust generalization across diverse video understanding tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability. Notably, ViaRL achieves a nearly 15% improvement on Needle QA, a subset of MLVU, which is required to search a specific needle within a long video and regarded as one of the most suitable benchmarks for evaluating temporal grounding.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Video Understanding", "Temporal Grounding", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/38e93e9caf1391241035beef3f598a49b8b1583f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper addresses the challenge of intention-driven video understanding, focusing on selecting relevant frames in videos to answer queries effectively.

Central to the approach is the Visual Iterated Amplification training strategy, an innovative iterative refinement process that alternates between optimizing the frame selector and the answer model, providing strong motivation and technical soundness. The effectiveness of ViaRL is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks, including VideoMME, LVBench, and MLVU, where it consistently achieves improvements. Given the difficulty of the tasks and the good results, I believe that reinforcement learning policy and the cyclic training is really helping to reason on the temporal axis so that it can select the most important frames. Very interesting work."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The major weaknesses of this work are the following:\n\n1 - It would be nice to see how the method affects other VLMs which are not flexible on the resolution/quality of input data.\n\n2 - While the method performs really well in one of the most challenging problems of video understanding, it lacks comparison in more generic tasks like answer generation (for Q&A and captioning for example) to the the impact of this 'specialization' on other capabilities of the network.\n\n3 - The ablation on cyclic training maybe needs a bit more deepening on the diminishing returns with additional cycles. The authors claim that it is due to the imperfect nature of MLLMs to provide correct answers for each visual scene and the limited info contained in 8 frames. I think these claims might need some more experimenting to see if the limit is on the method or on the MLLMs serving as supervisors."}, "questions": {"value": "Check above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "YD6eFhHSlY", "forum": "G0ettIR8yv", "replyto": "G0ettIR8yv", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14848/Reviewer_4Vp9"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14848/Reviewer_4Vp9"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14848/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761348879684, "cdate": 1761348879684, "tmdate": 1762925203409, "mdate": 1762925203409, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ViaRL (Visual Iterated Amplification Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework to address the challenge of efficient, query-driven frame selection in long videos.

I also do not see any experiments supporting this sampling process.\n3. Table 2 is never discussed in the paper. For example, why using all components yield the worse performance among the table?\n4.
