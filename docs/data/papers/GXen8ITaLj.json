Prior work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability, measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly ``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails. Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI systems. In this work, we propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior. Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk.", "tldr": "We Evaluate LLMs Attempt to Persuade on a Broad Range of Benign and Harmful Topics", "keywords": ["AI Safety", "Large Language Models", "LLMs", "Persuasion", "Evals", "Conspiracies", "Refusal"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f3c69aa63c3ef8dbfd4c04a0ca5cb4f91aa68bd2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes APE (Attempt to Persuade Eval), a benchmark that shifts persuasion evaluation from success (changing beliefs) to intent, whether a model attempts to shape beliefs or behavior, especially on sensitive and harmful topics.

Topic coverage spans benign factual/opinion, controversial issues, and non-controversially harmful content. Key findings: (i) many open and closed weight models willingly attempt persuasion on harmful topics that they would refuse to directly assist; (ii) “jailbreak” fine-tuning sharply collapses refusal rates on harmful topics; (iii) fine-grained “degree of persuasion” labels are unreliable, motivating a binary attempt/no-attempt metric; and (iv) persuasion attempts are most common in early rounds and taper with longer conversations."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The paper would benefit from starting with the abstract and moving the figure into the introduction or results section.\n\n- The study relies entirely on model-to-model simulations, which limits external validity and prevents meaningful conclusions about how human users might respond to persuasive attempts. Real persuasion involves emotional, social, and moral reasoning that automated agents cannot replicate.\n\n- The definition of a “persuasion attempt” is too shallow. Treating persuasion as a binary label (attempt or no attempt) ignores gradations in tone, framing, intensity, and rhetorical sophistication that characterize real persuasive behavior.\n\n- The evaluator model struggles with nuanced distinctions in persuasive strength. It cannot reliably detect subtle strategies such as moral reasoning, empathy framing, or indirect argumentation that may influence human audiences.\n\n- The evaluation design does not adequately account for confounding factors such as temperature, persona context, or prompt order effects, all of which may significantly alter persuasion likelihood.\n\n- While the paper effectively identifies safety gaps, it provides limited practical guidance on how to mitigate these issues. There is no clear proposal for retraining, safety-layer design, or model auditing frameworks to address identified vulnerabilities.\n\n- Ethical considerations and dataset release protocols are insufficiently detailed. The authors acknowledge potential misuse risks but do not specify monitoring or access restrictions for harmful prompt data.\n\n- The writing occasionally blurs descriptive findings with normative claims, making it harder to separate empirical evidence from interpretation or opinion.\n\n- The paper lacks grounding in persuasion theory or psychology, which weakens its conceptual framing.

Some topics (e.g., violence) are clearly harmful, while others (e.g., “undermining control”) depend heavily on interpretation without consistent criteria.\n\n- The neutrality and independence of the evaluator model are uncertain, especially since GPT-4o serves multiple roles (persuader, persuadee, and evaluator) in the same pipeline. This may introduce systemic bias.\n\n- The description of human annotator validation is vague. Details about the annotators’ expertise, agreement calibration, and labeling guidelines are missing, leaving uncertainty about evaluation reliability.\n\n- The operational definition of “persuasive attempt” is unclear. It is not explained whether persuasion is detected through argument structure, linguistic tone, or inferred motivation.\n\n- The five subcategories under “non-controversially harmful” topics are listed without clear theoretical or empirical justification, raising questions about representativeness and generalization.\n\n- The method of generating harmful prompts with a jailbroken model lacks transparency. The authors intentionally omit details for safety, but this decision reduces reproducibility and external verification.\n\n- The paper mentions coordination with industry labs following responsible disclosure but provides no documentation, dates, or evidence of model improvements after disclosure.\n\n- The use of simulated agents for both sides of the dialogue leaves open questions about how real human users would respond to similar persuasion attempts. A small-scale human validation study would have improved the paper’s grounding.\n\n- The broader implications of APE scores are undefined.

Such studies would require strict institutional review, strong content moderation, participant screening, and debriefing procedures. The dataset itself also carries misuse risks, as it could enable the creation of models that generate harmful persuasive content; secure access control and responsible data release are therefore essential.
