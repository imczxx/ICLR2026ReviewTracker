Existing attack methods often treat MoE as a unified architecture, overlooking the independent and collaborative weaknesses of key components such as routers and expert modules. To fill this gap, we propose Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (TLGA) to thoroughly investigate component-level vulnerabilities in video MoE models. We first design attacks on the router, revealing its independent weaknesses. Building on this, we introduce Joint Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (J-TLGA), which collaboratively perturb both routers and experts. This joint attack significantly amplifies adversarial effects and exposes the Achilles’ Heel (collaborative weaknesses) of the MoE architecture. Based on these insights, we further propose Joint Temporal Lipschitz Adversarial Training (J-TLAT). J-TLAT performs joint training to further defend against collaborative weaknesses, enhancing component-wise robustness. Our framework is plug-and-play and reduces inference cost by more than 60% compared with dense models. It consistently enhances adversarial robustness across diverse video datasets and model architectures, effectively mitigating both the independent and collaborative weaknesses of MoE. Code will be released upon acceptance.", "tldr": "Exposing and Defending Video Mixture-of-Experts via Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks", "keywords": ["Adversarial attacks for Video MoE; Robustness of Video MoE"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5653e210bdb1d541d2b49dc8c56f122729fd7e26.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the adversarial robustness of video Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, an underexplored area despite their growing success in video understanding tasks.

It is unclear whether the attacks assume a white-box, gray-box, or black-box setting, nor what information the adversary possesses (e.g., access to router parameters, gradients, or architecture details). Since the practicality and interpretability of robustness claims depend heavily on these assumptions, the authors should clearly specify the attacker’s knowledge scope and capabilities. Without this clarification, it is difficult to determine whether the attacks are realistic or merely theoretical.\n\n* Limited diversity of experimental datasets\n\nThe evaluation focuses primarily on UCF-101 and HMDB-51, which are relatively small-scale datasets. While these benchmarks are widely used, they may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of modern video understanding tasks. Extending the evaluation to larger and more challenging datasets would significantly strengthen the empirical validity and generalizability of the findings.\n\n* Limited theoretical insight into Lipschitz guidance\n\nThe paper briefly introduces temporal Lipschitz coefficients and their role in guiding perturbations, but the theoretical rationale behind why this specific guidance improves attack strength (or defense stability) is not rigorously analyzed. For instance, the connection between the Lipschitz constant and temporal consistency of video features is not deeply discussed. Including theoretical bounds or geometric intuition could clarify how the approach differs from conventional gradient-based or temporal smoothness attacks.\n\n* Defense generalization not fully demonstrated\n\nJ-TLAT’s robustness is mainly evaluated against its own attack (J-TLGA). Although it achieves strong performance under this threat, it is unclear whether the defense generalizes to other unseen or non-Lipschitz-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, or frame-specific perturbations). This makes it difficult to determine whether the method truly enhances general robustness or merely overfits to its own attack pattern. Additional experiments on cross-attack evaluation would greatly improve the paper’s credibility."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n- The work analyzes component-level vulnerabilities in video MoE architectures. The idea of differentiating between router and expert robustness is insightful and practically relevant.\n- The analysis from attack to defense provides a unified view of robustness analysis. The proposed method provides a comprehensive understanding of the studied problem.\n- The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple backbones (3D-ResNet, TSM, Video Swin) and datasets. The reported reduction in Lipschitz constant and GFLOPs is convincing.\n- The appendix provides a clean theoretical derivation for why router manipulation leads to cascading failures."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The new attack (TLGA) is basically a standard PGD-style adversarial attack with two small changes: a time-based adjustment of the step size, and an extra term related to the Lipschitz constant. What seems novel is the focus on attacking the router and experts separately in MoE models.\n- The loss, e.g., equation (7), is not clear how this actually constrains the Lipschitz constant or enforces smoothness. There’s no clear derivation or estimation of the Lipschitz bound 𝐾.\n- The three-stage adversarial training (router → experts → MoE) adds a lot of extra computation. However, the paper only compares inference efficiency, not total training cost. For a fair evaluation, it should compare against other robust training baselines (e.g., AT-M, AAT-M) using the same number of training epochs and attack iterations. Otherwise, the reported robustness gain might simply come from more training rather than the proposed method itself."}, "questions": {"value": "- What the paper calls “collaborative weakness” may actually come from training imbalance. The router tends to favor a few experts while under-training others, so once those experts are attacked, performance drops sharply. This is a common issue in MoE models and can probably be improved by better load balancing.\n\n- The proposed three-stage defense is quite complicated. Some of the same effects, e.g., reducing router over-reliance, might be achieved with simpler methods, such as balanced routing regularization or stochastic expert dropout, without training three times.\n\n- The table layout is incorrect.
