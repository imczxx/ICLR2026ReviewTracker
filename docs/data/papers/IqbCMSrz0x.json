Traditional methods often rely on detailed metric maps, whereas biological systems efficiently navigate using sparse, cognitive topological maps that support high-level reasoning.  We present Topo-AeroVLN, a brain-inspired framework enabling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform vision-and-language navigation from a top-down perspective.  Our method incrementally constructs a multi-level topological map by abstracting aerial observations into road-bounded regions and internal semantic objects.  A dynamic graph update mechanism, combining multimodal embedding similarity with spatial containment, ensures efficient and scalable map construction.  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) align natural language instructions with map vertices, supporting robust language-driven topological planning.  Experiments demonstrate strong spatial coverage and navigation performance in complex urban environments.  Topo-AeroVLN provides a generalizable, interpretable framework for UAV navigation that adapts to unseen environments without prior maps or extensive retraining.", "tldr": "Utilize brain-inspired mechanisms to construct cognitive maps for the path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles", "keywords": ["VLN", "Cognitive mapping"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d1a486fac3efb4586a2d2ba95ad93ddef24b2dc1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a brain-inspired cognitive topological mapping framework for UAV vision-and-language navigation from aerial views.

The paper consider navigation in high-altitude aerial environments, where data collection and topological map generation suggest that the drone operates at a height where obstacles are not encountered. Given the typical VLN task design, where the prompt only requires navigating from a start point to an end point without additional obstacles, the drone’s navigation path should ideally be a direct route from start to finish. The reliance on a topological map to guide the path seems unnecessary in this context, deviating from the standard VLN task assumptions.\n\n2.Writing and Presentation: The authors are encouraged to revise the manuscript to enhance clarity and readability, particularly in the presentation of formulas and figures. For example:\n- In Formula (4), the symbols for weights (sim and dis) and the function name (sim) appear at the same level, which may cause confusion for readers. The authors should consider clarifying these symbols or reformatting them, such as using subscripts for weights (e.g. ω_sim).\n- In Figure 3(a-c), the two curves are not accompanied by a legend, and the text does not directly explain their meanings. Readers are left to infer the significance of these curves, which can increase the difficulty of understanding the paper.
