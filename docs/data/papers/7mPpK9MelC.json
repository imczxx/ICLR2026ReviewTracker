The hallucination of the content generated by the large language model seriously affects the credibility and practicability of the model in key scenarios. However, the mainstream hallucination detection technology relies on external knowledge bases to verify the authenticity of the content generated by the model, or uses a large number of annotation data for training. These methods require complex model structure and support, will consume a lot of resources and time, and cross domain generalization ability is poor. In this paper, we proposes a new hallucination detection method, which allows the LLMs to imitate the way of thinking of the philosopher Aristotle. We decompose the complex hallucination verification process into two distinct subjects (called F2): a. Factual hallucination detection: verifying the fact finding of the content generated by the model and analyzing the optimal solution; b. Fidelity hallucination detection: Logical verification based on classical logical forms, including the reasoning systems or logical forms of logic such as Aristotle's most outstanding contribution, syllogism. The experimental results show that this method not only improves the recognition and analysis ability of the LLMs itself for illusory content, but also enhances the interpretability of the defects of the LLMs, enabling the developers of the LLMs to effectively identify the sources of errors and improve the model capabilities.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Hallucination Detection", "Logical Inference", "Large Language Models"], "primary_area": "neurosymbolic & hybrid AI systems (physics-informed, logic & formal reasoning, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b4f2688f9fce93a06f229a3a696631372917461a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a93e8cb9dd44e011a1749b9b63919b5b8b18243a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes F2, a training-free, prompt-based framework designed to detect and correct LLM hallucinations.

Originality\nThe paper's main original contribution is the conceptualization of the F2 framework. Decomposing the self-verification task into two distinct, philosophically-inspired subjects (Factual Hallucination vs. Fidelity Hallucination) is an intuitive and clean heuristic. While the underlying mechanism relies on standard prompt engineering, this specific two-pronged approach to structuring the verification is a creative application of existing ideas.\n\n2. Significance\nThe work's significance is primarily practical. It offers a useful, training-free, and portable prompting framework that can be immediately applied by developers to improve model reliability."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited Technical Novelty\n\nThe \"F2 mechanics\" is not a new algorithm but rather a structured prompting framework for self-verification. It falls within the established paradigm of in-context learning. The novelty lies in the heuristic (Factual vs. Fidelity decomposition), not in the underlying technology.\n\n2. Insufficient and Outdated Baselines\n\nThe experimental comparison is limited to foundational (CoT, ToT) and outdated baselines. The paper fails to benchmark F2 against its most direct competitors from 2024-2025, specifically recent works on self-correction, reasoning decomposition, and verifier-based methods [1, 2, 3]. This makes it impossible to assess its true contribution.\n\n3. Critical Gaps in Experimental Protocol (Unfair Comparison)\n\nThis is the most significant flaw. The F2 method's \"Retry Mechanism\" (Section 3.4) constitutes a form of rejection sampling, effectively giving it a $pass@k$ advantage (where $k \\ge 2$). If you set a lower threshold for baseline methods, it is basically making fewer retries for baselines. However, I cannot find details on how you set the acceptance threshold of the baseline methods.\n\nWithout this clarification, the reported performance gains are confounded by a larger, unacknowledged sampling budget, and the central claim of the paper's superiority is unsubstantiated.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Zhenyu Wu, Qingkai Zeng, Zhihan Zhang, Zhaoxuan Tan, Chao Shen, and Meng Jiang. 2024.

I find the F2 framework to be an intuitive and clearly-presented approach. However, I have several critical questions, primarily regarding the experimental methodology, that would need to be addressed to validate the paper's claims. Answering these could significantly clarify my concerns.\n\n1. On the \"Retry Mechanism\" and Fair Experimental Comparison:\n\nThis is my most significant concern. The F2 method's \"Retry Mechanism\" (Section 3.4) constitutes a form of rejection sampling. This appears to give F2 a $pass@k$ advantage (where $k \\ge 2$), while the baselines (Zero-shot, CoT, ToT) are not known. The reported performance gains may stem from this larger, unacknowledged sampling budget rather than the F2 verification framework itself.\n\nQ1.1 (Fairness): Is my understanding correct? Were the Zero-shot, CoT, and ToT baselines evaluated at different tolerance levels? How are those methods applied, and how is the threshold set?\n\nQ1.2 (CoT-SC Details): For the CoT-SC baseline, how many thought chains (samples) were used for its majority vote? How does this total sampling budget compare to the average number of samples (initial sample + retries) used by F2?\n\n2. On Insufficient and Outdated Baselines:\n\nThe experimental comparison is limited to foundational (CoT, ToT) and outdated baselines. The paper fails to benchmark F2 against its most direct competitors from 2024-2025.\n\nQ2.1: Could you please discuss how your F2 framework compares to recent methods on self-correction, reasoning decomposition, and verifier-based methods, such as Wu et al. (2024) [1], Luo et al. (2024) [2], and Zhang et al. (2024) [3]? This context is essential to assess your work's contribution.\n\n3. On the Nature of the Contribution (Technical Novelty):\n\nThe paper frames F2 as a new \"mechanics.\" However, the implementation (Figs 5 & 6) appears to be a sophisticated, multi-step prompting framework that falls within the established paradigm of in-context learning.\n\nQ3.1: Could you clarify what is mechanically novel about the method beyond this specific prompt structure? Is the contribution a new algorithm or a new (and effective) heuristic for in-context learning?\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Zhenyu Wu, Qingkai Zeng, Zhihan Zhang, Zhaoxuan Tan, Chao Shen, and Meng Jiang. 2024.

The paper does not include comparative experiments with recent hallucination detection methods and fails to establish a clear distinction from existing detection frameworks. While reasoning-related baselines (e.g., CoT, ToT) are included, recent hallucination detection methods are not. \n\n2. The proposed Methodology (Section 3) lacks scientific grounding and algorithmic specificity. Most equations are presented as symbolic definitions without concrete implementation details. The “retry mechanism” in Section 3.4 is especially vague — it is unclear what qualifies as a “concise reason,” how many retry iterations are performed, or what stopping criteria are applied. Greater algorithmic transparency is necessary to ensure reproducibility and to elevate the framework beyond a descriptive or prompt-engineering level.\n\n3. The mathematical modeling of F2 is not formulated with sufficient rigor.\n- Equation (1) does not specify input–output domains, making its functional definition ambiguous.\n- Equation (2) lacks a clear definition of “optimal solution”.\n- Equations (3)–(7) merely represent logical structures without any computational process\nIn practice, they correspond to prompt templates imitating logical reasoning, not formal inference mechanisms.\n\n4. The evaluation protocol is not clearly reproducible. Key details such as prompt formatting, extraction rules, and answer parsing are confined to the appendix rather than presented in the main text, leaving doubts about the replicability of results.\n\n5. The framework has not been validated on open-ended generation tasks, where hallucination tends to manifest more subtly. This limitation restricts the claimed generality and cross-domain applicability of F2.\n\n6. Given the dual-verification and retry structure, significant computational overhead is likely, yet the authors provide no analysis of time or cost. Reporting such resource implications is important for assessing the practical feasibility of the method.\n\n7. The paper’s writing flow is often uneven, with awkward phrasing and inconsistent transitions, which somewhat diminishes readability and overall polish.\n\n8. Finally, there is a mismatch between the logical structure presented and its actual implementation. Figure 2 visually suggests a formal logic verification pipeline, but in reality, the process appears to rely solely on prompt-based reasoning by the LLM, without any symbolic or automated logical validation."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
