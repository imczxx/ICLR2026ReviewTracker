While humans intuitively understand and balance such requirements across multiple decision-makers, automated systems demand precise mathematical formulations that may not exist or may lose essential context in translation. We propose a framework where distributed agents learn to interpret and satisfy semantic constraints through collective intelligence rather than explicit programming. The key insight is that natural language constraints often encode contextual priorities that vary with system state, which we capture by treating constraints as adaptive geometric structures whose shape depends on operational context. When an operator specifies \"maintain reasonable reserves,\" the meaning of \"reasonable\" naturally differs during peak versus off-peak periods, and our framework learns these contextual variations through language model guidance. To coordinate multiple agents under such fluid constraints, we structure the problem as a hierarchical game where semantic understanding at the system level guides local agent decisions without imposing rigid rules, allowing emergent coordination through game-theoretic interactions. The framework remains computationally tractable by recognizing that different aspects of coordination occur at different timescales, with fast local adjustments separated from slower global consensus formation through singular perturbation decomposition. Empirical evaluation on a multi-agent resource allocation task demonstrates that semantic-aware coordination achieves 89.2% efficiency compared to 82.7-86.4% for traditional methods while successfully handling requirements that resist mathematical formalization.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Stackelberg game optimization", "large language models", "semantic-embedded optimization", "lunar rover energy management", "hierarchical game theory", "bounded rationality", "multi-agent coordination", "mission-critical systems"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b976906e765325fa35429e0e05b9606030b9ef97.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The article addresses the problem of decentralised coordination through the use of Stackelberg games when constraints of the problem are evolving.

A key issue I find that the contributions of the work in the title, abstract and intro are quite overstated. The work sets itself to develop a generic method for semantic constraint understanding. However, the formulation in section 2 is highly specific to a battery allocation system. And all the problem formulation, developed solutions are specifically limited to this battery allocation problem.\n\nThus, I find the problem formulation to be of very limited scope and it does not justify the claimed contributions in abstract and intro.\n\nThe use of words such as “cognitive”, “incomputable complexity component” is unfortunate as a reader has not idea what these terms mean, and hinder clear understanding of the work.\n\nIt is not clear why the problem formulation in section 2 is realistic and significant. There are several assumptions made, such as a particular factorization of state space in Eq 1, a particular transition function in Eq2. Why do they model a realistic system? Why does the transition function in Eq 2 has an additive term \\sum_{j}? Are there real systems that use these assumptions? Why are there only a few objectives of interest noted in Eq3,4,5? What are exactly “soft fuzzy constraints” in Eq7? Who specifies and how? Please provide clear examples. \n\nEq 8,9 are very unclear. The notation f_i is used in Eq2, it is again used in Eq 9. I think the f_i in Eq9 may be different that the one in Eq8. as \\lambda represent incentive signal in Eq9. \n\nAs a result of these issues in problem setup, it is not clear if the problem addressed is significant.\n\nThe main technical contribution in section 3.1 is highly unclear. It is not clear what is “state-dependent Riemannian metric” in Eq 12, why is it necessary. What is differential manifold in Eq 13?\n\nEmpirically, the work tests in synthetic benchmarks which the authors have designed themselves and it is unclear why the domains are realistic.
