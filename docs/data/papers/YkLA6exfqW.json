Due to the tremendous security demands in large-scale areas and areas where the deployment of computationally heavy devices might not be feasible, like refugee camps, the development of a scalable solution must be a priority. Through this research, we aim to achieve this by understanding the impact of binarization on images and models. Surprisingly, neither the role of Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) nor binary fingerprint images (especially photos, not scans) has been explored in the literature. Henceforth, in this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of fingerprint recognition using both floating-point-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Binarised Neural Networks (BNNs) across multiple image representations, ranging from RGB to grayscale to binary. Our experiments reveal that while DNNs excel with richer representations such as RGB and grayscale, BNNs demonstrate superior compatibility with binary fingerprints, effectively leveraging their reduced complexity to achieve competitive or even better recognition accuracy. This finding highlights the importance of aligning model architectures with input spectra: full-precision networks benefit from information-rich domains, whereas binarized models coupled with binary images offer both efficiency and improved accuracy in inherently discrete representations. The results provide new insights into spectrum-aware fingerprint recognition, guiding the design of accurate and resource-efficient biometric systems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Fingerprint Recognition", "Binary Images", "Color Images", "Deep Learning"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b21410099a629d42563f4e9b90612001ed84bb5b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper addresses the suitability of floating-point versus binarized DNNs for fingerprint recognition across modalities (RGB image, grayscale, binary image).

These are locations where the fingerprint recognition model would not need enormous throughput, and it is unclear to me on what hardware they are considering. Any basic smartphone can run the regular models without binarization, and even though binarization does lead to some spedup, since the regular models are not prohibitive, I do not understand the motivation. To be clear, I thinnk building more effiicent models is an important area of research, but I fail to understand this specific use case.\n\n2. The setup of the study is unusual. The models are all being tested without any fine tuning on fingerprints, either using pretrained models on imagenet, or alternatively finetuning the binarized models on tiny imagenet. This is not how fingerprint models are usually trained: it is far more common to actually first fine tune on a fingerprint dataset.\n\n3. More broadly, this study is not a good fit for ICLR.

The authors assert that binarized networks show “superior compatibility” and “robustness” with binary images, but the reported improvements are modest and sometimes within the range of experimental noise. The study also claims substantial efficiency benefits but reports only storage savings, without measuring runtime, latency, or energy consumption.\n4.
