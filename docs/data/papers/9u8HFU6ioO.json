This is achieved by introducing a coding abstraction, which we call messageless secret-key codes, that formalizes sufficient and necessary requirements of robust watermarking: soundness, tamper detection, and pseudorandomness. Thus, we establish that robustness has a precise limit: For binary outputs no scheme can survive if more than half of the encoded bits are modified, and for an alphabet of size $q$ the corresponding threshold is $(1-1/q)$ of the symbols. \n\nComplementing this impossibility, we give explicit constructions that meet the bound up to a constant slack. For every $\\delta>0$, assuming pseudorandom functions and access to a public counter, we build linear-time codes that tolerate up to $(1/2)(1-\\delta)$ errors in the binary case and $(1-1/q)(1-\\delta)$ errors in the $q$-ary case. Together with the lower bound, these yield the maximum robustness achievable under standard cryptographic assumptions. \n\nWe then test experimentally whether this limit appears in practice by looking at the recent watermarking for images of Gunn, Zhao, and Song (ICLR 2025). We show that a simple crop and resize operation reliably flipped about half of the latent signs and consistently prevented belief-propagation decoding from recovering the codeword, erasing the watermark while leaving the image visually intact. \n\nThese results provide a complete characterization of robust watermarking, identifying the threshold at which robustness fails, constructions that achieve it, and an experimental confirmation that the threshold is already reached in practice.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["watermarking", "pseudorandom codes", "impossibility", "generative models", "diffusion models"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9c3dfe66ab0e8bcd4f4e456bdcc66c23b6332573.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The submission provides a study on the limits on the robustness of watermarking for AI generated content.\nIt models watermarking as the transmission of a secret message over a q-ary alphabet.\nThe strength of the attack is measured by the number of flipped symbols."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "I am not sure that the cryptographic formalism is the most suitable for explaining such a simple problem.

Right from the beginning, the application is cast as a communication problem where the watermarking primitives are abstracted within a cryptology formalism. Only section 4, the experimental part, considers a practical watermarking technique for GenAI taken on the shelves. I am not sure that this submission falls in the scope of ICLR. I let the decision to the AC.\n\n## W1: Messageless secret-key codes\n\nThe introduction of this abstraction is listed as a contribution. I disagree. This is just yet-another wording for naming zero-bit watermarking.\nQuoting the authors:\n> We introduce and formalize messageless secret-key codes (also referred to as “zero-bit” in prior literature)\n\nSo either the difference between messageless and zero-bit is not clearly defined in the submission, either these two are the same, and then , what is the point? The term zero-bit watermarking has been used for more than 20 years.  On the same token, I have difficulty understanding the difference between watermarking and \"*cryptographic watermarking*\".\n\n## W2: Simple derivations\n\nThe proofs rely on a simple derivation based on a Chernoff bound considering two cases:\n- $n$ $q$-ary symbols are transmitted and the attack modifies at most $\\alpha n$ symbols. The scheme is robust implies that the reception of any sequence closer to the reference codeword than    $\\alpha n$ is deemed watermarked. Hence a threshold over this distance.\n- If not watermarked, the decoder receives a random sequence. What is the probability that its distance to the referencd codeword is lower than the threshold above mentioned.\n\nWithout any surprise, $\\alpha < 1 - 1/q$ otherwise attacked sequence and random sequence are statictically indistinguishable. \n\n## W3: Mistake in the proofs\n\nI find the proof not very well written, with some typos or mistakes.\n- Theorem 5:\nLine 871. It should be $exp(-\\frac{\\delta^2 n}{3q})$... as the authors did Line 1095.\nLine 871. The threshold here equals $t = n - n(1+\\delta)/q$, then Line 876, the threshold equals $t=n(1-\\frac{1}{q})(1-\\delta)$. The footnote (Line 916) mentions a third threshold $t = n(1-\\frac{1}{q})(1+\\delta)$. Moreover, it states that this third threshold equals the first one. So we end up with three different values for a single threshold:\n    - $t_1 = n - n(1+\\delta)/q = n(1-1/q-\\delta/q)$\n    - $t_2 = n(1-\\frac{1}{q})(1-\\delta) = n(1 -1/q + \\delta/q - \\delta)$\n    - $t_3 = n(1-\\frac{1}{q})(1+\\delta) = n(1 -1/q - \\delta/q + \\delta)$\nOne can tell that: $t_2\\leq t_1 < t_3$. Which one is the 'true' threshold?\n\nAs for the proof of Th. 2:\nThe attack replaces a symbol with probability $1-1/q$ by a random symbol. Therefore:\n- $E[X_i] = 1/q + (1-1/q)\\times 1/q$ (not $1-1/q$ as written Line 1091)\n- The attacked sequence is dependent on $\\gamma$ (contrary to what Line 1101 says): $P(Y_i=y|\\gamma_i)\\neq P(Y_i=y)=1/q$.  \n\n\n## W2: Attack on a proposed GenAI watermarking\n\nSection 4 applies the theoretical study to a previous watermarking technique from Gunn et al. which pertains to the family of schemes embedding the watermark in the seed of the diffusion process (like Gaussian Shading, Gauss Shading++). This section shows that this scheme is not robust to a geometric attack (cropping, rescaling, rotation, etc). **This is not a discovery** since the reverse diffusion is not invariant. Indeed, this is already shown in the seminal paper of Gaussian Shading (see Accuracy vs. Random Crop). This is the reason why many schemes (Tree-Rings, Ring-ID, HTSR, Zodiac) seeks robustness against geometric attacks by crafting invariant seeds."}, "questions": {"value": "## Q1\n> Line 107: It applies to both secret-key and public-key versions of the primitive\n\nWhat is public-key watermarking?

How can it know the associated $\\pi$? ... moreover when millions (if not billions) of images are generated each year.\n\n## Q3\n> valid,invalid,tampered\n\nI have some doubt about the usefulness of the 'valid' output.

The main theoretical result is a restatement of known information-theoretic limits from classical coding theory. The conclusion that a code cannot be robustly identified if an adversary can modify nearly half of its binary components (or a (1 - 1/q) fraction for q-ary symbols) is a well-understood and intuitive principle from classical coding and information theory. At such an error rate, a tampered codeword becomes statistically indistinguishable from a random, invalid one. While the authors provide a formal proof within their defined abstraction, this feels more like a restatement of a known principle in a new context rather than a surprising or deep new insight for the field of generative model watermarking.\n\n2. The paper's central argument is that the success of the crop-and-resize attack demonstrates a fundamental and universal limit of watermarking itself. This claim seems to be an overstatement resulting from a misattribution of the cause. The attack works because the specific image encoder used (from Stable Diffusion 2.1) produces a radically different latent representation after a seemingly minor crop-and-resize operation. This reveals a weakness in the robustness of the image encoder's representations to geometric transformations, not an inherent flaw in the watermarking method.\nThe watermark is embedded in the latent space, and its robustness is therefore coupled with the stability of that latent representation. It is entirely plausible that one could train a more robust image encoder, for instance, using data augmentation that includes cropping and resizing, that would produce a much more stable latent vector for the attacked image. In that scenario, the number of flipped latent signs would fall well below the 50% threshold, and the watermark would survive. Therefore, the presented attack is a powerful demonstration of a vulnerability in a specific implementation, but it does not support the broader claim of a universal barrier for all watermarking schemes.\n\n3. The primary cryptographic watermarking schemes (e.g., PRCs) are designed to provide both robustness/error-correction and unforgeability in the multi-message setting. The \"messageless\" focus unnecessarily reduces the scope of the problem and detracts from analyzing the crucial trade-offs between message length, code rate, and robustness."}, "questions": {"value": "Is the public counter essential in practice?
