However, existing motion generation approaches address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text-motion coverage and precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{SceneAdapt}, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned motion models by leveraging disjoint scene–motion and text–motion datasets through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task to bridge two distinct datasets, thereby injecting scene-awareness. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold. In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention. Experimental results show that \\textbf{SceneAdapt} effectively injects scene awareness into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which this awareness emerges.

Meanwhile, despite improvements, there are some noticeable penetrations in many cases in the video.\n\n- Overstated positioning in related work. The claim that prior work addresses “either semantics or scene-awareness in isolation” is too strong… Recent efforts *do* combine text and scene: 1) Move as You Say, Interact as You Can: Language-guided Human Motion Generation with Scene Affordance, CVPR 2024. 2) Generating Human Interaction Motions in Scenes with Text Control, ECCV 2024. 3) Generating Human Motion in 3D Scenes from Text Descriptions, CVPR 2024. 4) LaserHuman: Language-guided Scene-aware Human Motion Generation in Free Environment, 2024...

The test set pairs HumanML3D text–motion with random TRUMANS start poses/trajectories after SDF-based filtering. This can inadvertently favor or disfavor certain prompts and should be discussed as a limitation (correct me if I am wrong).\n\n- Writing. Several typos/grammar issues (e.g., “exsisting,” “well-adpated,” “indicies,” “sacraficing,” “Qaulitative”)...; terminology for the scene-conditioning module (“SceneCo/ScenCo”) is inconsistent.
