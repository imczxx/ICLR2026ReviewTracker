While post-training methods can adapt models to specific needs, they often require costly data curation and additional training. Test-time scaling (TTS) presents an efficient, training-free alternative, but its application has been largely limited to verifiable domains like mathematics and coding, where response correctness is easily judged. To extend TTS to the domain of preference alignment, we introduce a novel framework that models the task as a realignment problem, as the base model often fails to sufficiently align with the preference. Our key insight is to decompose the underlying reward function into two components: one related to the question and the other to user preference. This allows us to derive a REAlignment Reward (REAR) that selectively rescales the preference-related reward while preserving the question-related reward. We show that REAR can be formulated as a linear combination of policy probabilities, making it computationally efficient and easy to integrate with existing TTS algorithms like best-of-N sampling and tree-search algorithms. Experiments on various preference alignment and role-playing benchmarks demonstrate that TTS with REAR enables scalable and effective test-time realignment with superior performance.", "tldr": "We propose a realignment reward that helps realign model responses to user preferences.", "keywords": ["large language model", "test-time scaling", "preference alignment"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ae0d9897002042a14934f76b4f1bced646a1b587.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f9f301d0166e7f35b7ece7c6119d1d32769ffb4f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces REAR, a framework for aligning with user preferences at test time, specifically targeting subjective and open-ended tasks.

The authors tried to use some mathematical derivation to show the depth of their approach, however, I feel these components were not well stated. For example: From (5) to (7), it feels like nothing substantial is explained. Lemma 3.1 also appears quite abrupt — it introduces a seemingly fancy formula, but its meaning is unclear, and in the end, everything just circles back to (7). Note that Lemma 3.1 is merely an intermediate result and does not offer any theoretical guarantee. It only shows that your policy is an optimizer of a certain expression, making the interpretation of this relation crucial. However, I don't find it particularly insightful or helpful for understanding your algorithm’s design. In fact, it ultimately leads to equation (7), which is equivalent to (5). \n\n2. What truly matters is Lemma 3.2, as it informs the reader how to compute the reward. However, the authors merely state that the reward can somehow be replaced by the policy probability. I believe this is a critical step in the algorithm’s design, yet the paper provides no intuition or explanation for this substitution. Although proofs are included in the appendix, they also fail to offer any meaningful intuition.\n\n2. The presentation could be improved for better clarity and coherence. For example:\n (a) What is the REAR score, and how is it defined? (I can roughly infer its meaning, but the paper should state it explicitly.)\n (b) What is $\\hat{r}_{REAR}$ in Lemma 3.2?\n (c) In Proposition 2.1 and several other places, you should distinguish between the symbols '=' (equality) and ':= / \\triangleq' (definition). This is especially important when your notation deviates from standard conventions. For instance, in Equation (3), your Q function is not the one that I learned. If you want to define a new Q function (or the soft Q-function, as you called), you should use a definition symbol rather than the equality sign.\n\n3. After analyzing the paper, I find the novelty is quite limited. It decompose the reward into two reward terms, then replaces the two reward terms by two policy probability terms, and use it as guidance in two common test-time inference methods. The mathematical derivations make little sense and sometimes disrupt the reading flow of the paper."}, "questions": {"value": "see weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "kQvxxTogFV", "forum": "z6pXpXufuO", "replyto": "z6pXpXufuO", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4160/Reviewer_Uh7X"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4160/Reviewer_Uh7X"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4160/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761884564000, "cdate": 1761884564000, "tmdate": 1762917204425, "mdate": 1762917204425, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a test-time scaling method for preference alignment in LLMs, in case of non-verifiable rewards.
