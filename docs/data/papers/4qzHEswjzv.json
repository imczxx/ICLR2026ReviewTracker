We propose a multi-stage approach that first robustly estimates local tangent directions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on neighborhoods, establishing theoretical consistency for these local estimates. Global orientation consistency of these tangents is then achieved through a spectral relaxation of a pairwise alignment objective. Finally, a globally consistent 1D embedding is computed by solving a carefully formulated linear system (or equivalently, a spectral problem on a derived Laplacian) that aligns the embedding with the oriented local projections. This method effectively leverages local geometric information while ensuring global coherence, producing an ordering robust to noise, curvature, and initial data rotation.

The paper's primary strength is its shift from traditional scalar-based methods to a novel vector-based approach.

Its core innovation lies in estimating local tangent vectors and, crucially, solving the non-trivial problem of aligning them into a globally consistent vector field, a challenge not addressed by the other methods.\n2. The contribution is not simply a new heuristic in manifold learning but the authors support their algorithm with a solid theoretical analysis that provides guarantees on its ability to recover the correct ordering. This mathematical foundation, combined with its demonstrated computational efficiency and successful application to complex real-world problems like single-cell RNA-seq pseudotime ordering, makes the method both powerful and practical for researchers."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The paper has some weaknesses and I will try to write them down in a somewhat decreasing order of significance that would hopefully help the authors to fix these issues and improve the quality of their paper.\n\n1. A notable weakness of the paper is its insufficient engagement with foundational methods in manifold learning, specifically ISOMAP and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). While the algorithm is clearly inspired by this field, as acknowledged through a subtle citation to the original LLE paper, it stops short of providing a direct, quantitative comparison (e.g. page 2, lines 102-105). For a new method to establish its place, it is crucial to benchmark it against the very algorithms that represent the benchmarks like in distance preservation (ISOMAP) and in local reconstruction (LLE). By omitting such a direct comparison, the authors leave a critical gap in their analysis, making it difficult for readers to fully appreciate the practical performance gains and trade-offs of their vector-based approach relative to these well-established techniques.\n2. Furthermore, the empirical validation of the STAGE algorithm is conducted on datasets of a relatively modest scale, with the largest example containing fewer than 17,000 genes. This scope raises significant questions about the method's scalability and its applicability to the large-scale \"big data\" problems prevalent today. An algorithm's performance on thousands of samples does not guarantee its feasibility on millions, where computational and memory constraints are really important. The paper would be substantially stronger if it explored how STAGE performs against modern, highly scalable embedding techniques, such as a simple autoencoder with some neural network architecture, which are designed to handle massive datasets efficiently and could potentially offer a more practical solution for a large number of samples.\n3. The evaluation of the algorithm's success is also somewhat limited by its focus on the intrinsic quality of the ordering, rather than the extrinsic utility of the resulting embeddings. A truly powerful manifold learning algorithm should produce a low-dimensional representation that is useful for downstream machine learning tasks. A more robust validation strategy, as demonstrated in prior work like Paraskevopoulos et al. (2018) [A], would involve a task-based evaluation. For example, by feeding the embeddings generated by STAGE and other competing algorithms (such as SMACOF, LLE, and ISOMAP) into a standard k-NN classifier and comparing the resulting accuracies, one could obtain a clear, objective measure of how well each method preserves the essential structure of the data for a practical application.\n4. Finally, I think the authors should include some computational complexity numbers of their algorithm vs the above referenced SOTA manifold learning algorithms to show maybe that their method is of similar or lower complexity (e.g. execution time or actual memory footprint)\n\n[A] Paraskevopoulos, G., Tzinis, E., Vlatakis-Gkaragkounis, E.V. and Potamianos, A., 2018.
