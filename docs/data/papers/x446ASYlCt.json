Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features.\nWe analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX  establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.", "tldr": "We present PersonaX, a meticulously curated collection of multimodal datasets that analyze the relationships among human behavior traits, facial attributes, and other biographical features.", "keywords": ["Multimodal Datasets", "LLM-Inferred Behavior Traits", "Causality"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3df22d95117a90221514fab2dd43a9720f350b7a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/59c05bb3775eb08b367b30b2b98ba2f60f9c94a4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces PersonaX, a pair of multimodal datasets for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits: CelebPersona and AthlePersona.
