A critical bottleneck in this context is how to load classical or quantum data into quantum circuits efficiently. Approximate quantum loaders (AQLs) provide a viable solution to this problem by balancing fidelity and circuit complexity. However, most existing AQL methods are either heuristic or provide guarantees only for specific input types, and a general theoretical framework is still lacking. To address this gap, here we reformulate most AQL methods into a unified framework and establish information-theoretic bounds on their approximation error. Our analysis reveals that the achievable infidelity between the prepared state and target state scales linearly with the total entanglement entropy across subsystems when the loading circuit is applied to the target state. In light of this, we develop AQER, a scalable AQL method that constructs the loading circuit by systematically reducing entanglement in target states. We conduct systematic experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of AQER, using synthetic datasets, classical image and language datasets, and a quantum many-body state datasets with up to 50 qubits. The results show that AQER consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and gate efficiency.

The theoretical bound in the paper is meaningful only in the limit S goes to 0. For target states with moderate or high entanglement, achieving a small S requires deeper circuits U, and it is unclear whether this can still be done with circuits of polynomial size.\n\n\n- Also, the upper bound is stated in terms of the existence of a product state with certain properties. This does not guarantee that a generic product-state ansatz will satisfy the same bound in practice.\n\n- Another concern I have is that computing the entanglement measure requires access to the target state. For quantum data, this may be possible if multiple copies of the state are available, though the number of required copies is not made explicit. For classical data, however, one must first classically construct the full target state, which is not tractable at large numbers of qubits. In fact, the classical-data experiments in the paper are limited to around 10 qubits.\n\n\n- Even for quantum states, as far as I understand, the simulations proposed in the paper rely on tensor-network methods, which inherently assume limited entanglement.

The algorithm's success hinges on this greedy step being efficient.

The experimental comparison relies heavily on the two-qubit gate count, which is a good but incomplete metric. To make a fairer and more robust assessment of AQER's scalability, I suggest the authors consider the gate depth, the number of trainable parameters, measurement overhead, and training cost.\n\n3. The study is performed under ideal, noise-free conditions. Given that the practical utility of any near-term algorithm depends on its noise resilience, the paper would be substantially more impactful with a discussion on this aspect.
