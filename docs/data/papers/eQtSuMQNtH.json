We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner attains 33.5\\% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA.

How much of the massive performance boost (e.g., +20% on BrowseComp) is attributable to the superior training data versus the dynamic context window? The authors compare DeepMiner data to HotpotQA data in Table 3, but this only proves the importance of the data.\n\n- The paper is missing a crucial comparison: [DeepMiner Data + Vanilla Context] vs. [DeepMiner Data + Dynamic Context]. Without this ablation, it is impossible to determine if the dynamic context window itself actually enhances reasoning capabilities, or if it merely serves as a tool to enable longer runs, with all capability gains stemming from the DeepMiner dataset.\n\n- The context efficiency analysis in Table 2 is \"training-free\" and uses a completely different base model (GPT-OSS-120B). This makes its results difficult to correlate with the main training results of DeepMiner-32B (based on Qwen3-32B) and thus cannot serve as supporting evidence for the dynamic window's effectiveness.\n\n- Compared to summarization-based methods, summarization, while lossy, at least retains some signal.
