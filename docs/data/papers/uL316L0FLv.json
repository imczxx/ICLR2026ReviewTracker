Existing subset selection methods often rely on implicit importance scores, which can be skewed towards majority classes and lead to low-quality prototypes for minority classes. We introduce UniPROT, a novel subset selection framework that minimizes the optimal transport (OT) distance between a uniformly weighted prototypical distribution and the target distribution. While intuitive, this formulation leads to a cardinality constrained super-additive maximization problem that is challenging to approximate efficiently. To address this, we propose a principled relaxation of the OT marginal constraints, yielding a partial optimal transport-based submodular objective. We prove that this relaxation is tight and enables a greedy algorithm with a \\((1 - \\frac{1}{e})\\) approximation guarantee relative to the original sub-additive maximization problem. Empirically, we showcase that enforcing uniform prototype weights in UniPROT consistently improves minority-class representation in imbalanced classification benchmarks without compromising majority-class accuracy. In both finetuning and pretraining regimes for large language models under domain imbalance, UniPROT enforces uniform source contributions, yielding robust performance gains. Our results establish UniPROT as a scalable, theoretically grounded solution for uniform-weighted prototype selection.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["partial optimal transport", "submodular maximization", "subset selection", "imbalanced classification"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
