We begin by revisiting existing federated independence testing methods and showing why they often fail to provide valid guarantees or maintain statistical power under data distributional shift across clients. Building on this analysis, we introduce a copula-based marginal alignment technique together with a stacking-based aggregation strategy that amplifies intra-client dependence while mitigating inter-client variation, yielding a theoretically sound and powerful global test. For practicality, we further accelerate the aggregation step and incorporate a privacy-preserving mechanism. On the theoretical side, we establish both the correctness of our method and the validity of the test. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our solution over existing methods.", "tldr": "A theoretically grounded and powerful framework for federated independence testing", "keywords": ["Independence Testing", "Causal Discovery", "Heterogeneous Federated Clients"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9842912a104d58fc3274d1ea1d34e64cfb9f39f2.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/de5857e502f00dc3d5cd0026646598ae741feb75.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors investigate the problem of federated independence testing across heterogeneous local distributions by introducing a copula-based marginal alignment and stacking-aggregation method with privacy-preserving secure aggregation.

Assumption 1 is very strong and restrictive. Could the authors provide more concrete application scenarios that satisfy this assumption? In those cases, what are X and Y (in each silo), and why would the correlation / dependence structure be consistent across silos? Also, it is recommended to cite more literature that supports such settings.\n2. Assumption 2 posits that only the marginal distributions are heterogeneous across clients. Could the authors consider the case where the joint distribution ($P_{X,Y}$) or the conditional distribution ($P_{Y|X}$) is heterogeneous (i.e., concept shift), which is also common in federated learning? Does the proposed method apply (or can it be extended) to such scenarios?\n3. On lines 170-171: why is $f_k := H_k \\phi(x^{k})$ defined this way, but then $C_{xy} = \\frac1n \\sum_k f_k^{T} f_k$? Could the authors clarify this derivation?\n4. At present the proposed method appears to consist of a relatively straightforward combination of existing methods. Could the authors explicitly introduce the specific technical challenges their method addresses?\n5. Regarding the experimental section: other than comparing with FUIT, the baselines seem to be variants of the proposed method. Would it be possible to include more state-of-the-art alternatives for comparison? Besides, the scale of experiments is small: only 3 clients, small sample sizes, low dimensionality of variables. Could the authors expand the empirical evaluation to larger number of clients, higher dimensional feature spaces, and more realistic federated settings?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "86yuZeYZrh", "forum": "AzHK6ummZ1", "replyto": "AzHK6ummZ1", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5491/Reviewer_q9Rs"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5491/Reviewer_q9Rs"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5491/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760884321795, "cdate": 1760884321795, "tmdate": 1762918092056, "mdate": 1762918092056, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles the challenge of testing statistical independence in federated learning systems where data distributions vary significantly across clients.

The paper's principal contribution resides in their systematic integration and domain-specific adaptation rather than pursuing  theoretical breakthroughs.\nW2) The paper relies solely on the Sachs dataset for real world validation. This biological network benchmark contains a limited number of variables with well defined relationships and high data quality, which fails to represent the more chaotic and complex scenarios commonly encountered in practical federated learning environments. Consequently, the method's success on this curated dataset cannot convincingly demonstrate its generalizability. Additional experiments on more diverse real world datasets would be necessary to strengthen the persuasiveness of the proposed approach.\nW3) The method works on the assumption that all clients must show the same kind of relationship all together—either all independent or all dependent. But in real situations, if some clients show independence while others show dependence, the goal of this method becomes unclear, and the way it combines results gets confusing. As a result, the method's promises might not hold. For example, Hospital A mainly treats patients with serious diabetes. There, insulin levels and blood sugar values are strongly connected. On the other hand, a health check-up center with mostly healthy people may show no clear connection that the method can find between these two measures.
