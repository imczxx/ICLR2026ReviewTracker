Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo–Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead. Experiments on five benchmark tabular datasets show that TAB-DRW achieves strong detectability and robustness against common post-processing attacks, while preserving high data fidelity and fully supporting mixed-type features.", "tldr": "This paper proposes TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking method for generative tabular data.", "keywords": ["Watermark", "Synthetic Tabular Data", "Generative AI"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3b479db3e321e6d644fa5ffa2cb1bb88ac5e0c9e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/60e653b2cab05a584e3c9adced2ccd34184e9703.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes TAB-DRW, a post-editing watermarking method for synthetic tabular data that embeds signals in the frequency domain.

The paper fails to clearly articulate the strategy for selecting specific numerical columns for watermark embedding; these details are only mentioned ad-hoc in the appendix as implementation notes. It is recommended that the main methodology section includes a discussion on the principles of column selection and an analysis of how different selection strategies impact the fidelity-robustness trade-off.\n2.  The logic for pseudo-random bit generation in Algorithm 3, particularly the rule for determining bit-pairs based on `k%4`, lacks sufficient theoretical motivation. The paper should provide a more detailed explanation for why this specific mapping is adopted and how it ensures robustness for bit sequences from adjacent bins, for instance, by explicitly connecting it to concepts like Gray codes.\n3.  A subtle discrepancy exists between the theoretical analysis (Section 3), which assumes fixed YJT and standardization parameters, and the practical detection process (Appendix D), which re-fits these parameters on suspect data. Although experiments in Appendix D suggest this gap has a negligible impact, the theoretical guarantees in the main text should be more cautiously qualified to clarify that the analysis is conducted under an idealized model.\n4.  The paper lacks an impact analysis of the final rounding and clipping step for discrete and bounded features. This non-linear operation could potentially weaken or even erase the watermark signal introduced by small modifications in the frequency domain; a discussion or experimental analysis of its potential effect on watermark detectability is advised."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Regarding the bit generation algorithm: In Algorithm 3, the bit-pair assignment rule (`k%4 = 0 or 3`) appears designed to make bit sequences of adjacent bins more similar.
