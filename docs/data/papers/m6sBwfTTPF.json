However, the presence of missing channels during acquisition often compromises signal quality and limits practical applications. Existing EEG channel reconstruction methods remain constrained by limited accuracy and generalization. In this work, we present Uni-SVDiffusion, a scalable pre-training–based diffusion framework for cross-channel EEG reconstruction that generates high-fidelity signals for arbitrarily missing channels. Our approach leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to disentangle EEG signals into spatial and temporal components, and employs a diffusion model trained on spatial representations to achieve precise reconstruction conditioned on observed channels. To enable a unified model across diverse EEG configurations, we further propose a forward/backward channel mapping strategy that preserves spatial structure and facilitates cross-dataset generalization via convolutional pre-training. Evaluations on three datasets demonstrate that Uni-SVDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, even under severe channel-missing scenarios. This work provides a generalizable, plug-and-play solution for EEG reconstruction. Code and pre-trained models will be released upon acceptance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["EEG，diffusion model"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8be363e9e27fe96359f231e69de71848416b935f.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/880bbf043f5ec0a6b8532cb28fc118d9fcc754d3.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the issue of noisy EEG channels by using a diffusion model on the spatial SVD space of the corrupted data.

If the figures were done with matplotlib a simple trick is to reduce the figsize -> this will make the font appear bigger.\n - **Downstream performance assessment**: the 2 baseline methods tailored to biosignals BioDiffusion [1] and Gram [2] both report downstream performance as the key measure of whether their reconstruction method works. Restoration/reconstruction metrics are seen as only safeguards/sanity checks to ensure that the method is working as intended. Indeed the “real-world applications” of EEG signals usually involve some sort of classification or regression. I think measuring performance of classifiers on the signals reconstructed with the different methods is ultimately the sole judge of whether a method is valuable. For this reason, the numbers presented here are without equivalent in the literature and it’s difficult to judge what their significance is. I think in order to completely ignore downstream performance assessment it would be useful to first make it clear that there is a strong correlation between reconstruction metrics and downstream performance in a first work.\n- **Baseline**: The Gram paper [2] uses spherical splines as a baseline in Fig. 3. I think it makes sense to use this very naive baseline as it is I think the default method in applications.\n- **Forward-backward mapping**: as highlighted above, I think being able to train on datasets with different channel counts is great. However, the explanation of how this happens in section 3.4 is in my opinion not clear. I think it deserves more rigor in defining $P$, denoting the dimensions and not going straight to an example or a figure.\n\n\n[1] Li, X., Sakevych, M., Atkinson, G., and Metsis, V.
