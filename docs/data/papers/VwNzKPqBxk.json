However, many real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000 response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA.  We build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3 orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community. Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving only 65.9\\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights into the role that extended thinking plays in addressing complex, professional-domain tasks.", "tldr": "We curate a PhD/MBA-level human-annotated rubrics dataset across Physics, Chemistry, Finance and Consulting with >7000 criterion-response pairs and introduce methods to mitigate bias and high cost of evaluation to make it fair and accessible to all.", "keywords": ["expert-annotated", "professional knowledge", "llm judge", "rubric evaluation"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d019d4c84e6dc5f5c72b2784ceff6d41621b6370.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ProfBench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark spanning multiple professional domains.
