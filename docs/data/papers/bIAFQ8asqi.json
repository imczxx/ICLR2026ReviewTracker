The proposed data-augmented ideation is a relatively straightforward extension of existing frameworks. Adding dataset descriptions as metadata and performing simple validation are natural incremental steps, not a fundamentally new approach or theoretical contribution.\n2. The automatic validation process is largely descriptive and based on keyword counts or correlations, not rigorous statistical or causal analysis. It is unclear how reliable or generalizable these validations are, and they do not convincingly demonstrate an improvement in true hypothesis verification.\n3. All experiments are conducted in one social science topic (climate negotiation). This makes it difficult to generalize claims about research ideation in general.\n4. The paper reveals an unaddressed trade-off: incorporating metadata enhances feasibility but reduces novelty, suggesting that the framework systematically biases idea generation toward safer, data-driven concepts at the expense of creativity—a limitation that remains insufficiently analyzed or discussed."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

For example, how would this work for empirical AI research? What would the automatic valiation look like in that case? My biased view is that the automatic validation is only possible for research problems where the execution is quite simple and straightforward, and you are gonna see a lot more errors when you move to a more execution-heavy domain, for example, LLM post-training/pre-training research, where the code implementation is more involved, and the execution involves GPUs as well. \n\n- Looks like the metadata construction is purely manual right now, how is this scalable? \n\n- My overall judgement is that it's great to see the proposed pipeline works for the social science topics being tested, but I'm not quite convinced it's gonna work the same for other broader domains.
