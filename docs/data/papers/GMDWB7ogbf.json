To address this, symmetric loss functions were introduced in the context of label noise, enabling models trained on noisy data to perform comparably to those trained on clean data without explicit noise knowledge. Loss functions satisfying a specific symmetry condition exhibit robustness to label noise. Building on this, we propose a novel method to derive noise-robust loss functions using monotonic functions and label normalisation, which involves a simple normalisation of labels that leads to noise robustness when labels are corrupted. Unlike other approaches, this method allows creation of new loss functions by defining application-specific monotonic functions rather than relying on predefined losses. We formally prove their theoretical properties, propose two concrete noise-robust losses, and demonstrate through extensive empirical evaluations on computer vision and natural language processing tasks that our losses outperform standard and existing noise-robust losses. Our evaluations indicate better learning of decision boundaries, faster convergence, and improved robustness to noise using the proposed loss functions.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Noise robustness", "NRFL", "WRLL"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8955ac784a1488f2f6dc71b8703a3c9e6eee627c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes “additive normalization of labels” for noise-robust learning.

This article evaluates the method only on very small datasets and does not include experiments on benchmarks with more categories or larger scale, such as CIFAR-100 or WebVision. It is well known that symmetric losses [1, 2, 3] are challenging to optimize. Results on small datasets like CIFAR-10 and MNIST are insufficient to assess optimization capability: even symmetric losses such as MAE and NCE—despite their optimization difficulty—can perform well in these settings. In contrast, on datasets with more categories or larger scale, such as CIFAR-100 and WebVision, symmetric losses are often harder to optimize and typically underperform. Consequently, using a symmetric loss in isolation has limited practical value.
