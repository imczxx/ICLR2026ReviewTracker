Extensive Theoretical Work: The authors have clearly invested a significant amount of effort in constructing an elaborate mathematical framework (Section 3).

Leap of faith in assumption 4: The main problem of this paper's theoretical claim lies in assumption 4, where the authors posits the existence of a \"virtual wave function\" $\\overline{\\psi}$ and then defines a new density $\\rho \\triangleq \\psi g$ (Eq 13) by arbitrarily multiplying this new \"quantum\" probability with the classical Gibbs distribution. This assumption is introduced ad hoc and is not derived from any preceding principles of optimization or quantization. The entire \"quantum mechanical\" part of the paper (Theorem 3.3) and the \"thermodynamic\" part (Theorem 3.2) are direct consequences of this single, unsubstantiated assumption. The paper fails to provide a rigorous justification for why signal quantization (a numerical rounding operation) should induce such a complex-valued wave function.\n2. Lack of Novelty in the Final Algorithm: After this extensive theoretical journey, the final SDE (Eq 23) and its discrete update rule (Eq 24) are formally identical to Annealed Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). The paper's framework serves as an extremely complex re-derivation of this well-known algorithm, where the \"quantization step size\" $Q_p^{-1}(t)$ is simply a re-labeling of the temperature $T(t)$ in a cooling schedule. The connection between Langevin dynamics, Fokker-Planck, and escaping potential barriers (which can be interpreted as tunneling via path integrals) is standard, decades-old knowledge in statistical physics and is not a novel contribution of this work.\n3. Unconvincing ML Experimental Support: The ML experiments (Sec 4.2) test the SGLD-like algorithm (Eq 25). The results in Table 3 are not compelling; the proposed QSLD/QSLGD methods are often outperformed by standard Adam or SGD (e.g., on CIFAR-100), which contradicts the paper's claims of superior optimization."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

For a given objective function $f(x)$, how would one find or write down the specific $\\overline{\\psi}$ (and thus $\\rho$ via Eq 13) that this assumption claims must exist? Without a constructive proof, this assumption remains arbitrary.\n4.

The whole text is written in a physicsy language without a comprehensive computer science intuition. I am worrying that this submission might not find a suitable audience at ICLR. \n\nIn particular, I was trying to grasp the main algorithmic results of this work, but I don't think Theorems 3.1, 3.2, or 3.3 can serve in this role. They just say how to map one type of dynamics to another, but they didn't say anything about why such maps work. For example, does the ground state of equation (17) solve the optimization problem? If so, in what quality? In many places, the authors make vague claims without quantitatively justifying them. For example, in Lines 334-336, \"when the energy gap is sufficiently small, the quantum tunneling effect enables the system's state to transition to a lower energy...\" This vague statement lacks precise characterization, such as in what probability, what the transition rate is, and how the rate depends on the energy gap. In addition, the general computer science audience might not know what the energy gap is.\n\nThis work might contain an important contribution; however, based on the current presentation, it is very hard to justify its value. For example, there's no convergence analysis, so it's hard to see whether this framework has any advantage compared with classical analysis. I think the ultimate goal, as pointed out by the authors, is to propose quantum algorithms based on this framework. Maybe this work will find its value once faster quantum algorithms are developed based on it.\n\nBesides, there is existing work on using quantum mechanical frameworks to speed up optimization problems, for example, arXiv:2303.01471, arXiv:2503.15878, and arXiv:2505.14670.
