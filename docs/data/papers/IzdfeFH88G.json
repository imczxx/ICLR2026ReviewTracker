The core difficulty lies in balancing model stability (preserving old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge). We propose Subspace-Guided Continual Learning (SGCL), a novel method that tackles this dilemma from a geometric perspective. SGCL functionally decomposes the feature space into two orthogonal subspaces: a ''stable subspace'' containing feature directions critical for previous tasks, and a ''plastic subspace'' where new knowledge can be learned with minimal interference. We demonstrate that this decomposition can be efficiently identified by analyzing the feature-space Hessian, where its high-curvature eigendirections define the stable subspace. Building on this, SGCL introduces two synergistic components: 1) Subspace-Guided Regularization (SGR), which imposes strong, curvature-weighted penalties on feature drifts within the stable subspace, and 2) Subspace-Guided Prototype Alignment (SGPA), which adaptively corrects the shift of old-class prototypes to recalibrate the classifier. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-Subset, show that SGCL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Sensitivity to hyperparameters:\nThe method’s performance strongly depends on the choice of the stability and plasticity weights (λₛ and λₚ). Since there’s no adaptive or self-tuning mechanism, the optimal balance must be found manually for each dataset or architecture, which limits its general applicability and robustness.\n\n2. Approximation of the Hessian:\nSGCL relies on an expected feature-space Hessian estimated through softmax probabilities. This assumes the loss landscape is locally smooth, which may not hold in highly non-linear or deeper models. As a result, the estimated curvature directions might not always represent the true “stable” directions, leading to imperfect subspace separation.\n\n2. Dependence on classifier conditioning:\nThe subspace extraction process assumes that the classifier weight matrix \n𝑊\n𝑡\n−\n1\nW\nt−1 is full-rank and well-conditioned. In practice, as the number of classes grows, some directions can become degenerate or highly correlated, making the QR decomposition unstable and potentially distorting the identified subspace.\n\n3. Simplified distributional assumption:\nThe prototype alignment module (SGPA) assumes that each class’s feature distribution is roughly Gaussian when generating synthetic samples for calibration. However, deep feature spaces are often multi-modal and non-Gaussian, which can lead to inaccurate prototype correction and weaker classifier adaptation.\n\n4. Rigid subspace separation:\nThe method treats the stable and plastic subspaces as strictly orthogonal, but in real feature manifolds, these directions are often correlated. This rigid projection-based split might discard useful shared information, causing minor interference or loss of representational richness over time."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The information of stable subspaces seems only workable for the latest task. The stable subspaces used in task $t$ relies on the Hessian matrix calculated with the data in task $t-1$, which seems that this information only works for the perservation of important knowledge of task $t-1$ and not for previous tasks. Can this regularization benefit the previous knowledge or can the subspace decomposion cover the previous tasks?\n2. Limitation in proposition 1. The proposition 1 requires a full row rank $ {\\mathbf{W}_{t-1}}$.  However, for learning task on a larger dataset like ImageNet-1k where $d \\gt c$ , it is likely that  it will not have full row rank.  As such, proposition 1 may not hold and what will happen on the subspace decomposition? Corresponding analysis and experiments should be included. The experiment may be conducted on ImageNet-1k since the ResNet-18 has $d = 512$ and $c = 1000$.\n\n\n3. The results of the plastic regularization seems not consistent. Intuitively, the regularization on plasticity can hinder learning on the new tasks. The corresponding experiment in Figure 5 also validates this, where accuracy of current tasks experiences a performance drop as the $\\lambda_{p}$ increases. However, without the plastic regularization, the overall performance of SGCL drops. Why this happen and could you please include further analysis on it?\n4.
