It is a key capability for AI to attribute humans' mental states based on dynamic interactions from a first-person perspective and then improve responses to humans accordingly. However, the existing benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) focus on testing their ToM capability with story-reading from a third-person perspective, leading to a critical gap between benchmark performance and practical competence in HAI collaborative and supportive tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel evaluation framework within HAI contexts, shifting from static test-taking to dynamic, first-person engagement. Our framework assesses LLM performance across two fundamental types of interaction scenarios derived from cognitive science: goal-oriented tasks (e.g., coding, math) and experience-oriented tasks (e.g., counseling). With the framework, we systematically evaluate LLMs and related techniques to improve their ToM across four synthesized benchmarks and a crowdsourcing user study with 100 participants. Our findings reveal that improvements on static benchmarks do not always translate to better performance in dynamic HAI interactions. This paper offers critical insights into ToM evaluation, highlighting the necessity of interaction-based assessments and providing a roadmap for developing next-generation, socially aware LLMs for HAI symbiosis.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Theory of Mind", "Large Language Model", "Human-AI Interaction"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5ecbc58decc405b3d8758577e99823ae66a0a889.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/aaf211cd14ddb74f6c89719bc9651ec539bdfcc9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces an evaluation framework for LLMs' ToM in the human-AI (HAI) context, shifting from static third-person story-acting to dynamic engagement.

The authors propose a framework, but they use previous data for evaluation instead of constructing their own, which weakens the contribution. I believe the **user study** (N=100) is a more significant contribution, yet the paper devotes insufficient space and analysis to it. Therefore, the focus of this paper may require some reorganization.\n3. The performance gap between ToM and the tasks in this paper, from the perspective of deep learning, seems to stem more from the **inconsistency between training objectives and downstream tasks**. The paper's analysis remains at a **superficial**, result-oriented level (both quantitative and qualitative), lacking in - depth analysis of intermediate processes.

The only apparent modification is a shift in narrative perspective (first-person vs third-person), which does not constitute genuine dynamic or interactive reasoning. Evaluation metrics are largely task-dependent rather than analyzing any mental states, raising doubts about whether the methodology truly reflects dynamic, interactive ToM.\n2. Evaluating ToM on math and code generation tasks appears unnecessary, as these tasks primarily require formal reasoning and problem-solving rather than modeling mental states or intentions. The chat-like format does not involve genuine interaction, suggesting a limited understanding of ToM and undermining the relevance of the results. The results in Table 1 prove this.\n3. The three contributions listed by the authors are not clearly reflected in the experiments and the method design.\n4. Experiments focus mainly on task performance, but it is unclear whether the LLMs actually perform ToM reasoning, since none of the ToM components are explicitly analyzed.\n5.
