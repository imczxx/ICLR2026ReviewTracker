Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of consistent edited input views, TINKER delivers robust, multi-view consistent edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel components: (1) Multi-view consistent editor: Enables precise, reference-driven edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video scene completion model : Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse inputs. Through extensive experiments, TINKER significantly reduces the barrier to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks, while also demonstrating strong potential for 4D editing. We believe that TINKER represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D and 4D editing.", "tldr": "TINKER achieves generalizable 3D editing with one or few inputs without per-scene optimization and demonstrating strong potential for 4D editing.", "keywords": ["Diffusion Model", "3D Editing"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6ecade5c44cd2ba3dacd6078e54926c3a58f2095.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/fefa62349acd0c9b55727b02d8ae572346f8f411.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a feedforward 3D scene editing pipeline and introduces a multi-view consistent image editing dataset.

We are grateful for the constructive comments and the positive recognition of our work.\n\nWe are highly encouraged to note that the reviewers share our focus on the same key future directions, such as Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian. We are grateful for this insightful engagement and the opportunity to discuss the future evolution and potential improvements for TINKER with **Reviewer c8ha** and **Reviewer RuqL**.\n\nWe are particularly grateful to **Reviewer KqtQ** and **Reviewer yNST**, who provided not only highly professional critiques but also invaluable suggestions for enhancing TINKER.\n**Reviewer KqtQ** raised several great points, including: (1) the impact of view variations, (2) the potential for depth map-induced hallucinations, (3) concerns over inference cost, and (4) an inquiry into a specific edge artifact. We have thoroughly addressed each of these in our individual response, providing detailed explanations and new supporting experiments. In our response, we demonstrated that large view variations, rather than being detrimental, actually provide greater informational gain that enhances model performance. We also clarified that the use of depth maps is a key factor in mitigating model-induced hallucinations. Regarding practical concerns, we explained that TINKER's inference cost can be readily optimized by leveraging existing acceleration techniques. Finally, we clarified that the noted edge artifact is not a fundamental limitation of our method and can be straightforwardly resolved.\n\n**Reviewer yNST** identified an imprecision in our \"per-scene fine-tune\" terminology. We have corrected this in the revised paper, explicitly stating that this process encompasses both model training and costly hyper-parameter tuning. Furthermore, in response to the suggestions, we have incorporated: (1) comprehensive experiments about flux-adapted baselines, (2) a new User Study to validate that TINKER's results are strongly preferred by users, and (3) more data visualizations to improve clarity.\n\nThe professionalism and insightful feedback from all the reviewers have been instrumental in significantly improving the quality and rigor of our work. Finally, we hope to express our sincere gratitude again to all reviewers, as well as to the ACs, SACs, and PCs, for their substantial time and dedicated effort throughout this review process."}}, "id": "vJ0vF7ZEAY", "forum": "j7Vt2lp2jX", "replyto": "j7Vt2lp2jX", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission144/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission144/Authors"], "number": 7, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission144/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763312916801, "cdate": 1763312916801, "tmdate": 1763312916801, "mdate": 1763312916801, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
