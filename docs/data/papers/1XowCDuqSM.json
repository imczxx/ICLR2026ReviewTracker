Conventional Clusterwise Linear Regression (CLR) mitigates this issue by learning $K$ local regressors. However, existing algorithms either optimize latent binary indicators, (i) providing no explicit rule for assigning an $\\textit{unseen}$ covariate vector to a cluster at test time, or rely on heuristic mixture of experts approaches, (ii) lacking convergence guarantees. To address these limitations, we propose $\\textit{covariate-guided}$ CLR, an end-to-end framework that jointly learns an assignment function and $K$ linear regressors within a single gradient-based optimization loop. During training, a proxy network iteratively predicts coefficient vectors for inputs, and hard vector quantization assigns samples to their nearest codebook regressors. This alternating minimization procedure yields monotone descent of the empirical risk, converges under mild assumptions, and enjoys a PAC-style excess-risk bound. By treating the covariate data from all clusters as a single concatenated design matrix, we derive an $F$-test statistic from a nested linear model, quantitatively characterizing the effective model complexity. As $K$ varies, our method spans the spectrum from a single global linear model to instance-wise fits. Experimental results show that our method exactly reconstructs synthetic piecewise-linear surfaces, achieves accuracy comparable to strong black-box models on standard tabular benchmarks, and consistently outperforms existing CLR and mixture-of-experts approaches.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Clusterwise Linear Regression (CLR)", "Covariate-Guided Assignment", "Proxy Network", "Vector Quantization", "Convergence Guarantee"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/43e8e745b097d389426254fb7eabb2c321abe1c2.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b6774425011c28cdf68c6dbc3ff951a41ae38607.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Covariate-Guided Clusterwise Linear Regression (CG-CLR), which jointly learns a covariate-based assignment rule and multiple local linear regressors in an end-to-end fashion.

Because the model uses local linear regressors, it maintains a level of interpretability – each cluster’s behavior can be understood via a simple linear formula. The learned “codebook” of regressors is compact, making the overall model relatively easy to inspect and reason about. This is an advantage over complex black-box models and aligns with the paper’s motivation of balancing accuracy and interpretability.\n\n3.

This is basically generalization in conventional machine learning setup, and is not special to this particular task. The authors should make it clear that the actual strength is the proxy is label independent, which means the algorithm is unsupervised in natural. I'm also not sure how much ``the inner minimization over $j$ cannot be evaluated at test time because the response $y_i'$ associated with an unseen covariate vector $x_i′$ is unknown at prediction time'' is undesirable. We can always estimate generalization error by cross validation/hold-out set if needed. \n* The linear convergence result requires a uniform lower bound on the proxy network's Jacobian, strong convexity and smoothness of the alignment loss.
