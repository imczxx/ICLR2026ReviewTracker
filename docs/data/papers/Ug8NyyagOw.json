Recent advances in video diffusion models have improved visual quality, yet they struggle with fine-grained text-video alignment, often leading to attribute mismatches, incorrect object interactions, and compositional failures. In this paper, we identify that this limitation stem from a predominant focus on video reconstruction rather than explicitly learning structured text-video correspondences. To address this, we propose Joint Distribution Modeling (JDM), a novel framework that enhances fine-grained alignment by modeling the joint distribution of video content and object masks. Unlike prior methods that rely on external constraints, JDM inherently learns structured mappings between textual descriptions and video regions, improving compositional consistency. We theoretically demonstrate that JDM improves text-video alignment by directly optimizing for fine-grained correspondences rather than relying on implicit learning from data. Experimental results show that JDM significantly enhances alignment while maintaining high video quality. Furthermore, JDM unifies video generation and segmentation within a single framework, paving the way for more structured and controllable text-to-video synthesis.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diffusion Model", "Video Generation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8aee7a96058c479c94885ca23844857ed8b0b2bc.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/2b81c4c24936e84049e467bb2b03713aae90e8dc.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Joint Distribution Modeling (JDM), a novel framework designed to improve fine-grained text-to-video (T2V) alignment and compositional consistency.

The reported training setup is prohibitively resource-intensive for most academic labs. The model was trained on a cluster of 80 Nvidia RTX 4090 GPUs for 30,000 steps. This extreme resource requirement effectively renders the work non-reproducible for the general research community.\n2. There is no analysis of the model's sensitivity to imperfect object masks. If the training masks contain noise or inconsistencies (a common issue in large-scale automated segmentation), the model may learn spurious correlations between noisy text-mask pairs.\n3. While JDM is trained to generate masks, the quality of these generated masks during inference (when they are unknown) is critical for validating the unified framework claim. The paper needs a dedicated analysis showing the quality of the segmented output generated by JDM.\n4. The demonstrated failure modes (semantic leakage) primarily relate to spatial composition and attribute binding.

The paper neither includes a comparison of JDM-Mask with CMI reweighting versus JDM-Mask without it, nor does it provide a comparison between using regional masks corresponding to the input text and using simple per-object segmentation.
