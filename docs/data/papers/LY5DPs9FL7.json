It enables humans to express thoughts, share intentions, and reason about complex phenomena. Despite our fluency in using and understanding language, the question of how it arises and evolves over time remains unsolved. A leading hypothesis in linguistics and anthropology posits that language evolved to meet the ecological and social demands of early human cooperation. Language did not arise in isolation, but through shared survival goals.\nInspired by this view, we investigate the emergence of language in multi-agent Foraging Games. These environments are designed to reflect the cognitive and ecological constraints believed to have influenced the evolution of communication.\nAgents operate in a shared grid world with only partial knowledge about other agents and the environment, and must coordinate to complete games like picking up high-value targets or executing temporally ordered actions. Using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, agents learn both actions and communication strategies from scratch.\nWe find that agents develop communication protocols with hallmark features of natural language: arbitrariness, interchangeability, displacement, cultural transmission, and compositionality. We quantify each property and analyze how different factors, such as population size, social dynamics, and temporal dependencies, shape specific aspects of the emergent language.\nOur framework serves as a platform for studying how language can evolve from partial observability, temporal reasoning, and cooperative goals in embodied multi-agent settings.

I found it to contextualize well within the emergent communication literature, and to go above and beyond experimentally, exploring the interaction of many variables (population size, embodiment, bidirectional channel, compositionality, etc) that are usually explored separately. \n\nTo me, **the highlight of the paper was the result on displacement**, which is nontrivial, and to the best of my knowledge, has not been shown before. I would definitely emphasize this finding (nothing wrong with the other findings, but they mostly confirm existing results). An interesting aspect of the spatial/temporal markers is that they are tied to **communicative need**, i.e., the fact that in Game II (where displacement emerges) time information was necessary to succeed at the game, whereas in Game I it was not. This ties well into theories that what gets lexicalized in language are things that are important to communicate about (cf. Gualdoni et al., 2024, Bickerton 2009).\n\nOverall, I think the findings + environment are relevant to the emergent communication community, and I would recommend acceptance."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "There were two main weaknesses, both of which affected my score.

FG is a multi-agent 5x5 gridworld for studying Emergent Communication. Agents can move in a partially-observed two dimensional grid, communicate discrete tokens over a communication channel (a part of the action space), and collect objects towards accomplishing an objective. There are two types of objectives in the game (each yielding a different environment):\n- ScoreG: Two objects are given different scores, each agent knows one of the scores, the agents must simultaneously pick up the higher-scoring object. The agents cannot see each other.\n- TemporalG: Objects are spawned over time in one of the agents' field of view. Agents must pick up the objects on an agreed-upon order.\n\nThe authors study the learning dynamics and the emergent communication protocol. In particular, experiments examine the following questions:\n1. Does an effective communication protocol emerge?\n2. Is the communication protocol compositional? This is done by measuring topographical similarity between messages and meanings.\n3. The effect of population size. Here population refers to the number of instantiations of the architecture, e.g. population size $15$ means that at every round of training two of fifteen NN instantiations are taken as the agent policies.\n4. The effect of the social network structure. For example, Self-Play means letting an agent policy play with itself (a loop in the network), a ring network means letting the $i$th player play with the $i + 1 mod N$ player, where $N$ is the population size. In addition, rings-with-cliques and a Watts-Strogatz networks are examined.

This was the first (or among the first) papers to study embodied emergent communication, specifically with agents moving on a (continuous) two dimensional world, without seeing each other, in order to reach landmarks (equiv. pick up objects) at a certain order. That paper explicitly studied compositionality. None of this is mentioned in the paper, which is the main reason for my presentation score (contextualization relative to prior work). Presenting this paper as a follow-up to Mordatch and Abbeel would be more honest with respect to originality; considering the impact of the 2017 paper, it would only strengthen this paper.\n- The ablation on \"Implicit Communication\" is essentially changing the Emergent Communication setup to a Social Learning one (Ndousse et al., 2021 and several other papers around that time by Natasha Jaques). In MARL social learning, the question is whether agents learn from each other by observing each others' actions. The connection should be made explicit.\n- The paper neglects to mention the rich body of literature on embodied emergent communication, indeed starting from Mordatch and Abbeel. In particular, the second paragraph in the introduction seems to imply that the study of embodied emergent communication is novel to this paper; that is far from the case.\n- More broadly, the title, introduction and conclusion of the paper suggest that the paper has ramifications to the study of the evolution of language. The question of whether results emergent communication have meaning for natural language is a topic for heated debate [e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4]. In particular [1] argues that following Hockett's design feature (such as displacement, emphasized in this paper) do not necessarily bear significance for language evolution. This is the reason for my soundness score. I suggest instead that the authors reframe their paper as bearing meaning on training dynamics of MARL, rather than overpromising and underevaluating as a paper on natural language evolution.\n- Minor: Citation styles are in the wrong format in most of the paper.
