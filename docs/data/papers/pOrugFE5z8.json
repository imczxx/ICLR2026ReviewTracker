Extensive research has confirmed that no single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths. ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks. Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.", "tldr": "For unseen time series zero-shot forecasting task, model-task co-embedding enables O(1)-complexity selection of optimal foundation models from a growing model zoo.", "keywords": ["Time series forecasting", "Model Zoo", "Zero-shot forecasting", "Foundation models", "Model Selection", "Model-task co-embedding"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c1cbc5964a2e8e2e8f175eac7abc27e9f6eaf589.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ZooCast, which is a framework that enhances zero-shot time series forecasting by combining multiple time series foundation models.
