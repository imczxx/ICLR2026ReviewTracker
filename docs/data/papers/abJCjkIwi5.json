Most existing studies generate trajectories without explicitly exploiting possible scene evolution, while world models predict consequences from ego behavior, enabling more informed planning decisions. Inspired by the world model, we propose OccDriver, a novel rasterized-to-vectorized dual-branch framework for trajectory planning. This pipeline performs a coarse-to-fine trajectory decoding process: The vectorized branch first generate multimodal coarse trajectories; Then the rasterized branch predicts future scene evolutions conditioned on each coarse trajectory via occupancy flow prediction; Lastly, the vectorized branch leverages intuitive future interaction evolution of each modality from the rasterized branch and produces refined trajectories. Several cross-modality (occupancy and trajectory) losses are further introduced to improve the consistency between trajectory and occupancy prediction. Additionally, we apply a contingency objective in both occupancy space, considering marginal and joint occupancy distributions in different planning scopes. Our model is assessed on the large-scale real-world nuPlan dataset and its associated planning benchmark. Experiments show that OccDriver achieves state-of-the-art in both Non-Reactive and Reactive closed-loop performance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Autonomous Driving", "Trajectory Planning"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3621f612e63c3e68d2db59ca65fa0dd6db8be63a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/aa1dffc09576ff3835a29fd5115982fb87698e21.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes OccDriver, a dual-branch transformer framework that integrates future occupancy prediction into trajectory planning for autonomous driving.

My main concern is the novelty of this paper. The concept of using occupancy prediction to guide planning is not new. Even UniAD[1] in 2023 has already explored joint designs between occupancy forecasting and trajectory generation. It seems that the main difference here is to adopt a parallel dual-branch structure rather than a cascaded one, which feels like an architectural variation rather than a fundamentally new paradigm. The claimed “future occupancy guidance” and “dual-branch feature interaction” are incremental extensions of prior occupancy-assisted pipelines.\n2. The related work section misses several closely aligned approaches (e.g., some end-to-end methods like World4Drive[2])\n3.
