Though MI has many explanation-generating methods and associated evaluation metrics, progress has been limited by the lack of a universal approach to evaluating explanatory methods.

We find that Compact Proofs consider many explanatory virtues and are hence a promising approach. Fruitful research directions implied by our framework include (1) clearly defining explanatory simplicity, (2) focusing on unifying explanations and (3) deriving universal principles for neural networks.

In addition, some explanatory methods may generate different explanations for a single model and task, with no clear way to choose between them. To solve this, the authors introduce the normative Explanatory Virtues framework, a set of desirable properties of explanations (or explanation methods) taken from four different approaches in the philosophy of science (Bayesian, Kuhnian, Deutschian and Nomological). They provide a rubric that defines satisfaction criteria for these virtues, and compare several explanatory methods (clustering, SAEs, circuits and Compact Proofs) under the lens of this rubric. Out of the evaluated methods, the authors find that Compact Proofs satisfy the most virtues. The listed virtues are also intended to help MI researchers develop better explanation methods and evaluation metrics."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- The identified problem is important and a common point of contention in modern MI, as identified by the authors. The amount of available techniques in MI has exploded, but progress is slowed by the lack of consensus on what it means for an explanation to be good, or how to compare competing explanations. This work provides a framework to assess these questions and ground future MI methods into well-accepted virtues from the philosophy of science.\n- The paper is well-written, structured, and argued. The authors do a good job of introduce complex philosophical concepts to an ML audience. The framework is systematically developed, virtues well-defined and grounding in the philosophy of science. Some virtues are defined using formalizations (the Bayesian ones). The detailed rubric included in Table 2 and the illustrative examples in the Appendix make the framework very clear.\n- The application of the framework to existing MI methods in Section 4 is rather compelling and shows the immediate applicability of the framework. For instance, the authors identify the importance in shifting from Parsimony to Correctness in the case of SAEs, and identify areas of improvement needed for circuit research (unification and nomologicity)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The work is crucially missing a discussion on prior work on desirable explanation properties in MI. Comprehensive frameworks like the \"Co-12 properties\" proposed by Nauta et al (2022) provide a well-established vocabulary for discussing the quality of explanations, with many of their properties having direct counterparts in the Explanatory Virtues framework. Other (albeit less detailed) such frameworks can be found field-specific reviews (\"Essential properties and explanation effectiveness of explainable artificial intelligence in healthcare: A systematic review\", \"How Should AI Decisions Be Explained? Requirements for Explanations from the Perspective of European Law\", \"Finding the right XAI method — A Guide for the Evaluation and Ranking of Explainable AI Methods in Climate Science\") as well as applied works such as \"What Makes a Good Explanation?: A Harmonized View of Properties of Explanations\". Regrettably, the authors do not define their contribution in relation to these existing frameworks. As a result, researchers familiar with the XAI literature might see the paper as reinventing established concepts rather than building upon them. This is by far the most important flaw of the paper, which makes me lean towards rejection.\n- One weakness of this work is the difficulty in operationalizing and quantifying some of the proposed virtues, which limits its immediate practical usefulness. While the Bayesian virtues are formalized, some concepts (e.g. Hard-to-Varyness, Unification, Nomologicity) are mostly qualitative. The rubric in Table 2 is useful, but it relies on categorical judgments (Highly/Weakly/Not Virtuous). A discussion of the challenges of developing more quantitative measures for these virtues would help strengthen this paper. Another option is providing more concrete guidance on how to apply the rubric to avoid ambiguity.\n- The paper is entirely theoretical. This is appropriate for a conceptual contribution of this nature, but it likely limits its visibility to the targeted MI community. The impact of the paper could be vastly amplified by even a small, demonstrative use case. For example, the authors could show how to apply Explanatory Virtues to modify an existing MI method like SAEs or circuit discovery in a non-trivial way, and then empirically demonstrate that this leads to explanations that are measurably better (more robust, generalizable, useful for a downstream task like model editing...)."}, "questions": {"value": "- The authors convincingly argue that \"Nomological Principles\" are neglected in practice. What could a \"general law\" or \"universal principle\" for neural networks look like? Are there any early candidates from the literature?\n- The formalization of \"Hard-to-Varyness\" is elegant, but its utility depends on the choice of the complexity measure. What are the authors' thoughts on appropriate choices for that measure in the context of MI?\n- How do the authors see their framework interacting with newer benchmarks like the MI benchmark mentioned in the appendix? The authors position the EVF at a \"meta-level,\" but the framework is only as useful as its impact on future research. Could the virtues be used to design better, more comprehensive benchmark tasks that go beyond simple localization?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ZeyoxGhIo8", "forum": "ToUla3c9kW", "replyto": "ToUla3c9kW", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22133/Reviewer_fRBQ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22133/Reviewer_fRBQ"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22133/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761991414927, "cdate": 1761991414927, "tmdate": 1762942081569, "mdate": 1762942081569, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the Explanatory Virtues Framework (EVF) as a philosophical and theoretical foundation for evaluating explanations in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI).

It's also not clear how it connects to the next paragraph. Also, in this paragraph you claim that explanations aim at knowledge. Later you state that they aim at truth...

In the former, we are trying to distinguish between different hypotheses about the world, and explanations are a tool for getting there. In the latter, we are trying to understand the mechanism by which a fully known NN produces its output. The relation between these projects is not at all clear to me.
