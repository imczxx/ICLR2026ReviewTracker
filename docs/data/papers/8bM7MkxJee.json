Collectively, these neurons are held to support a cognitive map of the environment, enabling the recall of and navigation to specific locations. Although recent studies have characterised the timelines of spatial neuron development, no unifying mechanistic model has yet been proposed. Moreover, the processes driving the emergence of spatial representations in the hippocampus remain unclear (Tan et al., 2017). Here, we combine computational analysis of postnatal locomotor development with a recurrent neural network (RNN) model of hippocampal function to demonstrate how changes in movement statistics -- and the resulting sensory experiences -- shape the formation of spatial tuning. First, we identify distinct developmental stages in rat locomotion during open-field exploration using published experimental data. Then, we train shallow RNNs to predict upcoming visual stimuli from concurrent visual and vestibular inputs, exposing them to trajectories that reflect progressively maturing locomotor patterns. Our findings reveal that these changing movement statistics drive the sequential emergence of spatially tuned units, mirroring the developmental timeline observed in rats. The models generate testable predictions about how spatial tuning properties mature -- predictions we confirm through analysis of hippocampal recordings. Critically, we demonstrate that replicating the specific statistics of developmental locomotion -- rather than merely accelerating sensory change -- is essential for the emergence of an allocentric spatial representation. These results establish a mechanistic link between embodied sensorimotor experience and the ontogeny of hippocampal spatial neurons, with significant implications for neurodevelopmental research and predictive models of navigational brain circuits.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["recurrent neural network", "spatial representations", "hippocampus", "development", "locomotion", "rats"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3f2dec28d8650483865f3b5d633c8bfe12089dd1.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a8a5f43eb07b7c1af69e12af9f45c1f0c8922820.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a compelling computational account of how locomotor\ndevelopment shapes hippocampal spatial representations.

However, there are a few things that I think should be addressed to make the paper stronger:\n\n1. The authors train the RNN to do one time-step ahead prediction of both motor and sensory state. For path integration, this kind of one step prediction makes sense to me. E.g. when it's dark and I walk from my bed to my bathroom, I'm constantly updating where I think I am. But it was unclear to me: a) why this kind of one time-step prediction would be done in the hippocampus with sensory information b) why this prediction should be one time-step ahead (as opposed to other time-scales, or multiple time-scales). Adding more discussion on this to provide better motivation would be helpful I think. \n\n2. The authors correctly say that their approach for identifying place and head direction cells - based on a spatial information metric - is standard. However, there is a growing understanding in the systems neuroscience field that a fixed threshold may not be the best way to classify. Many labs now use measures of cross-validation, robustness, consistency, etc., as well as compare to shuffled controls, to identify place cells. I understand the authors are primarily comparing to older experiments where this fixed thresholding approach was used, but it would be helpful I think to include some quantification of robustness of the place and head direction cells. If you split the trial in half and compute the SI for each half, is it similar? \n\n3. Related to the point above, it would be helpful to have population summary level plots of the distribution of spatial information and RVL, in addition to having individual units plotted (Fig. 3). This would help the readers understand the extent to which the RNN model develops these kinds of properties. \n\n4. Border cells seem to emerge in both the rodent recordings and the RNN model. Does the border score (and percent border cells) also increase in a similar way between RNN and neurophsyiological data? If so, this could be a further strengthening of the results (and could potentially be a supplemental figure). If no, then this suggests something different between the RNN and rodent development that would be interesting to comment on. \n\n5. Finally, Cueva and Wei (2019) looked at how an RNN trained to perform path integration develops spatial representations. They find that HD units emerge first, then border units, then grid units. This is in rough agreement with actual experiments. While Cueva and Wei (2019) did not consider how properties of trajectories the RNN follows impacts the development (as the authors of this submission do), I do think it is reasonable for the authors to acknowledge this prior work and its attempt to study development of spatial representation through RNNs."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Why do the authors choose the loss function they do (one time-step ahead prediction)? \n\n2. How robust are the place and HD cells the model produces? \n\n3.

Overly Strong and Unjustified Core Hypothesis: The central assumption that developmental changes in brain spatial representations are solely determined by locomotor patterns is a drastic oversimplification. This hypothesis completely neglects the crucial role of genetically programmed neural system development, which is an undeniable and fundamental aspect of brain maturation. To validate such a strong, almost certainly unreasonable assumption, the authors would need exceptionally compelling evidence, which is conspicuously absent.\n\n2. Insufficient Evidence to Support the Core Hypothesis: The model, at best, can only capture some features of CA1 representational development. Crucially, the authors themselves acknowledge that their model fails to spontaneously generate grid cells, and struggles to adequately characterize the developmental features of head-direction (HD) cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and other relevant brain regions. This demonstrates that their core hypothesis lacks the explanatory power to account for the full complexity of the navigation system's development. If locomotor patterns were the primary driver, the model should reproduce these key elements more robustly.\n\n3. Biological Implausibility of Model Choice for CA1: The authors' argument that their RNN model is specifically modeling CA1 is highly problematic and fundamentally flawed.\n(1) **Lack of Biological Constraints**: The RNN model is trained without any specific biological constraints pertinent to CA1. Without articulating why brain regions other than CA1 cannot be similarly modeled as RNNs, this claim is entirely unsubstantiated.\n(2) **Contradiction with CA1 Connectivity**: CA1 is widely recognized for having very sparse recurrent connections; indeed, it is primarily considered a feedforward processing stage from CA3 and entorhinal cortex. Therefore, using a recurrent neural network (RNN), whose defining characteristic is its rich internal recurrence, to model a region known for its lack of such connections is biologically inconsistent and fundamentally unsound. This choice of model severely undermines any mechanistic insights the paper claims to offer regarding CA1 function."}, "questions": {"value": "Could the authors provide insight into why their current framework might be insufficient for this emergence, especially when compared to other models, such as the Tolman-Eichenbaum Machine (TEM), which have successfully produced grid-like representations?
