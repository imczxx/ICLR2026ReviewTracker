A Proof-of-Concept with Policy-Aware Matrix Completion", "abstract": "Sparse-reward reinforcement learning typically focuses on exploration, but we ask: can structural assumptions about reward functions themselves accelerate learning? We introduce \\textbf{Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC)}, which exploits low-rank structure in reward matrices while correcting for policy-induced sampling bias. PAMC combines three key components: (i) a low-rank plus sparse reward model, (ii) inverse propensity weighting to handle Missing-Not-At-Random (MNAR) data, and (iii) confidence-gated abstention that falls back to intrinsic exploration when uncertain. We provide finite-sample theory showing that completion error scales as $O(\\sigma\\sqrt{r(|\\mathcal{S}|+|\\mathcal{A}|)/\\text{ESS}})$ where ESS is the effective sample size under policy overlap $\\kappa$. PAMC achieves strong empirical results: 4100$\\pm$250 return vs. 200$\\pm$50 for DrQ-v2 on Montezuma's Revenge, 78\\% vs. 65\\% success rate on MetaWorld-50, and 15\\% improvement over CQL on D4RL datasets. The method maintains 8\\% computational overhead while providing calibrated confidence intervals (95\\% empirical coverage). When structural assumptions are violated, PAMC gracefully degrades through increased abstention rather than catastrophic failure.
