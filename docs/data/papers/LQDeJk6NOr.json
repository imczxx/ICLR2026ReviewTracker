However, their utility is significantly limited by substantial computational costs, which severely restrict accessible timescales for many biologically relevant processes. Despite the encouraging performance of existing machine learning (ML) methods, they struggle to generate extended biomolecular system trajectories, primarily due to the lack of MD datasets and the large computational demands of modeling long historical trajectories. Here, we introduce BioMD, the first all-atom generative model to simulate long-timescale protein-ligand dynamics using a hierarchical framework of forecasting and interpolation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of BioMD on the DD-13M (ligand unbinding) and MISATO datasets. For both datasets, BioMD generates highly realistic conformations, showing high physical plausibility and low reconstruction errors. Besides, BioMD successfully generates ligand unbinding paths for 97.1% of the protein-ligand systems within ten attempts, demonstrating its ability to explore critical unbinding pathways. Collectively, these results establish BioMD as a tool for simulating complex biomolecular processes, offering broad applicability for computational chemistry and drug discovery.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["molecular dynamics", "biomolecular trajectories generation"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/760d3e26b2bb4ed7053ed78ff9076b0251513200.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper develops a method BioMD, which generates time evolution of protein and ligand structures using a hierarchical architecture and flow matching.

Can the model generalize to different time intervals, or is it restricted to this specific temporal resolution? If the latter, this should be explicitly stated as a limitation. \n- The DD-13M dataset is generated using enhanced sampling simulation, instead of unbiased MD. Therefore, BioMD is learning to reproduce biased trajectories, not true thermodynamic/kinetic unbinding behavior. The generated trajectories may not reflect realistic dissociation kinetics, and the model may be learning to mimic the \"push\" behavior by the biased potential in enhanced sampling. Currently, the paper does not clearly distinguish this subtlety.\n- The success criterion (Section A.3.4) only requires that \"at least one predicted ligand centroid position lies outside this convex hull.\" The success rate is thus measuring \"can find a way out\" rather than \"finds the correct way out.\" \n- The reported MAE and MSE metrics average over all frames and trajectories. This can mask catastrophic failures in individual frames. The authors should consider providing more comprehensive failure analysis, including per-frame error distributions, percentage of frames with physical violations etc.\n- The paper proposes the hierarchical architecture, but lacks the justification and ablation on the necessity of the hierarchy.

These metrics can reflect trajectory quality to some extent, but higher-dimensional evaluations or demonstrations would be more informative.

However, the MISATO dataset's simulation time (8 ns) is relatively short, insufficient to observe major protein conformational transitions (e.g., open-to-closed states). While DD-13M is a dissociation task, it was generated by metadynamics, an enhanced sampling method, not a spontaneous process in equilibrium. Therefore, the model's ability to simulate equilibrium rare events at the microsecond (µs) to millisecond (ms) level has not been demonstrated\n2. **Insufficient Evaluation of Protein Conformational Changes**: The evaluation of protein flexibility relies mainly on RMSF, which is an aggregate metric. In drug discovery, we are often more concerned with specific conformational changes near the binding pocket, such as the flipping of key side-chains or the movement of \"gating\" residues. The paper lacks an in-depth case study on these critical biological events.\n3. The model's performance on DD-13M is highly dependent on the quality and coverage of the training data. The DD-13M dataset was generated using metadynamics, which means BioMD may have learned a biased distribution of \"how to dissociate quickly\" rather than the dynamics of the true Boltzmann distribution. Could the author provide some study on the OOD cases using BioMD?\n4. Lack of ablation studies, such as how the definition of \"large-step\" influences the final results and what is the effect of different sampling steps."}, "questions": {"value": "- Was any data cleaning performed on the MISATO dataset? For instance, were unstable simulation results (according to the RMSD result) filtered out before training?\n\n - Did you evaluate the difference between the generated protein conformations and the reference MD simulations, particularly regarding key conformational changes in the binding pocket? \n\n- Have you attempted to extend the model to even longer timescales (beyond those in DD-13M)? Given the acknowledged error accumulation, do you observe simulation collapse or instability over extended periods? Furthermore, the MISATO simulations are relatively short (8 ns), making it difficult to observe significant events like major conformational transitions. Could you provide representative case studies to demonstrate the model's ability (or limitations) in capturing such rare but significant events?\n\n- Regarding Figure 6, how consistent are the generated unbinding pathways with the reference metadynamics results?\n\n- I recommend including related works that do not directly recover the dynamics trajectories but recover the key binding pose and also use flow matching or diffusion models. There are some related works recommended. For example, DynamicBind [1] learns to transform unbound to bound states of protein-ligand complexes; DynamicFlow [2] uses a flow model to transform protein apo state and a noisy ligand to a holo state and a binding ligand to consider protein dynamics in structure-based drug design.\n\n\n**Note: I might raise my score according to the situation of rebuttal discussion and paper revision.**\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] DynamicBind: predicting ligand-specific protein-ligand complex structure with a deep equivariant generative model, Nature Machine Intelligence 2024\n\n[2] Integrating Protein Dynamics into Structure-Based Drug Design via Full-Atom Stochastic Flows.
