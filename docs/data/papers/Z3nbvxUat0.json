The problem of learning functional cognitive maps is shared by humans, animals and machines. However, we still lack a clear understanding of how people represent maps for planning, particularly when the goal is to support cost-efficient plans. We take inspiration from theory of compositional mental representations in cognitive science to propose GenPlan: a cognitively-grounded computational framework that models redundant structure in maps and saves planning cost through policy reuse. Our framework integrates (1) a Generative Map Module that infers generative compositional structure and (2) a Structure-Based Planner that exploits structural redundancies to reduce planning costs. We show that our framework closely aligns with human behavior, suggesting that people approximate planning by piecewise policies conditioned on world structure. We also show that our approach reduces the computational cost of planning while producing good-enough plans, and contribute a proof-of-concept implementation demonstrating how to build these principles into a working system.", "tldr": "We propose and validate a computational hypothesis by whcih people formulate cognitive maps as generative programs and plan with policy reuse.", "keywords": ["planning", "cognitive maps", "representation learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a316370c434746e5373552c4aed045de1be86074.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/fe390ec9fcef64db033a9338a5ce0f44fb67a7e4.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies structured planning, with a focus on the synthesis of compressed cognitive maps that retain only the most planning-salient information about an environment. The work's goal is twofold: first, to develop an explanatory algorithmic account of how people might be forming simplified cognitive maps and planning with them, and second, to advocate for this approach as a generic algorithmic template for structure based planning in practice, inspired by how people plan. Maze Search Task is used as the central planning domain, a simple partially observable grid game that has been of recent interest to similar work in which the player must exit the maze. The core of the approach is a two-piece algorithmic recipe: program induction over possible cognitive maps is used to hand off a transition function to a structured planner. Together, these pieces constitute \"Gen-POMCP\", a generative planner. This approach is contrasted with standard POMCP (without the program induction over maps), and a variant of POMCP that incorporates a cognitive constraint (Depth Plan). A human study is then conducted to draw out the explanatory power of these different hypotheses. Behavioral metrics are deployed to compare DepthPlan with Gen-POMCP in the user study. The primary finding is that Gen-POMCP is a better predictor of human behavior than DepthPlan."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "- The question to better understand how people abstract and plan is a deep and important one. The ingredients in the proposed theory are intuitive, and resonate with other similar methods in the literature.\n- The paper was easy to read, and the core of the method and experimental design are intuitive (with a minor exception regarding the details of the method, I detail this below).\n- Inclusion of a human study, and the initial results contrasting Gen-POMCP with DepthPlan, are compelling."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "W1. I am broadly sympathetic to the research agenda to understand how people plan. However, one stated contribution of the work is \"...an algorithmic account of how structure-based planning can be implemented in practice\". There are large bodies of literature within the ICAPS, AI, and RL communities dedicated to this question. As such, I believe the present work, to be treated as a novel algorithmic account of structure-based planning, needs to be contrasted using the same language and analysis that are used to evaluate planning algorithms (or, a convincing argument should be made about why different analysis tools are needed). For example, recent work by Wen et al. explicitly proves under what conditions structured planning can be efficient (Propositions 1-3). Or, early work on planning explores how structure changes the planning problem, as in ABSTRIPs by Sacerdoti (1974). Or, more recently, Jinnai et al. (2018) examine the computational hardness of finding structures that can make planning as easy as possible, and prove both that this problem is NP-Hard in general, but that efficient approximation algorithms can exist (along with an average-case result follow-up by Ivanov et al.). In this sense, there are many known results for understanding when and why we can design efficient algorithms for structure-based planning. I struggle to see the novelty here from an AI perspective, especially since (1) the basic mechanisms used to scrutinize planning algorithms are not engaged with (computational hardness, robustness, and so on), and (2) the work is not situated conceptually or experimentally relative to the vast body of literature that studies structure-based planning algorithms. As further examples, consider work by Anand et al. (2016) that develop \"on the go\" abstractions to facilitate tree-based search, or Hostetler et al. (2014), who make use of state aggregation to simplify MCTS, or seminal work by Littman (1997) that proves various hardness results about different kinds of planning. Or, we can look at hierarchical structure, as in SHOP (Nau, 1999) or HTNs (Erol, 1997). \n\nW2. Much of the terminology and notation are under-developed or lacking in rigor and depth. For instance, planning is described as search through a tree---this is one plausible account of planning, though is still only part of the story. See, for instance, the work by Littman, who gives precise formal definitions to certain variants of planning problems. Similarly, POMDPs are defined using a standard definition of Belief MDPs, which is non-standard; the introduced object is an MDP over belief state, rather than a POMDP (with Kaelbling et al. showing how to connect the two). See the standard POMDP definition in the cited Kaelbling et al. paper in Section 3.1. I can imagine the Belief MDP definition is introduced for a reason, but it would be more effective to introduce POMDPs in full detail, then describe their translation into a Markov process over belief state.\n\nW3. The primary contribution of the work is to offer an explanatory algorithmic account about how people might be carrying out structured planning in POMDPs. The evidence offered to support the conclusion that Gen-POMCP is a valid such explanatory account is relatively thin; a variety of competing accounts are described in Section 4, but the model predictions from these alternative theories are not contrasted with. For instance, the work by Ho et al. is described as showing \"that people form cognitive maps that facilitate planning ... by selectively representing only the goal-relevant parts of the map\". This sounds extremely similar to the proposal in this paper: I did not understand where the two theories come apart, and where one might have higher explanatory power than the other.\n\nW4. Lastly, the core method is not described in adequate detail. Pseudo-code will add clarity to what precisely is being proposed by Gen-POMCP.\n\nTo summarise: I perceive the stated contributed as spread across both (1) developing new structure-based planning algorithms inspired by compositional accounts of how people represent cognitive maps, and (2) a proposed explanatory account of how people form cognitive maps and plan with them. The former is missing contact with the rigor, literature, and core analysis tools that evaluate approaches to (structure-based) planning, and the latter is missing direct comparison to other models of how people form simplified representations and plan. In light of this, I take the core claims to not yet be well-supported by evidence, and so I recommend rejection at this time. I am happy to discuss during rebuttal if I have misunderstood, or if there are other factors that can remedy these issues.\n\nTypos and Writing Suggestions:\n\n- \" Solving there problems optimally \" --> maybe,  \"Solving these problems optimally \"?\n- \"In the the remainder of this section...\"\n\nReferences:\n- Anand, A., Noothigattu, R., & Singla, P.

The work introduces a novel framework by uniting generative modeling and planning in the context of cognitive maps, and provides scientifically significant results for cognitive science. What's particularly novel about the approach is the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to induce a programmatic map for environment representation. This allows tractable inference of structure where previous methods would require potentially intractable enumeration. The framework (GenPlan) is thus novel in how it integrates an LLM-induced programmatic structural prior with a planning algorithm – a creative synthesis of ideas from program induction, hierarchical planning, and cognitive psychology. The cognitive experiment shows a higher human similarity for GenPlan model, indicating that human deviations from optimal policies are, at least in part, due to approximating planning by piecewise policies conditioned on structure for policy reuse.\n2. The paper is technically solid and provides validation on its base claims.
