Previous methods leverage cross-attention to model inter-view redundancy and employ autoregressive entropy models to predict probability distributions, achieving impressive rate-distortion performance. However, they suffer from slow coding speed due to the quadratic complexity of cross-attention mechanisms and the spatial autoregressive iterations of the entropy models. To address these limitations, we propose MambaSIC, which introduces two key innovations.  First, we propose a Mamba-based stereo visual state space block (stereo VSSB) that leverages its linear complexity and long-range modeling capabilities to more rapidly and efficiently capture redundancy information between the two views. Second, to accelerate the compression process and enhance the accuracy of probability distribution estimation, we introduce a bi-directional multi-reference entropy model that utilizes a checkerboard partitioning strategy and the stereo VSSB to get rich inter-view priors. Experimental results demonstrate that our MambaSIC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both rate-distortion performance and coding efficiency. Moreover, it achieves the smallest inter-view PSNR discrepancy, resulting in more balanced reconstruction quality.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Stereo image compression; visual state space model"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9496a712bd6ced6d32edf6793dca83982cb63fa4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes MambaSIC, a novel stereo image compression framework that leverages the Mamba-based Stereo Visual State Space Block (Stereo VSSB) to efficiently capture long-range inter-view correlations with linear complexity.

The disparity between the left and right views can be significantly large. Within the proposed Stereo Visual State Space Block (Stereo VSSB), the straightforward concatenation of features from both views may introduce substantial irrelevant or noisy information. This unaligned fusion could contaminate the original feature representations and degrade their discriminative capacity, ultimately reducing the overall effectiveness of inter-view redundancy modeling.\n2. The integration of the Mamba mechanism into stereo feature interaction is implemented in a rather direct and naive manner. The authors simply apply Mamba-based state-space modeling across two views without introducing any geometry-aware or adaptive fusion strategy. As a result, the conceptual novelty of the Stereo VSSB is limited, since it mainly reuses Mamba’s existing selective scan structure without substantial modification or theoretical adaptation to stereo correspondence.\n3.
