We introduce hyper-parallel scaling, a complementary framework that improves prediction quality at the token level. Hyper-parallel scaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token from the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference algorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects controlled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to sample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for a more accurate final prediction.To overcome the computational cost, we introduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism that minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE model to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less compute for inference. These gains are achieved without any fine-tuning of model parameters.", "tldr": "We introduce Roster of Experts (RoE), a training-free inference method that efficiently increases MoE performance by turning a single model into a dynamic ensemble.", "keywords": ["Test-time Scaling", "Mixture-of-Experts", "Inference", "Training-Free", "MoE"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6cc1ccfa6f103a9aebd926a1db66cc0e11762fd6.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ee5b1bbd12df0abbb2d1e61fd0ec64f3e8e4eccb.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce a training-free framework complementary to chain-of-thought scaling by enabling parallel inference in MoE via repeatedly sampling activated experts, before aggregating the outputs from multiple computational paths to produce a more accurate next-token prediction.

The \"equivalent model size\" is a weak argument, as the authors point out the disconnect between perplexity and downstream task performance. While this remains a challenge in scaling law research, which is out of scope of this investigation, this nevertheless renders the argument less convincing. In addition, Figure 5 seems to suggest a diminishing return as the number of samples increases. What is the performance ceiling of RoE, and how does it compare to a vanilla best-of-N scaling?\n\n2. The author presents clean cache as a major contribution, but only evaluated it on one of the three models tested without offering a clear explanation. This seems to greatly undermine the case the authors attempt to build.\n\n3. The authors did not mention the cost associated with the Bayesian Optimization-based search. The authors present the layer-wise temperature as a parameter that requires careful tuning, but did not further discuss how difficult it is to obtain a good configuration nor how much time it takes.\n\n4. MoE as a class of models also varies significantly in how sparse they are. More discussions on how sparsity affects performance improvements could be added to understand the tradeoff.\n\n5.

The authors develop this idea to Mixture-of-Experts language models through the Roster of Experts (RoE), a training-free inference time scaling algorithm. RoE introduces randomness to the expert router using Gumbel-Top-k sampling with temperature. This creates multiple diverse expert choices for each token, then their outputs are aggregated to form a single next-token prediction. To make this practical, the authors propose batched inference so that multiple routed paths for the same token are evaluated in parallel and a \"Clean Cache\" KV-cache sharing method that avoids the memory blowup.
