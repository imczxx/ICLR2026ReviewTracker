Most scientific studies assume a specific structure involving unobservable variables for the data-generating process and draw inferences from a parameter of interest within that framework. Conformal prediction is a popular model-agnostic method for constructing prediction intervals for new observations. However, it typically requires observed true labels to build the prediction interval, making it unsuitable for unobserved latent variables. We propose a method to construct a prediction interval by leveraging sample-splitting of the training data and analyzing the discrepancy between two independently trained models. To ensure the identifiability of the distribution of this conformity score, we introduce a few assumptions regarding the distribution of the residuals of the predictions. Furthermore, we propose a residual orthogonalization to satisfy these assumptions with a coordinating regularization term. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using both simulation and large language model experiments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["confidence interval", "neural network", "conformal prediction", "latent variable"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e1f8cb86cb1d0029a7f42d4e8ebd1d87efab33b2.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4dad9f37ee41ae53ddaf4ae199d0d395a38b3e67.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Latent Conformal Prediction (LCP), a way to get coverage-valid prediction intervals for unobserved latent variables.

To make this proxy identify the correct residual law, the authors posit mild assumptions on prediction residuals and propose residual orthogonalization.

Since $\\hat{f}(X_i)$ is also independent copies (on the probability space over x and y given the calibration set), it seems that the coverage still holds here? \n\nThe authors try to solve this problem via the residual orthogonalization; however, it seems that this introduces another additional dependency on the trained parameter theta and the calibration fold.

The authors mentioned the importance of obtaining correct latent variables in a system. However, it is not clear how a predictive interval of latent variables can help in decision-making.

I would request the authors to clarify this.  \n3. It is not clear how the authors identify $\\tilde{U}$ for $\\tilde{f}$ by $\\hat{V}/2$. The authors should provide some intuitive proof sketch in the main paper.  \n4. No baselines. The paper does not compare the proposed approach with existing conformal prediction or uncertainty quantification methods. \n5. What’s the application of this approach? The authors should provide concrete examples or scenarios where constructing prediction intervals for latent variables is beneficial.   \n\n### Minor:\n1. The discussion in the remark from lines 303 to 313 should be discussed more intuitively. The main point is slight obscure. It is also not clear how  characteristic function not having a compact support affects  estimating the distribution of $\\tilde{U}$.  I would request the authors to make this clear.\n2. If with Corollary 1, the authors do not need the Fourier transform to calculate the distribution of the conformity score. Then, what is the utility of the remark at line 303 discussing the Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform?  \n3. The authors should provide more discussion on the LLM experiments. \n4.

For calculating the MSE, how do the authors know the ground-truth latent variables in the LLM experiments?"}, "questions": {"value": "Here are my questions.\n\n### Questions:\n1. We have access to the outcomes $Y$ in our dataset. However, the latent variables should depend on the models we are training. How can that be model-agnostic? For example, the authors mentioned preference learning with the Bradley–Terry model. Since the reward depends on the model, the predictive interval will not be model-agnostic, right? I would request the authors to explain this.  \n2. What did the authors mean by saying, “Instead of the logit of the probability of $Y = 1$, the problem is not normalized because there is one-dimensional freedom for translations of the reward $r(W, Y)$”?  \n3. Why does Assumption 1 generally not hold?  \n4. “We could expect the symmetric fluctuation of the predictions with respect to the random perturbation of the observation in the training set.” How do the authors randomly perturb the observations?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "eYrAQfu1zW", "forum": "3FdIUbIjXb", "replyto": "3FdIUbIjXb", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24190/Reviewer_eqzF"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24190/Reviewer_eqzF"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24190/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762290333767, "cdate": 1762290333767, "tmdate": 1762942981578, "mdate": 1762942981578, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
