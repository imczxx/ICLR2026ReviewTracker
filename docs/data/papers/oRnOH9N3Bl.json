What drives this stability in the generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability concentration in the model’s output distribution. To quantify this concentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF)--a token-invariant measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude (e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies. We show that aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g., DeepSeek-distilled models) exhibit even lower BF and reduced variance across samples, as CoT extends reasoning into later, more deterministic positions, leading to more stable outputs. We hypothesize that alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model’s behavior, but instead steers it toward specific stylistic tokens (e.g., ``Sure'') that unlock low-entropy trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by nudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful diagnostic for understanding and controlling output behavior in LLMs - clarifying why alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how base models can be steered toward or away from diversity.", "tldr": "\"LLM probability concentration\" unifies disparate alignment phenomena by showing that alignment works not by changing a model fundamentally, but by steering it down latent low-entropy paths.", "keywords": ["Alignment Tuning", "LLM", "Probability Concentration", "Chain-of-Thoughts"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/730770d6d70dcb00bc0ca7c96f40d4ed1c84a308.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/bd354a3c4f383a6dd96e8a7936abf604d00d49f6.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work explores the behavior of LLMs during generation, focusing on the contrast between base models and aligned models that have undergone post-training.

In a few places I felt there is a bit of conflation between hypotheses/conjecture and things that are actually demonstrated empirically in the experiments. Specifically: \n- In Table 2, the results show that the aligned models have lower standard deviation in task accuracy. This result does not in itself \"confirm that BF is a reliable predictor of sampling consistency\" (l. 377). What we see is a very anecdotal pattern of correlation between BF and accuracy STD, we do not know that this pattern is reliable and consistent (especially given the very small absolute differences in BF), and we certainly don't know that there is a causal connection between these factors (as opposed to, say, a general connection between higher task performance and lower STD). \n- In Fig. 5, we see the effect of the resampling intervention. This is interesting in itself, but again I don't see how it can be used to directly infer that the BF metric \"reflects a deeper commitment to specific generative paths\", just because BF and the output token index are correlated. \n- In §7 and also in the intro and abstract there is talk about the effect of stylistic tokens, but I did not see that this is demonstrated anywhere in the paper.\n2. The main focus of the paper is on the BF metric, and in their motivation the authors state that \"token-level metrics such as entropy or log-likelihood… offer only a narrow lens on model behavior: they capture local properties but miss the global structure of the output space… this motivates our proposal of the BF\". As the BF is a major contribution I would have expected the paper to demonstrate this statement in some way - directly comparing how the conclusions on model behavior they draw from BF in this work differ (if at all) from the conclusions reached in prior works that supposedly focused on more \"local\" properties. Moreover, in practice the calculation is very similar to mean token entropy and it wasn't entirely clear to me that BF really measures something different.\n3. I found some later parts of the paper harder to follow and less self-contained - I was missing a more technical description of how exactly the resampling in §6 was performed, and I felt the concept of \"nudging\" (§7) and the motivation behind it was not sufficiently clear from the text.\n4. It is worth mentioning that the conclusions in §3 have largely been shown by prior work, most explicitly in Shi et al. 2024 \"A Thorough Examination of Decoding Methods in the Era of LLMs\" (https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.489/)."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The BF is grounded in information theory—defined as the exponentiated entropy rate over continuations—and connected to a balanced-tree abstraction of the effective output space, which makes the idea intuitive and comparable across settings. The authors also provide two practical estimators: a token-entropy aggregation for short outputs and an AEP-based estimator for long outputs that leverages length-averaged NLL, with empirical plots showing NLL closely tracks entropy and stabilizes with length. This framework unlocks several cohesive empirical findings: BF typically shrinks as generation proceeds; aligned models sit near BF≈1.2 (roughly an order of magnitude lower than base models), helping explain reduced decoding sensitivity; and a Pareto-style analysis highlights alignment as the dominant driver relative to model size, generation, and prompt complexity. Beyond diagnostics, the work ties BF to behavior: majority-vote variance drops with lower BF, resampling late in a sequence degrades performance more than early resampling, and CoT’s longer chains naturally push inference into low-BF regions that stabilize answers.

The AEP-based estimator inherits conditions (e.g., long sequences, autoregressive generation, finite precision) and approximations; while these are argued to be mild and empirically supported, deviations (short outputs, atypical decoding, domain shift) could bias BF estimates, and Monte Carlo underestimation issues remain salient for short generations. Causal attributions around alignment are suggestive rather than surgical: alignment dominates in the Pareto analysis, but the study does not disentangle which alignment stage (SFT vs. reward modeling vs. RL) drives BF reductions; the authors themselves flag this and hypothesize RL as the main culprit, leaving an important gap for checkpoint-level ablations. Some demonstrations (e.g., nudging with a different “instruct” model for prefixes) risk confounds from model mixing; similarly, results are concentrated on specific open-weight families and tasks, so generalization to other architectures, languages, and safety/creative settings deserves replication. Finally, while BF is positioned as deeper than sample-level diversity, its practical relationship to user-perceived variety is complex and sometimes uncorrelated with Distinct-N; practitioners may still need guidance on how BF should inform decoding or training interventions without sacrificing quality.

Maybe the paper is claiming insight into analysing entropy (albeit exponentiated), or maybe it's claiming something else around the AEP result. Analysing entropy estimates does not come across as too surprising. On the other hand, the AEP result comes from prior work. So I am not too sure how to position this paper.

It, however, never defines exactly what it means by “high probability”. In section 4.1, the paper then re-defines $\\mathcal{T}$ as the perplexity: $\\exp\\Big( H(p(Y\\_{\\geq t} \\mid \\mathbf{x} \\circ \\mathbf{y}\\_{< t})) \\Big)$, as this is the effective number of equally probable outcomes with the same total uncertainty.
