Despite these advances, they overlook the potential of directly constraining the initial representations of the input data, which can intuitively alleviate the distribution shift issue and stabilize training. In this paper, we introduce the Tanh function into the initial layer to fulfill such a constraint. We theoretically unpack the convergence property of the temporal difference learning with the Tanh function under linear function approximation. Motivated by theoretical insights, we present our Constrained Initial Representations framework, tagged CIR, which is made up of three components: (i) the Tanh activation along with normalization methods to stabilize representations; (ii) the skip connection module to provide a linear pathway from the shallow layer to the deep layer; (iii) the convex Q-learning that allows a more flexible value estimate and mitigates potential conservatism. Empirical results show that CIR exhibits strong performance on numerous continuous control tasks, even being competitive or surpassing existing strong baseline methods.", "tldr": "A simple yet effective algorithm that achieves strong performance by constraining the initial representations", "keywords": ["constrained initial representation", "temporal difference learning", "reinforcement learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e32f6c399375fb19dd5e94da4b6c51d41219044c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ef20406cf322bbbe02f9a3390ea0854169d75275.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces new training scheme called Constrained Initial Representations (CIR) whose goal is to stabilise the TD-learning and reduce distributional shift of off-policy training. They achieve it with the help of Tanh activation function introduced in the early layers of the Q-network, which, as they justify theoretically, allows us to upper bound the variance of the semi-gradient of the TD-loss. In addition to that, they introduce two other modifications to previous works: U-net type of architecture after initial layers with Tanh, and convex-Q learning, which is presented as an alternative to clipped double Q loss. The paper presents a vast set of ablation studies for each of the algorithmic choices and demonstrates an improvement over baselines on HumanoidBench, while on DMC tasks it shows a small degradation.\n\nWhile CIR indeed improves on some difficult benchmarks over baselines, not all comparisons are conclusive and in particular the choice of Tanh over LayerNorm and the need of the U-net like architecture (see Weaknesses).

To confirm the algorithmic design choices, the authors perform massive ablation studies, that confirm the necessity of regularisation layer at the beginning of the neural network and the advantage of convex Q-learning over clipped double Q-learning. The ablated parameters, while show inferior performance for some tasks with respect to baselines, manage to improve over baselines on many hard tasks."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "As mentioned before, while CIR achieves a clear improvement on HumanoidBench tasks, in general it is less good than baselines on DMC tasks as shown in Figure 4.\n\nThe most of theoretical results are not that original considering that there are prior works that investigate the stability of TD-learning with normalisation layers. Compare to https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04811 (a missing literature), where they did a more nuanced analysis of TD-stabilty, where they have decoupled the instability coming from off-policy learning and non-linear function approximation, and they showed that the usage of layer norm can help to upper bound both terms and eventually ensure the TD-stability. Considering that layer norm is also widely present in the CIR architecture, the natural question is whether addition of Tanh is really crucial for stability or it mostly further complements the layer-norm regularization. Moreover, looking at Figure 5 (right), we can see that replacing Tanh activation with Layer Norm doesn’t make a significant difference (means are quite close to each other, and confidence intervals overlap almost entirely).\n\nMoreover, the usage of U-net architecture was not properly ablated. In particular, it is not clear if by taking Bro architecture but with Tanh for the first layer activation function and convex Q-learning we can achieve similar results on HumanoidBench. The authors motivate the usage of U-net, because of its capability to perform \"multi-scale feature extraction\", at the same time you do not perform downsampling and upsampling, which I believe contradicts the aforementioned motivation. Have you tried a U-net variant with actual downsampling and upsampling?\n\nFinally, I am not fully convinced by a current proof of convex-Q learning convergence. The proof is only shown for one $Q^A$ function by considering that the action in the target value is $a^* = \\arg \\max Q^A_t(s,a)$, which indeed allows to obtain that $\\mathbb{E}[F_t^Q | P_t] \\leq \\gamma \\|\\Delta_t\\|$ for $F_t^Q$ defined with $Q^A$, however this argument will not work if $F_t^Q$ is redefined with $Q_t^B$.

The tanh change does not seem to be the one with the highest performance impact, yet it is the only one theoretically justified. In addition, the comparison against Simba and BRO has limited merit given the framing of the paper: if the tanh is the important contribution, it would make much more sense to evaluate the Simba and BRO architectures with and without the tanh function.\n\nThere is a growing trend to simply propose new architectures in the literature (the aforementioned papers being prime examples) but I think there is limited value in comparing bags of design decisions against one another instead of making controlled and carefully ablated additions to existing architectures.

This is not clearly communicated in the text either.\n    * The choice of tanh activations rather than any other function seems arbitrary and not well motivated. The properties that the tanh function brings are satisfied by simpler functions as well. Tanh seems to be a non-linear way to regularize but as I will outline the evidence for the need of this is not sufficiently strong.\n\n**Clarity**\n* The experimental results are presented in plots that are a bit difficult to read. For example, I don’t see any shaded regions in Figure 4. If the standard errors are small, I think the paper would benefit from simply removing the weak baselines since they don’t tell us much about the performance of the presented algorithm.\n* I think the number of seeds should be reported in the main text, not the Appendix.\n* I find the term scaling confusing in section 6.3. There is a difference between making a network large enough so it can sufficiently represent the required function and vastly overparameterizing it. When other domains talk about scaling, they refer to moving from millions of parameters to billions. That is clearly not the case here.\n\n**Related Work**\n* There are a few minor nitpicks that I have with the treatment of related work\n    * The paper repeatedly states that using larger networks is a challenge and cites Bjorck et al. [1], and then states that the first paper to attempt and resolve this is Nauman et al. [2]. This is a misrepresentation as Bjorck et al is quite literally about resolving this issue.\n\n**Novelty**  \n* In general, I think the novelty of the approach is limited as the effects of various components that are being applied have already been studied extensively. These are continually referred to as novel components but they already exist in the literature.\n    * The effects of layer normalization are well studied [2, 3, 8]\n    * So are the effects of RMSnorms and related ones as presented in section 5.1[4, 5, 6]. \n    * Specifically [5, 8] study normalization as a way to mitigate the divergence effects from high dimensional spaces. It might make sense to include them and to distinguish the suggested normalization approach if possible.\n    * Skip connections have previously been introduced as well. [2]\n    * Convex combinations of Q-values have also been studied before [7]. \n* Other parts of the module that are being proposed are often already considered in various implementations and I would not claim they are novel. While there is value in analyzing tricks that people have coded into their implementations, yet such analysis should be extensive. That is not the case for section 5.3 for instance.\n\nThis would be fine if the performance gains were very large but as I will outline later I have my doubts about the effectiveness of this rather complex approach.\n\n**Theoretical Results**\n* The theoretical analysis is not done on top of the early layers of some complex functions but instead on the output of the feature encoder in which the function is linear. In deep RL, that would correspond to the second to last layers not the initial one. This is disconnect from what the paper attempts to show.\n* Various of the theoretical results have strong assumptions.\n    * These assumptions may allow for much more general statements than the ones made in the manuscript. For example, with the assumption on the weights in Theorem 4.2, any transformation that does not change the direction of the basis functions would suffice.\n    * They also make some of the results very weak. The proof of Theorem 4.2 seems to rely on c being very small such that the weights are close to 0. Thus, the whole matrix over which we take the tanh is 0. That seems not very useful in practice. It is also not clear to me why this would be true at any point during the fitting of our Q-function.\n* The assumptions make the theoretical results quite weak. For example, in Theorem 4.2 even if I initialize my weights with an identity matrix, and $W \\phi$ is a selection of uncorrelated vectors, a single gradient step might correlate them.\n* In section 4, when talking about Theorem 4.4 and Theorem 4.5, the relation to the true Q-function is unclear. The text states that it is unclear whether the TD update converges to a global minimum. It is not clear to me which global minimum is being talked about as it is not defined in the text. The goal should be to learn an optimal Q-function. It is unclear to me that Theorem 4.4 would approximate that. There is a difference between a globally optimal solution to the equation of interest and the global minimizer in Theorem 4.5. The regularization induces convexity which allows us to minimize the proposed objective. I don’t see how there is a guarantee that that minimizer approaches the minimizer that we are looking for, namely the one of the optimal Q-function. As an example, one can always set lambda to be very large, the given objective is convex and thus, one can find a global minimum. That minimum however might be all weights equal 0 which is clearly not always close to the true Q-function weights. I only skimmed the proof but the “global minimum” that the proof seems to use is the one of the regularized objective which is not sufficient unless we make more assumptions.\n\n**Method design**\n* Several key components seem rather arbitrary or incorrectly motivated. Some of the statements made to motivate these components are likely incorrect or not well enough explained and supported with evidence.\n    * L 221: “latter layers can be naturally regularized” if the initial representations are constrained, since the magnitude of the input representations are controlled” - The magnitude of the input being constrained does not affect later layers. In general, observational inputs are limited by physical constraints in many of the suggested benchmarks, yet we see the need for regularization.\n    * L 223: “it may be challenging for the gradient to backpropagate and the gradient may vanish before the initial layers can be well-updated” - the paper argues that one benefit of the approach is to limit gradient variance but then does not seem to use that fact.\n    * L243: “based on Theorem 4.5, additional regularization terms are needed to acquire global convergence. Since regularizing the parameters is inherently equivalent to regularizing the representations, we further regularize representations for better stability by involving layer normalization, which is proven effective in prior works” - Layer normalization does not create a convex minimizer and it is unclear why it would be a substitute for L2 regularization. These two have inherently different effects.\n    * L307: “meanwhile, constraining initial representations with Tanh can be conservative since it constrains the initial representations” - It is unclear to me why this would lead to pessimism on the predictions since the initial representations are followed by a rather complex function object. Limiting the observation space does not induce pessimism.\n\n**Experimental Design and Analyses**\n* It is unclear to me why we wouldn’t compare against other methods that use normalization on ODRL. These are the approaches that are most similar. \n\n**Empirical Claims and Evidence**\n* The paper makes various claims about experiments that are not sufficiently supported.\n    * The paper claims that the introduced module provides higher sample efficiency than other methods (L 085), however no experiment for this is presented.\n    * The paper claims that performance on DMC easy exceeds all other baselines but it seems that results are within variance of BRO fast and TD-MPC2. \n    * In section 6.3 the paper argues that SimBa underperforms CIR. However, 4/6 results are within variance. I think it would be better practice to highlight statistically significant differences rather than bolding the mean.\n* A large chunk of the paper argues the need for a tanh activation however, simply using LayerNorm as suggested by other works seems to be just as effective. Thus, it is not clear how the effects of tanh and the experiments don’t make this clear.\n* Similarly, the skip connections don’t seem to bring any benefits in the ablation so it is not clear why they were included. It seems they might just increase the complexity of the method. If we removed both the skip connections and the Tanh, they method more or less reduces to existing layer norm approaches [2]\n* Overall, the experimental results seem comparable to previous approaches which is likely because the method looks somewhat similar to what prior work does.\n\n[1] Towards Deeper Deep Reinforcement Learning.

It's unclear how much this extension adds compared to using the mean. Also, in the appendix, I noticed that a different convex interpolation factor is needed for DMC vs. HumanoidBench, which suggests the method is not robust to different environments. \n\n- UNet-style skip connections are used. The benefits of this method seem to be limited judging by the ablation done in Fig.5 (right).
