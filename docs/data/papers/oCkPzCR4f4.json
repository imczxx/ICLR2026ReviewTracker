Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 1,947 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the strongest models struggle to generalize across levels and chart types, highlighting the significant challenges posed by Chart2Code.

Our Work Is Fully Original and Independent**\n\nWe would like to **seriously and clearly clarify** that our submission, including the motivation, core idea, benchmark task design, figure/table creation, experimental designs, and analysis **does not contain any plagiarism of ChartMimic**. Our team takes full responsibility for the originality and integrity of the work.\n\nAnyone who has read both ChartMimic and our benchmark Chart2Code, can clearly see that the two works are **substantively different**.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Topic-Level Similarities Are Expected in the Same Research Area**\n\nBoth works study the chart-to-code problem. Benchmarks addressing the same research question inevitably share **high-level conceptual similarities**, which is normal. **Reviewer ZM9h** noticing overlap at this level is understandable, but this **does not** imply rewriting or duplication.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Comparison of Motivation and Core Idea**\n\n**Motivation 1: Chart2Code (ours) expands the task space beyond ChartMimic.** (See Lines 039–042 and Table 1 for reference.)\n\nChartMimic focuses only on:\n\n - direct chart reproduction,\n - a variant with text-style customized data.\n\nChart2Code classifies this as only **Level-1 difficulty**. In real agent workflows, customized data often also comes as **figure screenshots**, not structured tables. Thus, we introduce a new setting where screenshots serve as customized data, better reflecting actual usage.\n\nBeyond this, Chart2Code additionally proposes two tasks that ChartMimic does not cover:\n\n - Chart Editing: modifying a chart with text instructions. It is common for users without coding skills.\n\n - Long-Table to Chart: creating a chart from long, raw, unprocessed tables. (This task is mostly close to the code-free scenario)\n\nThese tasks address chart-to-code capabilities that ChartMimic does not consider, making our benchmark more comprehensive.\n\n**Motivation 2: ChartMimic is no longer sufficiently challenging for modern models.** (See Lines 043–049)\n\nPrevious SoTA model GPT-4o already reached 82.2% scores in ChartMimic’s direct reproduction task. (See its Table 3) With the rapid advancement of frontier models, **ChartMimic can no longer serve as a sufficiently challenging or discriminative benchmark for evaluating current or future models.**\n\nTherefore, there is a strong need to introduce a more **challenging, and more comprehensive** benchmark.\nThis motivates our introduction of **Chart2Code**.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Claims of \"Rewriting\" or \"Identical Figures/Phrasing\" Are Factually Incorrect**\n\nThe claims of \"rewriting\", \"identical phrasing\", or \"identical figures\" are **not supported by evidence and are incorrect**.\n\nOur submission is a **benchmark paper**, and benchmark papers must include necessary decriptions such as:\n\n - task definition\n\n - data curation\n\n - data filtering\n\n - data annotation\n\n - dataset statistics and analysis\n\n - evaluation metrics\n\nThese are **expected structural elements**, not overlap.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Experimental Designs Follow Standard Benchmark Practice**\n\nThe comment regarding \"identical experimental designs\" reflects a misunderstanding of benchmark methodology.\n\nAny benchmark paper necessarily includes:\n\n - the evaluated models\n\n - implementation details\n\n - main results\n\n - analysis and discussion\n\nThese are **basic requirements** and our implementation follows widely accepted high-quality benchmarks, consistent with the standards of a top-tier venue like ICLR.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Extensive Supplementary Materials Demonstrate Rigor and Transparency**\n\nWe provide a **53-page supplementary appendix (pages 14–66)** documenting every detail of the benchmark construction process.\n\nThis extensive supplementary material shows rigor, transparency, reproducibility, and demonstrates that the benchmark was developed independently.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Request for Fair and Evidence-Based Judgment**\n\nA plagiarism allegation is a **extremely serious**. We respectfully **request an objective, evidence-based assessment**.\n\nWe hope **reviewer ZM9h** can re-evaluate our submission after carefully and thoroughly reading both ChartMimic and our paper. If plagiarism is alleged, we request **explicit evidence** demonstrating the overlap. \n\nFinally, we would like to raise one important question. We noticed that **Reviewer ZM9h** included **ChatGPT-generated logs directly within the review** (We have reserved this as the evidence).  This raises a serious concern: \n\n**If reviewer relies solely on ChatGPT’s review without independent verification, what happens when the LLM makes a mistake?**\n\nAccording to the review policy (https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2026/ReviewerGuide), a failure to disclose LLM usage may put a reviewer’s own submissions at risk of desk rejection.\n\nWe trust that the AC and other reviewers will recognize that the plagiarism concerns are **unfounded**, and we sincerely hope for a **fair and accurate evaluation** of our work."}}, "id": "rU980pynPT", "forum": "oCkPzCR4f4", "replyto": "oCkPzCR4f4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7426/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7426/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7426/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763025908271, "cdate": 1763025908271, "tmdate": 1763030052324, "mdate": 1763030052324, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating LMMs on \"chart-to-code\" tasks.

Through comprehensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LMMs, the paper demonstrates that even the strongest proprietary models struggle significantly with visual fidelity, particularly on editing tasks and long-context table-to-chart generation, revealing substantial gaps between code-level correctness and pixel-level accuracy in automated chart generation."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "- Well-motivated hierarchical design: The three-level structure effectively captures realistic usage patterns, from simple reproduction to complex editing and long-context processing;\n- Comprehensive evaluation methodology: The paper proposes a thoughtful multi-dimensional evaluation approach combining execution rate, code-level metrics , and chart-level visual fidelity scores;"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Insufficient novelty over ChartMimic: While the paper positions itself as advancing beyond ChartMimic, the core contribution appears incremental.

The two works belong to the *same research direction* (chart-to-code evaluation for multimodal models), which naturally leads to **high-level thematic similarity**, but they differ substantially in motivation, task design, dataset construction, evaluation protocols, and textual content.\nBelow is a concise summary of the findings:\n\n---\n\n## **1. No textual or structural plagiarism**\n\nI found **no copied paragraphs, no rewritten sentences, and no replicated technical descriptions** between the two papers.\nThe writing style, problem framing, and section organization in Chart2Code are distinct and not derived from ChartMimic.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Methodological similarity is expected, not plagiarism**\n\nBoth papers target “chart-to-code” evaluation and both use:\n\n* a chart image\n* a textual instruction\n* code generation as the output\n* execution-based and LLM-based evaluation\n\nThese similarities **reflect a shared research problem**, not copying. Such overlaps are *normal* for benchmarks in the same subfield.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Chart2Code introduces substantial new content**\n\nChart2Code expands beyond ChartMimic’s direct chart mimicry by adding:\n\n* **Level 2: Chart Editing**\n* **Level 3: Long-table to chart generation**\n* **Multiple data modalities** (text, figure, Excel tables)\n* **New structured evaluation metrics**\n* **A different data collection pipeline**\n\nThese components are **not present** in ChartMimic and clearly represent independent intellectual contributions.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Data reuse is clearly disclosed and properly cited**\n\nChart2Code **explicitly states** that only a small subset of “difficult charts” (300 figures) were filtered from ChartMimic, and cites the paper accordingly.\nThis is **standard, acceptable academic practice** as long as citation and attribution are provided—which Chart2Code does.\n\n---\n\n## **5. No evidence of improper copying**\n\nI found:\n\n* no duplicated figures\n* no reused tables\n* no reuse of ChartMimic-specific phrasing\n* no evidence of code or evaluation pipeline copying\n\nEverything resembling ChartMimic is **either normal for the domain or explicitly cited**.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Judgment**\n\n**Based on all available evidence, Chart2Code does *not* plagiarize ChartMimic.**\nIt should instead be viewed as a **legitimate extension** of existing chart-to-code benchmarks that builds on prior work while introducing new tasks, new data sources, and new evaluation methods.\n\nIf a reviewer worries about overlap, the issue is most likely **conceptual similarity due to shared research focus**, not plagiarism in content, writing, or data."}}, "id": "fTlMY5CWMd", "forum": "oCkPzCR4f4", "replyto": "oCkPzCR4f4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7426/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7426/Authors"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7426/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763026794024, "cdate": 1763026794024, "tmdate": 1763026794024, "mdate": 1763026794024, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Chart2Code, a benchmark for evaluating LMMs in chart understanding and code generation.

The paper introduces a well-structured hierarchical benchmark that decomposes chart-to-code reasoning into three progressive levels. The proposed benchmark is challenging, and the statistical details are sufficient.\n2. The paper proposes a set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, and the proposed base evaluation method appears thorough and reliable.\n3. The analysis and experiments are extensive."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The evaluation relies on GPT-5-mini, which may introduce circular reasoning, bias, or limitations in visual fidelity due to limited human validation.\n2. Metric Reliability and Anomalies: The paper's results reveal unexpected patterns that may affect confidence in the LMM-Score. For example, in Table 3, Seed-1.6-VL (0.812) is reported to outperform GPT-5 (0.633) on L1 visual fidelity. In Table 4, the 7B MiMo-VL-RL model (0.471) scores more than twice as high as GPT-5 (0.220) on L2 fidelity. These surprising results are not fully examined. They suggest that the LMM score may not always correspond to correctness and could favor outputs that are visually appealing to the judge-LMM, even if they differ factually or stylistically.\n3. Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart) is described as the paper's most novel and important contribution, as it addresses the critical bottleneck of long-context reasoning. Nonetheless, this level currently has only 150 tasks from 39 files, which limits the ability to draw firm conclusions about model performance on this complex, open-ended task.\n4. Shallow \"Long-Table\" Reasoning: Level 3 seems to test primarily \"long-context retrieval\" (locating the right data in a long file) rather than \"complex data reasoning.\" Real-world tasks often require several steps of data wrangling, such as filtering, merging tables or sheets, pivoting, and handling missing values before visualization. The benchmark may not fully reflect this important layer of pre-visualization reasoning.\n5. Limited Scope of Chart Libraries: The evaluation focuses exclusively on Matplotlib-based libraries and does not address interactive libraries such as Plotly or declarative options like Altair. A benchmark aiming for real-world relevance might benefit from acknowledging this limitation in scope.\n6. Some unexpected results are observed. For example, Seed-1.6-VL attains a high LMM score of 0.81 (L279), while MiMo-VL-7B-RL generates relatively few successful codes yet still achieves high LLM and LMM scores (L339). This may indicate that the metrics are somewhat sensitive.\n7. A unified or weighted composite metric might provide additional insights. Although there are many evaluation metrics, the absence of a unified composite score could make direct model comparisons less intuitive. For example, while it is observable that Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-Sonnet-4 perform relatively well, it remains somewhat challenging to determine the ranking of other models at a glance."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could you please provide a more detailed explanation regarding the metric anomalies, specifically the unexpectedly high LMM scores for Seed-1.6-VL and MiMo-VL-7B-RL? Are these results indicative of a sensitivity in the LMM-Score (as judged by GPT-5-mini) to particular model output styles or artifacts that may not align with human-perceived correctness?\n2. Have you conducted a human evaluation on a subset of the benchmark to calibrate the LMM-Score? Have you also assessed the correlation between LMM and expert scores? Linking these would strengthen the paper's claims about visual fidelity.\n3. Why were the \"base evaluation\" (8-dimensional) scores not reported for Level 1 tasks? I think it would be interesting to see this objective breakdown for the \"simpler\" reproduction tasks as well, if available.\n4. Would it be possible to add a comparison between MoE and dense models to help analyze the architectural effect?\n5. Would you consider including results for Qwen3-VL to further complete and update the benchmark coverage?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5RRZJCNLeS", "forum": "oCkPzCR4f4", "replyto": "oCkPzCR4f4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7426/Reviewer_pKmQ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7426/Reviewer_pKmQ"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7426/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761911167064, "cdate": 1761911167064, "tmdate": 1762919545872, "mdate": 1762919545872, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
