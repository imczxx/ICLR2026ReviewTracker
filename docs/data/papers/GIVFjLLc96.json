Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the input–representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are complementary to parameter-centric model merging.

If gradients are computed for the full network, the computational cost would become prohibitively large, especially for deep models. The authors should clarify this trade-off and the precise optimization scope.\n\nThe convergence of FDA optimization is not well analyzed.\nSince the gradient descent outcome depends heavily on random initialization, the authors should provide:\nResults over multiple random seeds,\nMean and standard deviation of performance,\nA short convergence analysis to justify robustness.\nWithout this, the reproducibility and reliability of FDA are questionable.\n\nIt is unclear whether the same optimization setup (learning rate, steps, loss weights) is applied uniformly across layers. Given that shallow and deep layers encode very different semantic information, a uniform optimization configuration may be inappropriate. The paper should discuss whether the FDA optimization strategy varies by layer or is shared globally, and why.\n\nThe FDA process requires layer-wise gradient-based optimization, which could be expensive for deep models such as Qwen3 or other large-scale transformers.\nThe paper should report or estimate.
