In parallel, spectral methods provide an efficient basis for global dynamics.

This physics-aligned design yields compact, robust frequency-domain representations. On standard reanalysis benchmarks, ClimateLLM matches or exceeds state-of-the-art accuracy across short- and medium-range horizons while training on a single GPU within hours. Moreover, the model supports *cross-variable transference*: networks trained on data-rich variables produce robust zero-shot forecasts for data-scarce variables.
