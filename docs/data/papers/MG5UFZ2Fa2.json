By identifying every intervened variable, existing RCA methods have achieved remarkable progress in localizing and fixing anomalies. However, people may be more interested and focused on those intervened variables that produced effects on a specific outcome, rather than the intervened variables that do not necessarily affect that outcome. This raises concerns on redundant localizing and extra efforts in fixing the anomalies. To fill this gap, we study a novel and challenging problem, termed as Outcome-Oriented Root-Cause Analysis (OORCA), aiming to identify all intervened ancestor variables of the outcome variable. To handle the proposed OORCA problem, we then propose the Cross-Regressing-based Root Cause (CRRC) framework by cross-regressing observational (normal) and interventional (abnormal) data on the outcome variable. Theoretically, our identifiability analysis prove that the proposed CRRC can capture all outcome-oriented root-causes, and our asymptotic analysis offers tractable and informative criteria in the finite-sample regime. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with 13 competitive baselines highlight the superiority of CRRC in both accuracy and running efficiency.", "tldr": "This paper presents a regression-based approach for identifying all outcome-oriented,necessary root-causes.", "keywords": ["Root Causes", "Regression Theory"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/51fc990fa9785eea6da2a97dffb37a265dc5b4eb.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a root cause analysis algorithm that identifies all ancestral nodes of an outcome variable.

The paper claims that existing RCA methods aim to identify the set of all intervened nodes instead of only the intervened nodes that affect a particular outcome. Besides Budhathoki et al., 2022; Okati et al., 2024; anonymous, 2025, some methods that do not assume a causal DAG up front, but learning a causal graph as a part of the RCA method via causal discovery. One example is CIRCA by Li at al. 2022, as cited by the paper. One can then check whether the intervened nodes are ancestors of the desired outcome variable. \n- There are some very glaring grammatical issues presented in the paper. For example, line 51, which says ‘which models the happens of anomaly as interventions…’.\n- The index notation used for representing random variables are confusing in section 2.\n- The proposed model assumes the data generative mechanism to be a linear SCM, which allows the paper to use the result from the paper about ancestor regression in the linear SEM for discovering the ancestral relations.\n- The paper does not provide code for the experiment. It becomes impossible to validate the experimental results. \n- The theorem numbers in the appendix do not match the main paper. For example, Theorem 2 in the main paper is actually Theorem 3 in the appendix. Proposition 1 in the main paper is actually Theorem 1 in the appendix. Theorem 1 in the main paper is Theorem 2 in the appendix. Also, line 782 says to ‘prove a simplified version of Theorem 1 as below.’ But the theorem below is called Theorem 2 (Simplified).\n-\tThe proofs for Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 in this paper are very similar to those of Theorem 2 in the paper by Schultheiss et al. 2023, limiting the original contributions of the paper. The difference is that Schultheiss et al. 2023 focus on testing whether $\\beta$ is zero, but this paper focuses on testing the difference between two beta terms. One can also see that Proposition 1 (Theorem 1 in the appendix) presented in this paper is similar to Theorem 1 in the paper by Schultheiss et al. 2023. It’s just that this paper now has an additional beta term coming from the interventional data. \n-\tLine 1491: the Table reference number is missing.\n-\tLine 466: double quotation marks.\n\nReference :\n\n-\tIkram, Azam, et al. \"Root Cause Analysis of Failures from Partial Causal Structures.\" The 41st Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence.\n\n-\tSchultheiss, Christoph, and Peter Bühlmann. \"Ancestor regression in linear structural equation models.\" Biometrika 110.4 (2023): 1117-1124."}, "questions": {"value": "- Why is it fair to compare precision with recall in the experiment?\n- Why are some of the baselines, such as RCD, iSCAN, and IDI, not compared in Figure 4?\n- Why does Figure 5 (right) not include the baseline of CRRC without the discovery method?

It seems to be that this ignores induces dependencies between  Xk and X-k under intervention.

Although the lemma was established in prior work, providing some intuition for readers would be very helpful. In particular, could the authors explain why this regression identifies ancestors specifically, rather than the Markov boundary of Y?\n\n* If multiple ancestors are intervened simultaneously, can coefficient cancellations occur (masking detection)? Any diagnostic for such cases?\n\n* Is it possible to explain why hybrid data preserves the coefficient relation? Would a two-sample regression or causal score test avoid hybridization yet support similar guarantees?\n\n* In what common intervention scenarios does Assumption 1 hold? Is it possible to provide counterexamples where it fails?\n\n* Traditionally, root-cause analysis seeks to identify all causes of anomalies in a system. Could the authors give a concrete real-world example where it is meaningful to focus on anomalies affecting only a specific target variable, rather than all anomalies in the system? In words, can the authors think of an application where only the restoration of a single outcome is of practical interest, and other anomalies are acceptable as they are and do not need to be eliminated.\n\n * Can the authors explain why their methods perform well in situations violating causal insufficiency. Is that that a weaker version of  causal sufficiency is sufficient for the algorithm. Or is it that the experimental design focused on situations where violating causal sufficiency is not a real issue? \n\n\n* If I understood correctly, i-SCAN [2] was not introduced for root cause analysis. Can the authors explain how they adapted it for RCA?\n\n* As far as understood, CIRCA needs a graph to be specified. If that is the case, this should be clarified and I think the auhtos should explain how they specified the graph? Other methods that do not require a graph should be included. Like for example the method proposed by [3].\n\n* As far as I know, the dataset provided by [4] is not a dataset containing anomalies and root causes. Even after looking at the appendix I do not understand how anomalies are detected or even if there are anomalies. I recommend using datasets introduced for anomalies and root cause analysis. Like for example the one introduced in [5].\n\n* Several of the methods that authors compared to, are not suited for the experimental design. For example, RCD, as far as I understood, does not assume a change in the causal coefficient in the SCM, instead it assumes a change in the noise. I wonder how good will their method perform against closer methods that also compare different in coefficients in normal regime and in the anomalous regime? For example, as it as done in [5]?\n\n\n\nMinor:\n\n* Maybe I'm missing something, but isn't ANS(Y) = An(Y)?\n\n* Provide a small worked example showing the coefficient-comparison logic step-by-step.\n\n* The statement \"We allow for X in Pa(X) and X in An(X)\" might confuse some readers, as it could be interpreted as allowing cycles in the graph. I would suggest rephrasing this to make it explicit that the authors are simply following the convention that a variable is considered a parent and ancestor of itself. In the current formulation, it appears that a vertex can be its own parent in some cases but not necessarily always, which may lead readers to think that this property depends on the specific graph rather than being a fixed definitional convention.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Schulthesiss and Buhlmann.

Several causal RCA approaches including TOCA, CF-Attn, and IDI have already emphasized that the root cause should be nodes that are not only intervened but also cause the anomaly at \\( Y \\) as a consequence of the intervention. The narrative should be corrected accordingly.  \n2. Figure 1(c) needs revision in light of comment (1).  \n3. At line 105 and throughout the paper, please use bold-faced capital \\( \\mathbf{X} \\) for matrix notation.  \n4. A major weakness is the assumption of a linear DGP (lines 111–114). Having this restriction at the problem formulation stage seems overly limiting.  \n5. The authors should justify their choice of using soft interventions beyond citing prior work. Specifically, please discuss why a causal mechanism (structural equation) would change as a result of an intervention. A real-world example illustrating such a structural change would strengthen the motivation.  \n6. Another significant weakness is the assumption of two sources of paired data — \\( D \\) (normal observational data) and \\( \\tilde{D} \\) (post-intervention data). Although the authors refer to \\( \\tilde{D} \\) as interventions, I believe that this paired-data assumption effectively requires counterfactual instances, which is a very strong assumption in causal inference and further restricts the problem scope.  \n7. In view of (6), if the authors still believe counterfactual data is not necessary, please justify the cross-regression step where the \\( k \\)-th attribute in \\( D \\) is replaced with the \\( k \\)-th attribute from \\( \\tilde{D} \\).  \n8. Can the authors elaborate on how Lemma 1 helps distinguish correlation from causation, which is crucial for identifying ancestors? I know that some approaches like LinGAM assume non-Gaussian exogenous noise and exploit asymmetry of error residuals to identify ancestors. However, the authors do not make such assumptions yet claim to identify ancestors—please clarify.  \n9.
