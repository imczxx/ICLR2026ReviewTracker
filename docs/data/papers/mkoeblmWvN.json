We first introduce a novel optimisation algorithm, DIRECT-LSR, to identify worst-case robustness against clinically relevant semantic perturbations, including geometric transformation, illumination distortion, and motion blur. Our method provides a reliable lower bound with theoretical guarantees, enabling a practical black-box robustness validation approach. Evaluating various commonly used DNN models on colour fundus photograph datasets, we demonstrate their vulnerability to semantic perturbations, particularly geometric transformations that drastically reduce model accuracy despite preserving clinically relevant features. As a secondary contribution, we show that a randomised data augmentation strategy can serve as an effective and accessible defence mechanism to improve models' reliability. However, since the performance gaps between clean and perturbed images persist, our results also highlight the need for more advanced defences in future work, offering insights for developing more reliable artificial intelligence systems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Semantic Robustness", "Retinal Image", "DIRECT optimisation"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/50027f21416ea85a159238205617acebd613e503.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b2c92f928060f7be0f876d647bbdca2bfe7d0648.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the robustness of retinal imaging models to \"semantic\" corruptions such as geometric distortions, illumination changes, and motion blur (in contrast to adversarial corruptions).

Indeed, the found corruptions are shown to degrade performance stronger than corruptions found by PGD-like gradient-based methods.

I see the potential value of this analysis to the medical field, specifically the subfield working on retina imaging, but for ICLR, this somewhat lacks generality. One would have to pitch the DIRECT-LSR algorithm as a general method, and I could see myself accepting such a paper, but this is not what the paper does.\n- The presentation of the paper should be improved:\n\t- Figure 3 is a bit weird because the lines all overlap, so most of the colors never even show up - probably, a logarithmic y-axis would have been advisable.\n\t- Figure 4 is poorly designed, I'd recommend to focus on one dataset, then put the rest in the appendix as separate figures.\n\t- Table 2 is hard to read, it includes a few irrelevant models (as in, models that never perform best), and no confidence intervals or any notion of uncertainty. I would make a selection of models, then have the full table in the appendix. Likewise, I would remove the $L_{min} > 0$ rows and present them in an extra appendix table.\n- The related work section is not very convincing, I would have liked to see works more closely connected to robustness of retinal imaging models rather than e.g. an arbitrary autonomous driving paper. \n- It seems like train / test splits were not conducted properly. If this is indeed the case, it would be a weakness.\n- The four datasets are not sufficiently characterized. How large are they? What is the state-of-the-art classification performance on the datasets?\n- The evaluation of human experts was not done perfectly. Ideally, human experts should have been asked to perform a classification task \"blindly\", in a true nAFC fashion, i.e. without access to the true labels, rather than just stating whether they think crucial features for the true class are visible or not. This would put model performance in perspective much better.\n- The limits of all corruption parameters are neither justified nor visualized, making it hard to assess whether they are reasonable (e.g. there are levels of motion blur that would be absurd to expect in retina images). \n- The analysis is a bit thin, I would have liked to see e.g. whether the different optimization procedures (DIRECT-LSR, Bayes, random search) find very different optima, whether your attacks lead models to favor a certain class, etc.\n- I realize this is a somewhat unfair criticism, but I find it hard to believe that random search outperforms PGD-style gradient-based optimization for the task of finding optimal corruptions. I must imagine that this is indicative of sub-par implementation or poor hyperparameters. Can the authors comment on this? (Maybe the random search effectively covers the entire parameter space?)\n- Training the models in table 2 with exactly the same setup does not seem very principled to me. Different training setups might be optimal for different models, so I would find it more convincing if all models were trained in a way that yields maximum performance (up to the limit of the respective architecture and model size). Another reasonable decision would have been to compute-match models. I would have also liked to see reference performance values on these tasks from literature.\n- Again a somewhat unfair point, but the paper lacks certain shibboleths that one would expect from groups that work in this field. For example, the phrase \"out-of-distribution robustness\" does not appear even once, although this is exactly what this paper is about at its core. I have tried to down-weight this point in my assessment, but it does not instill confidence.\n\nOverall, I feel conflicted about this paper. In principle, I see the value of the idea of finding provably difficult points in bounded parameter spaces for parametric corruptions, and I can imagine that evaluating robustness to such corruptions is relevant in the retinal imaging field. The biggest argument in favor of the paper is that the proposed algorithm could be useful in other settings. But the paper itself suffers from poor presentation, and there are some \"smells\" (such as the train-test-split issue, model comparison on equal footing, bad PGD performance, etc). The paper also has a very narrow topic scope and many questions remain open. Based on the related work, I am also lacking perspective on e.g. what models are considered gold standard for these tasks, and how robustness has been evaluated in the literature. I'm submitting an initial rating of 2 for now, but I am curious about other reviewers' thoughts and generally willing to increase this score, provided that presentation is improved and the paper is championed by someone else."}, "questions": {"value": "- I would find the paper more valuable if the idea was to implement a benchmark, where people submit retinal imaging models, and maximally strong \"semantic adversarials\" are created specifically for these models, eventually leading to a public leaderboard of the most robust retinal imaging models.

It reads in line 440 as if the dataset was not split, and validation was done on a random subset of the training set.\n- What is the Schwefel function?
