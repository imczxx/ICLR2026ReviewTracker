In contrast to conventional graph kernels based on graph combinatorics such as nodes, edges, and subgraphs, our metric graph kernels are purely based on the geometry and topology of the underlying metric space. A key characterizing property of our construction is its invariance under edge subdivision, making the kernels intrinsically well-suited for comparing graphs representing different underlying spaces. We develop efficient algorithms to compute our kernels and analyze their complexity, which depends primarily on the genus of the input graphs. Empirically, our kernels outperform existing methods in label-free settings, as demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. We further showcase their practical utility with an urban road network classification task.", "tldr": "We propose new graph kernels via the tropical Torelli map, comparing graphs through intrinsic geometry and topological cycles instead of nodes or edges.", "keywords": ["graph kernel", "metric graph", "tropical geometry", "graph classification"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f3078e4ad866807430adf3c36cf391e2d59cd943.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/39940caf1c9309fc0ad6f9274bedfaf105d721d9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper builds on ideas from tropical geometry and presents a graph kernel for metric graphs.

The matrix of the tropical Torelli map is then modified such that all graphs have matrices of equal size, and two variants of the kernel are produced, one that computes the Euclidean distance of the matrices and one that computes the Bures–Wasserstein distance.

The proposed kernel is thus novel in this regard. In addition, no other kernels have been inspired by the field of tropical geometry. Therefore, it is my view that the kernel that is presented in the paper is novel.\n\n- The authors have made a clear effort to motivate the proposed kernel and its properties (such as invariance under edge subdivisions) by discussing potential applications to road networks. \n\n- The two variants of the proposed kernel seem to lead to performance improvements on most of the considered datasets. However, there are several issues with the experimental evaluation, which are discussed below."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The paper's main weakness is that there are several issues with the empirical evaluation of the proposed method.\n    - No hyperparameter tuning was performed. The default hyperparameters were used both for the baseline kernels and also for the SVM classifier (its hyperparameter $C$ was not tuned). This raises doubts about the validity of the results. For a fair comparison, the hyperparameters of all kernels along with those of the SVM classifier should be optimized on some validation set.\n\n    - I do not understand why the authors did not include the Weisfeiler–Lehman graph kernel, which is known to be state-of-the-art for many problems, in their experiments. This kernel can be actually applied to unlabeled graphs if all nodes are assigned the same label.\n    \n    - The results reported in Table 5 of the Appendix are far from state-of-the-art. I understand that this is because the discrete or continuous features of the nodes were ignored. However, it is not clear to me whether the overall comparison remains meaningful.\n\n\n- If the genus of graph is much greater than $g_0$, a large number of rows and columns of the matrix of the tropical Torelli map are removed. This can lead to substantial information loss, and the kernel might fail to properly capture the similarity between graphs, thus affecting its overall performance.\n\n- The TTW kernel is not actually a valid kernel. Therefore, for classification problems, the objective of SVM is non-convex, which might lead to instabilities. While in the experimental evaluation, this does not seem to happen, there might exist problem instances where the solver might fail to converge.\n\n- The TTW is computationally very complex. On MSRC-21 and ER-MD, it is significantly slower than most of the competing kernels.\n\n- The output of the kernel is unique only for graphs that have a unique minimal spanning tree and the lengths of the edges are distinct. These two conditions are not satisfied by most real-world graphs, and therefore, the kernel might produce different output when isomorphic graphs are given as input along with other graphs.\n\n- Typo: l.277: \"such the log-Euclidean metric\" -> \"such as the log-Euclidean metric\""}, "questions": {"value": "- What features of the graph does the kernel capture?
