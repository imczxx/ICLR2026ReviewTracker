Yet most existing PDE foundation models rely on deterministic Transformer architectures, which lack generative flexibility for many science and engineering applications. We propose Flow Marching, an algorithm that bridges neural operator learning with flow matching motivated by an analysis of error accumulation in physical dynamical systems, and we build a generative PDE foundation model on top of it. By jointly sampling the noise level and the physical time step between adjacent states, the model learns a unified velocity field that transports a noisy current state toward its clean successor, reducing long-term rollout drift while enabling\nuncertainty-aware ensemble generations . Alongside this core algorithm, we introduce a Physics-Pretrained Variational Autoencoder (P2VAE) to embed physical states into a compact latent space, and an efficient Flow Marching Transformer (FMT) that combines a diffusion-forcing scheme with latent temporal pyramids, achieving up to 15× greater computational efficiency than full-length video diffusion models and thereby enabling large-scale pretraining at substantially reduced cost. We curate a corpus of∼2.5M trajectories across 12 distinct PDE families and train suites of P2VAEs and FMTs at multiple scales. On downstream evaluation, we benchmark on unseen Kolmogorov turbulence with few-shot adaptation, demonstrate long-term rollout stability over deterministic counterparts, and present uncertainty-stratified ensemble results, highlighting the importance of generative PDE foundation models for real-world applications.", "tldr": "We propose a generative PDE foundation model that bridges neural operator with flow matching, introduces efficient implementation, and achieves extensible applications across diverse PDE systems.", "keywords": ["PDE foundation models", "Generative modeling", "Neural operator learning"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/db81f3e5771bdcd269bdbbd9ad4f6042b330ecd5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a novel framework for building generative foundation models for partial differential equations (PDEs).

I had to look at the original papers (DPOT, MPP, The Well) to find the error numbers that were copied over and the setup that was used to get these errors.\n    - Setup 1: DPOT is run with a context length of 10 (takes 10 prior frames to make 1 future prediction) and the error is averaged over 5 autoregressive predictions. The Unet in the upper portion of the table is also setup like this. Extra channels are padded and inputs are sampled to a common, 128x128 resolution.\n     - Setup 2: Unet/FNO/CNextUnet in the lower portion of the table is setup with a context length of 1 and makes 1 future prediction, and the error is only at the next timestep. The resolution of the input/outputs are variable, and can be rectangular (512x128 RBC). Furthermore, these inputs are not downsampled like P2VAE.\n         - The FFNO baseline from the Well is missing (not a huge problem, but why only copy over errors from three out of the four models?) \n     - Setup 3: The P2VAE uses a common, 128x128 input, with extra channels discarded. The evaluation is a reconstruction error on a single frame, not a prediction error, which is a different task than the other baselines considered. \n     - There are more baselines cited that I did not attempt to try to figure out how these error numbers were generated. Even then, the reported setups are surface-level, there are many more parameters (num epochs, training compute, model size) that are not easily accessible yet should be made standardized or at least known to readers so that they themselves can make a fair comparison. \n\n- The issue stems from the fact that the authors decide to re-use baseline metrics from prior works, without making an attempt to adapt their own evaluation to match. Furthermore, when taking numbers from multiple prior works, each prior work uses a different training scheme, model size, data downsampling, error calculation, etc. which causes numerous inconsistencies when comparing results across different papers, not to mention comparing your model to these numbers. \n- My recommendation is to focus on a few, well-motivated experiments and baselines models and run the baselines yourself to ensure that the setups are consistent across all runs. Without this, it is very challenging to actually figure out if your method is doing better, and more broadly, may mislead casual readers about the true nature of what is going on.\n\nAs a result of the lack of rigor in evaluations, many of the results are not convincing:\n- The main table (Table 1) compares a reconstruction task to a prediction task, which is misleading. Reconstruction is much easier than prediction (both from prior work: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02608, and shown in Table 2 (VAE vs FMT losses)) and even then, the autoencoder does not seem to do better than some predictive baselines (although I am unsure if we can even compare this from what is noted in previous section). If the autoencoder is already worse, then it is likely that the FMT model will be worse than a majority of the baselines considered, especially when the FMT is trained with the 16M variant of the autoencoder.\n- In Table 3, we get an idea of the model’s rollout/prediction performance, but it is only compared to a single baseline. It is known that Unet is a good model for regular gridded benchmark problems, so a comparison to FNO/UNet would be good to make. \n\nThere are also some minor concerns:\n- The strategy used to downsample data is a little curious:\n    - Discarding extra physical variables and labeling them as “unimportant” is rather dismissive. For example, the point of solving compressible Navier Stokes is to get access to new physical variables that are not present in incompressible Navier Stokes, such as energy. \n    - Similarly, downsampling physical fields destroys finer-scale features that could be important. Especially in turbulent systems like Rayleigh-Benard Convection, there is mixing behavior that is likely lost when downsampling. \n- The runtime of FMT is longer than any of the baselines (100 denoising steps), compared to most baselines being a direct prediction (1-step). \n\nOverall, I think this is a promising idea, but needs substantial work to fix most of the experiments. It seems that you have put a lot of effort into the work, so I am sorry about the harsh review, but these are basic concerns about experimental rigor. Please let me know if I have had any misunderstandings about the nature of the experiments."}, "questions": {"value": "- What is k set to for experiments in Table 3?\n- How does the model performance compare to pure flow matching? \n   - In order to motivate the need for flow marching, it should be shown that it is better than the deterministic case and purely flow matching case."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "072bdkURS2", "forum": "nnRB90w2kv", "replyto": "nnRB90w2kv", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20882/Reviewer_9Hu6"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20882/Reviewer_9Hu6"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20882/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761663607490, "cdate": 1761663607490, "tmdate": 1762999982737, "mdate": 1762999982737, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The work proposes a PDE foundation model based on flow matching deformation.
