Why is this setting non-trivial? What happens when \\kappa is of order 1 or greater, and why is this not important? Are you implying that your method only does better in the case of vanishing signal? If so, do you have any intuition why the nonparametric method does better outside of this case?\n- Before Remark 2, you state that the singular values of D in (9) decay at the same rate. Do you prove this? How important is this for the theoretical result/algorithm to work?\n- Experimental work: the simulation studies are good and comparisons seem fair, and I liked that you compared in the setting where \\kappa is of order 1, even though your theory does not indicate superiority in this regime (according to my understanding). Did you consider comparing against other models, such as the Madrid Padilla one, in the real data example? I think that would strengthen the paper, since from the theoretical result it is not clear how much of an improvement your method gives over Madrid Padilla.\n- Typo at bottom of page 6: “We estimate the CUSUM statistics”."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "TIWi6aWNzg", "forum": "lhY8Pa0u8d", "replyto": "lhY8Pa0u8d", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8042/Reviewer_G654"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8042/Reviewer_G654"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8042/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761935835208, "cdate": 1761935835208, "tmdate": 1762920034286, "mdate": 1762920034286, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies online change-point detection for multivariate inhomogeneous Poisson point process data streams.

It should be made more clear in the problem setup what the meaning of streaming data is here. It seems the authors are assuming a series of point processes, not a stream of event data that is generated from a point process. If this is the case, then it should be mentioned how long each point process lasts, and does these point processes have any continuity in physical time. And it should be defined in the very beginning what is the format of each X^{(i)}. All these formulations need to be clarified to enhance the readability of the work. \n\n2. The algorithm 1 and algorithm 2 have limited usage if the constants $C_\\alpha$ and $C_{lag}$ are not specified: the detection threshold $\\tau$ depends on $C_\\alpha$, while the window size required depends on $C_{lag}$. Therefore, it must be specified what these constants are, rather than saying “sufficiently large” in order for the algorithm to be practically usable. It is mentioned in Remark 4 that “Given these choices, we select the remaining parameters (r,W,Cα) in Algorithm 1 by cross-validation on the training data.” It should be specified how this cross-validation is performed, and comment on what will be the case if there is no training data available for cross-validation. \n\n3. The COVID dataset may not be an ideal real data example for this task, as the confirmed cases every day may have strong correlations, as there could be self-existing effects between confirmed cases, which makes it more meaningful to model the intensity function to be history dependent, such as a Hawkes model or an autoregressive model. Also, it is not clearly described how the authors convert the confirmed case data into Poisson processes. It seems to me that there should be a threshold such that the authors will mark an “event” in the location (long, lat) of the corresponding county if the confirmed cases in that county are above the threshold. And instead of presenting Figure 4, I think at least some kind of figures of the trajectory of the detection statistics should be presented to visualize the detection result; Figure 4 itself is not informative enough and is not helpful for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n4. Some related prior work seems to be missing, such as the following. And I think there should be more related works on detecting changes in Poisson processes.\nNancy R. Zhang, Benjamin Yakir, Li C.
