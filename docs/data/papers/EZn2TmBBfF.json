A popular approach is *Best-of-$N$* (BoN) sampling, where $N$ candidate responses are generated, scored according to a reward model, and the highest-scoring response is selected.  While this approach can improve performance, it is vulnerable to *reward hacking*, where performance degrades as $N$ increases due to the selection of responses that exploit imperfections in the reward model instead of genuinely improving generation quality. Prior attempts to mitigate reward hacking---via stronger reward models or heavy-handed distributional regularization---either fail to fully address over-optimization or are too conservative to exploit additional compute.  In this work, we explore the principle of *pessimism* in reinforcement learning (RL), which uses lower confidence bounds on value estimates to avoid out-of-distribution (OOD) actions with uncertain reward estimates. Our approach, termed as *caution*, can be seen as the *reverse* of *curiosity*: where curiosity (e.g., via Random Network Distillation, RND) rewards prediction error as a signal of novelty, caution penalizes prediction error as a signal of distributional uncertainty. Practically, caution trains an error model on typical responses and uses its prediction error to lower reward estimates for atypical ones. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that caution is a simple, computationally efficient approach that substantially mitigates reward hacking in BoN sampling.  We also provide a theoretical analysis in a simplified linear setting, which shows that caution provably improves over the standard BoN approach.  Together, our results not only establish caution as a practical solution to reward hacking, but also provide evidence that curiosity-based approaches can be a general OOD detection technique in LLM settings.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reward Hacking", "Reward Models", "Pessimism", "Inference-time Scaling", "Large Language Models"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8b72f3b79335d8e9f424b6957000228b69dc41e8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Best-of-N with pessimism to mitigate potential reward hacking issues in test-time scaling.

This is both a perceived weakness and a question. Please correct me if I misunderstood the setup. The \"caution\" mechanism defines \"in-distribution\" by learning the typical feature patterns of the base reward model. This is effective at penalizing novel responses that exploit weird loopholes, but it may fail to mitigate, and could even reinforce, the reward model's own systemic biases which you mention in Lines 81-83 and in Figure 4. For instance, if a reward model was trained on data where humans consistently preferred verbose answers, its internal features would encode verbosity as a \"normal\" characteristic of high-quality responses. The caution predictor would learn this pattern and would consequently fail to penalize a verbose, incorrect, reward-hacking response. It might even penalize a concise, correct response for being stylistically \"out-of-distribution.\" In essence, the method regularizes generations toward the central tendencies of the reward model, and if those tendencies are themselves flawed, the method risks preserving those flaws. If doing so is indeed shown to mitigate hacking, why do you think hacking happens to begin with?\n\nW2. What is the most fundamental way to combine a reward signal and an uncertainty signal with BoN? Subtracting the uncertainty from the reward feels very natural from an RL / training point of view. However, BoN only cares about the ranking of the responses according to their rewards, making it insensitive to any shifts or rescaling. Is there a way we can introduce uncertainty in the ranking itself and how would you justify subtraction for inference-time alignment? I think this aspect is worth discussing in the paper and makes your decision of running a z-score transformation followed by using a global hyperparameter to balance the subtraction of the reward with the uncertainty more convincing.\n\nOther work considered, for example, a multiplicative exponential term to model uncertainty in reward scoring and they motivate it well for policy optimization [1].\n\n[1] Houliston, Sam, et al. \"Uncertainty-penalized direct preference optimization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.20187 (2024)."}, "questions": {"value": "- How do you expect the \"caution\" mechanism to perform if the base reward model is systematically biased? \n\n- The paper's discussion of Huang et al. (2025b) is very clear. A direct empirical comparison on the same experimental setup would be appreciated, as it represents the most relevant alternative approach.\n\n- Why do you not consider calibrated reward as done in InfAlign (Balashankar et al., 2024)? Since Best of n only cares about the ranking of the reward scores, such a calibration is theoretically motivated. Instead, you opt for a z-score transformation. Can you elaborate on lines 300-302? In particular, did you perform the z-score transformation per prompt or across prompts?\n\n- You may consider citing [2]. They use the reward model's learned representation of the prompt response pair to model its uncertainty. They argue when a data point is (almost) in distribution, there is less uncertainty.\n\n[2] Zhang, X., Ton, J. F., Shen, W., Wang, H., & Liu, Y. (2024).
