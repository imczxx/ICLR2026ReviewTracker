Existing methods typically require pre specifying the maximum order of interaction in the low dimensional functions and exhaustively considering all feature combinations up to that order. In practice, this often limits analysis to pairwise interaction terms. To address this limitation, the authors propose Bayesian TPNN, a Bayesian framework that adaptively selects the most relevant features for inclusion in the low dimensional components without pre-specifying the maximum order.

Most experiments are conducted on simulated or tabular datasets, with the exception of Section 4.4, which uses CelebA HQ and Catdog datasets. However, in these cases, the approach relies on another CBM model to generate interpretable concepts.
