Recently, a promising algorithm dubbed GSBM was proposed to solve the generalized SB (GSB) problem, an extension of SB to deal with additional path constraints. Therein the SB is formulated as a minimal kinetic energy conditional flow matching problem, and an additional task-specific stage cost is introduced as the conditional stochastic optimal control (CondSOC) problem. The GSB is a new emerging problem with considerable room for research contributions, and we introduce a novel Gaussian process pinned marginal path posterior inference as a meaningful contribution in this area. Our main motivation is that the stage cost in GSBM, typically representing task-specific obstacles in the particle paths and other congestion penalties, can be potentially noisy and uncertain. Whereas the current GSBM approach regards this stage cost as a noise-free deterministic quantity in the CondSOC optimization, we instead model it as a stochastic quantity. Specifically, we impose a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the pinned marginal path, view the CondSOC objective as a (noisy) likelihood function, and infer the posterior path via sparse variational free-energy GP approximate inference. The main benefit is more flexible marginal path modeling that takes into account the uncertainty in the stage cost such as more realistic noisy observations. On some image-to-image translation and crowd navigation problems under noisy scenarios, we show that our proposed GP-based method yields more robust solutions than the original GSBM.", "tldr": "We propose a generalized Schr\\\"{o}dinger Bridge matching algorithm that is robust to uncertain/noisy stage costs, by formulating a Gaussian process inference problem on the marginal probability paths.", "keywords": ["Gaussian processes", "Distribution matching", "Diffusion models", "Bayesian statistics"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/55b1b727e6c8e63cfd3cbb60a1977b60c34f215c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a GP prior GSBM algorithm for robust generalization.

According to Table 5 in the Appendix (Page 26), the method additionally requires $O(n^3)$ time. A strategy to further reduce the sampling time is needed. Considering the current computational cost, the performance improvement over GSBM does not appear dramatic.\n\n- “Sparse” Variational Gaussian Process: The proposed method constructs a flow by interpolating simple single Gaussian kernels defined on two domains, $x_0$ and $x_1$. While this simplifies the problem, it does not fully capture the global distribution, making the selection of data pairs highly influential to overall performance.\n\n- Uncertain Performance Difference: The proposed approach modifies the GSBM structure only by formulating $V_t$ as a GP problem. Based on the reported results, including those in the Appendix, the improvement over GSBM appears only incremental. It would strengthen the paper to include concrete experimental cases where GP-GSBM successfully solves problems that GSBM fails to address.\n\n### Minor Weaknesses\n\n- Choice of Primary Area: The proposed method utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP) as one possible solution to the GSB problem. In my opinion, this work may fit more appropriately under the area of generative modeling rather than GP itself.\n\n- Formatting in the Related Work Section: It might be better to remove quotation marks from the paragraph titles in the Related Work section for cleaner presentation."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses Section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "hZ6QWwnXb1", "forum": "3a2QuEzveq", "replyto": "3a2QuEzveq", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18943/Reviewer_Jgjn"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18943/Reviewer_Jgjn"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18943/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761997419571, "cdate": 1761997419571, "tmdate": 1762930998970, "mdate": 1762930998970, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This manuscript tackles the generalized Schrodinger Bridge (GSB) problem that incorporates an extra stage cost function on top of the original SB problem.
