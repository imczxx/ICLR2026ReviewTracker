In this work, we diagnose this issue in the state-of-the-art model VGGT, and trace the primary bottleneck to its Global Attention layer. Our analysis reveals a ``token collapse'' phenomenon, where many tokens attend to nearly identical regions, resulting in redundant computation and inefficiency. Motivated by this finding, we propose FastVGGT, a training-free framework that strategically prunes these redundant tokens. Instead of uniform merging, FastVGGT employs a tailored, three-part token partitioning strategy. It preserves initial-frame tokens as a stable global reference, retains salient tokens to maintain fine details, and utilizes region-based random sampling to ensure spatially balanced coverage. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry benchmarks validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably, on sequences of 1000 images, FastVGGT achieves a 4$\\times$ speedup over the original VGGT while simultaneously mitigating error accumulation, demonstrating its efficiency and robustness for long-sequence scenarios.

While the work solves an important problem with VGGT, the work is somewhat incremental; though in a technically competent and practically valuable sense. This is a minor, high level weakness, but has some implications, detailed below.\n2. The proposed merging mechanism is presented as a novel architectural contribution, but has close parallels in existing literature. The authors mention the cosine-based assignment and replication in ToMeSD [1]; an extension of ToMe [2] for diffusion. However, other approaches such as TokenLearner [3], SPiT [4], and ATC [5] are other works that apply similar mechanisms for perceptual grouping and exploiting redundancy, explicitly setting out to capture partitions with constraints of connectivity in 2D images. More tangentially, the averaging and landmark selection procedure can be said to correspond to Nyström-like kernel compression and feature sketching [6; 7], and can also arguably related to general low-rank approximation. This reviewer emphasises that while the paper’s integration of these techniques into 3D feed-forward geometry transformers is valuable, the current phrasing makes the work come across as a somewhat *isolated discovery*. In this reviewers opinion, the contributions of the paper would be clearer if the authors explicitly positioned the contribution within the existing body of work on the topic.\n3. Relatedly, an analysis on how the constrains used in the work (e.g. first-frame anchoring, salient protection) differ / synergise with existing works would benefit the field of token merging. Discussing how / why \"geometry-aware\" settings align / demand this specific adaptation would also be an interesting addition, and strengthen the work; particularly if the work is contrasted with existing methods.\n4. The paper is a little sparse in discussing the inevitable failure cases and practical limitations, as well as intuition for hyperparameters (merging ratio). The effect of merging naturally induces a loss of information, and failure cases (if applicable) would not be unnatural, nor surprising given the improved efficiency of the approach.\n5. Certain notation could be clarified slightly. L314 has examples of \"src\" and \"dst\" that is written out in plain text, which makes the notation hard to parse when placed in the prose. This is a minor weakness, but addressing this would improve the readability of the manuscript.\n\n---\n\n[1] [Token Merging for Fast Stable Diffusion, Bolya & Hoffman, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17604)\n\n[2] [Token Merging: Your ViT But Faster, Bolya et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09461)\n\n[3] [TokenLearner: Adaptive Space-Time Tokenization for Videos, Ryoo et al., 2021](https://openreview.net/forum?id=z-l1kpDXs88)\n\n[4] [A Spitting Image: Modular Superpixel Tokenization in Vision Transformers, Aasan et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07680)\n\n[5] [Agglomerative Token Clustering, Haurum et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11923)\n\n[6] [Using the Nyström Method to Speed Up Kernel Machines, Williams & Seeger, 2001](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2000/hash/19de10adbaa1b2ee13f77f679fa1483a-Abstract.html)\n\n[7] [Nyströmformer: A Nyström-Based Algorithm for Approximating Self-Attention, Xiong et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902)"}, "questions": {"value": "1. The authors uses the term “geometry-aware” liberally, but the mechanism operates entirely in feature space. Anchoring to the first frame and preserving salient tokens is plausible, but not proven to maintain geometric invariants. This reviewer is left wondering what the authors mean when stating that the model is \"geometry-aware\", and whether the authors considers this worthwhile defining more clearer in the manuscript?\n2. The method’s efficiency stems from token merging, yet comparisons are made only to 3D reconstruction baselines, not to efficient-transformer methods like ToMe, Nyströmformer, or even Performer [8]. The question is then; why not compare against generic attention approximations? Of course, this may not be trivial, but a discussion around why such a comparison is not included would be prudent.\n3. The merging ratio is treated as a fixed hyperparameter with minimal analysis. Do the authors have any insights to share with practitioners who would like to tune this in more specific applications?\n4. The paper reports mean metrics but is missing a failure analysis. Are errors gradual or catastrophic? Do high-parallax / low-texture regions induce failure compared to the original? Does merging induce smoothing, or loss of information, as one would expect?\n\nWhile not as much a question, but this reviewer emphasises that the manuscript would be strengthened by extending the related work section to include previous works on partitioning for reducing token redundancy.\n\n---\n\n[8] [Rethinking Attention with Performers, Choromanski et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14794)"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "WdTDCUT033", "forum": "asl8NJlIMe", "replyto": "asl8NJlIMe", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5717/Reviewer_rRZP"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5717/Reviewer_rRZP"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5717/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760998221849, "cdate": 1760998221849, "tmdate": 1762918214400, "mdate": 1762918214400, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes FastVGGT, a method to speed up Visual Geometry Transformers (VGGT) when handling long image sequences.\nThe authors find that the Global Attention layer causes heavy computation.

The paper provides no explanation for why certain configurations were chosen or how they relate to the proposed method's settings.

The paper's strategy and hyperparameters (e.g., 90% merge ratio) are clearly optimized for long sequences (e.g., 500-1000 frames). However, on short sequences (100 frames), the performance is mixed, even performing slightly worse than the baseline on some key metrics (e.g., RPE-rot and RPE-trans in Table 5). The authors acknowledge this in Appendix E, but a deeper analysis is missing from the main experimental section.\n\nW2: Disconnect between motivation and implementation for \"salient token\" selection. The motivation for \"salient tokens\" is described as preserving unique, \"keypoint-like\" features, and the paper mentions that a \"top-k based on token norms\" strategy was considered. However, a simple \"fixed-stride sampling\" was ultimately used for efficiency. The claim that both are \"comparably accurate\" is unsubstantiated (no data in ablations), which creates a disconnect between the final design and its original motivation (to preserve the most unique features).\n\nW3: Robustness to \"reference frame\" quality is questionable. The entire method relies heavily on the first frame as the \"world coordinate system\" and global anchor, designating all its tokens as high-priority dst tokens. The paper does not discuss at all how the model would perform if this first frame is of poor quality (e.g., blurry, occluded, or unrepresentative of the scene). This reliance on a single, arbitrarily chosen frame could be a robustness liability.\n\nW4: Evidence for \"token collapse\" is primarily qualitative. The paper's core motivation—the \"token collapse\" phenomenon—is primarily argued via visualizations of attention maps in Figure 3. While these maps look similar, this is only a qualitative observation. The paper lacks a more rigorous quantitative analysis (e.g., calculating average cosine similarity or feature variance between tokens) to prove the degree of redundancy, which weakens the force of its core motivation.\n\nW5: Justification for the fixed-stride sampling strategy. Using \"fixed-stride sampling\" to select \"salient tokens\" seems like an arbitrary choice. \"Keypoints\" in a scene are unlikely to be uniformly distributed on an image grid. This sampling method runs counter to the motivation of preserving the \"most unique\" features and is potentially less effective than the (W2-mentioned) top-k strategy."}, "questions": {"value": "Q1 : You determined an aggressive 90% merge ratio starting from Block 0, based on 500-frame sequences (Table 7). Is this fixed hyperparameter combination optimal for all tested sequence lengths (100, 300, 1000 frames)? Could the slight performance drop on 100-frame sequences (Table 5 RPE) be resolved by using a more conservative (lower) merge ratio? Does this suggest that an adaptive merge strategy (e.g., merge ratio $r$ as a function of sequence length $N$) would be a better choice?\n\nQ2 : Could you please provide a specific quantitative comparison of accuracy (CD/ATE) and inference time between (a) the top-k based on token norms strategy and (b) the final fixed-stride sampling strategy for \"salient token\" selection? (You claimed they were \"comparably accurate\" in Section 3.2). This is crucial for justifying your final design choice.\n\nQ3 : Your method is highly dependent on using the first frame as a global reference. Did you test the method's robustness to the quality of this first frame? For example, how much does FastVGGT's performance degrade if the first frame is blurry or heavily occluded? Have you considered alternative reference selection strategies, such as choosing the sharpest frame in the sequence (via some quality metric) as the reference, rather than blindly using the first one?\n\nQ4 : For your \"token collapse\" motivation, did you perform any quantitative measurements beyond the qualitative visualizations in Figure 3 to confirm this phenomenon? For example, by calculating the average cosine similarity between different token feature vectors in the Global Attention layers and showing that it increases in deeper layers? This would provide stronger support for your motivation.\n\nQ5 : The most exciting result in the paper is the improvement in accuracy on long sequences, which you attribute to \"mitigating error accumulation.\" Could you please explain mechanistically, in more detail, why removing tokens (even redundant ones) helps prevent error propagation? My hypothesis is: by merging redundant information in early layers (starting from Block 0), the model is forced to form a more compact and robust global representation, which prevents \"over-thinking\" on noise and redundant features in later layers, ultimately reducing drift.
