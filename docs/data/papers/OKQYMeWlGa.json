To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages structure pretraining for MD trajectory generation. Specifically, we first train a diffusion-based structure generation model on a large-scale conformer dataset, on top of which we introduce an interpolator module trained on MD trajectory data, designed to enforce temporal consistency among generated structures. Our approach effectively harnesses abundant conformer data to mitigate the scarcity of MD trajectory data and effectively decomposes the intricate MD modeling task into two manageable subproblems: structural generation and temporal alignment. We comprehensively evaluate our method on QM9 and DRUGS datasets across various tasks, including unconditional generation, forward simulation, and interpolation. Experimental results confirm that our approach excels in generating chemically realistic MD trajectories, as evidenced by remarkable improvements of accuracy in bond length, bond angle, and torsion angle distributions.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["geometric diffusion models", "molecular dynamics"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/62d4f86efc8b6d5a33dd73af3ca088c14a77415b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/bd04d03d900b2aa4829742ff4a5d99be5545f38c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work introduces EGInterpolator, a novel diffusion-based model designed for modeling MD distributions.

For small-molecule systems, MD simulations using empirical force fields already offer a good balance between efficiency and accuracy. The authors should further clarify the advantages of their model over traditional MD methods or include additional experiments on more complex biomolecular systems.\n2. Line 171 defines the so-called conformer distribution $p^{cf}(x)$, which is a potentially misleading definition. It can only be well-defined if it is based on an empirical data distribution (e.g., a dataset) or a known distribution (e.g., the Boltzmann distribution). The authors should clearly specify the definition.\n3. In the MD finetuning stage, are the model parameters $\\theta$ pretrained on the conformer dataset fixed or further optimized? This point does not appear to be clearly specified in Equation (3). If the parameters $\\theta$ continue to be updated during finetuning, then the premise of Theorem 4.1 may not hold, since it would be unclear whether $\\epsilon_{\\theta}^{cf}$ remains consistent with the pretrained approximation of $p^{cf}$ during finetuning. This would undermine the practical validity of the theorem.\n4. Lines 234–235 assume an extreme case, $\\hat{p}^{md} = p^{md}$, to illustrate the advantage of the parametrization. I find this assumption inappropriate, as $\\hat{p}^{md}$ assumes all conformations are i.i.d., while there exist temporal dependencies between consecutive MD samples, making it nearly impossible for their joint distribution to coincide with that of an i.i.d. case. Could the authors provide a reasonable justification for this assumption?\n5. From the experimental results in Figure 3(A), the recall of the coverage and matching metrics on the QM9 dataset still falls short of SOTA performance. Could the authors provide possible explanations for this gap?\n6. I have concerns about the setup of the interpolation task. Even though the model can generate a trajectory from the initial to the target state through the conditioning mask, the actual transition time corresponding to this process may be longer than 0.52 ns, which could result in the generated trajectory failing to capture the true underlying dynamics.
