Existing phenotype-driven methods often rely on expert-curated candidate gene lists and are sensitive to incomplete clinical data, limiting their real-world utility. We present PhenoKG, a knowledge-graph framework that enriches patient phenotypes with biomedical knowledge and ranks $\\sim$6,000 genes by their likelihood of being causative. PhenoKG integrates graph neural networks with transformer-based encoders to capture patient-specific phenotype-gene relationships, and incorporates an optional reranking procedure that leverages recently validated clinical associations to extend the knowledge graph while maintaining robustness to noisy or incomplete input. Designed to operate with or without candidate lists, PhenoKG achieves strong performance across diverse diagnostic settings and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on rare disease benchmarks.\nTogether, these results position PhenoKG as a step toward scalable, phenotype-first models for rare disease diagnosis, and open the path to integrating heterogeneous biomedical data for faster, more equitable genetic discovery.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["rare diseases; knowledge graphs"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/754363e1d32c3596c797d34e371597b153b7f6f3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tackles phenotype-driven rare-disease gene prioritization by building patient-specific subgraphs over a biomedical knowledge graph and encoding them with GATv2 plus transformer modules, followed by a contrastive ranking objective and an optional phenotype-based reranking step.

While PhenoKG achieves state-of-the-art results on most benchmarks, it performs substantially worse than PhenoApt on the MyGene2 dataset.

Candidate Gene Extraction: The paper briefly states that candidate genes are extracted “based on phenotype–gene associations,” but the specific algorithmic procedure (e.g., thresholds, ontology traversal strategy) is not detailed. How exactly are the candidate gene lists extracted when no clinician-provided list is available? Is there a fixed k-hop depth or a phenotype–gene similarity threshold?\n\n2. Could the authors provide component-level ablations—for example, evaluating the effectiveness of the reranking module, and whether integrating external knowledge bases (e.g., Monarch) actually improves results?\n\n3. Can the authors provide an example of a real patient case study showing how PhenoKG identified the correct gene and what features contributed most?\n\n4. The authors mention that they imposed multiple restrictions for efficiency, such as limiting the knowledge graph to a 2-hop neighborhood around each patient and only considering genes that appear in at least 10% of the patient’s phenotype subgraphs as candidates. More details are needed to understand how these restrictions might affect the fairness and rigor of the evaluation—for example, clarifying what exactly “2-hop” refers to and how it is defined in patient knowledge graph. A clear explanation of these choices would strengthen confidence in the fairness and validity of the reported results.\n\n5.

If the reranking strategy constitutes the novelty, ablation experiments should explicitly demonstrate its contribution.
