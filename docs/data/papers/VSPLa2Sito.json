Recent advances in 3D-aware classifiers that map image features to volumetric representation of objects, rather than relying solely on 2D appearance, have greatly improved robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Such classifiers have not yet been studied from the perspective of interpretability. Meanwhile, current concept-based XAI methods often neglect OOD robustness. We aim to address both aspects with CAVE - Concept Aware Volumes for Explanations - a new direction that unifies interpretability and robustness in image classification. We design CAVE as a robust and inherently interpretable classifier that learns sparse concepts from 3D object representation. We further propose 3D Consistency (3D-C), a metric to measure spatial consistency of concepts. Unlike existing metrics that rely on human-annotated parts on images, 3D-C leverages ground-truth object meshes as a common surface to project and compare explanations across concept-based methods. CAVE achieves competitive classification performance while discovering consistent and meaningful concepts across images in various OOD settings.", "tldr": "We introduce CAVE: Concept-Aware Object Volumes for Robust and Interpretable Image Classification", "keywords": ["Interpretability", "Robustness", "3D-aware classification with concepts", "Sparse volumetric object representation", "3D consistency"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/674798e3fc700819e9e898b3e1408c0c00986a4d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper is aim at finding a robust and explainable architecture for classification of images based on 3D representation of the object.

Think of human body which can be transformed in a non-rigid motion then it is obvious that fixed set of dictionary representation cannot hold all variation of the body. So I find it as a limitation of the method.\n* the 3D-C method is heavily relying on given set of meshes, where in the wild it is not given and may be hard to obtain especially for edge cases of objects (especially object with non-rigid movement abilities). I believe that the authors should elaborate on what are the options for a practitioner when this set is absent, or when he is interested in unknown set of classes.\n\nMinor weaknesses:\n* in the main figure on the first page, the left part is very intuitive and understandable, the right plot is much less. I didnt understand what the dashed lines stands for, moreover, it is better to put units or some explanation on the axes. I can get that the Y axis is accuracy in between 0-100 but what is 0.1 in spatial localization means?\n* The citation of the CRAFT paper by Thomas Fel et. al is in German, replace it with the appropriate English one."}, "questions": {"value": "* In line 51-85: \"Notably, post-hoc methods... However such methods only approximate the model’s computations, and thus do not provide a faithful explanation\". Seems to me like a very general and not accurate statement. Why did you claim that they do not provide faithful explanation? for the extreme case - a pure gradient from output to input of the entire architecture should ideally measure the impact of each input element on the output. Seems like very faithful explanation. I think that it should be clarify or backed somehow with experiments or references to other papers showing something like this. \n* It is not clear in the preliminaries section whether the approach limited to embedders which produce feature vector for each pixel, since I think that most embedders squeeze the input information into much smaller dimension, ViT for example patchify the input. If it is the case, then it is a very profound limitation of your approach (or NOVUM you based on). If not - then I think that the notations of H and W are not clear.\n* Im not sure how do the concepts being selected in space? why is bus contains the roof and car not (in Fig 4)?\n* In many concept decomposition papers the sparsity is playing a vital role, the most basic example for this is the SAE (Sparse AutoEncoders). In several places in your paper you are trying to cinvince that sparsity is a good characteristic where it is almost trivial in concept decomposition.\n\nOverall I find the ideas of the paper very intuitive, so the results seems reasonable to me. The idea to combine 3d-aware representation with XAI is very important, and the modeling through ellipsoids and Gaussians seems reasonable.

Each classification is a function of the dot product between each image patch and some concept; this dot product is not bounded, and does not reflect a meaningful distance/similarity measure. Even if it did, these concepts do not seem to have any semantic meaning -- they are freely learned parameters. As such, it may be inappropriate to compare with only interpretable/explainable models. If I am missing something fundamental, clarification would be appreciated. This is my primary concern.\n- The clarity of this work suffers a bit from not being self-contained. In particular, it is unclear from this work how spatial location and distributional nature of NOV's actually matter. If a reader does not read NOVUM, each NOV simply seems like a free parameter vector in the embedding space of the backbone. Moreover, there are a couple minor issues with formalism that impact clarity:\n    - Line 314: $\\sum_{(i,j)} A^+(x, h) = 1$ <- i, j do not appear as indices inside the sum\n    - The function $\\Omega_y$ is never defined, including in the appendix"}, "questions": {"value": "- How can it be said that standalone NOVUM is not faithful, but CAVE is? The only difference between the two as predictive models seems to be the number of concepts.\n- In the appendix, Spatial localisation is defined with respect to a single image-concept pair. How is this aggregated to a single value per model/dataset?\n- It may be worth comparing to [1]; this is an extension of ProtoPNet that, while not targeting robustness, learns distributional concepts in 2D space.\n\n[1] Wang, Chong, et al. \"Mixture of gaussian-distributed prototypes with generative modelling for interpretable and trustworthy image recognition.\" IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (2025)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "PvesB0RxOV", "forum": "VSPLa2Sito", "replyto": "VSPLa2Sito", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9053/Reviewer_zP4N"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9053/Reviewer_zP4N"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9053/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761927384526, "cdate": 1761927384526, "tmdate": 1762920763171, "mdate": 1762920763171, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
