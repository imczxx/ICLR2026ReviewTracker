These sequences start with geometry provided by a designer and build up the points and curves of the final profile step by step. We demonstrate that adding construction steps between the designer's input geometry and the final profile improves generation quality in a similar way to the introduction of a chain of thought in language models.  Similar to the constraints in a parametric CAD model, the construction sequences reduce the degrees of freedom in the modeled shape to a small set of parameter values which can be adjusted by the designer, allowing parametric editing with the constructed geometry evaluated to floating point precision.  In addition we show that applying reinforcement learning to the construction sequences gives further improvements over a wide range of metrics, including some which were not explicitly optimized.", "tldr": "This paper introduces a new method of generating Computer Aided Design (CAD) geometry via a sequence of simple geometric constructions including curve offsetting, rotations and intersections.", "keywords": ["CAD", "geometry", "reinforcement learning", "chain of thought"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c47eac6642fb537029976046e6ac59a2fd6599b1.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e97b0d58442874536e8c563ae7a382c032ba4e13.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a method that predict step-by-step CAD geometric sequences to match the input constraints described in the geometric prompt.
