Synthetic data generation with formal privacy guarantees, i.e. differential privacy (DP), offers a promising solution to enable data sharing while protecting sensitive information. Despite extensive study, state-of-the-art methods often focus on minimizing low-order marginal query errors and overlook the challenges posed by high-order correlations. To address this gap, we adapt the Private Evolution (PE) framework, originally developed for DP-compliant image and text synthesis, to tabular data. We introduce Tab-PE -- an algorithm for generating synthetic tabular data under DP. Tab-PE refines a synthetic dataset by an evolutionary process that leverages APIs to generate variations of the data, privately evaluate them, and retain the highest-quality samples. While the original PE requires access to large foundation models, Tab-PE is computationally efficient with heuristic APIs specialized for tabular data. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulation datasets, we demonstrate that Tab-PE substantially outperforms prior baselines on datasets exhibiting high-order correlations. Compared to the best baseline -- AIM, Tab-PE improves classification accuracy by up to 10\\% while running 28$\\times$ faster.", "tldr": "We use an evolutionary algorithm (Private Evolution) to generate differentially private synthetic data", "keywords": ["differential privacy", "tabular data", "synthetic data"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d69bd24057b0e85fa9d5aad255c7cc0b84227d1a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Tab-PE, a differentially private data synthesis algorithm that adapts the Private Evolution (PE) framework to the tabular domain.

Here, the term is used loosely as a buzzword and assessed only through downstream ML performance, which is an unreliable proxy. It remains unclear whether the proposed Tab-PE method actually addresses the stated problem.\n\n- Tab-PE performs substantially worse than AIM on low-order fidelity metrics (e.g., 1-way and 2-way TVD). If a method fails to preserve even low-order marginals, there is little reason to believe it can capture higher-order ones. \n\n- The sampling procedure in PE (top-K) is inherently biased, leading to tail loss and mode concentration. Tab-PE inherits this limitation, which likely explains its poor 1-TVD and 2-TVD results compared to state-of-the-art approaches such as AIM.\n\n- Tab-PE uses a single $\\lambda$ to trade off categorical and numerical scales in DP-NN. This hyperparameter must be dataset-dependent and the results could be very sensitive to this choice. This is a weakness inherent to the proposed algorithm.\n\n- The core algorithm is a direct application of PE with simple tabular adaptations (Gaussian perturbation for numerical attributes, resampling for categorical ones), reusing the same scoring and update loop from prior PE papers. It has very limited technical novelty and does not bring new insights to the field of DP tabular data synthesis.\n\n- The paper deviates from established evaluation practices in DP tabular synthesis. Rather than benchmarking on standard datasets  widely used in prior work (e.g., Adult, Bank, Census, Hospital), it selects its own suite tailored to its method and highlights improvements. This practice hinders cross-paper comparison and undermines the credibility of the empirical claims. **A rigorous study should first have validated Tab-PE on recognized benchmarks before proposing new ones**.\n\n\n[1] Hu, Yuzheng, et al. \"Sok: Privacy-preserving data synthesis.\" 2024 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP).

The general presentation around \"APIs\" is somewhat confusing and misleading. Why retain the \"API\" terminology if no external API calls or foundation models are actually used as in traditional PE?\n2. Related to the above, more could be done to delineate this work from Swanberg et al. which seems the closest related work from a tabular PE perspective. Why have you chosen not to empirically compare to this approach? \n3. It seems that PrivGSD is the closest related DP-SDG approach since it adapts the genetic algorithm approach to produce private tabular data which is closely related to Private Evolution. The specific differences between PrivGSD should be made much clearer in the main paper. Could you summarise the main differences?\n4. The main argument for Tab-PE is that it retains high-order correlations and is much faster than competing methods like AIM. However, most of the benchmark datasets that are used have only a small number of columns. I would have preferred to have seen results that show Tab-PE on higher-dimensional datasets where the argument about capturing high-order correlation is usually much more necessary than on smaller datasets. Do you think Tab-PE can scale effectively to these scenarios?\n5. Have you thought about lightweight hybrid approaches to extend Tab-PE with query-based methods (e.g., marginal information)? It seems to me a key weakness of Tab-PE is that it doesn’t capture 1-way or 2-way marginals as well as methods like AIM (which makes sense as AIM is explicitly trained to do so). However, it is fairly lightweight (from a DP perspective) to integrate marginal information e.g., using 1-way marginal information to initialize the Tab-PE approach (instead of random data)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ATUJq4mdwM", "forum": "SPgqHr2jiK", "replyto": "SPgqHr2jiK", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21749/Reviewer_QPTQ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21749/Reviewer_QPTQ"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21749/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761645516558, "cdate": 1761645516558, "tmdate": 1762941917638, "mdate": 1762941917638, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new tabular data synthesis algorithm that leverages the recent Private Evaluation (PE) technique.

Although the paper is overall interesting and well-written, I am concerned about the performance of Tab-PE. As shown in Table 1, the overall improvement over baseline methods is modest (at most around 10%), while the fidelity (even for simple one-way marginals) is significantly worse (up to 10 times worse on the Person Activity dataset). Given that low-order marginals are a crucial fidelity metric and have many applications (e.g., point/range queries) in tabular data, this represents a critical weakness. The paper should discuss this issue more thoroughly, especially regarding how Tab-PE should be used in practice.\n\n2. While it is interesting to distinguish between low-correlation and high-correlation datasets, the performance differences of Tab-PE across these datasets are not particularly significant. In addition, Table 5 (fidelity evaluation on the Breast Cancer dataset) lacks bold or underlined highlights; this can be either a typo or a mistake in the results. Either way, Table 5 again shows that the advantage of Tab-PE over marginal-based methods lies mainly in ML prediction and embedding metrics, which is unsurprising and has already been validated by many prior studies.\n\n3. Tab-PE relies on several pieces of so-called \"public\" information about the private tabular data, such as the domains of continuous and categorical values and class distributions. While the authors provide some justification for why these can be treated as public, directly using such information weakens the end-to-end privacy guarantee of Tab-PE and may not be practical when these statistics are unavailable. The authors should discuss these assumptions more carefully and provide a more rigorous privacy analysis."}, "questions": {"value": "Q1. Given the relatively modest performance gains (and in fidelity, worse results than baseline methods), why do the authors claim that Tab-PE represents a new paradigm for tabular data synthesis?

Why does the performance of Tab-PE appear similar on both high-correlation datasets (Table 1) and low-correlation datasets (Table 5)?
