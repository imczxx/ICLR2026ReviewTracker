The study of watermark attacks motivates the development of more robust invisible image watermarking. An ideal attack should effectively erase the watermark, preserve the visual quality of the image, and be simple and accessible. Although existing methods can partially destroy watermarks, they often fail to preserve satisfactory visual quality of image. In this paper, we propose the Super-Resolution Attack (SRAttack), a simple attack framework that leverages super-resolution (SR) to overcome these limitations. The proposed attack method first pre-degrade the watermarked image, then use a SR model to reconstruct a high-quality, watermark-free version, and finally down-sample it back to original dimensions of cover image. SRAttack operates in a black-box, training-free manner, and can be readily instantiated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAttack not only effectively destroys watermarks embedded by various advanced watermark algorithms, but also improves visual quality in contrast to existing attack methods. Our research findings reveal a new perspective on invisible image watermarking research, indicating the need to consider attacks aimed at improving visual quality rather than just reducing it.

Empirical results demonstrate its superiority over existing attacks in both watermark removal efficiency and visual fidelity across diverse watermarking algorithms.

While prior work on watermark removal often relies on degrading image quality (e.g., compression, noise injection), this work leverages SR’s inherent ability to reconstruct high-frequency details—where watermarks are typically embedded—to erase watermarks without sacrificing visual fidelity. The framework is also practically deployable, using off-the-shelf SR models without requiring custom training, which distinguishes it from attack methods that demand access to internal model parameters. The idea of combining SR with watermarking security is new.\n\nQuality:\nThe experimental evaluation demonstrates the attack’s effectiveness against state-of-the-art watermarking algorithms (e.g., DeepWaterMark, R-DCT). The results are compelling: SRAttack achieves high watermark erasure rates while maintaining PSNR metrics comparable to clean images, outperforming baseline attacks like JPEG compression. The methodology is grounded in empirical validation, with clear comparisons to existing techniques and quantitative metrics (e.g., SSIM, watermark detection accuracy). The work also highlights the universality of the attack, showing it works across diverse watermarking schemes without fine-tuning, which strengthens its practical relevance. \n\nClarity:\nThe paper is well-structured and accessible, with a clear problem statement, intuitive methodology (the three-step pipeline is logically explained), and reproducible results. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the attack’s performance, and the ablation studies (e.g., varying pre-degradation levels) provide insight into the method’s robustness. \n\nSignificance:\nThe work has practical and conceptual importance for both watermarking security and adversarial machine learning. By demonstrating that SR—a widely used tool in image processing—can be weaponized to bypass watermarking systems, it challenges the assumption that watermarking is inherently secure against high-quality image restoration. This raises urgent questions for watermarking designers about embedding strategies and robustness guarantees. The attack also contributes to the broader field of adversarial robustness by expanding the scope of threat models beyond traditional distortion-based attacks."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Lack of Theoretical Novelty and Methodological Depth\nThe framework relies heavily on off-the-shelf super-resolution (SR) models without introducing new architectures, loss functions, or theoretical insights. The attack pipeline is a straightforward adaptation of existing SR workflows (pre-degradation → SR → downscaling), which limits its conceptual contribution.\n2. Insufficient Empirical Validation and Ablation Studies\nThe experiments demonstrate effectiveness against state-of-the-art watermarking algorithms but lack critical ablation studies to validate the robustness of the attack.

For example, does aggressive JPEG compression (as used in prior attacks) outperform SRAttack in certain scenarios?\nAdd ablation experiments: Systematically test the attack under varying SR models, pre-degradation parameters, and scaling factors. For example, compare the effectiveness of Real-ESRGAN vs. diffusion-based SR models in watermark erasure.\n3.

However, the theoretical justification for this is underdeveloped.

The core mechanism of SRAttack is conceptually identical to methods used to remove adversarial perturbations, such as those from tools like Glaze, which are designed to protect artists from style mimicry. These perturbations, like invisible watermarks, are small, high-frequency signals embedded in an image. It has been demonstrated that simple and \"off-the-shelf\" techniques, including image downscaling/upscaling (a form of super-resolution), are highly effective at removing these perturbations.  The paper \"Adversarial Perturbations Cannot Reliably Protect Artists From Generative AI\" explicitly discusses how image upscaling is sufficient to bypass such protections.  This work predates the current submission and addresses the same fundamental problem: removing an unwanted, imperceptible signal via a reconstruction process. This paper fails to cite or discuss this entire line of work, and thus its central claim of novelty is unsubstantiated.\n2. The idea of using image restoration and super-resolution to \"purify\" images by removing adversarial signals has been explored for years in the context of adversarial defense.   These works operate on the same principle: adversarial perturbations move an image \"off\" the natural image manifold, and restoration techniques like SR can project it back \"onto\" the manifold, effectively removing the perturbation.  SRAttack is a direct application of this known principle to a different, but analogous, domain (watermarking) without sufficient acknowledgment or novel insight.\n3.  The paper claims SRAttack is a \"universal and efficient attack framework.\" However, the analysis lacks depth regarding why it works and where it might fail. The effectiveness relies on the assumption that the watermark is a fragile, high-frequency signal that a generic SR model will overwrite. It is not clear how this attack would fare against watermarks that are more robustly embedded in semantic features or across different frequency bands. The claim of universality seems too strong without a more rigorous theoretical or empirical analysis of its failure modes.\n\nReference: \nHönig, Robert, et al. \"Adversarial perturbations cannot reliably protect artists from generative ai.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.12027 (2024)."}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "bXLAxmFhgN", "forum": "i05MM4h1WZ", "replyto": "i05MM4h1WZ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15637/Reviewer_TMqM"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15637/Reviewer_TMqM"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15637/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761983838705, "cdate": 1761983838705, "tmdate": 1762925898234, "mdate": 1762925898234, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes SRAttack, a training-free attack on invisible image watermarking techniques.
