Existing benchmarks are often limited in the diversity of meta-features considered, leading to inconsistent model rankings and reduced generalizability. To address these issues, this study constructs a novel benchmark for tabular data classification and regression, designed with an explicit focus on two key, often competing, characteristics: Diversity and Efficiency. We propose a pipeline to quantitatively assess benchmark diversity and introduce a method for selecting a representative subset of datasets. Our results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark achieves superior diversity compared to existing alternatives while maintaining evaluation efficiency.

The authors argue that any single benchmark currently available to the academic community lacks diversity, while evaluating on all the benchmarks is very inefficient. The authors, therefore, frame the problem of building a new benchmark as the one that maximizes diversity, while maintaining maximal efficiency, reflected by the total number of datasets in the resulting benchmark. \n\nThe main unanswered question is, therefore, how to come up with a proxy metric that would describe the diversity of a benchmark. The authors first collect 112 diverse meta-features, describing various property of each dataset. Then, they filter these meta-features, to only leave the ones that have the highest relation to the ranking of 11 baseline methods. Then, authors propose a procedure which produces an estimate of ranking of 11 methods on a target benchmark, based on their performances on a source benchmark. To do this, authors select a subset of datasets from the source benchmark, which has the closest distance in meta-feature space to the target benchmark. They then use this subset to estimate average ranks of the baseline models on the target benchmark. The authors use MAE errors in estimating ranks to evaluate how good is the source benchmark at reflecting the diversity contained in the target benchmark. The authors use averaged difference in ranks across many established target benchmarks as a proxy for the diversity of a source benchmark. \n\nThe paper is not very clearly written, with many minor mistakes, which are described in the Weaknesses section. The main motivation behind my low score, however, comes from the disagreement with the idea of the proposed benchmark. The authors of the TabArena benchmark, for example, write “Most importantly, many datasets used in benchmarks are outdated, contain problematic licenses, do not represent real tabular data tasks, or are biased through data leaks”. The main motivation behind that benchmark, it seems, is to build a collection of datasets which are high in quality by the definition provided by the authors. In this paper, however, authors collect thousands of datasets from Kaggle, and use an automated LLM-based procedure to filter them. Therefore, the proposed benchmark takes a fundamentally opposite approach to the one of authors of TabArena, and, therefore, cannot be a replacement for it. Many other benchmarks also have some philosophy behind their filtration procedure, and cannot be replaced by a unified benchmark that lacks it, or, to some degree, takes an opposite approach. I will elaborate further in the weaknesses section. \n\nThis paper, however, has many positive contributions. The idea of estimating performance on one benchmark based on the performance on the source dataset is great, and can be useful in development to estimate performance on a variety of benchmarks quicker. I do, however, believe that any final evaluation should include full versions of the original benchmarks, since differences in ranking across different benchmarks have interpretable meaning, and are useful for researchers."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Figures 2 and 3 tell a story about relative similarity of different benchmarks."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The main weakness of this paper, for me, is that many current benchmarks represent a conflict of ideological approaches towards how a benchmark for Tabular ML should look. TabZilla takes the approach that only the hardest datasets need to be included, TabArena believes in the strict filtration and curation, TabReD believes that datasets need to be maximally realistic. I disagree that there is a need for one benchmark that fits all, instead, I believe we need a set of benchmarks, with a single benchmark corresponding to each idea. I also believe that the procedure described by the authors does not prevent datasets with data leakage from being included in the TabPalooza benchmark, and even encourages it. By maximizing diversity, we will include many datasets with problems in them, since ranking of baselines might change greatly on these datasets. I believe acceptance of the paper in its current form could lead to scientists optimizing their methods to abuse leaks or work better on some problematic datasets. In other words, I do believe that some minimal dataset filtering procedure performed by a human is necessary for any given benchmark, while this benchmark simply takes all available data in the tabular form and makes it into a dataset.\n\nThere are also several minor issues with writing, which did not greatly influence my score, but I would nevertheless like to point out some of them to help increase the quality of the paper.\n1.
