We introduce a unifying framework, Parameter-Efficient Subspace Optimization (PESO), which not only recovers many existing methods such as LoRA but also bridges them with the principled algorithmic and theoretical foundations of subspace optimization. This connection highlights a natural ``exploration--exploitation'' view of subspace methods, guiding the design of new algorithms that achieve strong convergence performance while still preserving memory efficiency. Importantly, our framework establishes the first convergence in the full-parameter space, resolving a critical gap in the current literature where low-rank updates lack such guarantees. We further instantiate the framework into a practical algorithm named PESO-LoRA, based on LoRA-type parameterization.

In Line 109-111, the authors claim that \"The resulting algorithm is, to our knowledge, the first memory-efficient method for LLM training with provable convergence to full-parameter optimality up to small errors, without additional assumptions such as explicit low-rankness of the solution.\" However, proir works have already established exact convergence rates for memory-efficient LLM training methods with standard or mild assumptions, including GoLore [arXiv:2410.11289] and LDAdam [arXiv:2410.16103], both of which were uploaded to arXiv one year ago. Consequently, given the non-diminishing convergence gap in Theorem 5.1 and the presence of these prior works, I highly disagree with this claim.\n2. The assumptions in the convergence analysis are too strong. Specifically, the approximation error $\\delta_k$ can diverge if the gradient $G_k$ diverges. The present proofs cannot exclude the case where $\\lim_\\{k\\rightarrow\\infty}\\delta_k=\\lim_\\{k\\rightarrow\\infty}\\\\|G_k\\\\|_F=\\infty$, and thus I believe Assumption 4 is a strong assumption.\n3. I think the improvements of PESO, as compared to the baselines in the experiments, are limited. Other subspace optimization algorithms such as GaLore [arXiv:2403.03507], GoLore [arXiv:2410.11289] , LDAdam [arXiv:2410.16103], Fira [arXiv:2410.01623] and Subtrack++ [arXiv:2502.01586] have similar memory efficiency and much stronger performance than LoRA.

The subspace minimization perspective is not new. This viewpoint has already been well established in GaLore [A1] and more recently revisited in Randomized Subspace Optimization (RSO) [A2]. In particular, the proposed framework in Equation (3) closely resembles RSO, where a low-rank variable $\\xi$ is obtained by solving a subproblem and then added back to the base parameter $W$. The authors are encouraged to clearly articulate the distinctions between their framework and the RSO algorithm.\n\n2. **Theoretical contribution**. The convergence analysis is weak and incomplete. Numerous existing works have provided both exact convergence guarantees and explicit convergence rates, such as RSO [A2], LDAdam [A3], SARA [A4], and RAC-LoRA [A5]. By contrast, the proposed algorithm only achieves convergence to a biased solution dependent on $\\delta$, without demonstrating exact convergence and convergence rates. This is a major concern regarding the paper’s theoretical rigor.\n\n3. **Experimental evaluation**. The empirical results are not comprehensive. The paper omits comparisons with recent strong baselines, including LDAdam, SARA, and RAC-LoRA, APPOLO [A6] which have demonstrated strong performance in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings.\n\n4. **Assumptions**. In Lines 127–136, the authors argue that prior works rely on unrealistic assumptions such as $r < m$ or random projections. However, Assumptions 4 and 5 in this paper are themselves non-standard and not commonly adopted in the literature. It is therefore unconvincing to claim that the present assumptions are more natural or milder than those in existing studies.\n\n[A1] GaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection\n\n[A2] A Memory Efficient Randomized Subspace Optimization Method for Training Large Language Models\n\n[A3] LDAdam: Adaptive Optimization from Low-Dimensional Gradient Statistics\n\n[A4] Breaking the Frozen Subspace: Importance Sampling for Low-Rank Optimization in LLM Pretraining\n\n[A5] Randomized Asymmetric Chain of LoRA: The First Meaningful Theoretical Framework for Low-Rank Adaptation\n\n[A6] APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance"}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Since the core theme of the paper revolves around exploration-exploitation, it would be natural to include targeted ablation studies, particularly examining the effects of restart frequency (K), rank (r), and related parameters.\n2. Although the paper positions itself as a unifying framework, it lacks in-depth discussion and comparison with key baselines in this area; notably GaLore [1] and other state-of-the-art methods.\n3. (Please correct me if I’m mistaken,) but M appears to be defined inconsistently; once as a projection map and elsewhere as a subspace. The notation would benefit from clearer, more consistent presentation. Additionally, there are minor grammatical issues (e.g., line 38: “Therefore, updating the entire …”).\n4. The alignment techniques are central to the proposed algorithm and should be discussed thoroughly in the main text, rather than being deferred to the appendix.\n5. The model is evaluated primarily against LoRA variants, but several recent strong baselines, including GaLore [1], APOLLO [2], LDAdam [3], FiRA [4], etc., are missing. Moreover, SubTrack++ [5], which also explores identifying optimal subspaces via geometric insights, appears conceptually related to the exploration phase and warrants discussion. \n6. The evaluation results are not fully convincing, as the mentioned baselines in point 5 typically outperform LoRA variants. This raises concerns about whether the proposed algorithms offer substantial improvements or meaningful advantages.\n7. The computational efficiency of the proposed methods is not addressed; in particular, time and memory costs should be analyzed, given that SVD operations are often computationally expensive.\n8. The proposed variants require clearer exposition in the main text, including detailed explanations and mathematical formulations of the optimizers and steps used in Algorithms 2 and 3. The current presentation includes repetitive content, while several important details are relegated to the appendix.\n\n\n---\n[1] Zhao et al., 2024.
