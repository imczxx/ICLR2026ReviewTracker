To further improve the performance of synthetic datasets, various training pipelines and optimization objectives have been proposed, greatly advancing the field of dataset distillation. Recent decoupled dataset distillation methods introduce soft labels and stronger data augmentation during the post-evaluation phase and scale dataset distillation up to larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K). However, this raises a question: Is accuracy still a reliable metric to fairly evaluate dataset distillation methods? Our empirical findings suggest that the performance improvements of these methods often stem from additional techniques rather than the inherent quality of the images themselves, with even randomly sampled images achieving superior results. Such misaligned evaluation settings severely hinder the development of DD. Therefore, we propose DD-Ranking, a unified evaluation framework, along with new general evaluation metrics to uncover the true performance improvements achieved by different methods. By refocusing on the actual information enhancement of distilled datasets, DD-Ranking provides a more comprehensive and fair evaluation standard for future research advancements.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["dataset distillation", "benchmark"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/658df7fc129857060184765fa11b7ca3bc116b45.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper first observes that existing dataset distillation approaches adopt inconsistent evaluation protocols, differing in their use of label types (e.g., fixed hard/soft labels or per-image soft labels), data augmentation strategies, etc. To enable a fair comparison across methods, the authors propose a unified benchmark along with two new evaluation metrics, LRS and ARS, designed to be robust against variations in the use of label types and augmentation techniques.

The benchmark focuses on two proposed metrics: label-robust score and augmentation-robust score.\nAs summarized in Table 1, existing DD methods differ significantly in their use of labels (hard vs. soft labels, and whether soft labels come from a fully-trained teacher or are jointly optimized during distillation) and augmentations (e.g., resize-crop, patch-shuffle, cutmix). These differences make direct comparison of DD methods difficult. The paper argues that prior evaluations, which each use their own label and augmentation setups, are unfair and inconsistent.\nTo address this, the authors propose:\n* Label-robust score: compares the accuracy of distilled data versus random selection under the same label setting (e.g., both using hard labels or the same soft labels). \n* Augmentation-robust score: compares distilled data versus random selection under the same augmentation setting (e.g., same augmentation type or no augmentation). \n\nThe proposed benchmark aims to standardize evaluation conditions and reveal the true contribution of the distilled images themselves, separate from the effects of labels or augmentations."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "* The paper provides a meaningful attempt to standardize the evaluation of dataset distillation methods, enabling a more controlled comparison against random selection under matched label and augmentation setups. \n* The results highlight interesting findings: under hard-label usage, matching-based DD methods remain stronger than recent soft-label–based approaches, suggesting that much of the improvement in newer methods (e.g., SRe2L) may stem from knowledge distillation rather than from the intrinsic quality of the synthetic images."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* Limited applicability of the metric: Although the proposed metrics allow comparisons under matched label/augmentation setups, they do not measure the ultimate achievable performance of each DD method under its best hyperparameter and setup choices.

It is unclear how these two scores should be used jointly or whether they could be unified into a single, more interpretable evaluation measure. \n* Limited scope beyond image classification: The paper focuses solely on image classification.
