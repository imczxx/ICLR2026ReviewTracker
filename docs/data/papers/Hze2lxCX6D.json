However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics, principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising avenue by training agents on  large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns an optimal, regularized $Q$-function via flow matching during training. At inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining. Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value learning into offline RL.", "tldr": "We introduce EVOR, a scalable offline RL method that leverages expressive value learning and flow matching to train large policies without gradients, distillation, or BPTT.", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "distributional reinforcement learning", "temporal difference learning", "flow matching"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7544ae8b2bb73b87483fdd082aae17acbf16900f.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9cfc732d1f97219d8004f25f5e4d8ebb4cd8efa5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work presents a generative offline RL algorithm, which avoids policy distillation and backpropagation through time during policy optimization.

The authors introduce three heterogeneous axes for scaling offline RL in the introduction: the data, model, and computing. However, the primary results in the paper mainly consider the inference-time scaling property. Offline trajectories often involve multi-modal, sub-optimal behaviors from unknown policies, which makes it hard for the model to learn such diverse behaviors with limited scalability.

The authors clearly identify the scalability bottlenecks in prior generative-policy offline RL methods—specifically the reliance on BPTT or distillation.

EVOR’s rejection-sampling-based policy extraction (Algorithm 2, Eq. 22) allows scalable test-time optimization without retraining. The mechanism directly leverages the expressive Q function and supports compute scaling via N_\\pi and temperature parameters (τ_R, τ_Q), which are empirically validated. EVOR’s inference-time scaling shows performance increasing monotonically with compute, aligning well with scaling-law intuition in modern generative RL systems. This feature enhances real-world deployability in compute-flexible settings.\n- Empirical results show benefit.

The construction of the value function in EVOR essentially follows the same principle as \"Q♯: Provably Optimal Distributional RL for LLM Post-training\", which estimates Q^*(x,a) by sampling reward-to-go values and applying a softmax/log-sum-exp aggregation. The only difference is that EVOR learns the reward-to-go distribution via flow matching, but this idea is already very similar to TD-Flow (Farebrother et al., 2025) and Intention-Conditioned Flow Occupancy Models (ICFOM), which also learn value functions from offline data using flow-based velocity fields. Hence, the claimed contribution is incremental rather than conceptually novel.\n- Restricted to KL-regularized RL formulation. EVOR is derived specifically under the KL-regularized RL objective, which is known to suffer from over-conservatism due to the KL divergence (penalizing exploration beyond the dataset distribution). This limitation may constrain the method’s ability to generalize to other regularizers (e.g., support-based ones) or to handle cases where mild extrapolation beyond the offline data is beneficial.\n- Dependence on rejection sampling for policy extraction. The learned Q(s,a) is only utilized through rejection-sampling-based policy extraction, which makes the method heavily reliant on the quality of the offline dataset. When the offline data are suboptimal or sparse in high-value regions, rejection sampling cannot meaningfully exceed the dataset performance, since all sampled actions originate from the base policy. This limits EVOR’s applicability in low-quality or diverse-data regimes, where gradient-based policy improvement or explicit policy learning may be preferable.\n- Comparative scope is narrow. Experiments are restricted to QC baselines and only on OGBench datasets. Other recent scalable offline RL approaches (e.g., Flow Q-Learning) are missing. Since EVOR’s main claim is “scalability,” benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods beyond QC would strengthen the empirical case."}, "questions": {"value": "Since the paper emphasizes Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning, could the authors further validate the effectiveness of Expressive Value Learning on the D4RL MuJoCo datasets?
