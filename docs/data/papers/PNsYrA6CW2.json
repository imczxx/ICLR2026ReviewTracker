Motivated by this, SSL has also emerged as a promising methodology in the molecular domain, which has unique challenges such as high sensitivity to subtle structural changes and scaffold splits, thereby requiring strong generalization ability. However, existing SSL-based approaches have been predominantly evaluated by naïve fine-tuning performance. For a more diagnostic analysis of generalizability beyond fine-tuning, we introduce a multi-perspective evaluation framework for molecular SSL under a unified experimental setting, varying only the pretraining strategies. We assess the quality of learned representations via linear probing on frozen encoders, measure Pretrain Gain by comparison against random initialization, quantify forgetting during fine-tuning, and explore scalability. Experimental results show that several models, surprisingly, exhibit low or even negative Pretrain Gain in linear probing. Graph neural network-based models experience substantial parameter shifts, and most models derive negligible benefits from larger pretraining datasets.

Hybrid approaches further complicate the analysis rather than clarifying it.\n        - This makes it impossible to determine whether performance differences arise from the architecture choice, the pretraining strategy, the input modality, or some interaction between them. This severely limits the ability to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of pretraining strategies themselves.\n    - The authors do not control for model capacity in a principled manner:\n        - Fixing hidden dimension to 300 across all models does not ensure fair comparison. Hidden dimension means different things for different architectures (e.g., Transformer attention heads vs. GNN message passing dimension).\n        - The appropriate comparison would control for total parameter count, not hidden dimension.\n    - Critical regularization details (weight decay, dropout rates, etc.) are not discussed, and it's unclear whether these were controlled across models or left at their original paper-specific settings:\n        - These have major impact on fine-tuning behavior and the parameter shift metric.\n        - This omission makes it difficult to interpret the results or reproduce the experiments.\n- The parameter shift metric (Eq. 2) is seriously flawed:\n    - It sums L2 distances across all parameters, making it fundamentally incomparable across models with different architectures.\n    - Models have different parameter counts, yet the metric is an absolute sum.\n    - Parameters have different scales across architectures (e.g., normalization layers vs. weight matrices).\n    - Weight decay and other regularization techniques significantly affect this metric, yet are not discussed.\n    - Reparameterizations that produce identical functional outputs yield different shift values. For example, consider a simple model $f(x, W) = \\text{LN}(xW)$. Both $f(x, W)$ and $f(x, cW)$ (where $c$ is a constant) produce the same output, but have different parameter shift values.\n    - The correlation shown in Figure 7 between parameter shift and performance gap does not validate the metric's utility for cross-model comparison.\n    - A better approach: use functional similarity metrics such as CKA or CCA on hold-out embeddings from pretrained vs. fine-tuned models, which are architecture-agnostic and measure what matters---representation similarity.\n- The regression results have significant presentation issues:\n    - Tables 11-16 appear to average MSE across datasets with different target scales, which is meaningless as MSE values for different regression tasks are not comparable.\n    - Further, because the scales of the targets and MSEs are different, it's much harder to interpret all the other results for regression (e.g., pretrain gain figure).\n    - Finally, there seems to be a reversal of linear probing trends for regression versus classification. This is interesting but not discussed adequately (please see my question about this below).\n- While linear probing is a reasonable metric to include in such a study, its utility for evaluating representation quality in deep pretrained models is questionable:\n    - Linear probing evaluates whether frozen representations are directly applicable to downstream tasks with minimal adaptation (i.e., only a linear or shallow classifier). However, in modern deep learning (vision, NLP, etc.), adapter-based methods and LoRA consistently extract substantially more performance from the same pretrained models while maintaining comparable parameter efficiency. This suggests that the ability to perform well under linear probing is not strongly indicative of the overall quality or usefulness of learned representations---rather, it reflects one specific (and arguably limited) notion of representation utility.\n    - An interesting alternative direction would have been to evaluate these models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA alongside (or instead of) linear probing, as this might provide more reliable insights into representation quality.\n- The model scaling experiments are underdeveloped:\n    - The main paper focuses primarily on data scaling but appears to also have conducted model scaling experiments with the hidden dimension 1200 results (Table 17).\n    - If extensive model scaling experiments were done, it would be good to present them in a similar manner to the data scaling experiments: Create a visualization showing performance as a function of model size at fixed data size.\n    - If the full grid of model sizes and data sizes have been explored, then some visualization of the full scaling surface would be valuable (perhaps some sort of Pareto front analysis).\n    - The existing model scaling results should be better integrated into the main discussion.\n- Many figures have poor aspect ratios that impede readability (Figures 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10)."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
