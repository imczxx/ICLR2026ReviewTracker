This design enables targeted simplification of complex expressions, improved generalization performance, and reduced computational overhead through adaptive LLM utilization.\nExperiments on eight synthetic benchmark functions and five real-world regression datasets demonstrate that ALEGP achieves superior accuracy and interpretability while requiring 50–60\\% fewer LLM interventions than fixed-schedule strategies.

Many factors in EA and GP (e.g., population size, expression length, operator sets, crossover/mutation parameters) can be adapted during evolution, and the entire process is dynamic. Additionally, the manuscript contains repetitive statements; for example, the phrase “suffer from bloat and local optima” appears multiple times on pages 1 and 2. The writing could be refined for clarity and conciseness.\n\nBoth GP and LLMs are computationally expensive. Since the proposed method incorporates both, its efficiency is questionable. The paper lacks a theoretical and experimental complexity analysis, even though the authors acknowledge that their approach may be more complex than standard GP methods. Furthermore, compared with current SOTA GP methods, a rigorous cost–benefit evaluation is missing.\n\nThe idea of leveraging LLMs for GP is straightforward. As the approach merely combines existing techniques, and the difficulty of integrating them is not clearly demonstrated, the contribution appears limited.\n\nThe experiments only compare the proposed method (under several LLMs) against a basic GP baseline. Including more competitive sota GP methods that address similar issues (bloat, local optima, etc.) would strengthen the experimental validation. Moreover, the paper does not justify why integrating LLMs is necessary, or whether existing SR approaches could achieve similar improvements without LLMs.\n\nThe analysis of the LLM’s role and failure modes in symbolic regression is superficial. Understanding these limitations is essential for the community to further advance this direction.\n\nAlthough the paper reports MSE results from GPT-4o-mini, Llama3, and Gemini2, it fails to deeply analyze how LLM architectures or parameter scales influence performance. \n\nThe concept of interpretability in the title is not well supported by the methodology.

Is there any cost–benefit analysis that quantifies performance gains relative to the total computational budget, including LLM query overhead?

If so, would the proposed framework still significantly outperform a non-LLM GP hybrid?\n\nThe experimental evaluation is limited to comparisons with basic GP implementations. To demonstrate the claimed improvements, it would be important to include strong SOTA GP baselines that specifically target bloat, premature convergence, and related challenges.\n\nAlthough the paper compares several LLM models within its framework, the conclusions drawn about their impact are unclear.

The use of deep learning models, particularly Transformers, for Symbolic Regression has become a major research direction, yielding many strong results (e.g., DSR, NeSymReS, E2E, SymbolicGPT).

The paper proposes a system with multiple complex components but does not clearly highlight its single most crucial contribution. Beyond the high-level concept of \"using LLMs in GP,\" what is the primary innovation? Is it the adaptive scheduler, the multi-island co-evolutionary framework, or the LLM prompting strategy? The authors are encouraged to more clearly delineate and summarize the paper's contributions in a hierarchical manner to help readers grasp the key takeaways.\n3. The proposed method lacks necessary details regarding its LLM integration. The quality of an LLM's output is highly dependent on prompt design, hyperparameters like temperature, and the provided context. The paper should specify the exact prompt templates, key parameter settings, and few-shot examples used to guide the LLMs. Furthermore, the paper does not discuss how the reliability of the LLM output is ensured. For instance, LLMs can occasionally generate syntactically incorrect or mathematically nonsensical expressions. The authors should detail whether a validation mechanism exists to handle such illegal outputs and report on the frequency of these failure cases, which is crucial for assessing the method's robustness.\n4.  The results reveal an interesting phenomenon: different LLMs perform disparately on different types of datasets (e.g., GPT-4o-mini excels on synthetic data but its performance degrades on real-world data, while Gemini-2 shows the opposite trend). This is a finding worthy of in-depth discussion, yet the current paper offers no analysis. What are the underlying reasons? Is it due to the models' mathematical reasoning, generalization capabilities, or other factors? Additionally, the synthetic benchmark functions used are often classic problems whose forms and solutions may well be part of the LLMs' vast training data. The authors need to discuss the potential risk of data leakage for these synthetic benchmarks.\n5.

In addition to that the paper makes an even more problematic statement that “larger enclosed areas indicate better performance,” but this interpretation is not valid in this context. Radar plots are only meaningful when the axes represent ordered or conceptually continuous dimensions, whereas the six datasets here are independent and unordered (note that if the order is changed, I can manipulate the area of the plots). The area enclosed by the plot depends heavily on the arbitrary arrangement of the axes and the geometric distortions introduced by the circular layout, rather than reflecting any true aggregate measure of performance.
