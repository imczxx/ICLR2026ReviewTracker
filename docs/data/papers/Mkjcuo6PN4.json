Traditional methods often ignore the biological spike characteristics of brain activity and find it difficult to reveal the dynamic dependencies and causal interactions between brain regions, limiting their effectiveness in brain function research and clinical applications. To address this issue, we propose a Spike-based Digital Brain (Spike-DB), a novel fundamental model that introduces the spike computing paradigm into brain time series modeling for the first time. Spike-DB encodes fMRI signals as spike trains and learns the temporal driving relationships between anchor and target regions to achieve high-precision prediction of brain activity and reveal underlying causal dependencies and dynamic relationship characteristics. Based on Spike-DB, we further conducted downstream tasks including brain disease classification, abnormal brain region identification, and effective connectivity inference. Experimental results on real-world epilepsy datasets and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset show that Spike-DB outperforms existing mainstream methods in both prediction accuracy and downstream tasks, demonstrating its broad potential in clinical applications and brain science research.", "tldr": "We propose the Spike-based Digital Brain, which enables high accuracy brain activity prediction and assists in brain disease classification, abnormal brain region detection, and effective connectivity inference.", "keywords": ["Brain activity", "Fundamental model", "Spike computing", "fMRI prediction", "Brain diseases."], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/39fd727de4b5ac6630e9051427a809868f745215.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes **Spike-DB**, a spike-based computing framework for modeling fMRI data.

The paper’s core claim is to “encode fMRI signals as spike trains.” However, fMRI BOLD signals are slow hemodynamic measures (around 1 Hz), not neural spikes (around 10-1000 Hz). Compared with fMRI, which has low temporal resolution, spike-based computing is more suitable for modalities with high temporal resolution, such as iEEG or EEG. How do the authors justify the biological meaning of such a design when applied to fMRI data?  \n\n2. The model uses generic spike encoders and decoders without linking parameters (τ_m, τ_s, thresholds) to realistic neural biophysics or cortical circuitry. Claims of “biological interpretability” are therefore not well supported.\n\n3. The authors claim that they are the first to introduce the spike computing paradigm into brain time-series modeling. However, earlier works have treated fMRI data as spike trains, though in slightly different ways, for example:  \n   [a] Kasabov, Nikola K., Maryam Gholami Doborjeh, and Zohreh Gholami Doborjeh. *“Mapping, learning, visualization, classification, and understanding of fMRI data in the NeuCube evolving spatiotemporal data machine of spiking neural networks.”* IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems 28.4 (2016): 887–899.  \n   Hence, this claim should be softened.  \n\n4. The authors fix the number of anchor regions to 89 out of 90 total, leaving only one region to predict. This setup trivializes the prediction task, as each region is almost self-predictive given its high autocorrelation.  \n\n5. Minor differences (about 1-2%) are presented as “state of the art,” which is not statistically justified. Standard deviations should also be reported to assess robustness across random seeds.  \n\n6. The paper reports disease classification results based on the learned spike representations, but the implementation details of this task are not clearly described. It is unclear whether a multi-layer perceptron, a linear classifier, or another model was used, and whether the SNN backbone was frozen or fine-tuned during training. The paper also omits details such as the loss function, optimization setup, and evaluation protocol. Clarifying these aspects and reporting variance across runs would strengthen the reproducibility and reliability of the classification results.  \n\n7. Only one public dataset and one collected dataset are used for evaluation, making it difficult to demonstrate the method’s generalization and reliability. More publicly available datasets should be included to evaluate the proposed approach.  \n\n8. The authors replace causal modeling with simple perturbation differences. Whether these results correlate with true causal effects needs to be carefully justified.  \n\n9.

Optimal performance is achieved when $K$ = 89 out of 90 total ROIs, leaving 'only one target region'. This suggests the model is highly optimized for a very specific 'predict-one-from-all' task, not a general masking strategy. This high sensitivity is confirmed by the ablation study, which shows performance 'deteriorates significantly' as K decreases ($K$ < 45, as shown in subsection 3.6), raising concerns about the model's practical flexibility.\n- To fully understand the practical trade-offs of the proposed method, an analysis of the computational overhead is required.
