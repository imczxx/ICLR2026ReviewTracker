Although various methods have been proposed to restore a watermarked image to the original image, these methods are model-dependent. In this study, we propose a model-agnostic watermarked image restoration method that requires no additional training. The proposed method first extracts a message from a watermarked image and embeds the same message into the watermarked image. Then, our method computes a watermark component as the subtraction between the watermarked image and the double watermarked image. Finally, the proposed method generates a restored image by subtracting the watermark component from the watermarked image because the watermark component has a high correlation with the subtraction between the watermarked image and the original image. Experimental results show that the proposed method obtains a restored image with higher image quality for 10 of 11 existing watermarking methods. Furthermore, we have extended the existing eight methods and added a re-watermarking function that updates an embedded watermark with another watermark.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["post-processing watermarking", "image restoration", "watermark removal", "image quality"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/734dd97dcb9d7c29c1dcdc6d27a7d163010065d1.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3d8369628440524060e243c7b066a2b9a30719a6.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a model-agnostic watermarked image restoration method, which aims to address the issue that post-processing image watermarking technology causes quality degradation and information loss in the original image.

Fundamentally, the method operates under a strict white-box setting: The user must possess the same embedder and  message m. This requirement contradicts the threat models of many generic watermark removal attacks, such as DiffAtt (Zhao et al., 2024) and Watermark Steganalysis (Yang et al., 2024), which often deal with black-box scenarios where the embedder/message is inaccessible. Furthermore, the proposed restoration method can only be applied to post-processing watermarking, and not to in-processing watermarking. Please clarify these scope boundaries more explicitly.\n- **Fairness of Baseline Comparison (White-Box vs. Black-Box/Grey-Box):**  The comparison pits a white-box recovery method against generic attack methods designed for black-box or grey-box settings, specifically DiffAtt (Zhao et al., 2024) and WmStg (Yang et al., 2024). White-box methods inherently hold a significant information advantage, leading to expectedly higher image quality metrics. Please analyze this discrepancy more carefully.\n- **Weak Theoretical Foundation for Watermark Component Correlation:**  The core approximation supporting the method is the high correlation assumption:  $W(I_{\\text{orig}}, m) \\approx \\alpha \\cdot W(I_{\\text{wm}}, m)$. However, the watermark component W often results from complex or non-linear operations, such as deep learning models or complex frequency transformations. While the paper presents visualizations demonstrating the components' similarity, it lacks formal mathematical proof or boundary analysis to guarantee the robustness of this crucial approximate linear relationship across diverse and non-linear watermark embedders.

No offense to this work and any other work in this area, but in our humble opinion, the watermarking restoration methods which aims to fight against quality degradation and information loss might fall into a wrong path for real-world application. Since most of the post-processing watermarking methods are used for protection or generally speaking, they act as a unique stamp to prove something (belong to whom or whether it is generated by AI etc.). Therefore, we might raise two point: first, keeping the watermarking exist is vital for most of the time (unless you are the attacker who want to bypass the watermark and use the image illegally), and second, quality degradation and information loss might not be a vital problem (unless there are severe degradation, but in recent years, most watermarking methods achieves satisfying visual quality). Therefore, we are appreciating more on the part where the author tries to become an attacker who remove the watermark and add a new one.
