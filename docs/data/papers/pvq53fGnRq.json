The theory elegantly justifies correcting numerical error to improve fidelity by moving the generation towards an HR target. However, the proposed blind SR method does the exact opposite: it pushes the generation away from the LR condition to ostensibly improve perception. This sign-flipping feels less like a principled application of the core theory and more like a clever but ad-hoc heuristic that happens to yield perceptually pleasing results. The paper lacks a convincing theoretical argument for why this maneuver should work consistently.\n\nThis leads to my second point regarding the \"plug-and-play\" and \"no-training\" claims, which I find to be overstated. The method's reliance on a calibration step (Algorithm 1) using a set of LR-HR pairs is a form of data-driven parameter tuning. This undermines the \"no-training\" narrative and raises questions about generalization. A single guidance scale A calibrated on one dataset may not be robust across diverse image domains.\n\nFurthermore, the paper does not sufficiently address the inherent risks of its approach. Pushing the generation away from the LR input is a fundamentally unstable process that could easily introduce artifacts or hallucinate details inconsistent with the source. A thorough analysis of these failure modes is conspicuously absent. Finally, the empirical validation is quite narrow. Claiming a general framework for \"posterior diffusion SR\" while testing on only a single backbone model (ResShift) weakens the paper's claims of broad applicability."}, "questions": {"value": "The sign-flipped guidance is the linchpin of your practical method, yet its theoretical grounding seems to be the weakest part of the paper. Could you elaborate on the justification for this? Specifically, what prevents this \"push away from LR\" from simply amplifying noise or creating implausible structures, rather than consistently enhancing perceptual quality?\n\nThe \"plug-and-play\" claim hinges on the robustness of the calibrated scale A. How does the method's performance hold up when A is calibrated on one domain (e.g., natural images) and tested on a completely different one (e.g., medical scans, cartoons)? This is crucial for understanding the method's true generalizability.\n\nA complete picture of an algorithm's performance includes its limitations. Could you provide a qualitative analysis of failure cases? It would be particularly insightful to see instances where the perceptual enhancement introduces clear artifacts or generates textures that are inconsistent with the LR input, as this would help clarify the method's trade-offs.\n\nI am open to reconsidering my evaluation should the authors provide convincing answers to these questions in their rebuttal."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ThSfo0uzVz", "forum": "pvq53fGnRq", "replyto": "pvq53fGnRq", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14514/Reviewer_zA8j"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14514/Reviewer_zA8j"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14514/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762056176913, "cdate": 1762056176913, "tmdate": 1762924908618, "mdate": 1762924908618, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a plug-and-play framework for posterior diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR), enabling controllable image quality without retraining.
