The method applies specifically to graphon models and depends on smoothness and exchangeability assumptions. It is unclear how the proposed theoretical framework or random-imputation idea would extend to broader classes of network models (e.g., latent-space, temporal, or sparsified networks). Thus the paper’s claims of general applicability thus seem overstated.\n(2)\tEmpirical impact. The experimental gains over ECV are modest. In Table 1, SAS and ICE show no meaningful improvement, suggesting that differences arise mainly from estimator robustness rather than from the proposed validation method. In real-world datasets, results are essentially tied on three of four networks. Only the drug–disease network shows a visible advantage, which is not analyzed in depth. Without more in-depth analysis demonstrating the impact of ECV bias, it is difficult to conclude that the differences are practically important.\n(3)\tEfficiency gains. Although Figure 3 shows a computational speed-up relative to ECV, the paper does not provide an asymptotic complexity comparison. Moreover, the statistical efficiency results in Figure 5 are averaged across all graphon models and may be dominated by the weaker performance of NS and USVT, making it hard to assess whether the gains are consistent or meaningful across settings."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "mfbFxDfKMg", "forum": "8J3GTeQmwl", "replyto": "8J3GTeQmwl", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15109/Reviewer_NTvL"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15109/Reviewer_NTvL"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15109/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762097757138, "cdate": 1762097757138, "tmdate": 1762925431126, "mdate": 1762925431126, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes CV-imputation, a cross-validation method for selecting graphon-based models on network data.
