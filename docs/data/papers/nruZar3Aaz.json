However, state-of-the-art video diffusion models frequently produce implausible results such as momentum violations and object interpenetrations. Existing physics-aware approaches often rely on task-specific fine-tuning or supervised data, which limits their scalability and applicability. To address the challenge, we present PhyMAGIC, a training-free framework that generates physically consistent motion from a single image. PhyMAGIC integrates a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model, confidence-guided reasoning via large language models (LLMs), and a differentiable physics simulator to produce 3D assets ready for downstream physical simulation without fine-tuning or manual supervision. By iteratively refining motion prompts using LLM-derived confidence scores and leveraging simulation feedback, PhyMAGIC steers generation toward physically consistent dynamics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PhyMAGIC outperforms state-of-the-art video generators and physics-aware baselines, enhancing physical property inference and motion–text alignment while maintaining visual fidelity.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Dynamic Generation", "Phyical Priors", "Physical Simulation", "LLM Reasoning", "MPM Simulation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/af1594b19fb1335afb9429816fc8f2f5c4f00a74.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents PhyMAGIC, a training-free framework that enables physically consistent 3D motion generation and physical property inference from a single static image. Unlike prior diffusion-based or physics-embedded models that require task-specific training, PhyMAGIC integrates three pretrained components—a video diffusion model (CogVideoX), a large language model (GPT-4o) for physics reasoning, and a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) simulator—into a unified, closed-loop system. The framework iteratively refines motion generation through confidence-guided LLM feedback, where low-confidence physical attributes (e.g., density, elasticity, friction) trigger targeted prompt updates and new motion synthesis. The refined videos and inferred parameters are then validated and corrected via differentiable simulation, forming a reasoning–generation cycle that progressively improves physical plausibility without any fine-tuning or supervision.\n\nComprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as PhysGaussian, PhysGen, and various real-world single-image scenes show that PhyMAGIC achieves superior performance in both semantic and physical consistency compared to state-of-the-art video generation and physics-aware baselines. It enhances text–motion alignment (up to 16% CLIP similarity improvement) and maintains high visual fidelity while being more computationally efficient—over ten times faster than trained counterparts. Overall, the paper contributes a novel and generalizable approach that bridges LLM reasoning, diffusion-based video synthesis, and differentiable physics simulation to realize physically grounded, interpretable, and scalable dynamic generation from minimal visual input."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper introduces a conceptually elegant and practically valuable approach that unifies pretrained video diffusion models, large language model reasoning, and differentiable physics simulation into a closed-loop pipeline. This design enables physical property inference and motion synthesis from a single static image without any task-specific fine-tuning or annotated data, which is a notable advance in the direction of scalable physics-aware generation.\n2. The authors provide clear physical intuition for the design choices. The observation that different motion trajectories reveal distinct levels of physical evidence (e.g., a squeeze motion discloses elasticity better than free fall) is both physically grounded and conceptually insightful, forming a solid theoretical backbone for the proposed iterative reasoning framework.\n3. The explicit use of interpretable physical parameters (density, elasticity, yield stress, etc.) also makes the model’s behavior more transparent compared to end-to-end black-box video diffusion systems."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The paper does not include supplementary videos or visual demonstrations, which are crucial for evaluating a method that claims improvements in physical realism and motion plausibility. From the static figures alone, it is difficult to fully assess the perceptual quality and physical consistency of the generated dynamics. In particular, Figure 5 lacks ground-truth visualizations, making it hard to judge whether the proposed approach indeed performs better than the baselines in practice. The authors are strongly encouraged to provide additional qualitative video results for clearer evaluation.\n2. Several figures are visually coarse and fail to clearly convey the intended comparisons or architectural design. For example, Figure 1 and Figure 3 appear somewhat rough and could be redrawn with more precise annotations or higher-quality visuals. Moreover, the paper does not explain clearly how the baselines are re-implemented or compared. A more transparent comparison protocol would strengthen the credibility of the experimental results.\n3. The experimental section compares PhyMAGIC mainly against earlier open-source baselines such as CogVideoX, PhysDreamer, and Physics3D, but omits several state-of-the-art commercial or research-level models, including Wan 2.2, Sora, and Veo. Given the rapid progress in video generation, evaluating against these newer and higher-performing models would provide a fairer and more convincing benchmark for the claimed advances.\n4. The core component of PhyMAGIC relies on the assumption that large language models can accurately infer physical parameters (e.g., density, Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio) from limited visual cues. However, the experimental results do not strongly support this assumption. As shown in Table 8, even after multiple refinement iterations, the predicted physical values often deviate from ground truth by one or more orders of magnitude. This raises concerns about the robustness and reliability of LLM-based physical inference.\n5. While the framework leverages pretrained video diffusion models to synthesize motion evidence, current video generation models themselves often suffer from physical inconsistency, such as non-conservation of momentum and unrealistic object interactions. Relying on such imperfect priors may limit the upper bound of PhyMAGIC’s physical realism, especially when the diffusion model introduces visually plausible but physically implausible trajectories."}, "questions": {"value": "The author did not include the code in the Supplementary Material.

My understanding is that rendering videos from 3D Gaussians is the final objective, with the video primarily serving as a source of physical information. In that case, is a video generation model truly necessary? Could the physical quantities instead be provided directly by an LLM’s prior knowledge or manually specified by humans? Would this affect the final results? Overall, the connection between video generation and 3D rendering feels quite disconnected.\n\n2.\tPrior works such as DreamPhysics, PhyDreamer, and Physics3D also combine video generation with physics simulators. Could you elaborate more specifically on what the distinct contributions of this work are compared to them? Overall, I think the framework is quite similar.\n\n3.\tSince the Trellis model is used, the system can only generate single-object videos. It cannot handle scenes with backgrounds or objects of higher complexity and realism. For instance, PhysCtrl（NeurIPS25）, which also integrates a simulator with video generation, can produce more complex and natural video results.\n\n4.\tThe rendered outputs suffer from the inherent granularity of Gaussians, leading to a noticeable lack of sharpness and fine details — for example, in the wolf case, most detail is lost in later frames.
