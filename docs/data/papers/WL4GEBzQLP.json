Existing methods suffer from reliance on multi-metric supervision and the role-specific encoding required for triplet loss computation, resulting in inefficient computation. To overcome these issues, we move beyond pairwise modeling and propose a novel representation learning framework to achieve efficient and robust trajectory similarity computation, named Hyper2Edge. Hyper2Edge consists of three main components: (i) Hypergraph-based modeling to represent trajectories as hyperedges, instead of single nodes, preserving sequential and structural details; (ii) Hierarchical trajectory representation learning to capture intra- and inter-trajectory patterns; and (iii) A weighted top-$k$ InfoNCE loss to focus on nearest-neighbor relations, addressing the inefficiencies of triplet loss. Evaluated on two public benchmarks, Hyper2Edge achieves an average improvement of 12.8\\% in accuracy and reduces total training time by 55.6\\% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The paper employs a weighted top-$k$ InfoNCE loss instead of the triplet loss to mitigate repetitive encoding, it has similarities to the approach presented in KGTS. Besides, they do not provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity and do not give any efficiency experiments comparing the InfoNCE loss and the triplet loss.\n\nW2: In Section 3.3, the authors claim that the proposed weighted top-$k$ InfoNCE loss enables each trajectory to comprehensively model its similarity relationships with the entire dataset. However, because the top-$k$ weighting reduces non-neighbor contributions to near zero, the loss does not truly incorporate global information and remains fundamentally a locally focused loss.\n\nW3: In Section OVERALL PERFORMANCE (RQ1), previous studies have evaluated model performance using various distance metrics. In contrast, this paper reports results only under Euclidean distance. Consequently, the current experimental results cannot comprehensively assess the model's performance. Additional experiments with alternative distance metrics, such as DTW, Hausdorff, ERP, and EDR, would provide a more complete and convincing evaluation.\n\nW4: Previous studies commonly report performance across multiple distance metrics to achieve a more comprehensive evaluation. However, they can also report results under a single metric (e.g., Euclidean distance). Therefore, the statements in Section Efficiency Evaluation (RQ3)—\"other methods must repeat the entire training process for multiple metrics\" and \"For baselines: (Time per Epoch) × 100 Epochs × 3 Metrics\"— are inaccurate. To ensure a fair comparison of efficiency, the baseline models should also be evaluated under a single distance metric rather than three.\n\nW5: In Section Ablation Study (RQ4), this paper replaces the InfoNCE loss with the MSE loss to demonstrate the effectiveness of the weighted top-$k$ InfoNCE loss. However, since the paper frequently compares the triplet loss with the InfoNCE loss, it may be more reasonable to use the triplet loss as a variant without weighted top-k InfoNCE loss instead of MSE loss."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see W1-W5."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "igPcipUtrn", "forum": "WL4GEBzQLP", "replyto": "WL4GEBzQLP", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6459/Reviewer_Kq1G"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6459/Reviewer_Kq1G"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6459/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761783103172, "cdate": 1761783103172, "tmdate": 1762918848275, "mdate": 1762918848275, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles trajectory similarity computation and the inefficiencies of pairwise/triplet-based supervision.
