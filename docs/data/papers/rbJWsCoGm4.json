However, many of these models rely on transformer backbones, making their effectiveness constrained by the cost of processing the input context. The quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length imposes a fundamental trade-off on existing designs: they must either preserve high-frequency information using point-wise embeddings, which is computationally expensive for long sequences, or employ patch-based embeddings to reduce sequence length at the risk of discarding critical temporal details. To overcome this limitation, we present TimeSqueeze, a hybrid forecasting architecture that combines the strengths of both point and patch embeddings through dynamic time series compression. TimeSqueeze introduces a novel two-stage hybrid representation: (1) a lightweight state-space encoder processes the full-resolution time series with point-wise embeddings to extract fine-grained temporal features, and (2) an adaptive patching module intelligently prunes these features using variable-sized patches, assigning smaller patches to information-rich regions and larger patches to redundant segments. This hybrid approach yields a variable-resolution representation that preserves critical temporal details while reducing computational overhead. By retaining the fidelity of point embeddings and the efficiency of patch embeddings, the resulting compressed sequence enables the Transformer backbone to substantially reduce the input length without sacrificing forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSqueeze achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance while delivering substantial computational advantages, including up to $8\\times$ improvement in pretraining data efficiency and up to $20\\times$ reduction in pretraining time compared to equivalent point-embedding models.", "tldr": "TimeSqueeze combines fine-grained point embeddings with dynamic variable-size patch embeddings to deliver optimal time series forecasting performance per computational budget.", "keywords": ["foundation models", "time series forecasting", "dynamic patching", "conext compression", "efficient forecasting"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/76674560f3acd75702da9a0c4698ee481ca484cb.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes TimeSqueeze, a hybrid forecasting architecture that fuses point-wise and dynamic, content-aware patch-wise representations for efficient time series forecasting, particularly in long-context regimes.

While Section 3 briefly gestures at point-wise decomposability, the model's explicit capability for multivariate or exogenous feature forecasting is only cursorily addressed, with no empirical analysis contrasting, e.g., approaches like Crossformer or TimeXer.

Potential Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The choice of patching threshold $\\tau$ is acknowledged as data-dependent and requires tuning. However, the ramifications (e.g., stability, transferability across domains, optimal selection strategies) are not robustly quantified—raising concerns about practical usability and the risk of model brittleness. The only discussion occurs at a high level in the Conclusion, and more rigorous empirical explanation (e.g., full-sweep results for a range of $\\tau$ on multiple datasets) is absent.\n3. While the patching function is presented cleanly, some important aspects remain underspecified—for instance, the way boundaries are handled when signals have sudden global changes, or how minimum/maximum patch sizes interact with highly nonstationary regions (see dynamic patching on Page 4 and visualization in Figures 8–10). Additionally, the role of variable-length unpatching in SSM/Transformer composition warrants deeper theoretical and implementation clarity. The claim of strict causality preservation could be accompanied by formal or simulation evidence to eliminate any ambiguity.\n4.

Baseline evaluations are taken from Time-MoE (ICLR 2025) and have not been updated to include more recent models, such as Sundial [1] and Moirai-MoE [2], that have advanced the state-of-the-art in the meantime. As such, this paper's claim of state-of-the-art performance is not demonstrated. Posting models on the GIFT-Eval benchmark [3] has become common practice in this area, and many more recent performant models can be found there. (Ideally, the Chronos evaluations would also be updated to at least use Chronos-Bolt, released Nov. 2024.)\n- The specific focus on Time-MoE in the method design and evaluations limits the impact of the paper, given the advances in the field since its publication. Without further discussion and evaluation, it's not necessarily clear that this method could be applied on top of more recent models and perform as well.\n- Only five evaluation datasets are used - this is extremely limited and not in line with recent papers in this area. Even among earlier papers, MOMENT, TimesFM, Moirai, and Chronos all use dozens of datasets in their evaluations. Again, GIFT-Eval is an example of a large evaluation set that has become commonly used.\n- A compelling explanation is lacking for placing patch boundaries based on the difference between neighbouring samples. For a seasonal input, this means focusing on the areas between peaks and troughs, but it's not clear why they should be treated as more relevant. Empirical justification could be all that's available, but it would strengthen the paper if some insight could be provided.\n- It's not clear to me that it's very impactful to speed up pretraining of time series foundation models without improving other aspects of performance, given that they tend to be relatively cheap to train as far as foundation models go, and the zero-shot capability means pretraining only has to be done once. One possible benefit would be allowing more scaling of model size, but the results suggest that doing so does not help performance.\n\n[1] Liu et al. \"Sundial: A family of highly capable time series foundation models\" ICML 2025.  \n[2] Liu et al. \"Moirai-MoE: Empowering Time Series Foundation Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts\" ICML 2025.  \n[3] https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salesforce/GIFT-Eval"}, "questions": {"value": "- Ablations compare to using a fixed patch length of 4 but the dynamic patching seems to prefer using patch length 2 in many cases - have you evaluated a fixed patch length of 2?
