PolIC3 to the rescue", "abstract": "The use of machine learning in sequential decision-making tasks has grown substantially, intensifying concerns regarding the safety of learned policies and motivating research on policy verification. We present a new policy verification method based on the well-known IC3 algorithm. Unlike existing approaches, ours decouples reasoning about policy decisions from reasoning about the effects of these decisions on the environment in which the policy is executed. This separation allows us to leverage the latest advances in machine learning certification tools to handle the former subproblem, whilst relying on specialized solvers for the latter. Experiments confirm that our approach scales better and supports a wider variety of policy architectures than current state-of-the-art methods.", "tldr": "We present a new state-of-the-art action policy verification method for neural network and tree ensemble policies based on the well-known IC3 verification algorithm", "keywords": ["Action Policy Verification;RL Policy Analysis;Trustworthy sequential action decision making"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/035f1a44c57586d37fd1de097308bf2f4be29075.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/05143394dc605e098454bd4f5a918c00161e6e0f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work deals with policy verification.\nA new method for policy verification is presented, based on the established IC3 algorithm."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "* The topic is relevant.\n* The idea of using and adapting a technology established in another domain is interesting.\n* The abstract is written very well."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* The presentation seems somewhat tedious to me.

It adapts IC3 and proposes POLIC3, which decouples reasoning about the policy and the environment. The environment is a guarded command model; the policy is a neural net or a tree ensemble. The key step replaces an exact “policy frame transition” test with a necessary-condition surrogate that splits action feasibility and policy selection so that standard SMT handles environment reachability, and standard certification tools handle policy decisions. Experiments on several integer-variable planning benchmarks show higher coverage and faster runtimes than prior policy verification baselines, and the method can handle more complex policies such as ASNets through interface nets."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper writes a generic IC3 with four abstract subroutines and gives the assertions needed so that termination and correctness follow. It then maps these to environment models and to policy-constrained transition systems.\n\nThe paper explains why a direct SMT encoding of \\pi is brittle, then proposes a split test with theorems that show rejection is sound: if the relaxed test fails, the exact test is false. It also gives practical constructions that reduce the policy side to LiRPA for nets and VERITAS for trees.\n\nOn known FFNN and DTE policy benchmarks, POLIC3 matches or improves solved instances and often reduces runtime, and it scales to ASNet policies through interface functions. A coverage table and per-instance runtime plots support this."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The core split is only a necessary condition, not equivalent to the exact policy frame test.\nThe method replaces the exact test with separate checks over transitions and over policy choice. Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 show only that failures of the relaxed test imply failures of the exact test, not the converse. This can produce many false positives in the relaxed test and weak pruning. The paper claims the IC3 assertions still hold, but the split gives no completeness guarantee about when refinement will cut enough states to ensure practical convergence speed. A short discussion that quantifies this gap would help.\n\nThe policy side check replaces max over applicable actions with max over an under approximation  $A\\inA(s)$ that must hold for all states in r. How A is computed with SMT, how conservative it is under large guards, and what happens when guards use disjunctions or derived predicates are not discussed. Errors here directly affect the soundness of the rejection step and the strength of pruning.\n\nFor successor selection the paper enumerates commands rather than solving the approximate policy frame test, to avoid SMT complexity. This is simple but it can be expensive when branching is high. A cost bound or empirical trace would be useful to show that this choice does not dominate runtime on hard instances."}, "questions": {"value": "For which classes of r and guards is the relaxed policy frame test equivalent to the exact test?

How sensitive is pruning to the size of A?\n\nCould you share data on clause sizes and variable orders for the hard FFNN cases and show a heuristic that consistently shrinks reasons?\n\nWhat guarantees do you have that F and G preserve the decisions of the original ASNet over the JANI model semantics?
