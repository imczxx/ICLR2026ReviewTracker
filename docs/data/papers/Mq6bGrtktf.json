Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs. However, how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled remains insufficiently explored. In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as 27% more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by -22.6% relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by -20.1%), categories for which humans typically demand citations. Furthermore, experiments with fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) demonstrate that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences.

This is particularly important because modern LLM services increasingly let the model itself control citation decisions in agentic workflows. The distinction between cite-worthiness (content-conditioned importance) and citation recommendation (document matching) is well-motivated and fills a genuine gap in the literature, as most prior work focuses on attribution and retrieval rather than the fundamental question of what merits verification.\n\n(B) The dataset construction is thoughtful and rigorous. Using Wikipedia's inline templates provides a reliable signal from experienced editors, and the reorganization into 8 meaningful categories with balanced pairwise comparisons (28 category pairs) enables fine-grained analysis. The quality control measures (duplicate pairs for consistency checks, removal of malformed sentences) and annotation setup with 402 US-based participants is reasonable. \n\n(C) he paper provides compelling evidence of how training data shapes citation behavior through three well-chosen analysis dimensions: (1) sentences with \"Citation needed\" tags show models are over-influenced by Wikipedia markup (+19.5% to +27.4% vs humans), (2) numeric sentences reveal systematic underselection (-22.6%) despite human preference for citing quantitative claims, and (3) person names show similar underselection (-20.1%) despite established norms around biographical verification. \n\n(D) The experimental validation that DPO (but not standard fine-tuning) can improve alignment by 5.76% on average (11.8% for smaller models) provides actionable evidence that citation preferences can be learned and controlled. The negative results for fine-tuning corroborate prior findings about its limitations for knowledge injection, while the DPO success suggests a path forward for deployment."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "(A) Minor: The final dataset contains only 2,596 pairwise comparisons, which becomes just 1,206 training pairs after splitting. This is quite small for training modern LLMs and limits the reliability of conclusions. More critically, the paper provides no inter-annotator agreement metrics (Cohen's kappa, Fleiss' kappa, or even pairwise agreement rates), making it impossible to assess whether the annotation task is well-defined and whether human preferences are consistent. The paper mentions removing inconsistent annotations but doesn't report what percentage of annotations were inconsistent, raising concerns about task difficulty and label reliability.\n\n(B) The paper lacks essential methodological details that undermine reproducibility and credibility: (1) no prompts are shown for LLM evaluation, despite prompt sensitivity being well-known, (2) no statistical significance tests are reported - differences like 62.7% vs 61.2% could be within noise, (3) no confidence intervals or standard errors across evaluation runs, (4) no analysis of potential train/test contamination given that models were pretrained on Wikipedia and the dataset uses Wikipedia sentences. \n\n(C) \nThe claim that models overselecting \"Citation needed\" sentences demonstrates \"training data bias\" (rather than appropriate learned behavior) assumes human annotations are ground truth without justification. However, Wikipedia editors explicitly marked these sentences as needing citations, so models selecting them more frequently could indicate they correctly learned Wikipedia's citation standards - which might be more rigorous than the crowdworkers' judgments. The paper doesn't validate that crowdworker preferences align with Wikipedia editor expertise or provide evidence that the model behavior is genuinely problematic rather than reflecting legitimate editorial standards that prioritize verifiability.\n\n(D) The artificial balancing of category pairs (28 combinations with ~107 examples each) doesn't reflect natural distributions of content types requiring citations. Additionally, the eight categories seem somewhat arbitrary - the reorganization from 153 labels into 8 groups lacks clear principled justification, and some categories appear to overlap conceptually (e.g., \"Vague\" vs \"Unclear,\" or why \"Medical Content\" is separate from domain-specific \"Jargon\")."}, "questions": {"value": "(A) What was the inter-annotator agreement rate (Cohen's kappa or Fleiss' kappa) for the pairwise comparisons? How many annotations were flagged as inconsistent and removed? Given that Table 2 shows many category pairs with win rates close to 50% (e.g., Info vs Sic: 50.5%, Doubt vs Vague: 48.9%), does this suggest the task may be ambiguous or poorly defined for certain category pairs? Could you provide evidence that crowdworkers' citation preferences align with those of experienced Wikipedia editors, given that Wikipedia's editorial standards may be more rigorous?\n\n(B) Did you check whether the Wikipedia sentences in your dataset appear in the pretraining corpora of the evaluated models? This is particularly important since you argue models are influenced by seeing \"Citation needed\" tags during training - but this conclusion requires that models actually encountered these specific sentences or similar patterns. Additionally, could you provide the exact prompts used for LLM evaluation and report statistical significance tests (with confidence intervals) for the performance differences between models? Without these details, it's difficult to assess whether observed differences are meaningful or within experimental noise.\n\n(C) our analysis shows models overselect \"Citation needed\" sentences (+19.5% to +27.4%) and underselect numeric/person-name sentences. However, couldn't the former indicate that models correctly learned Wikipedia's rigorous citation standards (which crowdworkers may underestimate), while the latter might reflect that numbers and names often appear in contexts where surrounding text provides attribution? Have you conducted ablation studies or controlled experiments to isolate whether these patterns are truly \"biases\" to correct, or whether they reflect reasonable learned heuristics? What evidence supports the assumption that crowdworker preferences should be preferred over model behavior that might better align with Wikipedia's actual editorial standards?\n\n(D) How do you expect these findings to generalize beyond Wikipedia-style encyclopedic writing to other domains like scientific papers, journalism, or conversational AI responses where citation norms differ substantially? The category taxonomy seems Wikipedia-specific (e.g., \"POV\" reflects Wikipedia's neutrality policy) - have you considered how citation preferences might differ for medical literature (where citation standards are extremely rigorous), news articles (where attribution norms differ), or casual information-seeking (where users may prefer fewer citations for readability)? Could you discuss how the artificial balancing of category pairs in your dataset might affect model performance on natural distributions of content?\n\n(E) The paper references missing appendices (e.g., \"Appendix ??\") multiple times for critical details about model training, hyperparameters, and DPO implementation. Could you provide complete details about: (1) DPO hyperparameters (learning rate, beta, number of epochs), (2) why standard fine-tuning failed so dramatically (Table 5 shows -14.4% for Llama 3B) - is this a hyperparameter issue or fundamental limitation, (3) how you constructed the preference pairs for DPO from pairwise human judgments, and (4) computational costs and training time?

This differs fundamentally from ordinary users’ citation needs—for example, a user seeking 'insomnia medication advice' has distinct expectations vs. reading Wikipedia’s 'insomnia' entry. The study thus measures 'Wikipedia editor preferences' rather than general 'human preferences,' calling the validity of its research question into question.  \n\n2. **Circular reasoning in key findings**  \nA central claim (models over-select 'Citation needed' tags) is attributed to training data bias. However, annotation data is reorganized from Wikipedia inline templates (Table 1), creating tautology: Wikipedia labels define ground truth → models trained on Wikipedia are tested → models prefer Wikipedia labels → conclusion blames 'training bias.' This finding risks being a dataset artifact rather than a meaningful scientific discovery.  \n\n3. **Missing high-stakes real-world scenarios**  \nCritical application scenarios requiring citation control are absent, such as:  \n- High-stakes medical advice ('take XX medication') vs. medical knowledge statements ('XX drug mechanism is...')  \n- Legal opinions ('you have rights under XX law') vs. statute descriptions  \nCitation logic in these scenarios differs sharply from Wikipedia, yet the paper ignores them entirely.  \n\n4. **Inadequate sample size**  \nAfter cleaning, only 2,596 pairs remain (1,206 training, 100 validation, 1,288 test), with ~43 training pairs per category combination.
