Two models are considered: the coordinator model, where all sites communicate only with a central coordinator over private channels using private randomness, and the blackboard model, where each site can write on a public blackboard visible to all, but still uses private randomness.\n\nIn the coordinator model, the authors design a $(1+\\epsilon)$-coreset using roughly $O(sk + dk + dk \\log(n\\Delta))$ bits of communication (hiding dependencies on $z$ and $\\epsilon$). In the blackboard model, they further reduce the communication complexity to $O(s \\log(n\\Delta) + dk \\log(n\\Delta))$ bits.\n\nTo achieve these results, the paper first presents a randomized bicriteria algorithm that uses only $O(s \\log n + kd \\log n)$ bits of communication. This is achieved via a lazy sampling procedure based on the adaptive sampling technique from prior literature. The key insight is to sample from a distribution close to the adaptive one, but requiring fewer communication bits. The resulting bicriteria solution is then used to construct the coresets through sensitivity sampling. Finally, the authors present experimental results supporting their theoretical claims.
