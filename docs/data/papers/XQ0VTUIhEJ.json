We introduce Whitened Self-Attention, a theoretically motivated\nand novel enhancement that optimally accounts for inter-token correlations, and\nbased on several covariance modeling assumptions, we derive a computationally\nfeasible implementation for it. Experiments with a small GPT architecture show\nthat whitened self-attention reduces perplexity by 19.3%, achieves the same mean\ncross-entropy loss in 37 times fewer training iterations, and, after hyperparameter\noptimization, reduces training time by 91%.

The authors should elaborate more on this.\n\nFor the experiments:\n - I don't think Figure 4 well supports the authors claim about the functionality of the whitening filter. It is true that from (a), it shows decreased correlation as training progresses. However, it should be compared with a baseline without the proposed whitening filter. Since the token embedding and the layer norm are trained, it could be that they naturally learn to be de-correlated with training.\n - From Table 3, it seems like the author did run experiments on 7M models. Why not also post the results of MCE for the 7M model? Now I am not sure if the model scales well given the super small model size.\n - From the experiments (Figure 3), it is unclear to me if the model overfits or underfits without the training set MCE.

This corpus has short range dependencies and very limited vocabulary (93 tokens), which aligns well with the model’s covariance assumptions. It is unclear whether the same improvements would hold for tokenized or multilingual corpora with complex co-occurrence structures. Hence, while results are strong within this setup, the generalization to realistic language modeling conditions is questionable.\n\n-  The whitening is derived assuming first-order stationarity and modeled with a block tridiagonal covariance. Figure 4b shows this assumption breaks down for the second decoder block, where non-stationarity increases drastically. This empirical evidence implies the whitening process fails in deeper layers, hence its impact to realistic multi-layer Transformers is again questionable.\n\n- Even with block simplifications, recursive whitening introduces additional parameters and potential gradient instability. The authors acknowledge whitening recursion grows with sequence length and is not GPU-friendly, and suggest prefix-sum parallelization (Sec. 7), but this is prospective, not demonstrated. The method’s scalability to long contexts (e.g., N > 2048) remains speculative.\n\n- The comparison is limited to vanilla SA with no comparison to existing orthogonalization or other-related methods. For example, orthogonal attention regularization (Xiao et al., ICML 2024).\n\nMinor:\n- Empirical results are heavily overplotted (Figure 3) without error bars or multiple runs.\n- Table 1 and Figure 3 show large apparent speedups (“91% reduction”), but training time comparisons are based on different batch sizes and parameter counts (1.62 M vs 1.88 M weights, 256 vs 128 batch). Per-iteration cost is actually far higher for WSA, and the runtime savings come primarily from faster convergence under this specific loss surface.

Given that Transformer performance, optimization dynamics, and attention patterns fundamentally change with model size, the presented results should be interpreted as conceptual evidence rather than empirical validation of scalability.\nThe writing would benefit from better structuring: I found the result section particularly convoluted to parse, with numerous results presented in succession, spread accross multiple tables.

Wouldn’t the results be more meaningful if demonstrated with more standard tokenization or embedding strategies, where inter-token correlations play a much greater role?
