This approach cannot invent novel, domain-specific transformations (e.g., handling date differences, geospatial calculations, complex conditional logic) that might be crucial for certain datasets. Compared to methods generating arbitrary code, the expressive power of PromptFE's feature space is inherently limited to combinations of these fixed operators, potentially failing to capture more intricate data relationships.\n- Scalability Limitations (Cost & Evaluation Overhead): Each iteration involves potentially multiple LLM API calls and, more significantly, feature evaluation using cross-validation. Repeated model training for scoring can be computationally expensive, particularly for complex downstream models or large datasets. The overall wall-clock time might still be substantial.\n- Heuristic and Opaque Search: The LLM-driven search is fundamentally heuristic, relying on the model's opaque internal mechanisms to interpret scores and examples. There are no guarantees of convergence, optimality, or systematic exploration. The process might fixate on suboptimal patterns derived from early high-scoring features (local optima).
