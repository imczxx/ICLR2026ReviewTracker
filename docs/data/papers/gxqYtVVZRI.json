In particular, diffusion models for spatiotemporal virtual sensing already exist [1]. The authors claim that their model compares favorably to [1] because the latter uses short input sequences and a fixed graph. However, these limitations can be easily resolved with existing techniques; therefore, the technical novelty of the paper appears limited.  \n    - In line 72, the paper states: “While USTD meets all criteria in Table 1, the public implementation restricts sequences to 12 or 24 steps, so we were unable to run it on our datasets, which have longer sequences.” Adjusting the input sequence length should not be difficult and should not prevent a direct comparison.  \n    - The reference for USTD is incorrect; it should refer to [1], not to “Tang et al.”  \n    - As mentioned above, diffusion models have already been applied to virtual sensing. Likewise, the idea of learning representations in the frequency domain is common in existing methods—for example, [2] combines both diffusion and frequency-domain representations for spatiotemporal forecasting.
