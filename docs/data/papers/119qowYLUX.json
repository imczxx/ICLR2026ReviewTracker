SAE features are typically characterized by examining their activating examples, which are often \"monosemantic\" and align with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal *feature sensitivity*: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language descriptions for features; instead, we directly use language models to generate text similar to a feature's activating examples and test whether the feature activates on these inputs. We demonstrate that sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants.

The paper filters out 35-79% of features, with exclusion rates dramatically increasing with SAE width (51% for 65K to 79% for 1M).

Filtering for features that \"activate on their own truncated examples\" explicitly selects for simpler, context-independent features, which is acknowledged but not adequately addressed.

Why should this assumption hold? The authors don't present any idea or empirical data and simply assume this is true. But it is important: If the LLM generates samples where the features should NOT activate (examples below), then the sensitivity score could be entirely wrong.\n\nThe authors present not needing a feature annotation as a main advantage of their strategy. However, although they don't require an **explicit** annotation, the LLM sample generator needs to make an **implicit** guess about what the feature might encode, in order to generate activating examples. If this guess is wrong, the LLM would generate samples that should not activate and the sensitivity score is low not because the SAE feature is low-quality, but because the LLM doesn't understand what makes the shown activating examples really activate.\n\nTo illustrate why I expect this problem to be the **norm** and not an edge case, I'd like to give some examples.\n\nExample 1: Ground truth feature the SAE found is \"The subject of this sentence is the second noun\", and the feature fires at positions that predict a noun.\nThis is a feature that should exist in real language models as it's part of the IOI circuit (Wang, 2022) and real SAE features have actually been found (Makelov, 2025). So this is a feature that is great, monosemantic, with a clear interpretation, and many such features are present in real SAEs.\nLet's pretend this SAE feature is perfect, ie sensitivity=100% and think through how high the proposed method would score the sensitivity. Input prompts with activating examples would be seemingly arbitrary text, with many activations being at tokens like \"to\", \"the\", \"for\", etc, since these words often predict a noun that should possibly be copied from earlier in the context. The LLM sample generator would now just generate arbitrary sentences that just so happen to contain those tokens but no specific sentences where the subject/object should be copied and thus the proposed sensitivity metric would be low although the \"ground truth\" sensitivity is high.\n\nExample 2: Features, that are better explained by their role on the LLM output. An LLM has to understand input but also generate output and many features, especially in late layers have shown to be better explained by their role in crafting the model's prediction. Often, activating this neuron leads to promoting or inhibiting a meaningful set of tokens as has been shown by simply calculating f @ W_dec @ W_unemb and most features in late layers behave like this. For example, let's assume a feature is active whenever the model predicts a form of the word \"sell\". This feature could be identified quite easily by calculating f @ W_dec @ W_unemb and showing that activating it leads to the logits of [\" sold\", \"sold\", \" sell\", \" resold\", ...] being higher. \nHere's the link for this feature on neuronpedia: https://www.neuronpedia.org/gemma-2-2b/19-clt-hp/40860\nLooking at activations alone, it activates on words like \"which\", \"it\", \"to\", for\" in various different contexts. Only a small subset of prompts actually contain a form of the word sell at the next token position, because often, the model's prediction is different than the actual text. Thus, again, the LLM sample generator would generate samples where most don't activate the feature because the LLM has no idea what the feature really activates for. So sensitivity would be low although the feature learned is perfect.\n\nThis problem gets worse with scale:\n- larger models have more layers and CoT tokens, so most features need to be explained in terms of their interactions with other features rather than inputs.\n- more intelligent models might have more abstract, complex features, still monosemantic, but in a nontrivial way. Simply generating some sentences that appear similar wouldn't cut it.\n\nAs a result, the proposed metric is not a principled method to evaluate SAE feature quality because it cannot distinguish whether the LLM sampler understands the nature of this feature vs the feature itself has low sensitivity."}, "questions": {"value": "- methodological details are missing for the human study: number of human evaluators, who they were (e.g. MI researchers, undergraduates, etc), how many prompts did each person score, how was blinding done, etc.\n- ll 448 mentions results for Matryoshka SAEs but no data or figure is linked. Where can I find the results of this experiment?\n- Figure 3b, could the authors clarify which Auto-Interp Score was calculated here? (e.g. detection, fuzzing, simulation, something else)\n- Figure 3b, c, d, why are the scores clustered around decimals?\n- Only 2M tokens were used to produce activating examples. Since many features occur rarely (ie frequency 1e-5 or less), I expect that many features only have few activating examples. The authors acknowledge this limitation but there's a deeper flaw: Because you sample so few, you likely miss the highest activating, often most clear and interesting examples. If more activations were used, the activating examples might have been clearer, the LLM would have been able to generate better samples, and the sensitivity score could've been possibly much higher."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "IcVbeovUwm", "forum": "119qowYLUX", "replyto": "119qowYLUX", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15941/Reviewer_Ztja"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15941/Reviewer_Ztja"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15941/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762035646866, "cdate": 1762035646866, "tmdate": 1762926152036, "mdate": 1762926152036, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
