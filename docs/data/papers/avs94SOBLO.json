Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs.\nHowever, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an *attribution graph*: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties---causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Attribution Methods", "Explainable AI", "LLM", "Autoregressive LLM", "Context Attribution"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e8128873cc23e1dca9f3fb9baba2cd71ba6d8e7f.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/177986cb5c77d0e86fe22ed269746fb8149f776c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces CAGE, a context attribution method that builds a causal row stochastic graph over prompt and generated tokens and propagates influence to capture prompt to output and intergenerational effects in autoregressive language models.

This creates a critical logical flaw. The constraint assumes that 100% of a token's generation can be attributed to previous tokens, which contradicts how LLMs actually work. LLMs have inherent randomness, learned biases, and model parameters that contribute to generation beyond just the input context. By forcing weights to sum to 1, the method artificially inflates attribution scores when there are few contributing tokens, potentially creating misleading explanations\n\n* The normalization in Equation (1) using Φ(x) = max(x, 0) can cause division by zero issues if all attribution scores for a token are negative.

The motivation is clearly laid out in the introduction, and the distinction between CAGE and prior work is made both in the text and through effective visualizations. Especially, Figure 3 greatly aids in understanding the influence propagation process.\n- By providing a tool to trace the flow of information through intermediate generation steps, CAGE claims to offer a more faithful and complete picture of a model's reasoning process than was previously possible with attribution methods. The framework is general and can be applied on top of any existing or future base attribution method."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The model of influence propagation, calculated via matrix multiplication ($A_{\\tau,:}^{\\prime}=A_{\\tau,:}+A_{\\tau,\\tau-1}\\cdot A_{\\tau-1,:}$), implicitly assumes that influence propagates through the network in a way that can be modeled by a linear combination of path weights. The paper could be strengthened by acknowledging this as a simplifying assumption and briefly discussing why it is a reasonable one in this context, or contemplating what might be lost by this linearization of the influence flow.\n\n- The construction of the adjacency matrix $A$ involves clipping all attribution scores to be non-negative ($\\Phi(x) = \\max(x, 0)$) before row-normalization. Many attribution methods can produce meaningful negative scores, indicating that a feature actively suppresses a certain output. By discarding this information, the model may lose a crucial part of the explanation. For example, in the \"Facts\" dataset, a model might rely on already-generated facts to down-weight the probability of generating them again. This \"negative\" influence is an important part of the reasoning process that is currently ignored. The paper would benefit from a discussion of this design choice and its potential limitations.\n\n- The context attribution evaluation relies heavily on the Attribution Coverage (AC) metric, which is newly introduced in this paper. While novel metrics can be valuable, their introduction requires strong justification. The core assumption of the AC metric—that attribution should be uniformly distributed across all ground-truth sentences—is not well-defended and may not be appropriate for complex reasoning tasks. It is highly plausible that certain pieces of information are more pivotal than others. By penalizing non-uniform distributions, the AC metric may unfairly disadvantage methods that correctly identify and focus on the most crucial context. The paper would be more convincing if it either provided a stronger theoretical justification for the uniformity assumption or supplemented the AC results with a more standard metric."}, "questions": {"value": "- The AC metric, as defined in the paper, rewards explanations where attribution is spread uniformly across all ground-truth sentences. However, in complex reasoning tasks, it's plausible that some pieces of evidence are more critical than others. Why is uniform attribution considered an ideal property, rather than allowing for a non-uniform distribution that might more accurately reflect the model's focus? Furthermore, could the authors provide the rationale for selecting the specific range $[\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}(a_{GT}), \\frac{3}{2}\\mathbb{E}(a_{GT})]$ for this metric?\n- To isolate the goal of identifying all relevant prompt sentences, have the authors considered an alternative metric that measures coverage without enforcing a uniformity constraint? For example, a metric based on the average rank of ground-truth sentences (when all prompt sentences are sorted by their attribution scores) could provide a more direct assessment of whether an explanation method successfully highlights the most important information.\n- The faithfulness evaluation in line 463 mentions calculating the \"area under this perturbation curve\". Could the authors explicitly define the axes of this curve?
