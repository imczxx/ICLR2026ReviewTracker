This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks often adopt uniform instance-level normalization, which overlooks patch-specific characteristics, and model dependencies at a single scale, failing to capture complex temporal variations. To address these limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving inter-patch dependency. DeCoP first introduces Instance-wise Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for representation learning. Building on this, a hierarchical Dependency Controlled Learning (DCL) strategy explicitly models inter-patch dependencies across multiple temporal scales within the latent space. This is complemented by a global Instance-level Contrastive Module (ICM), which enhances generalization by learning instance-discriminative representations from time-invariant positive pairs. DeCoP achieves state-of-the-art results on ten datasets, improving MSE by 3% on ETTh1 over PatchTST using only 37% of the FLOPs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Time series analysis", "self-supervised learning"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c71fcda7eeef3a301e3addc1071413df72c7d902.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7c8092138e2eb69ea296b5dec5f8f1f7550c11e7.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes DeCoP, a self-supervised pre-training framework for time-series that combines: (1) IPN to blend instance- and patch-level statistics for robustness to distribution shifts while retaining local semantics; (2) DCL to control receptive fields across multiple temporal scales; (3) ICM to build time-invariant positives via frequency-domain masking and a contrastive loss.

The frequency-domain masking mechanism in ICM raises potential concerns about cross-sample information leakage, since the frequency selection is based on batch- or channel-level averaged amplitudes. This may implicitly introduce dependencies between samples, particularly under cross-domain or distribution-shift scenarios. A clearer explanation or ablation demonstrating that such leakage does not affect training fairness would be valuable.\n\n2. The stability and interpretability of the learnable coefficient α in IPN are insufficiently analyzed. Although Figure 6 shows qualitative distribution alignment, there is no quantitative study or sensitivity test on how α evolves across datasets or initialization schemes. Such analysis would clarify whether the IPN layer remains stable under highly non-stationary data.\n\n3. Reporting averages over multiple random seeds and performing significance testing would make the empirical claims more convincing.\n\n4. Comparison set of baselines remains somewhat limited. Including comparisons with more recent multi-scale or frequency-aware architectures would help position the work more clearly within the state of the art.\n\n5.

Providing a more detailed breakdown of computational and memory cost between pre-training and fine-tuning phases would highlight the real efficiency advantage."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the Weaknesses, and the following:\n\n1. The paper states that the Instance-level Contrastive Module (ICM) selects “time-invariant” frequencies using averaged amplitudes across the batch or channel (Eqs. 12–13). Could the authors clarify the exact scope of this averaging? Is it computed only within each batch of the source-domain data, or does it aggregate statistics from multiple domains or entire datasets? In cross-domain fine-tuning, is the same set of frequencies frozen, re-estimated per domain, or adaptively updated? It would help to describe how the model avoids potential cross-sample leakage during frequency selection.\n\n2. How sensitive is the ICM to the hyperparameters 𝐾 and 𝑀 used for selecting top-K or top-M frequencies? An analysis of performance stability across different masking settings would clarify the robustness of the ICM component.\n\n3.  The learnable mixing factor between instance-level and patch-level statistics (Eq.~7) is central to the IPN design. Could the authors provide more details on how $\\alpha$ evolves during training and across datasets? Is $\\alpha$ constrained within $[0,1]$ via sigmoid activation, and is there any regularization applied? Visualizing or quantifying $\\alpha$’s dynamics might help demonstrate whether IPN consistently balances local and global normalization, especially under severe distribution shifts.\n\n4. In Table 5, DeCoP demonstrates robustness when transferring from ETTh2 → ETTh1 under limited labels. Are all hyperparameters (e.g., masking ratio, learning rate, optimizer) kept identical between pretraining and fine-tuning? If not, what are the adjusted values? Providing a clear protocol for transfer experiments would strengthen the reproducibility of these results.\n\n5.

Additionally, is there any prior or heuristic for selecting appropriate (W_k) values across different datasets?\n4.
