We present STARFlow-V, a flow-based autoregressive video generator that operates in compressed spatiotemporal latents and is trained with exact likelihood end-to-end. Two design choices ensure causality for autoregressive prediction while mitigating error propagation and enabling end-to-end training: (i) Global–Local architecture, which constrains each token to depend only on the past along time while preserving rich within-frame interactions; and (ii) noise-augmented training jointly with \\emph{flow-score matching}, a lightweight causal denoiser that recovers clean samples from noisy generation. To improve efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware fixed-point iteration scheme that reformulates inner updates as parallelizable iterations without violating causal structure, yielding substantially faster inference. A deep–shallow autoregressive-flow hierarchy further balances capacity and stability over long videos. The same model natively supports both text-to-video (T2V) and text-/image-to-video (TI2V) generation via unified conditioning, avoiding separate pipelines. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with markedly lower sampling cost compared to diffusion-only or discrete AR baselines. By marrying causality, likelihood, and efficiency in a single architecture, STARFlow-V helps pave the way toward a flow-based, scalable paradigm for world modeling.", "tldr": "We show for the first time that normalizing flows can be scaled for high-quality video synthesis", "keywords": ["normalizing flow", "video generation", "generative model", "autoregressive model"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/41b6c84d08c5ccd4938bb0798e893d6167abd660.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new video generation model based on STARFlow [Gu'2025], a type of normalizing flow.

The authors also assert \"diffusion's training inefficiency\" (line 74) and their \"efficient inference algorithm\" (line 87), yet offers insufficient evidence to support these claims. In particular, comparisons with baseline models in terms of training cost and inference speed are missing.It would be better for the authors to conduct additional quantitative analysis to support these claims.\n\n  2. Lack of ablation studies. Although three designs are proposed, the paper does not include any ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of each design. It would be better if the authors could perform additional ablation study isolating the performance contribution of each component.\n  3. Weak qualitative results. The qualitative comparisons in Figure 4 (bottom two rows) show that their generated videos exhibit limited motion, falling short of the motion dynamics achieved by current diffusion and autoregressive models.

Unlike Line 92, extensive experiments are not conducted – only the VBench score of the final model and few qualitative comparisons are provided. In addition, the results are not competitive with diffusion-based methods because there are large gaps in many categories of VBench.
