While the former dictates overall fuel efficiency, the latter informs detailed design and performance optimization. Existing deep-learning surrogates typically focus on either global or local predictions individually, failing to optimize both tasks jointly, thus limiting their effectiveness in iterative design processes. To address this, we propose UniAero, a unified framework that jointly predicts $C_d$ and dense surface fields from 3D automotive geometry. UniAero combines (i) a Physically Stratified Mixture-of-Experts (Phys$^{2}$MoE) with scale-sensitive experts and physics-aware gating for multi-task, multi-scale learning; (ii) Serialized Patch Attention to process large meshes efficiently while preserving long-range interactions; and (iii) a hierarchical encoder with Geometry-aware Position Encoding (GPE) to capture subtle shape cues. \nExperiments on three industrial datasets demonstrate that, by explicitly leveraging the inherent coupling between global and local aerodynamic phenomena through joint modeling. UniAero reduces drag error by 12% and improves local-field accuracy by 16% over strong single-task baselines, with ~1s inference per vehicle on a single GPU, far faster than CFD simulations. With its superior accuracy, speed, and coherence, UniAero holds significant promise for automotive aerodynamic design.

Moreover, the claims about the usefulness of different components need to be better proved and analyzed to provide more insights. If no theoretical insights can be provided about these components, the work should at least support its claims with more rigorous and thorough experiments to make up for its limited application. Based on these points I suggest rejecting this paper. \n\n## Specifically:\n\n1. The CFD surrogate model appears restricted to a very narrow class of geometries (automobiles) with fixed flow boundary conditions. The practical significance of this application should be demonstrated, like how important this is to the car industry in their car development, how much this surrogate can expedite their prototyping, how much money can be saved, what the car manufacturers' typical tolerance to the prediction error is, do they always need the prediction only for a fixed flow condition. \n2. If the authors want to suggest its potential extrapolation to the other geometries, then the surrogate's generalization capability remains unclear due to the limited car dataset.\n    * Its performance may also need to be evaluated on the training set, and reported in the appendix.\n    * The shape differences between the training and test sets should be systematically evaluated to understand how the degree of geometric variation affects prediction accuracy. The cars seem to have similar global shapes. \n    * The model’s performance on simple unseen geometries (e.g., a sphere) also needs to be examined. If it's not good, this limitation should be highlighted.\n3. Due to this narrow application I expect the authors to at least shed some light on the component designs. However, there is no rigorous ablation test conducted to study their unique properties and verify each novel component’s contribution to the performance (except MoE). This significantly undermines the fancy claims made in Section 2 and 3 about these components’ usefulness.\n    * I suggest that the authors check the AlphaFold2 paper to understand how to write a high quality paper for a model with many novel components, without making shaky claims. \n4. In Table 2, the number of parameters for each model should be reported to verify whether the improvement in accuracy arises from increased model complexity, especially for MoE. If proper, a plot should also be generated to illustrate this. \n5. The relative L2 error alone—which is a scalar—is not enough to illustrate how better this model is at capturing cross-scale phenomenon compared to the other models. For instance, how does the model perform in regions with sharp corners and high curvatures? The visual inspection in Fig. 3 over only a few samples is not enough for this. I expect a more systematic, numerical evaluation over all test samples.\n   * For instance, a 2D graph Laplacian may be used to roughly evaluate the car surface's nonlinearity at each point, and the local prediction errors can be weighted by these Laplacian coefficients to derive a global metric for this purpose.\n6. Additionally, L1 might be a better choice than this L2 (which is actually MSE in this work) due to the high dimensionality of this problem. It's also weird that the authors chose L1 in Fig. 3 but relative error based on MSE in Table 2. I wonder if the relative promotion in Table 2 look appealing because of this choice.\n   * **To resolve this confusion, I strongly suggest that the authors use relative absolute error for Table 2**. \n   * _Aggarwal, C.

The paper thoroughly ablates Phys2MoE, showing it outperforms naïve multi-tasking and vanilla MoE, but it does not isolate how much Serialized Patch Attention vs. a simpler local attention, or Geometry-aware Position Encoding vs. plain positional features, each contribute to accuracy, runtime, or memory. A “w/o SPA / w/o GPE” study would make the source of gains clearer. \n\n2. The paper reports training time per epoch and ~1 s inference per car and claims improved efficiency over KNN-heavy baselines, but does not report FLOPs, parameter count, peak training/inference memory, or scaling with point count. That limits how convincingly we can judge deployability in a real aero design loop. \n\n3. The joint loss uses hand-tuned task weights ($\\lambda_p,\\lambda_\\tau,\\lambda_d$), and performance is sensitive to those values. This raises concerns about extensibility: as more targets are added (lift, side force, aeroacoustics, etc.), manual λ tuning becomes brittle and harder to reproduce. \n\n4. UniAero relies on voxelizing and serializing very large surface point clouds (hundreds of thousands to millions of points) into multiple Morton/Hilbert-style orderings before inference. For new high-resolution geometries, that preprocessing itself may be nontrivial and could erode the claimed “interactive” turnaround time. \n\n5. Some terminology and structure choices reduce accessibility — e.g. “naïve MTL” appears before “multi-task learning” is clearly defined, and core training details (task weights, downsampling strategy) are scattered rather than surfaced early. In addition, many architectural elements (hierarchical point-cloud transformer backbone, multi-scale decoder heads, Mixture-of-Experts routing) resemble known designs; without a clearer, sharper statement of what is *algorithmically* new vs. what is an effective integration for automotive aerodynamics, readers may perceive the work as a strong systems combination rather than a fundamentally new learning paradigm."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Did you verify basic physics consistency between predicted fields and predicted ($C_d$)?\n\n   - If you integrate the predicted surface pressure and wall shear stress over the body to obtain an implied drag force, how close is that to the directly predicted ($C_d$)?\n   - If you performed that check, please quantify the mismatch; if not, can you comment on feasibility and whether this is something the model could be encouraged to satisfy?\n\n3.
