However, generalizing to novel humans requires training on data that captures the diversity of human behaviors. Adversarial training is a promising method that allows dynamic data generation and ensures that agents are robust. It creates a feedback loop where the agent’s performance influences the generation of new adversarial data, which can be used immediately to train the agent. However, adversarial training is difficult to apply in a cooperative task; how can we train an adversarial cooperator?\nWe propose a novel strategy that combines a pre-trained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. We call our method \\textbf{GOAT}: \\textbf{G}enerative \\textbf{O}nline \\textbf{A}dversarial \\textbf{T}raining. In this framework, the GOAT dynamically searches the latent space of the generative model for coordination strategies where the learning policy---the Cooperator agent---underperforms. GOAT enables better generalization by exposing the Cooperator to various challenging interaction scenarios. We maintain realistic coordination strategies by keeping the generative model frozen, thus avoiding adversarial exploitation. We evaluate GOAT with real human partners, and the results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the Overcooked benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in generalizing to diverse human behaviors.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["multi agent", "adversarial training", "zero-shot coordination", "human-AI interaction", "cooperation", "reinforcement learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6abf02cd2914e58a8eb926bc1027270974fdb483.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focuses on the problem of training a cooperative agent in a two player cooperative Markov game.

The adversarial procedure works by finding embedding values that would lead to partner agents being sampled by the generator that maximize regret. This regret is calculated by calculating the difference between self-play scores and cross-play scores with the learning agent.\n\nEvaluation is done on a toy matrix game, a reaching environment, and two overcooked environments.

The models uses a pre-trained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. The policy itself tries to minimize regret, this induces an adversarial setup, but the challenge is to not the adversary be adversarial _and_ cooperative - two conflicting objectives. If the adversary is not constrained to such policies, then it can become overly combative, resorting to sabotage instead of making the policy robust and foolproof. In contrast to zero-sum games like chess where self-play can improve the performance of the policy by exploiting weaknesses against itself, in cooperative games there is no such incentive for a policy. \nTo prevent cross-play performance from self-sabotaging, the model essentially samples adversarial players from a learned distribution of agents using a variational autoencoder. this limits the capability for self-sabotage since the agents are sampled from a predefined distribution.

The VAE model and generative policy allows for sampling policies parametrically with a smooth latent space, preventing expensive zeroth-order methods to sample policies. This makes the optimization objective more tractable and inexpensive. This idea is also used in controllable image generation and editing where latent variables are optimized to achieve a test-time objective with a pretrained network. \n2. The formulation is pretty straightforward - given a cooperator policy $\\pi_C$, the adversarial policy chooses a partner policy $\\pi_P$ to minimize the value function with cross play of the cooperator and partner, while maximize the self-play performance of the partner policy - this is presumably to prevent selecting incompetent policies. This is also interpreted (accurately) as the regret of choosing a cooperative policy over itself in a cross-play scenario. Regret for bad partner policies will be lower (due to low first term in Equation (4)) than a good partner policy that does not work well with the cooperator policy. \n3. The experiment setup is satisfactory - including a cooperative matrix game allows easy visualization of one-step policies and analytically verifying optimal adversarial policies for a given cooperative policy, a 5x5 cooperative reaching game with more complexity but still tractable, and a hard game with a larger action space (Overcooked) with real-time dynamics on which performance is also shown with human cooperative players. \n4. Extensive analysis with related methods - GAMMA and MinMax is shown in RQ4 and RQ5. Figure 5 shows the adversarial objective drifting to new policies that significantly deviate from the normal distribution (in the projection space), showing that the model is indeed aiming to find harder partner policies."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The robustness of the policy depends on the coverage / support of the autoencoder and its simulated policies. The paper uses fixed agent populations with training methods (Line 178).\n2. The paper is not self-sufficient in terms of mentioning how the distribution of partner policies are learned before the adversarial sampling is performed. \n3. Figures 5 and 6 are nice, but they also show that the policies deviate a lot from random normal as training progresses. Since the generative model works off a VAE, are the policies that have a latent so far from the normal distribution meaningful at all? Is a regularization apart from the self-play regret (as mentioned in Line 722) enough to constrain the space of sampled policies?\n4. Figures 5 and 6 also show that the coverage of partner policies is very concentrated and lacks diversity - could it lead to a possible oscillation of the cooperative policy if certain partner policies are not compatible with each other? \n\nMinor nits: \n1. Line 75: \"The regret objective proves effective because it challenges the learning agent with a curriculum of increasingly difficult, yet still feasible tasks.\" - Regret minimization by itself does not motivate a curriculum learning approach. This line could say something like \"it challenges the learning agent and expands the frontier / coverage of harder yet feasible state configurations\""}, "questions": {"value": "**Questions**\n\n1. Since the distribution of the partner policies is learned using a VAE, why cant the cooperative agent be trained to minimize regret over the entire distribution of partner policies (by sampling partner policies from the VAE) instead of using an adversarial method to sample partner policies? Is that going to be slower or faster than the proposed training in terms of environment interactions and training time? \n2. Line 376 - \"We hypothesize this is because the generative model, trained on cooperative trajectories, encodes a latent space rich in strategic variations.\" - the paper posits that the generative model encodes a rich space of strategic variations is what leads to fast convergence - this approach is also used in other prior work (some of which are mentioned in the paper). Does GOAT perform better than prior work leveraging generative policies due to its adversarial sampling? \n\nMinor questions:\n1. Line 45/74: Why is Adversary capitalized? \n2. uncommon notation for distribution, i.e. $\\Delta$ is used. This could be replaced with a better notation in my opinion\n3. Line 363: \"PBT methods rely on simulated populations of self-play partners, are often computationally expensive, and have poor coverage of actual human behaviors.\"  - why is cross play and adversarial training less expensive than self play? I thought the tradeoff was to spend more compute on adversarial training to have better mode coverage of adversarial policies. Figures 4b and 4e show that GOAT is indeed faster but is there any argument or justification as to why that is the case, especially because adversarial training can be slow and brittle."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "1tnELdcUzJ", "forum": "AeehNfbHqD", "replyto": "AeehNfbHqD", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6948/Reviewer_Zoti"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6948/Reviewer_Zoti"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6948/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762124680525, "cdate": 1762124680525, "tmdate": 1762919176208, "mdate": 1762919176208, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
