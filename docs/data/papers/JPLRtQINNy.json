One possible setup to enable adaptation is to allow target domain owners to privately evaluate candidate models on their own data. For example, model providers consider how to adjust models to better fit the unseen target data, relying solely on returned model performance. Existing methods adopt Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization to refine model parameters or employ a two-stage learning process that first identifies the target-related samples in the source data and then retrains the model. However, we find that these methods struggle to generalize well for the target tasks during inference, primarily because of the failure to account for data-statistical shifts between source and target domains. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of domain bridging in the context of model adaptation for proprietary target data. The core idea is to bridge the domain gap by learning target-aligned perturbations on source data, enabling the fine-tuned model to achieve better performance on target domains. A natural attempt is to extend ZO optimization to this setting. However, this approach fails to produce reliable perturbations on real datasets. To address this, we design a target-aligned, sample-wise perturbation learner, enabling reliable adaptation from performance-only feedback. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees and demonstrate through experiments on five datasets across image and text modalities that our domain bridging method achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy by approximately 4\\%.", "tldr": "Domain Bridging introduces an efficient framework that learns source data perturbations to bridge domain gaps, enabling effective model fine-tuning for target domains without requiring direct access to proprietary target data.", "keywords": ["domain bridging", "evaluation-based adaptation", "zeroth-order optimization", "proprietary target data"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/91d535950cee1688cbd85ca498b8c8316925af32.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/416e0678fb813e63667363d45584a0cd79908874.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tackles evaluation-based domain adaptation when target data are inaccessible.

However, it relies on strong assumptions (strong convexity and a bounded Hessian), which usually do not hold for most modern deep networks. Could you elaborate on this assumption? Alternatively, the authors could show experiments on small, linear models or provide surrogate approximations. \n- Baseline comparisons with DG: I also looked at Appendix E. (comparisons on DG and sDG). However, since DG and sDG do not have target domain access, the comparisons in Tab. 11 & 12 are of less significance (as DA has target domain access). For a fair comparison, the DG/sDG methods should be evaluated with a setting that has a matching feedback budget.\n- Hyperparameter Tuning: How were the hyperparameters chosen?

The EDB method depends on a zeroth-order estimator for gradients, which can be noisy and less precise than true gradients. The performance gap between EDB and its variant with exact gradients (EDB) indicates that approximation errors limit the method's full potential.\n\n2. While EDB converges faster than baselines, the process of learning sample-wise perturbations for the entire source dataset within a bi-level optimization framework is inherently complex and could lead to higher computational costs per iteration, especially with large-scale source data.\n\n3. The adaptation process is highly reliant on the performance feedback from the target domain. The paper shows that performance degrades with noisy feedback, suggesting the method might be vulnerable to imperfect or adversarial feedback in real-world scenarios.\n\n4.  The robustness analysis against noisy feedback, while valuable, uses simulated Gaussian noise added to the performance metric. The paper would be more convincing if it tested the method against more realistic noise types, such as label noise in the target domain's support set or non-IID noise distributions that might occur in real-world data. \n\n5. This paper lacks the analysis of perturbation interpretability. The paper correctly notes that the learned perturbations do not visually resemble the target data, which is a privacy feature. However, a deeper analysis of what these perturbations represent or how they correlate with specific domain shift characteristics (e.g., style, texture) would provide valuable insights into the mechanistic interpretation of the \"bridging\" process, moving beyond quantitative distance metrics like MED.\n\n6.The experiments are conducted on standard academic benchmarks (e.g., Office-31, Office-Home). Although the paper mentions that perturbations can be computed in parallel, it does not fully demonstrate the method's scalability and computational efficiency on larger, more complex datasets (e.g., DomainNet, VisDA 2017) or with larger model architectures (ViT).
