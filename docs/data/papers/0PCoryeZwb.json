Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive evaluation. We systematically identify the **Overconfidence Phenomenon** in current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce **TH-Score**, a novel metric measuring confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose **LLM-as-a-Fuser**, an ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines, achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Evaluation", "LLM-as-a-judge", "Calibration"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/94b9f778785780c3a12e0a7508c0a4f5f0105608.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the problem of overconfidence in the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm.

This omission makes it difficult to assess the metric's effectiveness and advantages over existing, widely-used calibration measures.\n\n2. **Applicability of TH-Score to Different Confidence Methods**: In Section 4.1, the definition of TH-Score relies on confidence intervals near **0 and 1**, controlled by a parameter $\\epsilon$. This formulation seems well-suited for the Self-Confidence (SC) method, where confidence scores span the full [0, 1] range. However, its applicability to the other described confidence methods is unclear. For instance, the confidence derived from Log Probability (LogP) has a theoretical minimum of 0.5.

Critical assertions like \"while Bayesian methods are computationally infeasible\" are made without citing supporting literature, weakening their credibility. The acronym \"TH\" in TH-Score is never defined, creating ambiguity about the metric’s conceptual origin. The TH-Score is misleading: \"accuracy\" specifically refers to the accuracy of\ntargeted confidence intervals\n(high/low-confidence regions) and \"percentage\" denotes the sample coverage of these intervals, yet neither is distinguished with specialized notation (e.g., acc_interval vs. acc_global). Experimental notation is also inconsistent—Table 4 uses \"Acc\" to represent interval-specific accuracy without clarifying this in the caption, and Table 5 omits explanations for baseline abbreviations, forcing readers to infer their definitions.\n\nSuperficial Method Design and Unjustified Component Inclusion:\nThe proposed methods are conceptually simple with insufficient elaboration, and key components lack motivational grounding. LLM-as-a-Fuser’s integration of \"rationales\" is abrupt and poorly aligned with the paper’s core focus on \"confidence\": the rationale module is not justified as a natural extension of confidence-driven calibration, nor are baselines augmented with rationales for fair comparison. This raises questions about whether the framework’s performance gains stem from confidence modeling or the uncalibrated addition of rationales—suggesting potential unfair advantage over baselines.\n\nInsufficient Experimental Validation and Missing Ablation Studies:\nThe experimental design fails to validate the framework’s modular dependencies. No ablation studies are conducted for LLM-as-a-Fuser to isolate the impact of critical components: there is no comparison of results using different confidence metrics (e.g., LogP, MP instead of SC), nor validation of performance when confidence is excluded entirely. This absence prevents verification of whether confidence—the link between TH- Score and LLM-as-a-Fuser—adds tangible value, undermining the claim of a cohesive solution.\n\nLack of Cohesion Between Core Components:\nThe paper reads as two disjointed works rather than an integrated study. TH-Score and LLM-as-a-Fuser are only superficially connected via \"confidence,\" yet the necessity of confidence in this relationship is unproven. Structurally, the paper segregates their methods and experiments without cross-referencing insights. Experimentally, TH-Score is evaluated across three confidence settings (SC, MP, LogP), but LLM-as-a-Fuser exclusively uses SC, ignoring the broader findings from the metric’s validation and breaking methodological consistency.\n\nOpaque Experimental Setup:\nCritical experimental details are omitted, compromising result reproducibility and interpretation. For Table 5, the paper does not specify which source models the baselines (e.g., Majority Voting, Entropy-Weighted Voting) aggregate, nor clarify whether listed models (Qwen3-235B-A22B, GPT-4o) function as \"fuser\" models—and if so, which source LLMs they synthesize. These omissions obscure how experimental design impacts outcomes, as aggregation performance is highly sensitive to both source model diversity and fuser capability.\n\nShallow Result Analysis and Avoidance of Anomalies:\nResult interpretation is limited to numerical comparison, lacking critical depth and engagement with anomalies. For instance, Table 1 shows Qwen3-235B-A22B (TH-Score=17.52) outperforming Mistral-Nemo (TH-Score=-11.64), but the paper only attributes this to \"better calibration in high-capability models\" without analyzing\nwhy\nmodel scale or architecture drives this gap. Anomalous results are ignored: Table 5 shows Qwen3-235B-A22B’s TH-Score decreasing with Fuser, Deepseek-R1-0528 and GPT-4o performing worse as fusers, and Figure 5 depicts excessive erroneous disagreements in GPT-4o—yet none of these are explained, nor linked to the framework’s limitations (e.g., fuser’s poor rationale integration). This evasion undermines the analysis’s academic rigor.\n\nUnsubstantiated Claims of Academic Contribution:\nThe paper fails to validate its purported advantages over prior work. It cites Yang et al. (2024) noting that multi-model aggregation requires substantial resources but provides no analysis of whether LLM-as-a-Fuser reduces computational or data costs. Without comparative resource benchmarks, the framework’s practical or academic noveltyin addressing resource constraints remains unproven.\n\nNeglected Limitations and Generalization Boundaries:\nNo systematic discussion of limitations or generalization is provided. Experiments are restricted to a single benchmark (JudgeBench), with no exploration of how the methods perform in high-stakes closed domains (e.g., medical diagnosis). The paper also does not address whether TH-Score’s ε threshold or LLM-as-a-Fuser’s effectiveness requires domain-specific tuning—leaving the reliability and applicability of conclusions in real-world scenarios unsubstantiated."}, "questions": {"value": "1.For the critical assertion that \"Bayesian methods are computationally infeasible\" in the context of LLM calibration, why does the paper not cite any supporting literature to validate this claim, and how might this omission affect the credibility of the paper’s choice to avoid Bayesian approaches?\n\n2.The acronym \"TH\" in TH-Score is never defined in the paper. What does \"TH\" stand for, and why was this conceptual origin of the metric not clarified to avoid ambiguity for readers?\n\n3.In the TH-Score, \"accuracy\" specifically refers to interval-specific accuracy (for high/low-confidence regions) and \"percentage\" refers to interval sample coverage. Why were these terms not distinguished with specialized notation (e.g., acc_interval vs. acc_global)?\n\n4.Table 4 uses \"Acc\" to represent interval-specific accuracy (not global accuracy), but this is not clarified in the table caption. Why was this key distinction omitted, and how might it lead to misinterpretation of the TH-Score’s performance across different ε values?\n\n5.Table 5 includes baselines like \"Entropy W. Voting\" and \"Conf. W. Voting\" but does not explain these abbreviations. Why were these baseline definitions missing, and what steps could have been taken to improve the table’s readability?\n\n6.LLM-as-a-Fuser integrates \"rationales\" of source models, but the paper does not justify how this component aligns with the core focus on \"confidence-driven calibration.\" What motivated the addition of rationales, and why were baselines not augmented with rationales to ensure a fair comparison of the framework’s performance gains?\n\n7.The paper claims LLM-as-a-Fuser’s advantages stem from confidence-aware aggregation, yet no ablation studies test performance when using different confidence metrics (e.g., LogP, MP instead of SC) or when confidence is excluded entirely. Why were these ablation studies omitted, and how can the paper prove that confidence (not just rationales) is critical to the framework’s success?\n\n8.TH-Score is evaluated across three confidence settings (SC, MP, LogP), but LLM-as-a-Fuser exclusively uses SC. Why was this methodological inconsistency introduced, and how does it impact the coherence between the metric’s validation and the framework’s experimental design?\n\n9.Table 5 compares LLM-as-a-Fuser with baseline aggregation methods (e.g., Majority Voting), but it does not specify which source models these baselines aggregate, nor clarify if listed models (e.g., Qwen3-235B-A22B) act as \"fusers\" and which source LLMs they synthesize. Why were these critical experimental details omitted?\n\n10.Table 1 shows Qwen3-235B-A22B (TH-Score=17.52) outperforming Mistral-Nemo (TH-Score=-11.64), but the paper only attributes this to \"better calibration in high-capability models.\" What specific aspects of model scale (e.g., parameter size) or architecture (e.g., training data, reasoning modules) drive this calibration gap, and why were these factors not analyzed?\n\n11.In Table 5, Qwen3-235B-A22B’s TH-Score decreases when used as a fuser, and Deepseek-R1- 0528/GPT-4o perform worse as fusers. Why do these anomalies occur, and how do they relate to potential limitations of LLM-as-a-Fuser (e.g., poor rationale integration for certain models)?\n\n12.Figure 5 shows GPT-4o has excessive erroneous disagreements when deviating from majority voting. The paper claims this reflects \"poor integration ability,\" but it does not link this to the framework’s design. How do GPT-4o’s erroneous disagreements specifically reveal flaws in LLM-as-a-Fuser’s rationale synthesis or confidence weighting?\n\n13.The paper cites Yang et al. (2024) noting that multi-model aggregation requires substantial resources, but it provides no analysis of whether LLM-as-a-Fuser reduces computational/data costs compared to prior methods like Collaborative Calibration. Why was this comparative resource benchmark omitted?\n\n14.Experiments are restricted to the JudgeBench benchmark, with no testing in high-stakes closed domains (e.g., medical diagnosis). Why were these domains not included, and how can the paper assess LLM-as-a-Fuser’s generalization to scenarios where calibration errors have severe consequences?\n\n15.The paper does not discuss whether TH-Score’s ε threshold or LLM-as-a-Fuser’s effectiveness requires domain-specific tuning.
