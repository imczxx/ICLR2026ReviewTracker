Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank, a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40% compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Efficient AI", "Compression", "LLMs"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f13c53d16fdbe2e43a5b274aad9196a976b0c553.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f3e240d52fe2e6f8cf79f2eeeb3aa5075d8ab0a2.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes D-Rank, a SVD-based compression work for LLM that dynamically allocates compression ranks across layers based on their information density, rather than applying uniform compression ratios.

Missing citation and limited novelty. The paper's core contribution—dynamic rank allocation for LLM compression—is not new. Hua et al. (2023) \"Dynamic Low-rank Estimation for Transformer-based Language Models\" (EMNLP 2023 Findings) directly addresses dynamic rank estimation for transformers. The authors cite the 2022 work from the same group but omit their 2023 follow-up on the exact same problem.  This makes the novelty claims appear overstated.\n2. The core technical contribution—using spectral entropy-based effective rank to measure information density—lacks proper justification.  The paper provides no explanation for why spectral entropy is the optimal metric, or does it compare against alternatives like stable rank, nuclear norm, Fisher information (FWSVD), or activation-based importance (ASVD). Table 1 shows effective rank values vary across layers, but doesn't demonstrate these values actually correlate with optimal compression performance. The mathematical formulation (Equations 1-2: normalizing squared singular values into a probability distribution, then exponentiating the Shannon entropy) appears arbitrary without theoretical grounding.\n3. Unclear and Potentially Unfair Experimental Settings. The experimental setup is poorly specified, creating uncertainty about fair comparison. For example, Table 3 shows FWSVD with perplexity 18156 at 40% - is this without fine-tuning while D-Rank gets updates? Looking at Table 3 (LLaMA-7B results), the numbers for FWSVD and basic SVD are catastrophically bad (perplexities in the thousands), while ASVD, SVD-LLM, Basis Sharing, and D-Rank are reasonable. This suggests: A) FWSVD and SVD are evaluated zero-shot (no recovery procedure); B) ASVD, SVD-LLM, Basis Sharing, D-Rank get some form of correction/update"}, "questions": {"value": "1.
