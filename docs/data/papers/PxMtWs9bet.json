Inspired by the integrated processing of color and structure of the human visual system (HVS), we propose Expo-GS, a novel framework that decomposes HDR-NVS into three interpretable components, namely,  Irradiance Field Training, Geometry Field Training, and Interactive Joint Training. Central to Expo-GS is the exposure-aware signed distance function (Expo-SDF), which dynamically reweights geometric supervision via localized exposure reliability estimation, suppressing noisy gradients from unstable regions while enhancing structure learning in well-exposed areas. Building on this, we design an interactive optimization strategy that synchronizes Gaussian primitive growth and pruning with evolving Expo-SDF cues, enabling exposure-aware density control and eliminating hallucinated structures near exposure transitions. Experiments show that Expo-GS significantly outperforms prior methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. It achieves a peak PSNR of 39.06 dB under HDR settings and up to 41.38 dB in the LDR-OE configuration, excelling in preserving high-frequency textures and maintaining structural consistency.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["High Dynamic Range", "Novel View Synthesis"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/68bd1eb7d5ffa62f315350a0908af04777849034.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Expo-GS, an exposure-aware framework for HDR novel view synthesis (HDR-NVS).

However, the modular and stage-wise nature of its technical design makes the work read more like a well-engineered integration of existing techniques than a fundamentally innovative contribution.\n\nIn particular, the core component, Expo-SDF, is essentially an intuitive exposure-weighted extension of the traditional SDF, with limited conceptual novelty. While the paper successfully demonstrates that combining HDR and SDF is effective, it does not provide sufficient justification that such a combination is necessary or deeply integrated at the algorithmic level. Consequently, the contribution of this work lies more in its solid engineering implementation and practical system design than in proposing a genuinely new research direction or model architecture with substantial theoretical insight.\n\n\n2. The comparison methods are too limited. Basically, only HDR-NeRF and HDR-GS among the compared methods are in a similar direction.
