Several recent approaches aim to address this issue, including Sink Attention in GPT-OSS and Gated Attention in Qwen3-Next. However, a comprehensive analysis of attention sink is lacking, and the necessity of eliminating it remains unclear. In this work, we provide both theoretical and empirical evidence showing that attention sink emerges as a mechanism to resolve forced attention, yet it limits the model’s expressive capacity. By analyzing the connection between attention sink and Gated Attention, we demonstrate that attention sink implicitly constructs a native Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) within attention layers. This insight reveals why only a fixed subset of attention heads contributes to generation, which closely resembles the expert collapse problem encountered in MoE. To enhance the utilization balance of attention heads, we propose a sink-aware training algorithm with an auxiliary load balancing loss designed for attention layers. We hope this study offers a new practical perspective on attention sink and Gated Attention, and encourages further exploration of how to leverage the inherent MoE mechanisms within attention layers.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Attention Sink", "Gated Attention", "Large Language Models"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0773202c9f6719ced2e849ee5930f740b61c91d1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work analyzes the “attention sink” phenomenon and argues that the sink weight functions like a head-level gate, making an attention layer in transformer block a native Mixture-of-Experts structure. Specifically, this work first elaborates that using the first token as the attention sink reduces the precision of query-to-key selection, indicating the necessity of eliminating attention sink for models’ expressive capacity enhancement. Then, this work demonstrates a formal equivalence between attention sinks and the gating factor in MoE. Moreover, this work further shows that the heads in the first few layers show higher activation level and stronger global capacity. Finally, this work reveals the occurrence of expert collapse within attention head and proving that the proportion of dormant heads is higher due to the expert collapse for larger models. To solve this expert collapse, inspired by MoE, this work finally propose an auxiliary load-balancing loss across heads with a refined variant that excludes early layers and top collapsed heads which can be regarded as the shared experts as in the MoE models.

The theoretical derivation of connecting attention sink (implicit gating factor) to an explicit gating factor is convincing, offering an interesting perspective on attention sinks and gated attention via showing the attention structure with multiple heads is inherently MoE structure. This potentially makes it possible to think attention problems as MoE routing problems.\n\n2. In the meantime, the comprehensive analyses and empirical observations including the head-level metrics before and after training corroborate the proposed equivalence between sink mass and gating, making the claim more robust.\n\n3. The proposed  auxiliary load-balancing loss function inspired from MoE scenario is convincing and makes sense, the fine-grained exclusion of first few years and collapsed heads is intuitive and empirically justified. The corresponding experiment results of fine-tuning existing models with the proposed loss function are convincing and align with the theoretical claims.\n\n4.

The text asserts the first layer receives “only current-token information” and, if it fails to capture global context, the second layer will again process mostly current-token content. However, in decoder-only transformers, self-attention at layer 1 already has causal access to all prior tokens, so the statement risks conflating MLP channel information with attention context. This statement should be carefully adjusted. \n\n2. Even though the proposed auxiliary load-balancing loss function can effectively mitigate expert collapse in attention heads, the authors report that the initial variant unintentionally reduced sink usage across the board, necessitating the refined Eq. (9), which underscores design sensitivity and potential fine-tuning instability and robustness issues for different models. \n\n3. The evaluation seems limited. The reported gains are on AceReason-Nemotron fine-tuning and a set of reasoning benchmarks; it would strengthen claims to include long-context tasks (where sink is often exploited) and more strong reasoning tasks.

Through a continuing fine-tuning setup, the authors show that employing auxiliary loss similar to MoE community could bring some performance gains."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I think the most interesting part of this paper is to use an analogy of MoE to understand self-attention and employ MoE techniques to improve self-attention. However, the authors fail to explain this with more contents and empirical studies, especially considering some parts of this paper seem to be redundant.\n\nFrom Section 2, two main messages are: (1) first token acts as attention sink, and it emerges due to normalisation in softmax, or called \"forced\" attention in the paper. (2) attention sink functions through the cosine similarity of queries and keys.  However,  these two messages are already covered by [1]. Additionally, [1] seems to be an early attempt to mitigate attention sink by relaxing normalisation in softmax (using sigmoid attention without normalization). The authors only cite [1] in Appendix. This not only ignores the contributions of [1], but also makes section 2 redundant. Since MoE is the most important part in this paper, I think section 2 should be a motivated part with previous literature and understanding of recent models. Of course, this reduces the contribution of this paper. \n\nIn section 3, the authors convey the message that the first few layers of the model plays a significant role in generation. This is drawn from the visualisation of Figure 5. However, I believe this message is not new to the community, like also shown in [1-3]. But I appreciate the design of local/global metrics and hope to see more analysis on receptive field theory as mentioned in this paper. Again, metric in (5) was proposed in [1] without citation.\n\nWith the analogy of MoE,  I feel that the authors fail to conduct enough empirical analysis in this part. For example, the authors only one continuing fine-tuning experiment (with LoRA) to show the performance of auxiliary loss. What are the performance of full fine-tuning? Whether the results are sensitive to k and $\\alpha$ used in equation 9? The authors follow a style of mechanism understanding for storytelling. However, after fine-tuning LLMs with a new loss, they fail to conduct analysis on this new model to conclude whether the assumptions are valid. \n\n\nReferences:\\\n[1] Gu et al.
