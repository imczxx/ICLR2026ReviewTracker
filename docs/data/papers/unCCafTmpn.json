We present Prompt-SSLC, a unified framework that integrates three synergistic components to balance stability and adaptability in streaming data scenarios. First, Semi-Supervised Sequential Leader Clustering (SSLC) dynamically updates prototypes to accommodate incoming data streams, ensuring flexibility in clustering. To enhance discriminability and mitigate prototype overlap, SSLC incorporates a Distance-Aware (DA) update mechanism that optimizes prototype distributions, maintaining inter-class separation as new data arrive. Second, dual prompting augments the foundation model: a *Task* Prompt guides category discovery, while an *Instance* Prompt dynamically recalibrates features to prevent drift toward previously learned classes without requiring retraining. Third, an Open-Set-Aware (OSA) classifier employs uncertainty estimation to identify and filter ambiguous samples, ensuring robust prototype updates. This cohesive integration of streaming clustering, feature recalibration, and uncertainty-aware filtering establishes a robust framework for OCD. Extensive experiments on generic and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate that Prompt-SSLC achieves significant performance improvements, setting a new state-of-the-art for OCD.", "tldr": "Prompt-SSLC integrates SSLC, dual prompting, and open-set-aware classification for real-time category discovery, dynamically updating prototypes and features to achieve state-of-the-art performance on streaming data.", "keywords": ["On-the-Fly Category Discovery", "Dual Prompt Learning", "Semi-Supervised Clustering", "Sequential Leader Clustering", "Open-Set Recognition", "Streaming Data"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d2a21b6d17a0bebfd86446972c5c9e9c8460f18f.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4a494ca0cbf7e90b8b52d4a9e8c54fe39d83c02a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper addresses the problem of On-the-fly Category Discovery (OCD), the task of continuously identifying new or emerging categories in data streams without halting or retraining the model.

For example, consider why dual prompts outperform other PEFT methods, how distance thresholds are tuned. Furthermore, analyzing computational or latency cost for true online deployment would be useful.\n- Although results are strong, the main metric used is accuracy gains.
