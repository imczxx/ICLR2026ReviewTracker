Recent decomposition-based approaches aim to disentangle these complex dynamics into separate spatial and temporal components, facilitating clearer and more effective modeling. However, varying information densities between spatial structures and temporal patterns remain a substantial challenge, potentially leading to inaccurate feature interactions and subsequently degraded forecast performance. Furthermore, existing forecasting models often lack explicit interpretability, obscuring spatial-temporal influences driving predictions. To address these critical challenges, inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Decomposition Learning architecture (STKAN). The STKAN framework explicitly separates and individually models spatial and temporal dependencies using specialized multi-order KAN modules. It encodes complex input series into spatio-temporal embeddings through an adaptive node-group assignment mechanism. Dedicated spatial and temporal KAN modules independently and robustly capture internode relationships and temporal dynamics at multiple orders, explicitly modeling distinct underlying patterns. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on widely recognized benchmark datasets convincingly demonstrate that STKAN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and interpretability, clearly delineating the critical spatial groupings and essential temporal patterns that significantly influence predictions, thus greatly benefiting real-world intelligent transportation scenarios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Kolmogorov–Arnold Network", "Spatial-Temporal Forecasting", "Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Modeling", "Adaptive Spatial Aggregation"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/aaabd674ad2bbe3fb66e41ed54452c626451a8de.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes STKAN, a Kolmogorov–Arnold Network-based framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

While the paper claims that KANs enable disentangled spatial–temporal modeling, the motivation behind this choice is not clearly justified or theoretically supported. The Kolmogorov–Arnold theorem describes the universal decomposition of multivariate functions into sums of univariate ones, but the paper does not convincingly explain why or how KAN’s learnable functional mappings naturally facilitate spatial–temporal separation in traffic data. Moreover, many prior architectures (e.g., STAEFormer, GMAN) already use isolated spatial and temporal attention blocks to decouple spatial and temporal dependencies without invoking KANs. The authors do not provide sufficient argumentation or empirical evidence to show that KAN-based decomposition offers a fundamentally superior mechanism compared to attention-based or graph convolution-based disentanglement.\n\nW2. Although the paper includes several ablation experiments, it omits critical configurations that are essential to understanding the contribution of each KAN component. Specifically, the paper does not include w/o S-KAN and w/o T-KAN.
