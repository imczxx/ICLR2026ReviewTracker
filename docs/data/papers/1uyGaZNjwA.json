Existing adaptation methods typically address drift in isolation, overlooking spatio-temporal correlations—not only between streams but also among drift events—and failing to enable synchronized adaptation across large-scale data streams. Furthermore, current graph-based approaches often rely on static, pre-defined embeddings, limiting adaptability in highly dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose GAMAD, a graph-driven autonomous adaptation framework for multi-stream concept drift that integrates spatio-temporal graph construction with dynamic and predictive adaptation mechanisms for multi-stream forecasting. GAMAD dynamically constructs correlation graphs from historical distributional statistics and subgraph structures, eliminating dependence on pre-defined topology and enabling generalizable representations. For online multi-stream evolution, it performs noise-tolerant windowing for accurate node-level drift detection, and then expands from drift-centric nodes to localized subgraphs based on current multi-stream correlations. To further enhance forecasting generalization, we employ a hierarchical topological matching strategy to retrieve and reuse previously observed drift patterns, enabling more predictable adaptation to inherently unpredictable drifts. Extensive experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that GAMAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forecasting performance. We also show applicability to recommendation scenarios, where continuous adaptation to evolving user preferences is essential.

Our main concern regarding originality is that multi-stream concept drift adaptation has been widely studied, with prior work already exploring dynamic graphs and localized adaptation. The proposed framework largely integrates existing components rather than introducing a fundamentally new mechanism. The contribution is therefore more engineering-oriented than conceptual.\n\nW2. The paper does not adequately demonstrate that the proposed components are individually necessary. There is no clear ablation across the graph-level, subgraph-level, and node-level representations to validate the claimed hierarchical modeling benefits. The paper employs a fusion-before-diffusion strategy, but does not compare it against alternative designs. Further, the framework lacks ablation on the hierarchical drift pattern matching module and the local subgraph expansion mechanism, both of which are highlighted as key contributions.\n\nW3. The framework relies on multi-stage graph and subgraph sampling with adjacency-matrix-based operations, which may introduce substantial computational cost. The paper lacks complexity analysis and runtime comparisons, making scalability to large graphs unclear.\n\nW4. The dynamic graph construction relies on historical distribution statistics and subgraph structure extraction. However, in scenarios where inter-stream correlations change abruptly at high frequency, the constructed dynamic graph may lag behind the real underlying dynamics, leading to delayed or suboptimal adaptive responses. \n\nW5. The node-level drift detection mechanism is based on temporal window statistics and adaptive thresholding, which implicitly assumes local distribution stability. In high-noise or adversarial disturbance settings, this approach may result in false positives or delayed detection.

While most existing methods assume a single temporal stream, the proposed framework explicitly models multi-stream environments where concept drift can propagate through correlated nodes.

The proposed multi-stream correlation graph construction computes adjacency matrices at the global, subgraph, and node levels.

The graph-driven online adaptation module introduces several hyper parameters (e.g., β, h, K, q), yet the paper does not discuss the sensitivity of the method to these choices. It would be helpful if the authors could analyze the robustness of the method with respect to these hyper parameters and provide guidance on how to set them in practical scenarios.\n\n3.
