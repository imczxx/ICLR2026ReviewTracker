Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes hallucinations. \nHowever, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model (LLM) backbones when curating the training data. \nMoreover, they heavily rely on offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM alignment. \nIn this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework, Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of input images.  \nMoreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Multimodal Models", "Preference Optimization"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ffb5be5323092a4959fa57a95ffdd237a4b0642e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/63b267f7c3e4a7ebf715e1ba0e85394693899336.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles one of the most persistent problems in multimodal model training: modality imbalance, where large multimodal models rely too heavily on their language backbone and ignore the visual evidence.

Additionally, MME and MMHal* need to be normalized from 0-100 (instead of 0-2000 and 0-6) to allow for proper averaging.\n* Most prior alignment work, including the works cited in this paper, report results for aligning LLaVA 1.5, which allows more direct comparison between methods In this work, the authors only report results on the more recent Qwen2 and Qwen2.5 base models. For direct comparison one must therefore rely on the author’s reproduction of prior work on this new base model. However, the reported reproductions seem to achieve no or only limited improvement over the Qwen baselines, which may suggest that either these previously published works are not generally effective on these newer base models or the reproductions may not be fully optimized. For example, with the adjusted averaging (norming MME and MMHal), for RLAIF-V the draft reports a -0.6% average regression over the Qwen2-VL-7B baseline and a modest +0.4% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. For CSR the numbers are -0.5% and +0.1%, etc. For a more direct comparison, perhaps MBPO could also be applied on LLaVA 1.5 for a direct comparison with published results?\n* The offline data is produced by adversarially perturbing the input image to minimize the likelihood of the ground-truth response. The paper suggests that this would induce the model to rely on the “prior biases of the LLM backbone”, but doesn’t discuss why the resulting response would satisfy this criteria when e.g. an image that induces a refusal response may also satisfy the adversarial objective (though Figure 3 provides some empirical evidence).\n* The paper reports hallucination via MMHal and CHAIR scores (without recall for CHAIR). Both these benchmarks exhibit some known weaknesses as discussed in [BDHS]. This provides a somewhat limited view on the resulting hallucination performance. Adding AMBER [AMBER], the vision enabled MMHalBench-V variant [BDHS], Pope [POPE], or even DeCapBench [PAINTING] may provide a more comprehensive picture.\n* In the introduction, the paper claims that “Furthermore, the inherently offline nature of DPO—relying exclusively on pre-collected model responses—limits its ability to adapt to distributional shifts during training, thereby hindering optimization effectiveness”, though online as well as iterative DPO strategies have been successfully explored [OnlineDAP] [BDHS] [RLAIF-V].\n\n\n\n[POVID] Zhou, Yiyang, et al. \"Aligning modalities in vision large language models via preference fine-tuning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.11411 (2024).\n\n[BDHS] Amirloo, Elmira, et al. \"Understanding alignment in multimodal llms: A comprehensive study.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.02477 (2024).\n\n[PAI] Liu, Shi, Kecheng Zheng, and Wei Chen. \"Paying more attention to image: A training-free method for alleviating hallucination in lvlms.\" European Conference on Computer Vision.

What motivated this choice? To me, the choice is not clearly intuitive. Some prior works (also cited in this paper) describe a relationship with lack of attention to visual tokens and visual hallucinations [Povid] [PAI] [BDHS], which would intuitive translate to low IIG scores suggesting that such sampling may yield a set where the base model may be less likely to hallucinate on to begin with? On the other hand, sampling for IIG may yield samples where the image content is more necessary to answer the questions yielding samples that could be informative for training. Was any further study done on the impact of the choice in the paper?\n* In section 4.1 the work describes that a reward of 2 is given “to the chosen response”. Does this mean reward is only assigned with the chosen response is correctly and fully reproduced (i.e. full string matching)? Unless this data was seen during SFT, would this not be difficult for the model?\n* In the reproduction of POVID, was the image distortion objective reproduced as described in the original paper? [POVID]\n* In the reproduction of RLAIF-V, was the same iterative training method followed, which collects online feedback? (see section 2.3 in [RLAIF-V])\n* The authors compare the proposed adversarial noise injection with random noise as proposed in [POVID], however, as mentioned in that paper and later also studied in [BDHS] injecting such noise needs some calibration in order to not diverge too much or too little from the original context. The example in figure 5, which shows no errors in the noised responses when random noise is used, may indicate that the noising hyper parameters are not chosen optimally, potentially under-reporting this baseline performance?\n\n\n\n[POVID] Zhou, Yiyang, et al. \"Aligning modalities in vision large language models via preference fine-tuning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.11411 (2024).\n\n[BDHS] Amirloo, Elmira, et al. \"Understanding alignment in multimodal llms: A comprehensive study.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.02477 (2024).\n\n[PAI] Liu, Shi, Kecheng Zheng, and Wei Chen. \"Paying more attention to image: A training-free method for alleviating hallucination in lvlms.\" European Conference on Computer Vision.
