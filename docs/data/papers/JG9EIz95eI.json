Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human–machine interoperability at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attack. In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety (and security) issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline, which we call **SafeCoop**, that integrates a semantic firewall, language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32 critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides guidance for advancing research on safe and trustworthy language-driven V2X collaboration in transportation.

However, the system design only explicitly addresses anomaly detection through trust scoring and filtering. It remains unclear how performance is directly optimized, or whether the authors simply assume that anomaly detection will inherently improve performance. This assumption should be explicitly stated and justified.\n\n- Insufficient attack implementation details: While Section 3 and Appendix D provide a taxonomy of attacks, the paper lacks a detailed explanation of how attacks are actually designed and implemented in the evaluation. For reproducibility and proper assessment of the defense mechanisms, more specifics are needed on attack generation, particularly for the MLLM-based Content Spoofing attacks (e.g., prompt engineering strategies, attack success rates, stealthiness measures). Further, in Table 1, several adversarial scenarios (w/o defense) achieve better performance than the Benign (Non-collab) baseline across multiple metrics. This counterintuitive result raises questions about attack severity and undermines claims about the effectiveness of the defense. While Appendix G partially addresses this through the computation scaling phenomenon, this critical finding deserves prominent discussion in the main paper with a thorough analysis of what it implies for both attack potency and defense necessity.\n\n- Unexplained performance degradation in ablation study: Table 3 shows that adding LPC and MSC agents actually increases the Vehicle Collision (VC) score under CS+MCF attacks, which is concerning. The paper provides no investigation or explanation for this degradation. Could false positives in anomaly detection be causing the defense to filter legitimate messages, thereby reducing situational awareness and increasing collisions? Without presenting false positive/false negative rates and analyzing this phenomenon, the reliability of the defense pipeline remains questionable."}, "questions": {"value": "How is \"performance\" explicitly optimized in the system design, or is it assumed to naturally follow from anomaly detection?\n\nWhy do some adversarial scenarios (Table 1) outperform the non-collaborative baseline?

How is each of the attacks staged? What is the range of the attack, e.g., How much temporal misalignment in relay/replay interference? What is being introduced in content spoofing? How many forged connections are there in the Sybil attack? These are important details to provide context to gauge the evaluation metrics. Whether these staged attacks are trivial or sophisticated, the results can lead to entirely different conclusions. One way to show the sophistication is to show if conventional defense against these attacks can be successful, how does LLM compare against conventional methods, and whether using an LLM is an overkill.\n- Missing details on how the LPC agent compares ego perception with received messages. Is it taking a multi-view image or lidar as input? What if the received message is outside the field of view of the perception module?\n- Figure 1, appearing before the abstract, could use additional legends and details to be self-explanatory. What do the numbers after CD, CS, and CS+MCF mean? Why is the MCF description pointing to the CS score? And CS description points to CS+MCF score? Before the readers read the abstract, a couple of legends and explanations could be very helpful to avoid confusion.\n- The paper claims to have studied four attack surfaces (CD, RI, CS, MCF). What has been studied for CD (connection disruption)? There are no results on CD in Table 1. Table 2 is attack detection, not defense. If it's difficult to detect and evaluate, ok to tone down a bit.\n- The evaluation results show LLMs are insufficient in safeguarding against attacks, cannot recover collaborative driving performance before attacks, and cannot be run in real-time.
