Our layer-wise algorithm (i) derives an approximate second-order saliency score that aggregates Hessian-trace information across time steps, (ii) incorporates a component sensitivity analysis to guide feed-forward network (FFN) pruning, which also sheds light on where redundancy resides in mamba architecture, (iii) can be easily extended to semi-structured and structured sparsity.

Experimental Scope and Generalization: Although multiple scales of Mamba models are evaluated, the experiments are limited to Mamba architecture alone. The claim that OBS-style pruning generalizes to state-space models would be much stronger if demonstrated on alternative SSMs (e.g., S4 or S5) and hybrid models (e.g., JAMBA, Zamba). Additionally, assessing the robustness of the pruning method under longer context lengths or distributional shifts—key strengths of SSMs—would provide more convincing evidence of practical utility.\n\n3.

The benefits of pruning for deployment (such as latency, memory savings, or throughput improvements) are asserted but not quantified.

The core motivation mentions that Mamba(1 and 2) models have billions of parameters which hinders deployment. However, > 95% of the parameter count lies in the in_proj and out_proj layers that are just fully connected projection layers. The paper instead focuses on the SSM layers instead, which (especially in Mamba2) have much lesser impact on the overall efficiency (in both parallel scan and recurrent inference modes). At the very least, the writing should be made clearer to reflect this so that this does not mislead the eventual reader.\n\n- The authors seem aware of the above limitation and did try to investigate pruning the in_proj, out_proj, and other layers (in section 3.4 and in B.2.3), however the results incur a significant performance drop.\n\n- When I compare the dense Mamba-1.4B model to the pruned Mamba-2.8B model, I see similar or worse performance (for both downstream evals and runtime efficiency) for the pruned larger model. For the method to be practically applicable, I would expect to see better performance for the pruned larger model (otherwise why would a user not just use the dense model directly)?\n\n- The paper focuses more on Mamba-1, whereas Mamba-2 has objectively been shown to be more practically relevant (for general LM tasks and also long-context associative recall etc) in the Mamba-2 paper. While some of the results like the speedup (e.g. the numbers in B.2.4 and Table 8) make sense for Mamba-1, I wonder how much they generalize to Mamba-2 (given the different structure of the A tensor).\n\n- In Mamba2, the A tensor has a negligible number of parameters (often a tiny number like 32 corresponding to the number of heads). I feel like this paper overindexes on the token mixer portion of the whole architecture, whereas the largest gains in efficiency (both speedup and parameter reduction) are to be had in the other bulkier parts of the model\n\n- The results in Tables 11 - 13 are extremely suspicious. Does SparseGPT really get extremely poor numbers on the first 3 tasks, and then is competitive on the rest of the tasks and ends up with a competitive average score? It would be great if you can check/verify this.\n\n- While the authors do evaluate on some of the standard downstream LM datasets, I feel like the overall evaluation (and ablation studies) in the paper could have been more rigorous. This is especially heightened by the fact that the proposed method is training-free and requires minimal changes to be able to run inference on datasets. Specific ideas here that could have been tried include running the same process on a model like Vision Mamba (to show the applicability to another modality), showing validation loss trends on the pretraining dataset, additional datasets typically used in LM eval harness (e.g. the ones reported in the Mamba-2 paper), and perhaps even doing it on a pretrained hybrid Mamba-Transformer model.

The other baseline methods seem more competitive on Mamba2, so it seems surprising to not evaluate a broader range of parameters here.\n\n- We get extremely bad performance for the baselines on Mamba-1, but very good performance on Mamba-2. What is the reason behind this? Is there a potential problem in the evaluation setting?\n\n- A useful and well calibrated experiment here could be to run inference on the validation set of a dataset like FineWeb (analogous to the perplexities reported on the first three datasets). This is a strong proxy for downstream LM performance, and any deltas here would be good to see between the baselines and the proposed method.\n\n- Could you please elaborate about the methodology used to produce Tables 8 and 9?
