A critical limitation of current models is their inability, both theoretically and methodologically, to disentangle perturbation-induced effects from the pervasive background cellular transcriptional programs that remain invariant to perturbations but dominate observed gene expression patterns. To address this, we propose a latent variable generative model that explicitly partitions latent space into an variant subspace where a latent causal model is employed to capture perturbations, and an invariant subspace capturing unperturbed cellular programs. We establish a principled foundation for disentangling these two subspaces, and identifying the latent causal model, by differentiability analysis. We then translate our theoretical findings into a practical method that more accurately predicts perturbation effects, supported by the theoretical guarantees. On both simulated and large-scale genetic perturbation benchmarks, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting cellular responses to unseen combinations, significantly outperforming existing methods. Crucially, by disentangling unperturbed cellular programs from perturbation-induced effects, our method prevents the latter from being confounded or absorbed into the dominant invariant patterns. This separation allows the true causal impact of perturbations to be isolated and reliably estimated, thereby enabling accurate prediction of unseen combinatorial gene perturbations at the single-cell level.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Bioinformatics", "Causal representation learning", "Single cell perturbation", "Interpretability"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ca92b3649415f35293fad25fe565e588ebdd7e8a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel generative model (cDAG-VAE) for predicting the effects of gene perturbations in single-cell transcriptomic data.

The empirical comparison is restricted to other VAE-based methods and omits simple statistical and non-VAE baselines. Additionally, the paper does not include a comparison against SAMS-VAE (“Modeling Cellular Perturbations with the Sparse Additive Mechanism Shift Variational Autoencoder”, Bereket et al., 2023), which was specifically designed for interpretable perturbation modeling with causal structure. No linear or GLM-based approaches are tested. Recent work by Huber et al. in “Evaluating Deep Models for Predicting Single-Cell Perturbation Outcomes” (Nature Methods, 2025) highlights that deep learning models often fail to outperform trivial linear baselines in perturbation prediction. The absence of even a basic additive or no-change baseline, as used in “Systema: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Single-Cell Perturbation Modeling” (Roohani et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2024) and “Benchmarking Foundation Models for Cell Perturbation Prediction” (Szalai et al., BMC Genomics, 2025), shows a serious gap. Similarly, specialized models such as GPerturb from “Gaussian Process Modeling of Single-Cell Perturbation Responses” (Koh et al., 2023), or alternative ML architectures (e.g., transformers or graph models), are entirely ignored. Transformer-based models like scGPT and scBERT, and graph-based models like GEARS (introduced in “Predicting Transcriptional Outcomes of Novel Multigene Perturbations”, Roohani et al., 2024), were shown to match or outperform VAE-based methods in Systema. Without comparisons to these broader approaches, it remains unclear whether the reported improvements stem from model novelty or simply from benchmark favorability. \n\n2. The paper relies exclusively on RMSE and R² for performance evaluation, both of which are problematic when applied to high-dimensional gene expression space. These metrics are often dominated by expression of highly variable or abundant genes and may obscure biologically meaningful differences. In contrast, recent benchmarks employ more informative metrics for causal accuracy, such as Pearson correlation on top differentially expressed genes, or precision in identifying the perturbed target gene itself. The current paper does not include any such metrics, e.g., accuracy of identifying the perturbed gene, which are essential to support claims about “accurate perturbation prediction” or causal interpretability.\n\n3. All experiments are performed on the Norman2019 dataset, a CRISPRa Perturb-seq screen in K562 cells with 105 single-gene and 131 combinatorial perturbations. While this is a valuable dataset, its exclusive use is problematic. No results are presented on other datasets such as the CRISPRi screens.\n\n4. The paper repeatedly claims to recover the “true causal impact” of perturbations and implies that the learned variant latent factors reflect genuine causal mechanisms. If the model’s latent directed acyclic graph (DAG) is intended to reflect biological causal structure, then it should be evaluated using standard gene regulatory network (GRN) inference benchmarks. Despite generating a DAG over latent variables, the paper provides no quantitative comparison to existing GRN inference methods or ground truth networks (e.g., from ChIP-seq, transcription factor databases, or curated pathway maps). Without such validation, it's unclear whether the learned graph reflects meaningful biological regulation or simply captures statistical variation in the latent space.\n\n5. The identifiability results in Section 3 rely on strong and biologically questionable assumptions such as a smooth, invertible generative map and perturbation richness across all latent dimensions. In reality, gene expression is noisy, sparse, and often affects only a subset of factors. Moreover, the theoretical guarantees assume global optimization of a non-convex objective, with no discussion of convergence or robustness. These assumptions are not tested in practice and should be more clearly acknowledged."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Why are no statistical baselines included in the comparison?\n2.

This risks that all non-linear causal effects are modeled incorrectly, impacting the disentanglement the model claims to achieve.\n\n2. The identifiability proof requires the decoder to be a diffeomorphism, but the mapping from a low dimensional latent space to a high dimension expression profile is almost certainly not invertible.\n\n3.
