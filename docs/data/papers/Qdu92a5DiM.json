The model learns to transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution. Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from the sequence length. For \\textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization.

Across the reviews, we see broad agreement that the refinement based discrete flow formulation, the GA plus PPO optimization scheme, and the performance on PMO and lead optimization are promising.\n\n## Practical Focus on Quality and Diversity, not Raw Validity\n\nSeveral reviewers noted lower validity in some tasks. While we agree that validity is an important metric, we want to emphasize that in practical applications the central question is whether the generated molecules are useful, that is, synthesizable, drug-like, and diverse. Our quality metric combines validity and uniqueness in a way that directly reflects this. It excludes degenerate edge cases where a model generates the same valid molecule repeatedly, or where only a single valid structure appears among many repeats. We also note that a moderate drop in validity from 95 percent to 75 percent requires only about 1.3 times more samples to recover the same number of valid molecules, whereas low diversity cannot be compensated in this way.\n\n## Fragment-Constrained Generation\n\nSince multiple reviewers raised concerns about our performance on fragment-constrained tasks, we thoroughly investigated observed differences. In the following, we want to highlight specific issues with baseline comparability that we found.\n\n### GenMol\n\nWhile Fig. 2 of the GenMol paper suggests that the only difference between de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation is the use of a fixed prompt, the public implementation reveals that GenMol performs fragment constrained linker design and scaffold morphing through multi step rejection sampling, not direct conditional completion. The function starting at:\n\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/genmol/blob/f384e1e05c2f810302886d637ea5f0b558b9be3a/src/genmol/sampler.py#L130C1-L150C23\n\nsplits each fragment into a prefix and a suffix, generates both sides independently, and then reconstructs molecules through mix_sequences and filter_by_substructure, silently discarding invalid, unparsable or non matching generations. Since only the surviving reconstructions are returned, the reported validity excludes all failed generations and is therefore not comparable to raw validity numbers reported for other models.\n\nIn a recent update in the repository README, the authors acknowledge this and report results without the rejection based filtering. Under this more fair setting, their validity and quality on linker design and scaffold morphing drop to **very low** levels. To be completely open, they also introduce a new SAFE syntax to mitigate this, but the updated formalism is not accompanied by a publication and the timeline for evaluation is too short. Moreover, GenMol V2 shows a substantial drop in performance on the PMO benchmark. Taken together, these observations strengthen our results because they suggest that the original GenMol numbers in the paper cannot be used as a reliable point of comparison for fragment constrained generation tasks.\n\n### SAFE-GPT\n\nSAFE-GPT also employs constrained decoding tailored to fragment constrained tasks. Appendix A.4 describes constrained beam search to enforce fragment presence and connectivity constrained generation for scaffold morphing and linker design. Since no unconstrained results are reported, comparisons against GenMol should be interpreted with care. These constraint mechanisms strongly affect validity and should be made explicit when comparing models.\n\nWe include the updated table below, which reflects a more consistent comparison across models. We hope this resolves the concerns raised about our performance on this specific task. We include the updated results in the revised paper."}}, "id": "0hMUaj9hAy", "forum": "Qdu92a5DiM", "replyto": "Qdu92a5DiM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5933/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5933/Authors"], "number": 8, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5933/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763113925765, "cdate": 1763113925765, "tmdate": 1763307839181, "mdate": 1763307839181, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
