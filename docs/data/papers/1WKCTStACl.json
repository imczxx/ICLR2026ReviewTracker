The core idea is to replace AlphaZero's standard planning loss—which minimizes the difference between network predictions and MCTS search results (for policy) and episode returns (for value) —with a new objective that *directly* maximizes the total episode score. Because the MCTS component is non-differentiable, the authors employ Evolution Strategies (ES) as a zeroth-order, black-box optimizer to train the neural network parameters. The method is evaluated on five single-agent environments (Navigation, Sokoban, TSP, VKCP, and MDP), where the authors claim that AlphaZeroES \"dramatically outperforms\" the standard AlphaZero baseline while using the same MCTS algorithm and network architecture."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper's primary strength is the question it poses: challenging the optimality of the standard AlphaZero planning loss. This is a fundamental and worthwhile question to investigate.\n\nThe paper's observation that maximizing the score via ES does not correlate with minimizing the standard planning losses (and can even be anti-correlated) is an interesting finding.\n\nThe ablation study in Appendix D, which attempts to separate the contributions of the policy and value network optimization, is a good addition and provides some insight, showing the source of improvement is environment-dependent."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "My main concerns are as follows:\n\n1.  **Lack of Intuition and Analysis:** The paper provides no satisfying explanation for *why* its method works. In fact, the results in Figures 2, 3, 5, etc., show that the value and policy losses for AlphaZeroES often increase or stagnate while the score improves. The paper even states \"a definitive explanation... is beyond the scope of this paper\". This is not acceptable. If the network's value/policy heads are producing \"worse\" predictions (according to the standard loss), how is the MCTS using these heuristics to produce a *better* overall policy? What is being learned? Without this analysis, the paper is just a collection of puzzling empirical results.\n\n2.  **Questionable Sample Efficiency:** Evolution Strategies are zeroth-order methods and are notoriously sample-inefficient, especially in high-dimensional parameter spaces (like neural networks). Yet, this paper claims comparable or better performance within the same training time and number of episodes as gradient-based AlphaZero. This is an extraordinary claim. It suggests that ES is *more* sample-efficient than backpropagation for this complex planning problem, which contradicts a large body of literature. This result is highly questionable and may be an artifact of poorly tuned baselines or very simple environments.\n\n3.  **Vague Methodology & Reproducibility:** As mentioned in the Presentation section, the paper lacks a clear, high-level pseudocode for the AlphaZeroES training loop. Section 4.3 just describes ES, not its integration. This, combined with the lack of a complete, runnable code repository, makes the results difficult to trust or replicate.\n\n4.  **Poor Scalability and Simple Environments:** The experiments are conducted on \"toy\" problems. A 10x10 grid or a 20-city TSP is not a convincing demonstration of a method intended to improve *AlphaZero*. AlphaZero's fame comes from its ability to master extremely complex domains like Go or chess. The scalability experiments in Appendix C only test up to 36 nodes and 128 hidden dimensions. This is insufficient. It is highly likely that a black-box ES approach will fail to scale to the millions of parameters and vast search spaces where gradient-based AlphaZero excels."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  Could the authors provide a more concrete analysis of the learning dynamics? If the value loss is high (e.g., Fig 2), does this mean the MCTS effectively learns to ignore the value head's output and relies purely on rollouts? What do the learned policy/value predictions actually look like? How can the search be effective if its guiding heuristics are, by the paper's own metrics, not improving?\n\n2.  Can you please comment on the surprising sample efficiency? Why would a zeroth-order method (ES) be more efficient than backpropagation here? Were you able to run the baseline AlphaZero with a fully optimized set of hyperparameters? The results are very counterintuitive.\n\n3.  To properly test the claims of scalability, would it be possible to test this on a much larger, more standard benchmark? For example, a larger combinatorial problem (e.g., TSP with $n=100$) or a different domain entirely (like a small board game)? The current environments are too simple to support the paper's strong claims.\n\n4.  Section 5 states that \"AlphaZero and AlphaZeroES took about the same amount of time per iteration.\" This is a very surprising claim. A standard ES update (like OpenAI-ES) requires $N$ full episode rollouts (one for each worker/perturbation) just to compute a *single* pseudogradient $g$. In contrast, a standard AlphaZero update (or batch update) can learn from the data of a single episode (or batch of episodes) via backpropagation. Could you please clarify what \"iteration\" refers to in this context? Does it mean one full parameter update, or one generated episode? This claim is central to the method's viability but seems to misrepresent the computational cost of ES."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "FpSR8o1DgE", "forum": "1WKCTStACl", "replyto": "1WKCTStACl", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22463/Reviewer_ygAX"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22463/Reviewer_ygAX"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22463/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761402449847, "cdate": 1761402449847, "tmdate": 1762942229491, "mdate": 1762942229491, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces AlphaZeroES, which replaces AlphaZero's planning loss minimization with direct episode score maximization using evolution strategies (ES).

The organization and presentation of the paper can be improved. It would be better put mathematical expressions separately for clear elaboration instead of using in-line mode.

Moreover, for each environment, all contents are put in huge bulk of single paragraph, making it difficult to follow.\n2. The paper lacks theoretical justification. In Section 6 (Discussion), the claim about \"simple optimal policy but complex value function\" lacks rigor and doesn't explain why this would systematically favor ES.\n3. The paper claims to test \"across a wide range of learning rates for fair comparison\" between AlphaZero and AlphaZeroES. However, this doesn't ensure a fair comparison. Different learning rates are optimal for different objectives, making it impossible to isolate whether improvements come from the objective change or better hyperparameter selection.\n4.

Could the authors plot the correlation between planning loss and episode score throughout training for both methods?\n5. For theoretical justification of \"self-consistency is not necessarily aligned as an objective with performing better\", could the author explain why would policy-value inconsistency not hurt MCTS performance, given that MCTS explicitly uses both value estimates and visit counts for action selection?
