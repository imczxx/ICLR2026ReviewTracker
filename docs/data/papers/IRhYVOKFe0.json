The method translates ambiguous natural language reasoning steps into the formal symbolic logic required by a theorem prover (specifically, Isabelle). Then, the paper gets the LogicScore by the following steps:\n1. Checks if the reasoning step is \"grounded in the given context\". It measures the cosine similarity between the premises used in a step and the original premises provided in the problem.\n2. Uses the theorem prover to check if the inference made in the step is logically sound. If the step cannot be parsed (i.e., has invalid syntax), the system falls back to using the \"average token probability\" as the score.\n3. The average of the Premise Validity and Logic Validity scores across all steps in the reasoning chain.\n4. A binary score (1 or 0) for whether the final answer matches the ground truth.\n5.

The primary strength is the integration of a symbolic theorem prover into the reward loop. This moves beyond the limitations of purely outcome-based or probabilistic process-based rewards, providing a more rigorous \"formal and symbolic assessment of logical validity\".\n2. The method directly targets and improves reasoning faithfulness, a critical need for high-stakes domains like medicine and law. The paper's manual evaluation found that the LogicReward-trained model could produce more faithful reasoning processes.\n3. The model shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution tasks, including BBH, GSM8K, and CommonsenseQA.\n4. LogicReward excels in scenarios without ground-truth labels. By removing the \"Outcome Validity\" component, the reward signal relies only on Premise and Logic Validity. In this setting, it still outperformed other reward systems (LLM-as-judge, PRM, Confidence), demonstrating its value in real-world situations where labels are scarce."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The authors explicitly acknowledge that the LogicReward labeling process, which involves running a theorem prover, is \"relatively slower than approaches that only compare final outcomes\".\n2. This speed limitation presents a significant challenge for scalability, particularly for \"on-policy reinforcement learning scenarios\"  (like PPO or GRPO) that require fast, in-the-loop reward generation. The paper's use of SFT and DPO  cleverly sidesteps this by being offline methods, but it leaves the system's viability for on-policy RL as an open question.\n3. The auto-formalization process is \"still imperfect\". Even with soft unification and refinement, ambiguities in natural language remain difficult to formalize. The results show that even after refinement, the logic success rate was 50.8%, meaning nearly half of the steps were still not validated as logically sound by the prover.\n4. When a reasoning step fails the syntactic check and cannot be evaluated by the theorem prover, the system \"falls back to the confidence of the inference $I$, defined as the average token probability of the reasoning step\". This pragmatic choice means that for a large portion of reasoning steps (those that fail to parse), LogicReward does not actually provide a symbolic logical guarantee.\n5. The method was primarily trained and evaluated on NLI and logical reasoning datasets. While it showed some generalization, the paper notes that \"gains on GSM8K are smaller\". The authors suggest this is because mathematical reasoning relies \"more on domain-specific reasoning\"  than on the commonsense assumptions that Soft Unification is good at handling. This suggests the current pipeline may be less effective for highly specialized domains without further adaptation."}, "questions": {"value": "Refer to Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "jBzhOlMANK", "forum": "IRhYVOKFe0", "replyto": "IRhYVOKFe0", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11788/Reviewer_x5nR"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11788/Reviewer_x5nR"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11788/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761824032671, "cdate": 1761824032671, "tmdate": 1762922811881, "mdate": 1762922811881, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper targets the flaw of outcome-based training that can yield correct answers with incorrect reasoning, proposing LogicReward, which enforces step-level logical correctness via a theorem prover, plus Autoformalization with Soft Unification to reduce ambiguity and improve formalization.
