A Diagnosis of Limits on Sequential Computation", "abstract": "Despite their power as general sequence processors, Transformers systematically fail at \\textbf{simple sequential arithmetic tasks like counting}. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting circumvents the Transformer's architectural limits for such iterative computations, its practical application is plagued by brittleness over long sequences. We propose a new perspective on this failure, identifying an architectural conflict we term \\textbf{State-Update Interference (SUI)}. We posit that self-attention's inductive bias for global, semantic association can disrupt the localized, state-dependent updates required by procedural algorithms. Paradoxically, CoT may exacerbate this by unrolling the entire computational history, creating an ever-growing set of distractors that are semantically similar but logically irrelevant, thereby corrupting the state-update process.\nTo investigate this hypothesis, we introduce \\textbf{Sequential State Quarantining (SSQ)}, a diagnostic instrument designed to isolate this failure mode. SSQ periodically forces the model to compress its reasoning trace into a compact state while discarding the preceding context, surgically enforcing the narrow information bottleneck required for procedural logic. On a suite of algorithmic tasks, SSQ yields dramatic performance gains, with accuracy scaling monotonically with the frequency of this intervention. Our findings suggest that a primary bottleneck for procedural reasoning is architectural: a failure of \\textbf{context management} that is distinct from general limitations of context length or logical capacity. This reframes the problem, suggesting a need for models that can learn to actively manage their long context.

The proposed SSQ could effectively improve models' performance on tasks (Count, Parity Check and Cycle Navigation), verifying the SUI hypothesis proposed in the paper.

Many reasoning tasks contains both long-horizon associative reasoning and iterative inductive reasoning. Even the tasks studied in this paper (e.g. count) require the model to precisely retrieve elements from the long input list. The work seems to claim that most failures stem from the state update (e.g., count = 3 => count = 4) errors. What are the ratios of such kind of failures?\n\n(2) Though I know that SSQ serves as a diagnostic probe for the SUI hypothesis, I do not think reasoning traces for most general tasks could be \"compacted\" in to a single 'state', which limits the applicablity of the SSQ proposed in the paper.\n\n(3) The research was not conducted in sufficient depth. Existing works (e.g., LightThinker [1], Gist Tokens [2]) have already explored methods of compressing reasoning traces (though their aims are not entirely identical with this paper).
