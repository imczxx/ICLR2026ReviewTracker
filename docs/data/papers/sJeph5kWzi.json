Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT algorithm with two key innovations. At first, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter (MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches between assumed and actual object motion. Secondly, the Motion-adaptive IoU (Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching region and incorporates height similarity to reduce mis-associations, while remaining lightweight.

The authors specifically implement the standard KF using a constant velocity model for the state transition matrix F. While the paper visually demonstrates that complex human movements (e.g., phased switching, predictable back-and-forth patterns) violate the Markovian assumption, the justification for choosing the most simplistic linear prior as the failure point is weak.\n- The Motion-Adaptive Technique (MAT) employs a discrete piecewise design to set Mo-IoU's parameters ($p_t, q_t$) for efficiency, switching based on predefined, fixed velocity thresholds ($\\Theta_{\\text{center}}$, $\\Theta_{\\text{height}}$). Relying on this abrupt, binary switching rather than continuous tuning may introduce instability or non-smooth changes in the association cost function when normalized speeds fluctuate near these critical boundary thresholds, potentially destabilizing tracking in the fast, variable motion characteristic of DanceTrack and SportsMOT."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The MeKF training relies on a specific dataset generation process using matched YOLOX detections and ground truth. Could the authors provide a sensitivity analysis or further discussion on how the performance of MeKF might change if a lower-performing or different detector were used to generate the training dataset?\n2. The MeMoSORT framework is specifically tailored for human-dominant scenarios characterized by complex, non-Markovian motion and severe occlusions (DanceTrack, SportsMOT). While the cross-dataset evaluation between DanceTrack and SportsMOT showed only a \"slight degradation\" in performance, validating the learning of transferable motion patterns, have the authors tested MeMoSORT's generalization capability on more conventional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) benchmarks, such as **MOT17** or **MOT20**? \n3. The MeKF is a hybrid filter designed to retain the stability of the classic Bayesian structure by explicitly compensating the physics-based prior (using $\\Delta\\hat{F}_t$, $\\Delta\\hat{H}_t$) rather than fully replacing it. The authors claim this approach \"robustly ensures the stability of the state estimation\" and provides a \"failsafe\" compared to purely data-driven methods (like DiffMOT or Mamba-based trackers). Can the authors elaborate on the theoretical or empirical mechanisms that prevent potential instability when the NN components, such as the covariance compensation terms $P_t^F$ and $P_t^H$, are trained and integrated into the Gaussian approximation framework, particularly when compared to other hybrid methods that discard the physics prior entirely?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "skWmXZHOXw", "forum": "sJeph5kWzi", "replyto": "sJeph5kWzi", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18996/Reviewer_DhRY"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18996/Reviewer_DhRY"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18996/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761607212761, "cdate": 1761607212761, "tmdate": 1762945693232, "mdate": 1762945693232, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"title": {"value": "Official comment from Reviewer DhRY"}, "comment": {"value": "I have read through the feedbacks from the other two reviewers.
