In this work, we propose a novel network architecture that enables LoD signal representation. Our approach builds on a modified Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single scale and thus lacks native LoD support. Specifically, we introduce the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP), which extends the MLP by attaching an output branch, also called tail, to each hidden layer. Each tail refines the residual between the current prediction and the ground-truth signal, so that the accumulated outputs across layers correspond to the target signals at different LoDs, enabling multi-scale modeling with supervision from only a single-resolution signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our T-MLP outperforms existing neural LoD baselines across diverse signal representation tasks.", "tldr": "We introduce the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) for level-of-detail signal representation and progressive transmission.", "keywords": ["Level of Detail; Progressive Transmission; Implicit Neural Representation; Multi-Layer Perceptron"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b7b34f44e57abfc1b4be5b7f1a9bca92b25c0c97.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, the authors propose a Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) designed to achieve multiple levels of detail (LoD) across different signal representations.
