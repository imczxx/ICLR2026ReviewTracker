In memory-based RL methods, the long-term memory capacity relies on the sequence models used in agent architecture. Two main approaches improve long-term dependency for sequence models, using linear recurrence and using information selection mechanisms such as gating. However, the sample efficiency of existing approaches remains low in long-term memory tasks. In this paper, we first present a saliency-based framework to illustrate why existing methods do not perform well on long-term memory tasks. Specifically, they cannot effectively filter out noisy information irrelevant to the memory task in the early stage of training. To this end, we design a novel linear recurrent module, in which the gating is controlled by spiking neurons. Spiking neurons output discrete values and can more effectively mask noise in the early stages of training, thus improving sample efficiency. The effectiveness of our proposed module is demonstrated on Passive Visual Match, a classic long-term memory task, and several different types of partially observable tasks. The code is attached in the supplementary material and will be made publicly available.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Spiking Neural Networks", "Sequence Models", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/50986598261f8682a21122aa8450311987267995.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9be670246935a2e99aff8095d57f8ec480f06134.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This study focuses on gated neural memory models, noting that the nature of the gate of such models strongly influences the effective time-duration over which a model can learn. Specifically, with sigmoidal gates, true \"gating\" is nearly impossible and requires very large gating-weights, which hinders learning. Instead, the authors propose to use spiking neuron models combined with surrogate gradient learning to learn discrete gating in memory neuron models.

To mitigate this issue, they propose using memory with discrete (spiking) neurons.\n\nFirst, the authors introduce a signal-to-noise analysis framework for memory. It uses a long-term task with known credit assignment, and is relatively straightforward. It takes the gradient with respect to the observations of the correct credit assignment divided by the total credit assignment.\n\nNext, they perform a theoretical analysis of SNR for linear and nonlinear RNNs, and then gated and non-gated RNNs. They focus on the effect of SNR and the gradient for both cases. Importantly, they prove that gating enables an SNR of 1, which is not possible with a non-gated recurrent update. \n\nThe authors go on to motivate a **discrete** and associative gating mechanism called the parallel spiking neuron. It uses a heaviside step gating mechanism surrogate gradient to enable backpropagation. They add stochasticity to mitigate an issue where a neuron can be stuck at 0, preventing gradient flow back through the RNN. They use this mechanism to construct a linear recurrent cell.\n\nThe authors calculate the SNR for their model with both soft and hard gating, as well as other prior work. Their method obtains greater SNR than other methods. Nonlinear RNNs demonstrate vanishing gradients, and gated linear RNNs report better SNR than nongated linear RNNs. Finally, discrete gating produces slightly better SNR than sigmoidal gating.\n\nThey report returns for other tasks, demonstrating their cell can learn more quickly than other models as the temporal dependence length increases.
