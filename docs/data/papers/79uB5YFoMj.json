We propose a more practical threat model, Fake Data Injection, which reflects realistic adversarial constraints: the attacker can inject only a limited number of bounded fake feedback samples into the learner’s history, simulating legitimate interactions. We design efficient attack strategies under this model, explicitly addressing both magnitude constraints (on reward values) and temporal constraints (on when and how often data can be injected). Our theoretical analysis shows that these attacks can mislead both Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms into selecting a target arm in nearly all rounds while incurring only sublinear attack cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our strategies, revealing significant vulnerabilities in widely used stochastic bandit algorithms under practical adversarial scenarios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["multi-armed bandits", "adversarial attacks"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/117aa300d2f88f5ff1c732d0d6e6c61ceb5d59fe.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4164566951e5912a59b4c70d0854ac32c0116f88.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new attack model in MAB called Fake Data Injection (FDI).

This could simulate situations such as fake reviews or fake engagement for any specific arm/content without the algorithm even recommending that arm in the currrent round.

Let's consider any specific arm $i$, since each arm is corrupted once, the cost of corrupting $i$ according the definition of the corruption is $| r_i - \\mu_i|$ where $r_i$ is the corrupted reward.\n\nTo ensure that after the corruption, eq (1) holds, we need\n\\begin{align*}\n    & \\hat{\\mu}(t+1) \\leq \\hat{l}_k(t) \\\\\n    \\implies & \\frac{\\hat{\\mu}_i(t) N_i(T) + r_i}{N_i(T) + 1} \\leq  \\hat{l}_k(t) \\\\\n     \\implies & r_i \\leq \\hat{l}_k(t) (N_i(T) + 1) - \\hat{\\mu}_i(t) N_i(T)\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow consider corruption $| r_i - \\mu_i|$. Since we are attacking the arm, it's obvious that we are trying to reduce it's mean, so $r_i - \\mu_i$ is infact negative and $|r_i - \\mu_i| = \\mu_i - r_i$ not $r_i - \\mu_i$\n\nSo we have\n\\begin{equation}\n     r_i \\leq \\hat{l}_k(t) (N_i(T) + 1) - \\hat{\\mu}_i(t) N_i(T)\n\\end{equation}\nand \n\\begin{equation}\n    C =  \\mu_i - r_i\n\\end{equation}\nCombining the two we get \n\\begin{equation}\n    C \\geq \\mu_i + \\hat{\\mu}_i(t) N_i(T) - \\hat{l}_k(t) (N_i(T) + 1)\n\\end{equation}\nThis is completely opposite of what is claimed in the proof for Theorem 4.1 in Appendix Section A.2.2\n\n- I don't agree with the claim that this model has more restrictions as it allows corrupting only a fraction of rounds not all. In the algorithm design, all the algorithms proposed by the authors are also just arbitrarily corrupting whenever they want. In fact I believe this problem is simpler as the learner does not have to analyze whether the arm would be picked by the algorithm or not and can inject noise whenever and wherever. \n\n- I don't agree with the claim that earlier works only considered the unbounded reward setting.

The author(s) **grounded the work on the statement that the existing works are with unrealistic assumptions on adversarial attacks**. The details are listed in the second paragraph in Section 2.2 and my corresponding concerns are as below:\n1. 'Attacker can perturb the environment-generated reward in every round.' --- It is incorrect. Some existing works, such as \\url{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-018-5758-5}, assume that the attacker can only attack a fraction of time steps, instead of all time steps.\n2. 'The attacker modifies the reward of only the selected arm' --- It is incorrect for some existing works. Some papers such as \\url{https://proceedings.mlr.press/v99/gupta19a/gupta19a.pdf} assume that the agent pull and arm only after attacks, in which case it is impossible for the attacker to only attack the selected arm.\n3. 'The pre-attack reward and the attack values are unbounded' --- It is incorrect for some existing works. Bounded-reward case is usually a much easier one and there has been many works on that. Again, check the results in \\url{https://proceedings.mlr.press/v99/gupta19a/gupta19a.pdf}\n\nBased on my concerns above, \n1. I am a bit confused why this fake-data-injection setting is interesting to explore and what is its difference from the existing setting. It seems to me that the amount of injection is similar to the amount of corruption.\n2.
