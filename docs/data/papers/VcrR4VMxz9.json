Robust aggregators are commonly used  to resist Byzantine clients. This usually requires to estimate the unknown number $f$ of Byzantine clients, and thus accordingly select the aggregators with proper degree of robustness (i.e., the maximum number $\\hat{f}$ of Byzantine clients allowed by the aggregator). Such an estimation should have important effect on the performance, which has not been systematically studied to our knowledge. This work will fill in the gap by theoretically analyzing the worst-case error of aggregators as well as its induced federated learning algorithm for any cases of $\\hat{f}$ and $f$. Specifically, we will show that underestimation ($\\hat{f}<f$) can lead to arbitrarily poor performance for both aggregators and federated learning. For non-underestimation ($\\hat{f}\\ge f$), we have proved optimal lower and upper bounds of the same order on the errors of both aggregators and federated learning. All these optimal bounds are proportional to $\\hat{f}/(n-f-\\hat{f})$ with $n$ clients, which monotonically increases with larger $\\hat{f}$. This indicates a fundamental trade-off: while an aggregator with a larger robustness degree $\\hat{f}$ can solve federated learning problems of wider range $f\\in [0,\\hat{f}]$, the performance can deteriorate when there are actually fewer or even no Byzantine clients (i.e., $f\\in [0,\\hat{f})$).", "tldr": "This work systematically studies the theoretical effect of the estimated number of Byzantine Clients on the performance of Federated Learning.", "keywords": ["federated learning", "byzantine", "nonconvex optimization"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cfd6852a81cc1877f94a2dfdd067763244536d80.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies Byzantine-robust federated learning when the server only knows an estimate \\(\\hat f\\) of the number of Byzantine clients (the true number is \\(f\\)). \nMain takeaways: (i) if we underestimate  (\\(\\hat f < f\\)), aggregation / training can become arbitrarily bad; (ii) if we do not underestimate (\\(\\hat f \\ge f\\)), the best-possible error (and convergence floor) scales like\n\\[\n\\kappa = \\Theta\\!\\left(\\frac{\\hat f}{\\,n - f - \\hat f\\,}\\right),\n\\]\nwith matching lower/upper bounds and a simple construction that achieves this rate up to constants."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- Clear split between two regimes: underestimation can be catastrophic; otherwise there is a tight, quantified floor.\n- Matching lower and upper bounds\n- The dependence on both \\(f\\) and \\(\\hat f\\) is explicit, which clarifies the cost of being conservative."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The underestimation impossibility is not really new: it is closely tied to the **breakdown point** in robust statistics.  \n  If the true contamination $f/n$ exceeds the method's breakdown (here essentially $\\hat f/n$), you can get unbounded error.  \n  So this part feels more like transferring a known concept, rather than introducing a new phenomenon.\n\n- Novelty in the *order* of the bound is modest.

For instance, $\\frac{n}{2}$ for CWMed, $\\frac{n-2}{2}$ for CWTM, and $\\frac{n}{10}$ for centered clipping, with respect to the breakdown point.
