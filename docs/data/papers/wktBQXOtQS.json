While existing methods often struggle with the computational burden of optimizing millions of Gaussian parameters, our approach employs a parameter-specific second-order optimization that substantially improves convergence speed while maintaining mapping quality. By sequentially optimizing position, orientation, scaling, opacity, and color parameters through local Newton solves, we achieve efficient updates without the computational overhead of global Hessian calculations. Our method leverages structured spatial relationships between keyframes through a K-nearest neighbor approach, employing secondary targets as preconditioners to prevent optimization overshoot. Experimental evaluation on TUM RGB-D datasets demonstrates that FSGS achieves competitive tracking accuracy (RMSE ATE < 1.5cm) while providing high-fidelity dense reconstructions at interactive rates. The system's robust performance across various indoor environments highlights the effectiveness of combining second-order optimization techniques with neural rendering for real-time SLAM applications.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Robotics Perception", "Gaussian Splatting SLAM"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a1f89668c64acca9415c0b21cf3a9df9b0527371.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper \"Hierarchically Optimized Gaussian Splatting for Robust and Efficient Monocular SLAM\" proposes a novel monocular SLAM system that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) within a hierarchical optimization framework to achieve real-time, photorealistic dense reconstruction with robust tracking and drift-resilient mapping."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper is clearly written and well-structured. The abstract succinctly summarizes the core idea and contributions. The introduction contextualizes the work within the evolution from feature-based to NeRF-based to 3DGS-based SLAM, clearly identifying the gap the paper fills. Figures (e.g., the system overview in Figure 2 and Hessian visualization in Figure 4) are informative and well-integrated into the narrative. Technical sections (scene representation, frontend/backend design) are detailed without being overwhelming, and the ablation and results sections are easy to interpret thanks to well-organized tables and visual comparisons."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. While the paper claims to address monocular SLAM, much of the quantitative evaluation (especially in Tables 2 and 4) uses the TUM RGB-D dataset, where ground-truth depth is available during evaluation—and possibly (though not explicitly stated) during training or initialization. The monocular results reported (e.g., 5.8 FPS, ATE ~4.0 cm) are derived from sequences that originally include depth sensors, raising concerns about whether the system truly operates under pure monocular constraints (i.e., no access to depth at any stage).\n\n2. The paper briefly mentions support for dynamic objects via “pixel-level masks” (Sec. 3.6) and cites Zhou et al. (2025), but no experiments or ablations demonstrate performance in dynamic environments. Given that monocular SLAM is especially vulnerable to moving objects (which violate static-world assumptions), this omission is significant.\n\n3. The global pose-graph optimization (Sec. 3.7) is described as “optional” and uses covisibility-based edges. However: \n -  It is unclear how often this stage runs (e.g., per keyframe? every N keyframes? after loop closure?). \n - No metrics are provided on loop closure detection accuracy or drift reduction magnitude. \n - Table 4 shows that removing global optimization increases ATE by ~2×, yet the paper does not report long-sequence results where drift accumulation would be most evident. \n\n4. The Stochastic Local Newton (SLN) optimizer is a key claimed innovation. However: \n - The paper compares SLN only against first-order Adam, not against other second-order or quasi-Newton methods (e.g., L-BFGS, Gauss-Newton) commonly used in bundle adjustment. \n - The diagonal Hessian approximation is justified via Figure 4, but the impact of ignoring off-diagonal blocks is not quantified (e.g., via convergence speed or final loss with full vs. diagonal Hessian on a small scene). \n\n5. Table 1 reports 8.4 GB GPU memory, significantly lower than prior work. However: \n - The comparison includes methods like NICE-SLAM (NeRF-based) that maintain dense voxel grids or MLPs, which are inherently more memory-intensive than explicit Gaussians. \n - It is unclear whether memory includes only active Gaussians or also optimizer states, keyframe buffers, etc.\n - The 80 FPS on Replica uses RGB-D input (Table 3), yet the abstract emphasizes monocular SLAM. The monocular speed (5.8 FPS) is far from “real-time” for many applications."}, "questions": {"value": "See the weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "cbDaaGADhZ", "forum": "wktBQXOtQS", "replyto": "wktBQXOtQS", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21002/Reviewer_Uxyd"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21002/Reviewer_Uxyd"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21002/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761467788326, "cdate": 1761467788326, "tmdate": 1762999978897, "mdate": 1762999978897, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a real-time monocular SLAM system that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting within a hierarchical optimization framework to achieve both efficient tracking and high-fidelity dense reconstruction.

The paper claims its main contribution is a hierarchical optimization framework, yet the proposed three-level structure largely overlaps with the components already present in SLAM systems that enable loop closure (e.g., Loopy-SLAM [1] and LoopSplat [2]), and thus does not constitute a substantial novelty.\n2. The experimental comparison relies on outdated baselines; for 3DGS–based SLAM, more recent methods such as GS-ICP SLAM [3] and RTG-SLAM [4] should be included to ensure a fair and up-to-date evaluation.\n3. Although the proposed method employs pose graph optimization to maintain global consistency, it explicitly claims not to include loop closure, which is misleading. No comparison is provided against NeRF-based or 3DGS-based SLAM methods (e.g., Loopy-SLAM, LoopSplat), which weakens the validity of the claimed advantages.\n4. While the system demonstrates improved real-time performance, the tracking accuracy remains inferior; moreover, the ablation study suggests that the SLN optimizer improves efficiency at the cost of lower tracking precision. In contrast, GS-ICP SLAM achieves real-time performance of 30 FPS on both Replica and TUM datasets with superior tracking accuracy, whereas the proposed method only reaches real-time speed on Replica (5.8 FPS on TUM) and exhibits limited accuracy on both benchmarks.\n5. The evaluation omits the widely used dataset ScanNet, which limits the comprehensiveness of the experimental validation.\n6.

These omissions make it difficult to evaluate the real performance improvements or novelty of the proposed approach.\n\n3. Questionable originality of claimed contributions.\nThe two claimed innovations—the hierarchical strategy and the SLN optimization scheme—appear to be simple extensions or combinations of existing designs. The hierarchical optimization pipeline is very similar to standard frontend–backend–global setups used in nearly all modern SLAM frameworks. The SLN optimizer directly inherits ideas from 3DGS2 with minimal adaptation. Therefore, the methodological contribution seems incremental rather than truly novel.\n\n[1].
