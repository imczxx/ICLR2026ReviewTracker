In practice, LLM services are typically deployed using multi-tenant serving frameworks. Popular inference frameworks such as vLLM and SGLang both employ Key-Value cache sharing among users to enhance computational efficiency. However, this shared caching mechanism may lead to potential leakage of the private user prompts. Previous works have demonstrated the impact of this information. Nevertheless, these works mainly focus on expanding the attack surface brought by the cache sharing mechanism, rather than optimizing the attack performance. This prevents users from accurately assessing the leakage's impact, thus hindering the timely leakage mitigation.\nTo investigate the bounds of the cache-based side channel attack, we propose RL$^2$eak, a reinforcement learning enhanced prompt leakage attack framework. We show that the adversary requires far fewer active prompt guesses with RL$^2$eak than reported by previous works. To validate the effectiveness of our RL$^2$eak, we apply RL$^2$eak to two real-world scenarios, i.e., medical and finance, achieving a maximum 12.48$\\times$ reduction in average requests needed to guess one token.

We have carefully considered all comments and revised the paper accordingly. We have also submitted the revised manuscript, in which all modifications are highlighted in **blue**. We hope the following summary will assist the AC and future readers in better understanding our work and the rebuttal. We believe these revisions have strengthened the paper, and we provide our detailed point-by-point responses below. \n\n**Addressing the Concerns Raised by Reviewer zDf7:**\n\n- **Assumption on high-level domain knowledge:** We have added experiments in Section 5.4 to evaluate robustness under varying degrees of adversarial advantage: (1) No prior knowledge, (2) High-level intra-domain knowledge, (3) Precise intra-domain knowledge, and (4) Misaligned knowledge. The results demonstrate that $\\text{RL}^2\\text{eak}$ remains robust in the high-level intra-domain setting (reducing APR by 27.9%), while misaligned knowledge (e.g., training on Finance, testing on Medical) hampers performance, confirming our hypothesis on domain-specific bias.\n- **Robustness against caching design:** We updated Section 6 to clarify that $\\text{RL}^2\\text{eak}$ decouples query guessing from verification. Consequently, our method is compatible with various scheduling policies (e.g., FCFS, priority-based) by leveraging timing-based side channels (Time-To-First-Token) alongside the Longest Prefix Match (LPM) mechanism.\n\n**Addressing the Concerns Raised by Reviewer sS1o:**\n\n- **Assumption on the KV cache pool:** We clarified in Section 3.3 that our assumption relies on the victim and attacker sharing a server node with a KV cache pool. We referenced real-world implementations, which utilize KV-cache pooling for persistence, validating the practicality of our threat model.\n- **Demonstration of SFT overfitting:** We highlighted our ablation study (Section 5.3) which demonstrates that SFT is prone to model collapse as training steps increase, necessitating the DPO approach. We have updated the description in Section 4.1 to emphasize this finding.\n- **Evaluation on less correlated datasets:** We conducted cross-dataset experiments (e.g., training on **PubMedQA**, testing on **MedQA**) to prove that $\\text{RL}^2\\text{eak}$ is effective even when training and testing data exhibit distribution disparities within the same general domain.\n- **Time cost:** We clarify that our empirical experiments show that for a query of approximately 100 tokens, $\\text{RL}^2\\text{eak}$ requires around 5 minutes to recover the whole query. Notably, we clarify that the attack window is determined by **KV cache eviction** rather than the victim's query termination. Given that modern systems employ pooling techniques that extend cache persistence, supporting APR as our primary metric.\n\n**Addressing the Concerns Raised by Reviewer** **C8wA****:**\n\n- **Motivation for efficiency:** We updated Section 1 to emphasize that prior KV cache side-channel attacks were often impractical due to the prohibitive number of requests required, as documented in prior works. $\\text{RL}^2\\text{eak}$ bridges the gap between theoretical feasibility and practical exploitation.\n- **Generalization on domains and models:** We expanded our evaluation to include the **PubMedQA** dataset and the **Llama-3.1** model series. Furthermore, we have conducted cross-dataset experiments to test $\\text{RL}^2\\text{eak}$’s generalizability under different attacker assumptions. The results confirm that $\\text{RL}^2\\text{eak}$ generalizes effectively across different attacker assumptions and model architectures.\n\n**Addressing the Concerns Raised by Reviewer** **RQv1****:**\n\n- **Mitigation and Target Cache Policy:** We discussed that while user isolation is a mitigation, it significantly reduces cache sharing efficiency. We also clarified that our attack is compatible with other engines, such as **vLLM** (which supports token-level matching), by adapting the verification mechanism.\n- **Choice of Baselines:** We justified our use of order-based side channels as the baseline due to their stability compared to TTFT-based methods, while emphasizing that our main contribution is the efficient *generation* of queries, which is independent of the specific side channel used for verification.\n- **SFT/DPO Motivation and Decontamination:** We clarify that we adhere to a strict train-test split. Furthermore, our new cross-dataset experiments demonstrate robustness to distributional shifts without data leakage.\n\nOnce again, we sincerely appreciate your time and valuable feedback. We hope that the revisions and clarifications we have provided effectively address the concerns and contribute to strengthening our submission.\n\nBest,\n\nThe Authors"}}, "id": "nLqQrh1sxf", "forum": "LmGSD6CedJ", "replyto": "LmGSD6CedJ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11388/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11388/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11388/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763718598087, "cdate": 1763718598087, "tmdate": 1763718598087, "mdate": 1763718598087, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces RL^2eak, a framework to improve the efficiency of prompt leakage attacks that exploit shared KV-caches in multi-tenant LLMs. The method uses a two-stage fine-tuning process (SFT followed by DPO) and features a novel automated annotation technique for DPO that generates preference pairs from token generation difficulty.

The authors indicate that only-SFT leads to poor attack performance primarily due to overfitting and mode collapse (line 248), but there is no demonstration of such limitation.\n3. The test set and the train set are highly correlated since they are sampled from the same dataset (line 319-323), contributing to the good performance of RL2eak.
