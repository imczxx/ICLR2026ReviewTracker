It is widely utilized and implemented across various industrial scenarios, often handling massive datasets that include sensitive user information necessitating privacy preservation. To address the challenge of maintaining privacy within the Bloom filter, we have developed the DPBloomfilter. This innovation integrates the classical differential privacy mechanism, specifically the Random Response technique, into the Bloom filter, offering robust privacy guarantees under the same running complexity as the standard Bloom filter. Through rigorous simulation experiments, we have demonstrated that our DPBloomfilter algorithm maintains high utility while ensuring privacy protections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide differential privacy guarantees for the Bloom filter for membership query problems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["data structure", "differential privacy"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3b6508d8650892d2db748a2a7f004686e5ba6373.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes DPBloomfilter, which integrates a differential privacy (DP) mechanism, specifically randomized response, into a Bloom filter.

The analysis follows straightforwardly from standard DP composition and doesn’t introduce conceptual or algorithmic novelty beyond that. Consequently, while technically correct, the work is not particularly original or deep. Indeed, as the authors note, this idea was examined in the BLIP paper from 2012, and I see the difference between this paper and that paper as being minimal.  \n\nThe authors also note that introducing this type of noise inevitably leads to false negatives. The main advantage of a Bloom filter, however, is precisely that it avoids false negatives. Once false negatives are allowed, there is little reason to start from a Bloom filter in the first place. Other approximate membership or sketching structures (e.g. quotient or cuckoo filters, locality-sensitive hashing structures) may allow both false positives and false negatives more naturally. A discussion of these alternatives, or a comparison against data structures designed to tolerate symmetric error, is missing. The authors should acknowledge that this changes the underlying semantics of membership queries and that the resulting structure is not a “DP Bloom filter” so much as a “DP approximate membership sketch.” It is less clear what are the right applications for a DP approximate membership sketch.  \n\nI don't feel the paper was clearly written regarding what the DP meant in the context of a Bloom filter.  My understanding would be “neighboring” datasets (Bloom filters for sets (S) and (S') differing by one element) would be the relevant starting point, and the privacy claim would be the results for such 2 sets would be what was considered for DP. That is probably what the authors are doing, but they should make it clearer? The meaning of the DP guarantee in the context of probabilistic membership queries seemed to me underspecified.\n\nFinally, the paper does not engage with a significant body of prior work on secure or private variants of Bloom filters that are not based on differential privacy but pursue similar goals.

Briefly, what does this method provide that the others don't?\n\n2) The paper lacks a clear (or even, technically, correct -- see Questions below) statement of how to translate a desired $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP guarantee into the parameter setting $\\varepsilon$. This makes it hard for a reader to actually use the algorithm in practice, or even understand what the asymptotic relationship between the overall privacy guarantee and utility is."}, "questions": {"value": "1) In Step 2 of the proof of Lemma B.4, the paper claims that $P[|Y| = y] = \\binom{m}{y}(y/m)^k - \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \\binom{m-i}{y-i}P[Y=i]$. First, I think that's supposed to be $P[|Y|=i]$ at the end, since $Y$ is a set, not a number. Second, should the sum be to $y-1$ rather than $k-1$? If $k > y$, for example, this is circular. I don't think this actually changes most of the paper, but that is also kind of a problem -- it's hard to actually fish out the explicit values for parameters like $\\varepsilon_0$ that are based on things like $F_W^{-1}(1-\\delta)$ that are not explicitly provided anywhere. This calls statements like \"[w]e have proved from a theoretical perspective that when the DP parameters $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$ are very small, DPBloomfilter can still maintain good utility\" (Line 75) into question, as the paper doesn't actually say what the relationship between $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$ and $\\varepsilon_0$ is, but states its utility guarantees in terms of $\\varepsilon_0$.\n\n2) The abstract (Line 18), introduction (Line 76), and conclusion (Line 480) all mention experiments, but I don't see any experiments. The paper should at least compare to the Patel et al paper (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=GQNvvQquO0) and the basic composition bloom filter from Alaggan et al.\n\n3) Similarly, the abstract and intro advertise that the paper is \"the first work to provide DP for the Bloom filter for membership query problems\", but then clarify that Alaggan et al did the same thing in 2012 (albeit for pure, not approximate DP). This should be rewritten.\n\n4) Lemma 5.4 has RHS $t\\alpha(1-\\delta_{err})$, but Lemma D.3 variously says $t(\\alpha - \\delta_{err})$ and $t\\alpha(1-\\delta_{err})$.\n\n5) Under Condition 5.2, only Condition 1 is really a condition. The rest appear to just be definitions and should be labelled accordingly.
