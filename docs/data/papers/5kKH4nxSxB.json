While effective, these methods are computationally heavy, sensitive to retriever quality, and reveal little about an LLM inherent fact-checking ability.\nWe propose an evidence-free claim verification task: identifying factual inaccuracies without external retrieval. To study this setting, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework covering 9 datasets and 16 methods, testing robustness to long-tail knowledge, claim source variation, multilinguality, and long-form generation.\nOur experiments show that traditional uncertainty quantification methods often lags behind detectors based on internal model representations. Building on this, we develop a probe-based approach that achieves state-of-the-art results. \nTo sum up, our setting establishes a new path for hallucination research: enabling lightweight, scalable, and model-intrinsic detection that can facilitate broader fact-checking, provide reward signals for training, and be integrated into the generation process.", "tldr": "Formalize a task for fact checking without evidence, comprehensive evaluation and top-performing method based on LLM internals", "keywords": ["hallucination detection", "fact-checking", "uncertainty quantification"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d1f7d129f99e82b14237210a35725d4f9a73ec1a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper argues that RAG-centric fact verification is noisy, unscalable, and lacking in robustness.

Theoretically, any fact verification benchmark could be trivially converted into a RAG-free benchmark.\n\n- In the introduction, the authors could better position the role of evidence-free retrieval in the broader landscape of LLM evaluations, and how it complements RAG-based verification. As presented, the evidence-free paradigm is presented as an explicitly better replacement for RAG verification, when to me the two tasks seem largely complementary.\n\n- The paper doesn't fully address the issue of context, or the fact that many statements are neither completely true or completely false.

In my opinion, this is not something that they can be expecting to receive a credit for. Separating methods that rely on external data and those that don't, is not the formalization of a new research problem and is as trivial as showing two separate tables in the results section. It is insignificant and has been done by others [1].\n- The proposed model is not significantly different from previous methods, such as [2]. The core idea is that the internal states of LLMs to some extent can reveal the veracity of claims, which we already knew for almost three years. Now, can we train more classifiers on each layer, and then train another classifier on the outputs of the previous classifiers to squeeze a few more percentage improvement?  Yes, probably. Which is basically what authors have done. But is this significant? In my opinion, no.\n- The improvements are not good either. Out of 9 datasets, the method only works comparatively well in 2 datasets (CC and CMP). Interestingly these two datasets are synthetic datasets (created either by LLMs or a random process).
