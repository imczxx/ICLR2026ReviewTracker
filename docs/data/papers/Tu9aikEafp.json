To causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal operationalizations: **M1** (engagement degree) and **M2** (semantic quality), with matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context understanding, safety, and inflating ``dark traits'' (e.g., psychopathy, narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \\rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \\rightarrow 52.3$ as junk ratio rises from $0$ % to $100$ %.\n\nError forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify *thought-skipping as the primary lesion*: models increasingly truncate or skip reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1. Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that *data quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay*, reframing curation for continual pretraining as a *training-time safety* problem and motivating routine \"cognitive health checks\" for deployed LLMs.", "tldr": "Our work is the first to provide controlled experimental evidence that continual exposure to junk web text causally degrades LLM reasoning, instruction-following, and even personality traits.", "keywords": ["LLM", "safety", "cognitive health", "social media"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/83a65493325365e136afa2dcb3f3910466b0ffde.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces the term Brain Rot in LLMs, defined as continual pre-training on junk web text inducing lasting cognitive decline in LLMs. The junk data consists of Twitter/X posts that are short, semantically simple, and popular (high engagement), whereas the control data are posts from the same dataset that are longer, less popular, and with more high quality text (as judged by GPT-4o). By pre-training 4 models of varying families and sizes on the junk and controlled datasets and evaluating on a series of benchmarks of cognitively demanding tasks, results demonstrate a decline in performance. Additional experiments trying to mitigate the effect with instruction tuning show it is somewhat effective, but does not fully restore the original model capabilities.

The main conclusion from the paper is that pre-training datasets should be audited to ensure high quality and avoid the supposed cognitive decline. This is neither novel (training/finetuning on bad data has been shown to reduce language modeling capabilities before), and is also not realistic (no pre-training dataset actually contains such high proportions of specifically junky twitter data, and the authors do not justify that this is something being done in the real world). As a result, I feel that this mostly undermines the insight or utility of the work. To actually make this more realistic, for example it would be interesting to do a pre-training dataset audit to see the actual proportion of low quality data, and then re-train the model with this subset removed, and comparing the results. Or, perhaps using the existing setup, it would be more notable if there was some difference noticed by end-users interacting with the models or if model responses were more engaging for users? \n\nSecond, I'm not convinced of the soundness of the dataset construction. The thresholds for popularity and length are seemingly arbitrary. Moreover the inclusion of length as part of the M1 engagement metric is motivated in 3.1 because shorter tweets supposedly boost engagement, but then later in lines 195--6 the authors find no strong correlation between these two factors, which feels contradictory.

Since modern LLMs are already trained on large-scale open web data that includes Twitter and similar content, it remains unclear whether the addition of “junk” text meaningfully changes exposure. The paper also does not discuss whether filtering such data could improve model performance, or whether similar filtering is already in practice.\n\n- The two metrics used to define “junk” data  (engagement and semantic quality) are only partially convincing. While semantic quality seems reasonable, using engagement (e.g., fewer than 500 interactions) as a proxy for low quality is debatable. Low engagement does not necessarily indicate poor content and may even correspond to high-quality but less viral material. This issue also affects the selection of “control” data.\n\n- Section 3 (M2) claims that data quality aligns with human preferences, but lacks methodological details about the annotation process, such as inter-annotator agreement, the diversity of annotators, or stratified sampling across engagement levels and text lengths.\nCPT training was conducted for three epochs. While this is understandable for a small corpus, it may have caused overfitting or catastrophic forgetting. A comparison with one-epoch training would help clarify whether the degradation stems from overexposure or intrinsic data issues.\n\n- The NIAH-MK3 model exhibits lower performance after CPT, yet the underlying reasons are not thoroughly analyzed.\n\n- The paper does not explicitly test for catastrophic forgetting, which is especially important given the multi-epoch training setup.\n\n- The dataset construction and filtering pipeline lacks transparency, particularly regarding how high- and low-engagement examples were balanced, raising the risk of sampling bias.\n\n- Finally, while the paper convincingly shows that CPT on “junk” data harms model behaviour, it offers no discussion of potential mitigation strategies. It remains unclear whether the authors advocate for stricter data filtering, improved data curation, or new training safeguards to prevent such “brain rot.”"}, "questions": {"value": "Please see my concerns in the weaknesses section"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "O7cDVYbtDF", "forum": "Tu9aikEafp", "replyto": "Tu9aikEafp", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18667/Reviewer_omQC"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18667/Reviewer_omQC"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18667/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761962030164, "cdate": 1761962030164, "tmdate": 1762928364581, "mdate": 1762928364581, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
