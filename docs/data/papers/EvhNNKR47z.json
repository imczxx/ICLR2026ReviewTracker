In this paper, we introduce GeoFlow, a novel framework that (i) augments area representations with geospatial attributes, including relative positions, $k$-hop and geodesic distances, (ii) employs a specialized geometric-intrinsic fusion encoder design that combines graph attention for intrinsic area signals with coordinate-aware encoders for global structure, and (iii) adopts an axial-global attention decoder to capture OD-specific competitive dependencies. For OD flow generation, GeoFlow is paired with flow matching models to produce more authentic and diverse mobility samples. Empirically, GeoFlow achieves superior performance in predictive accuracy, while substantially improving generative fidelity and diversity.

The model architecture. The final OD pair embedding Z is given by Eq. (5), which depends on the area embedding given by Eq.(4). These area embeddings defined in Eq. (4) depends on two types of attentions, A_axial and A_global. However, the problem is A_axial and A_global further depend the final embedding Z, as specified in Eqs. (6), (7), and (9), and that makes the forward propagation a circle. Do the authors actually made a typo that the Z in Eqs. (6), (7), and (9) should be the geographic tensor G? Please clarify. \n2. Computational complexity. The authors claim to have lower computational complexity than O(N^4). For A_axial, I understand it can be reduced to O(N^3). But for A_global, it is not clearly explained how to make it smaller than O(N^4). Please provide better explanation. \n3. The Transflower baseline. Transflower only uses local features and coordinates without the information of k-hop distance and geodesic distance, Is the performance advantage of GeoFlow mainly because it uses more information? In Table2, does ID 2 corresponds to the same amount of information used by Transflower? If yes, then the model actually doesn't show advantage. If not, please provide this ablation. It is important to distinguish the gains from better model design and from more information. \n4. Explanability of attention map. The attention map of Transflower has clear correlation to the points of interests. What about A_axial and A_global of GeoFlow?\n5. Explanability to performances. In Fig. 6 in appendix, the first two rows show decent similarity between the ground truth and both the prediction and the generation samples.
