However, measures like VS, MagArea, and MagDiff can be computed from the same pairwise distance matrices used to calculate PLDiv and are inherently geometry-dependent. Exactly how geometry is summarised by either of these diversity measures is a more nuanced debate that requires clearer formalisation or further empirical investigation. \n\n**Limited Advantages over Baselines:** The practical benefits of PLDiv over existing diversity measures, such as the Vendi Score (VS), MagArea, or MagDiff are not convincingly demonstrated (as detailed below). It would be of interest to show stronger examples of diversity evaluation tasks that uniquely require PLDiv and cannot be addressed by established measures. \n\n**Point Pattern Analysis:**  Figure 3 shows that PLDiv can distinguish between simulated point patterns of varying diversity. However, it is not evaluated  if PLDiv has an unique advantage at this task or if other diversity measures could also tell the difference between these examples. \n\n**Curvature prediction (Table 1):** VS and MagArea can predict curvature with MSEs of 0.05 compared to PLDiv with an MSE of 0.04 (see Limbeck et al. and Turks et al. for comparison). Given the experimental setup, and the small absolute difference in MSE, this does not seem like conclusive evidence that PLDiv is uniquely geometry-aware. For further clarifications, it would also be of interest to simply report the values of each diversity score plotted against the curvature values.\n\n**Text Evaluation (Figures 4, 6, 7,8):** Considering uncertainties, all diversity measures reach similar Spearman correlations on the response task, and PLDiv shows the lowest Spearman correlation on the story task. The authors state that PLDiv exhibits linear correlation, but if the stronger linear relationship is its main advantage over other diversity measures, Pearson correlation should be evaluated instead. Questions of interest beyond the correlation with the softmax temperature, such as the alignment with human evaluation scores are not evaluated. The reported text evaluation tasks already seem to be sufficiently addressed in more detail by baseline diversity measures (see Zhu et al. or Limbeck et al. for comparison).\n\n**Image Evaluation:** MagArea seems to show very similar trends and perform on-par with PLDiv in Figure 5. To clarify whether PLDiv performs best at this experiment, it would be beneficial to report uncertainties e.g. by repeating the experiment across varying different seeds or subsamples. Further, it would be relevant to specify which parameter and distance choices have been used to compute alternative diversity measures and how these impact results to e.g. discuss why the DCScore here shows larger fluctuations than reported by Zhu et al..\n\n**Limited Scalability:** PLDiv shows e.g. MagArea with the parameter settings reported here. However, the runtimes of PLDiv are not necessarily advantageous over diversity measures that are computed at one fixed scale of (dis)similarity e.g. the VS score, which is still notably faster than PLDiv for the examples in Table 2.. \n\n**Reproducibility:** Questions remain on the reproducibility of the experimental results. A reproducibility section and relevant supplementary materials detailing the specific experimental setups and parameter choices would improve transparency.\n\n**Theoretical Novelty:** Existing entropy-based diversity measures are also theoretically justified and the authors state no unique theoretic property of PLDiv that is not also already fulfilled by an alternative diversity measure.\n\n**Overall Assessment:** This paper introduces a valid and mathematically sound approach to measure diversity via persistent homology. However, the claimed advantages over existing diversity measures are not sufficiently substantiated, both conceptually and empirically. The work would be strengthened by more careful positioning relative to prior methods, clearer definitions of what “geometry-aware” means in this context, and broader, reproducible experiments that highlight for exactly which datasets PLDiv provides unique insights."}, "questions": {"value": "**Main Questions:**\n\n- Line 139 claims that magnitude-based methods \"abstract away the geometric or topological structures that can differentiate datasets with the same dispersion.\"\nCan the authors provide examples where PLDiv distinguishes datasets that alternative diversity measures cannot?\n\n- Does PLDiv fulfill any theoretic properties relating to diversity (beyond what is shown in 4.2.) that are not fulfilled by other diversity measures ? \n\n- Why is PLDiv proposed as a new summary of PH rather than applying existing summary statistics? Would the trends shown by PLDiv be different to e.g. total persistence or other one-number summaries of PH? Further comparison could be relevant to clearly motivate the introduction of PLDiv. \n\n- Is PLDiv (sufficiently) scalable to large datasets compared to e.g. the Vendi Score? Further empirical evaluation on increasing sample sizes would be of interest.\n\n- Could PLDiv also be generalised via alternative filtrations (e.g., using cosine distances) to capture structure in other modalities such as language embeddings?  Would being similarity-dependent then not be a strength rather than a limitation?\n\n- Which implementations of the alternative diversity measures, dissimilarity choices, and other parameter choices have been used to report the results in Table 2, Figure 4 or Figure 5? Does the choice of dissimilarity impact results and does it ensure a fair comparison?\n\n---\n\n**Further Questions on Reproducibility:**\n\n- How is the k-DPP sampling implemented and can you cite a reference?\n\n- How exactly is the experiment in Section 5.4. simulated? Does the number of observations stay the same or does it decrease as the number of labels decreases? \n\n- Do you have an intuition on why PLDiv shows the lowest standard deviation in the MSE in Table 1? \n\n- Missing implementation details are given as a reason for not reporting MagArea in Figure 4. Why could MagArea be computed for other experiments but not for this one? Could it not be calculated from e.g. the same distances used to calculate PLDiv?\n\n- Which dataset is Table 5 computed on?\n\n- Line 062 cites Bubenik et al. directly after the statement that \"curvature is inherently linked to diversity\", but their paper never once mentions diversity. Isn’t the statement taken from another reference?\n\n- Conclusions state that “these results establish PLDiv as a versatile tool for dataset construction, augmentation, model evaluation, and robustness analysis”.
