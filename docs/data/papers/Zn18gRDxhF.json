However, in my opinion, this paper lacks novelty and interest, as there are already two existing works [1,2] that explore similar perception settings. Therefore, even if the idea itself is not novel, the authors should clearly describe how their benchmark differs from these prior ones. Although Lines 071–079 do provide some comparisons with existing benchmarks, the distinction should be described more explicitly in comparison with [1,2].\n\n- I highly appreciate the large number of experiments conducted — it is indeed impressive. However, since the results appear quite random, I understand that identifying consistent patterns and conducting in-depth analysis must have been challenging for the authors. Nevertheless, rather than stopping at a superficial interpretation such as “there is no scaling law” or “latest models perform poorly,” the paper should include a deeper analysis or discussion on why such phenomena occur. For example, one possible explanation could be that the latest models, during post-training, have overemphasized reasoning datasets, which might have led to catastrophic forgetting of perception capabilities.\n\n- The paper’s readability could be improved. For instance, essential details such as dataset construction and evaluation metrics — even in brief form — should be included in the main text. Currently, since the dataset construction process is only found in the appendix, it was difficult to follow.

This raises the question, why the Ishihara test should be particularly used for the purpose in this work.\n\n- Line 045 \"common-sense expection\": This review disagrees about this statement.

While the authors mention several important cases (Lines 101-102), these cover only a very narrow scope. In fact, most real-world visual perception tasks can be adequately solved with prototypical color perception abilities limited to a few basic categories such as \"reddish,\" \"bluish,\" \"greenish,\" \"white,\" and \"black,\" except for the few counterexamples the authors cited.\n\n- The paper's motivation, scope, and practical impact regarding why color naming is important remain weak.

Moreover, the original Ishihara test evaluates not only color hue but also the ability to perceive relative color differences. Therefore, the Ishihara test alone cannot adequately assess the absolute color awareness that the authors intend to measure. Additional absolute color measurement assessment methods should be employed in parallel to fully support the paper's argument.\n\n\n- Section 4.2: Green insensitivity has also been mentioned in [C3].
