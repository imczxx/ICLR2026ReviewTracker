However, current methods rely heavily on domain feature extraction, which not only breaks the end-to-end learning paradigm but also hinders representation learning of buy–sell interactions from the orderbook, leading to inaccurate forecasts. Moreover, these methods often require training separate models for different quantiles, further violating the end-to-end principle and introducing the quantile crossing issue. Recent advances in time-series models have demonstrated promising performance in general forecasting tasks. However, these models lack inductive biases arising from buy–sell interactions and are thus parameter-heavy. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end probabilistic model called OrderFusion, which produces rich representations of buy–sell interactions, hierarchically estimates multiple quantiles via constrained residuals, and remains parameter-efficient with only 4,872 parameters. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on widely used price indices (ID1, ID2, and ID3) using three years of orderbook in high-liquidity (German) and low-liquidity (Austrian) markets. The experimental results demonstrate that OrderFusion consistently outperforms multiple competitive baselines across markets, and ablation studies  highlight the contribution of its individual components.", "tldr": "We propose OrderFusion, an end-to-end probabilistic model for accurate intraday electricity price forecasting.", "keywords": ["Intraday Electricity Market", "Orderbook", "End-to-End", "Probabilistic Forecasting"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5a4745d10c8e2993265ca1043f6b26a56bc79073.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/270fe408dc44a1a47f92f52d149ac2ac3aa2947a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes ORDERFUSION, a method designed to perform intraday electricity price forecasting by encoding orderbooks.

However, in the general forecasting setting, there are long-established and well-known probabilistic methods (see, e.g., [1-2]) that models multiple quantile levels using only one model. These works have already proposed to use techniques very similar to \"Section 3.3 Head\" of this paper to avoid quantile crossing. In addition, unlike the proposed approach, the existing approaches can model all quantile levels. Introducing existing techniques from general forecasting to the specific setting of price forecasting has a limited novelty.\n\n- According to Table 5, it seems that the experimental data are of small scale. And the proposed model is also of small scale (5,000 parameters). However, the state-of-the-art comparing methods are big Transformer models. It is unclear whether the performance gain is from the effective design of the model components, or from the potential overfitting of the comparing methods and/or the inductive bias coming from the small size of the proposed model.\n\n- Although the model has achieved competitive performance on intraday electricity price forecasting by utilizing the nature of orderbooks, I can't help but think that the application is too specific. I think this paper might be better fitted to submit to a price forecasting journal rather than ICLR.\n\n[1] Gasthaus, J., Benidis, K., Wang, Y., Rangapuram, S.
