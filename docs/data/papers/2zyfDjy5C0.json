In this work, we analyze the performance bottleneck and hardness result of $\\mathsf{VAR}$ Models through a fine-grained complexity lens. Our key contribution is identifying the conditions under which $\\mathsf{VAR}$ computations can achieve sub-quadratic time complexity. \nWe have proved that assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ($\\mathsf{SETH}$) from fine-grained complexity theory, a sub-quartic time algorithm for $\\mathsf{VAR}$ models is impossible. \nTo substantiate our theoretical findings, we present efficient constructions leveraging low-rank approximations that align with the derived criteria. \n\nFormally, suppose that $n$ is the height and width of the last VQ code map in $\\mathsf{VAR}$ models, $d$ is the hidden dimension, $R$ is the bound of the entries of the input matrices for attention calculations in $\\mathsf{VAR}$ models. We present two results: \n\nOn the negative side, we show that when $d = O(\\log n)$ and $R = \\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log n})$, assuming $\\mathsf{SETH}$, it is impossible to approximate the output of $\\mathsf{VAR}$ model up to $1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ additive error in truly sub-quartic time $O(n^{4-\\Omega(1)})$.\n \nOn the positive side, we demonstrate a sharp phase transition in the computational complexity of the $\\mathsf{VAR}$ model. When $d = O(\\log n)$ and $R = o(\\sqrt{\\log n})$, the runtime improves dramatically from $O(n^{4+o(1)})$ to $O(n^{2+o(1)})$, which approximates the output of the output of $\\mathsf{VAR}$ model up to $1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ additive error. \n\nThis work initiates the study of the computational efficiency of the $\\mathsf{VAR}$ model from a theoretical perspective.

The main theorems are direct applications of the results of Alman & Song (2023), who already analyzed the existence of sub-quadratic approximation algorithms under bounded attention entries. Although the paper includes additional complexity analysis for components of VAR beyond attention layers, the dominant computational bottleneck still arises from attention. The proofs largely rely on a straightforward application of existing results without addressing any technical challenges specific to VAR. Consequently, the paper does not provide novel or meaningful theoretical insights. Given that Alman & Song (2023) already covered the core discussion on approximation with $1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ additive error, simply extending their results to VAR models is not a sufficiently compelling contribution to justify acceptance.\n2. The paper does not establish whether VAR models actually satisfy $R = o(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ in practice. Because the contribution is predominantly theoretical—and limited, as noted above—the lack of practical justification becomes more problematic. If VAR exhibits unique characteristics that make verifying the entry-bound criterion or implementing low-rank attention more challenging, such aspects should be explained and supported by experiments or additional analysis.\n3. The writing includes unnecessary details while omitting important ones, reducing clarity and readability. For example, the Related Work section introduces diffusion models and gradient approximation techniques, which are not central to the paper’s contributions and obscure its positioning within the literature.
