In this study, we identify a critical yet underexplored issue in RL training: low-probability tokens disproportionately influence model updates due to their large gradient magnitudes. This dominance hinders the effective learning of high-probability tokens, whose gradients are essential for LLMs' performance but are substantially suppressed. To mitigate this interference, we propose two novel methods: Advantage Reweighting and Low-Probability Token Isolation (Lopti), both of which effectively attenuate gradients from low-probability tokens while emphasizing parameter updates driven by high-probability tokens. Our approaches promote balanced updates across tokens with varying probabilities, thereby enhancing the efficiency of RL training. Experimental results demonstrate that they substantially improve the performance of GRPO-trained LLMs, achieving up to a 46.2% improvement in K&K Logic Puzzle reasoning tasks.", "tldr": "We identify the issue of over-dominance of low-probability tokens in RL training for LLMs, and propose two effective methods accordingly which evidently enhance the performance of RL-trained LLMs across various models and datasets.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Large Language Models", "Generative Models", "Post Training", "Chain of Thought"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/381f150d4cc428210d9a8faff34597154e688a92.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f22cd3e6e10da0b35a51592322d0d98d4fb8ea37.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work first identifies the pattern that tokens with low probability could induce significantly higher gradients than those with high probability tokens.

Specifically, those tokens are already of high probability so that improving their grad norm can only marginally change their distribution. Figure (6) is helpful in demonstrating the effects of low and high probability tokens. But those experiments are different from gradient update. Specifically, inclusions of different probability tokens in figure (6) is hard: tokens are either updated or not updated; but in gradient update, all tokens are updated, but the update magnitudes (gradient norm) are different. \n\n3, I do appreciate the bounds over the gradient norm.
