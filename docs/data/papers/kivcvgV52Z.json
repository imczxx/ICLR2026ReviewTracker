However, existing learning-based approaches designed for 2-Opt rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which suffer from limited generalization and high computational overhead. In this work, we propose the first non-autoregressive (NAR) framework for 2-Opt, which addresses the generalization and efficiency limitations of prior AR-based models by reducing the complexity of the input space, smoothing the reward landscape, and eliminating the need for repeated inference during optimization. To enable effective training within this framework, we introduce A GFlowNet-guided 2-Opt Framework (AGOF), which leverages the reward–edge alignment capabilities of Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) to provide accurate and generalizable edge evaluations for guiding 2-Opt swaps. Furthermore, we design Exploration beyond Local Optima (ELO) to inject perturbations into the optimization process, helping the model escape local optimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGOF not only outperforms existing GFlowNet- and 2-Opt-based methods but also has favorable generalization and computation efficiency.", "tldr": "We propose a gflownet-guided 2-opt framework to solve the exiting opt solver's genelization problem", "keywords": ["Vehicle Routing Problem", "GFlowNet", "2-opt"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b79bb226cdcc2ec2144d54048d185711640bea63.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a non-autoregressive (NAR) algorithm for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) named AGOF by leveraging the 2-Opt heuristic.

AGOF is designed to overcome the limitations of autoregressive (AR) models in terms of generalization ability and computational efficiency.\n\nTo address the traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm's focus on maximizing rewards for single trajectories, the authors introduce GFlowNet to learn the entire reward distribution. This is achieved by training with the Trajectory Balance objective function, thereby enabling reward-edge alignment. The score matrix generated by GFlowNet is then used to calculate the potential improvement for each 2-Opt. Furthermore, an Exploration beyond Local Optima (ELO) mechanism is introduced to tackle the inherent tendency of 2-Opt to quickly converge to local optima.\n\nExperimental results demonstrate that AGOF exhibits remarkably fast inference speed and strong generalization capabilities, showing very small optimality gaps on large-scale problems.

In Equation (16), why not directly derive the optimal solution from the score matrix? Since the score matrix depends only on the instance graph and not on the current solution, it seems like an end-to-end approach that directly produces a solution. In this sense, the score matrix might implicitly contain enough information to infer a global solution. Could there be a way to exploit the score matrix directly to obtain the optimal solution, without the need for the time-consuming 2-opt refinement?\n3. Could you conduct an additional experiment on the sensitivity of the model to the quality of the initial solution? Since a key difference between your method and previous benchmarks is that your approach does not rely on an initial solution, I am curious about how sensitive your method and the baseline methods are to the quality of the initial solution.
