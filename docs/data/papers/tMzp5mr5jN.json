Yet current spoken dialogue systems frequently fail on under-represented dialects and accents, often misidentifying the input language and causing cascading failures in downstream dialogue tasks. Addressing this dialectal variance under low-resource constraints remains an open challenge, as standard fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting on high-dimensional speech data. We propose Convex Language Detection (CLD), a novel framework that integrates a theoretically grounded convex optimization techniques into the spoken dialogue systems pipeline. Our method is efficiently implemented via multi-GPU Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) in JAX, thus providing global optimality guarantees and fast training in polynomial time. Theoretically, we prove that our convex objective induces certified margin stability and provide rigorous guarantees against feature perturbations. Empirically, we demonstrate sample efficiency and robustness to input dialectical variance, to significantly reduce language misidentification rates for low-resource dialects within high-resource languages.

It proposes a robust ASR framework named CLARA, centered around a novel Convex Language Detection (CLD) algorithm. The core of this framework replaces the standard language detection layer, which follows the ASR encoder (like Whisper), with a convex reformulation (cvxNN) of a vanilla neural network (NN). This convex problem is then solved efficiently using ADMM-based methods. The authors claim that CLD offers strong convergence guarantees, high sample efficiency, and lightweight training costs. Experimental results show that in both binary and multiclass accent-detection tasks, CLD outperforms baselines in accuracy and Word Error Rate (WER), especially in low-data regimes (e.g., 100-1000 samples)."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.\tStrong empirical performance in low-resource environments. The CLD model demonstrates remarkable sample efficiency, maintaining high accuracy and low WER even with minimal data, as shown clearly in Fig. 1 & 2.

The convex formulation provides significant computational efficiency by allowing the model to find a global optimum, thus avoiding costly hyper-parameter tuning. As shown in Table 1, CLD trains in just 64.45 seconds (a 13-17x speedup) and requires orders of magnitude fewer TFLOPS than baselines.\n\n3.\tTheoretical analysis and reproducibility. The work provides theoretical grounding for the CLD's robustness via a margin stability analysis (Section 4.2), which links the convex program to a formal bound on margin degradation under feature perturbations. Furthermore, the authors' commitment to open-sourcing their JAX code and custom dialect datasets strongly supports reproducibility.\n\n4.\tValidation with Human Feedback. The paper strengthens its claims by moving beyond automated metrics to include validation from human testers in a practical scenario (Sec 5.6).
