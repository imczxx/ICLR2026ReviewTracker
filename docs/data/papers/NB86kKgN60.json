Consequently, developing deep learning methods that can effectively process EEG signals remains an open and important research problem. To tackle this problem, this work presents a new method inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). In computer vision, NeRF techniques train a neural network to memorize the appearance of a 3D scene and then uses its learned parameters to render and edit the scene from any viewpoint. We draw an analogy between the discrete images captured from different viewpoints used to learn a continuous 3D scene in NeRF, and EEG electrodes positioned at different locations on the scalp, which are used to infer the underlying representation of continuous neural activity. Building on this connection, we show that a neural network can be trained on a single EEG sample in a NeRF style manner to produce a fixed size and informative weight vector that encodes the entire signal. Moreover, via this representation we can render the EEG signal at previously unseen time steps and spatial electrode positions. We demonstrate that this approach enables continuous visualization of brain activity at any desired resolution, including ultra high resolution, and reconstruction of raw EEG signals. Finally, our empirical analysis shows that this method can effectively simulate nonexistent electrodes data in EEG recordings, allowing the reconstructed signal to be fed into standard EEG processing networks to improve performance.", "tldr": "We propose a NeRF-inspired method that encodes raw EEG signals into a compact neural representation, enabling high-resolution visualization, denoising, and electrode imputation from a single sample.", "keywords": ["EEG Representation", "EEG Super-Resolution", "EEG Denoising", "NeRF"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d3d6884308c13c8f51587a36ad83a97e4911e0ca.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/acde076d59b6c11a2845f92259c5bff813e0cf82.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a novel approach for modeling EEG data by drawing inspiration from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).

The proposed approach is more akin to an implicit neural representation (INR) than to a true Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), as it lacks core NeRF components such as volumetric rendering and per-ray sampling strategies that enable view-dependent reconstruction.\n\n2. Insufficient experimental validation. The experimental evaluation is limited to electrode-missing scenarios and does not explore other important cases, such as missing time points, combined spatiotemporal missing patterns, or varying sparsity levels. As a result, the generality and robustness of the proposed approach remain unverified. Though the idea of this paper is very interesting, a comprehensive evaluation would further largely strenghten the contributions and support the authors’ claims more convincingly.\n\n3. The framework is limited in scalability and practicality. Each EEG sample requires a dedicated per-recording network trained on short (3s) segments with progressive fine-tuning. This setup limits scalability to large cohort of EEG datasets. Probably providing the time for fully finetune for of the model would be helpful.\n\n\nMinor concerns:\n1. The paper should discuss potential limitations when reconstructing signals at boundary electrodes. Similar to NeRF, the proposed model may struggle to extrapolate accurately in regions with no nearby training electrodes, leading to unreliable reconstruction near the scalp edges.\n\n2. The evaluation is conducted on relatively small datasets, which limits the assessment of the model’s scalability and generalization. Including experiments on larger or more heterogeneous EEG datasets would further strengthen the paper’s claims.\n\n3.
