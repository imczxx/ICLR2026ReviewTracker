Document images, such as scanned forms and infographics, highlight critical challenges due to their complex layouts and textual content. However, current benchmarks do not fully address these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural images, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set of k synthetic data based on four diverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed benchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on text-rich images. In addition, we propose two simple and effective TRIG methods based on general instruction tuning and plug-and-play efficient embedding, respectively. By finetuning MLLMs on our synthetic dataset, they promisingly improve spatial reasoning and grounding capabilities.", "tldr": "We introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering.", "keywords": ["Vision Question Answering", "Multimodal Large Language Models", "Visual Grounding"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7b5a5f7f559741dd6bde3040faaf5f3c6a1cecf1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The author introduces TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering.

Although the proposed embedding method demonstrates advantages in terms of efficiency, it has not been adequately compared with recent related work under identical experimental conditions, which diminishes the credibility of the method's innovation. It is recommended to perform the comparison using a unified dataset, the same OCR input, and consistent evaluation metrics, and to present a comparison table detailing accuracy, inference delay, and memory usage. \n4.

In Table 1, several open-source models, including LLaVA and Qwen-VL, exhibit an IoU of 0.00 in the OCR-free scenario, which is markedly inconsistent with their performance in the standard VQA task. This discrepancy could potentially stem from errors in the evaluation code, deficiencies in the prompt design, or issues with the parsing of model outputs. If it can be demonstrated that the evaluation is indeed accurate and that the model is incapable of generating valid coordinates, the current conclusion may be upheld. Conversely, if the issue pertains to the evaluation or the parsing format, a revision of the conclusion will be necessary. \n2. The current description lacks sufficient detail. For instance, the method used for similarity measurement has not been addressed. It is advisable to include relevant formulas or pseudocode to elucidate the computational process leading from image and text embeddings to the resultant similarity vector. Additionally, the method of similarity measurement and the aggregation strategy should be thoroughly clarified. \n3.
