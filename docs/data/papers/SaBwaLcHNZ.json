We study inter-character interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve each character’s identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and because mixing styles often causes **style delusion**, where realistic characters appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation (CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative storytelling.

The authors identify two primary challenges: 1) the \"non-coexistence\" of characters in training data, and 2) \"style delusion,\" where characters' visual styles blend undesirably. To address these, they propose a two-part solution. First, **Cross-Character Embedding (CCE)**, a prompt engineering strategy that uses structured captions of the form `` `[Character: <name>], <action>` `` to disentangle character identity and behavior. This allows the model to learn character-specific traits from their respective source videos and compose them at inference time. Second, **Cross-Character Augmentation (CCA)**, a data augmentation technique that synthetically creates training examples of cross-style interaction by segmenting characters from one domain and pasting them into scenes from another. These augmented clips are captioned with an additional `` `[scene-style: <style>]` `` tag to help the model preserve stylistic integrity. The authors fine-tune a large-scale text-to-video model (Wan2.1) on a curated 81-hour dataset and demonstrate through extensive experiments that their method significantly outperforms existing baselines in identity preservation, interaction quality, and style consistency.

This is a natural evolution of personalized generation and has high potential for creative applications.\n*   **Novel Methodology**: The proposed framework is original in its combination of two distinct ideas to solve two well-defined problems. CCE (via prompt structure) tackles the non-coexistence of characters, and CCA (via synthetic compositing) addresses the style delusion problem. This two-pronged approach is elegant and shown to be effective.\n*   **Strong Empirical Results**: The qualitative results are visually impressive and clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches, which either fail to maintain identity or cannot produce coherent interactions. The quantitative results, despite the aforementioned issues with the ablation tables, generally show a strong performance lead, especially on the task-specific VLM metrics.\n*   **Benchmark Contribution**: The introduction of a dedicated benchmark for multi-character interaction, including a new suite of VLM-based metrics tailored to character identity, motion, style, and interaction, is a substantial contribution in its own right. It provides a more meaningful way to evaluate models on this task than standard metrics alone."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "*   **Scalability and Data Dependency**: The method's primary weakness is its reliance on fine-tuning using a large corpus of video data for a pre-defined set of characters. As implied in Section 3.3, each new character universe (e.g., a TV show) requires collecting hours of video footage and undergoing an expensive fine-tuning process. This makes it difficult to scale to new, arbitrary characters in an open-world setting. As acknowledged by the authors, this is a significant limitation.\n*   **Lack of Human Evaluation and Unjustified Metric Choices**: For a task where success is highly subjective (e.g., \"authenticity\", \"plausibility\"), the absence of a human study is a major weakness. The paper instead introduces VLM-based metrics but fails to justify why established identity preservation metrics (e.g., face recognition similarity) were not used or compared against, especially for the human-like characters. While VLM evaluation is innovative, its reliability is questionable without proper protocol.\n*   **Questionable Reproducibility of VLM-based Evaluation**: The use of a VLM as a core evaluation tool introduces significant reproducibility concerns. The output of VLMs can be stochastic due to parameters like `temperature`. The paper fails to describe the protocol used to ensure deterministic and reproducible scores. Key details are missing: Was `temperature` set to 0? Were scores averaged over multiple runs? What were the exact prompts used? Without this information, the quantitative results in Table 1, 2, and 3 are not fully credible.\n*   **Unverified Claim of Model-Agnosticism**: The paper claims its framework is \"model-agnostic\" (Section 3.1) but provides no empirical evidence. All experiments are conducted by fine-tuning a single base model (Wan2.1-T2V-14B). Without applying the CCE and CCA framework to at least one other distinct T2V backbone, this claim of generalizability remains unsubstantiated.\n*   **Clarity and Consistency of Ablation Studies**: The quantitative results in the ablation section (Tables 2 and 3) are poorly presented. There are numerical inconsistencies for what should be identical experimental conditions across different tables. For example, the results for the full model (\"Ours\" in Table 1, \"w/ Both\" in Table 2, and \"10%\" in Table 3) all report different scores. This makes it impossible to confidently assess the individual contributions of the proposed components. This must be fixed."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  **On Data Requirements**: Could you please clarify the data requirements more explicitly? The paper implies a single fine-tuning on a mixed dataset. Does this mean to add a new character from a new TV show, one must re-run the entire fine-tuning process on the combined old and new data? What is the approximate training time (e.g., in GPU-hours) for the reported 5-epoch fine-tuning on the 81-hour dataset?\n2.  **On Evaluation Metrics**:\n    *   (a) Could you justify the decision to exclusively use VLM-based metrics for identity preservation over established methods like face recognition ID similarity, at least for the human characters (Mr. Bean, Young Sheldon's cast)? A comparison showing the VLM's superiority would strengthen your metric choice.\n    *   (b) Crucially, what protocol was used to ensure the VLM evaluation is deterministic and reproducible? Please provide the exact prompts, model version, and parameter settings (especially `temperature`) used to query Gemini-1.5-Flash for the Identity-P, Motion-P, Style-P, and Interaction-P scores in the appendix.\n3.  **On Generalizability**: To substantiate the \"model-agnostic\" claim, could you provide any results or insights, even preliminary, from applying your CCE and CCA framework to a different base T2V model?\n4.  **On Inconsistent Ablation Results**: Could you please clarify and unify the results presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3? Specifically, please ensure that the results for the same experimental setup are consistent across all tables and explain the counter-intuitive findings in Table 2 (e.g., the drop in `` `Subject-C` ``).\n5.  **On CCE's Mechanism**: The term \"Cross-Character Embedding\" suggests a specific learned representation. Can you clarify whether your method learns an explicit, separable embedding for each character, or if CCE is more accurately described as a structured prompting technique that influences the text-conditioning of the frozen T2V model?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ccc2FZ8VDV", "forum": "SaBwaLcHNZ", "replyto": "SaBwaLcHNZ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3735/Reviewer_Fsis"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3735/Reviewer_Fsis"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3735/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761989155019, "cdate": 1761989155019, "tmdate": 1762916952970, "mdate": 1762916952970, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
