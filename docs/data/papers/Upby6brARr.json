Existing algorithms for these problems often rely on optimal radius guessing strategy, leading to an overall running time that is dependent on the aspect ratio Δ (the ratio between the maximum and minimum pairwise distances). This dependency may potentially limit the scalability of the algorithms for handling large-scale datasets. To overcome the aspect ratio dependency issue, we propose a multi-scaling method.  Multi-scaling partitions the clustering instance based on relative distances between data points. It then generates a set of candidate radii whose size is independent of Δ, ensuring the existence of at least one radius that can closely approximate the optimal one for any constrained k-center instance. This narrows the search space for radius guessing  and removes the runtime dependency on the aspect ratio. To further improve the efficiency of multi-scaling, we introduce a problem-specific data reduction method that allows multi-scaling to operate on a smaller unweighted instance while preserving theoretical guarantees. These techniques enable us to obtain approximation results for a series of constrained k-center problems with near-linear runtime in the data size. Empirical experiments show that our proposed methods achieve better performances compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms on both small and large-scale clustering datasets.", "tldr": "Avoid guessing clustering radii and remove the aspect ratio from the running time for constrained k-center problems", "keywords": ["Constrained Clustering; Approximation Algorithm"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dd276000541035400c9306ef175edfa629664c9a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/00a09fe48d1c84bd215b827a9a5d02ac8c0df129.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Many algorithms for constrained $k$-center problems (such as those with outliers, fairness constraints, etc.) rely on the assumption that a near-optimal radius can be efficiently approximated. Typically, this step incurs a dependence on $\\Delta$, the distance aspect ratio of the input. The paper proposes a preprocessing subroutine that eliminates this dependence by producing a list guaranteed to contain a near-optimal radius.\nIn Euclidean spaces, the proposed subroutine constructs a list of size $O(n \\log (nd))$, which, when combined with a standard binary search, results in only $O(\\log (n \\log d))$ iterations of the downstream algorithms. The preprocessing itself runs in $O(nd \\log^2 n)$ time (ignoring $\\epsilon$-dependent factors). Consequently, the approach removes the $\\Delta$-dependence from the running time of many existing algorithms.\n\nThe core idea is based on constructing a Hierarchically Separated Tree (HST) over the input points. For Euclidean settings, such trees can be built in $O(nd \\log^2 n)$ time [Har-Peled, 2011], independently of $\\Delta$. Once the HST is obtained, the authors introduce a bottom-up bucketing strategy that groups distances associated with each tree node. The key observation is that the distance between points represented by the children of a node is bounded in the HST, allowing both the bucket sizes and the number of buckets to remain independent of $\\Delta$.\n\nAdditionally, the paper presents specific preprocessing schemes for certain problem settings, achieving faster running times for corresponding algorithms. Finally, the authors conduct an extensive set of experiments demonstrating the empirical speedups achieved by incorporating the proposed subroutine compared to existing approaches."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

I find it difficult to understand the practical motivation for designing such a preprocessing subroutine. From a theoretical perspective (real RAM model), the motivation is clear: $\\Delta$ can be arbitrarily large, making such a subroutine useful. However, the paper’s motivation seems to be based on practical datasets. In such cases, the aspect ratio is typically bounded in terms of $n$, since the input precision is inherently limited. For example, assuming $n$ points with each coordinate represented using $O(n)$ bits is a reasonable practical assumption. In this case, $\\Delta = 2^{O(n)}$, which leads to a multiplicative overhead (as mentioned in the paper) of $O(\\log \\log (n\\Delta)) = O(\\log n + \\log \\log n)$—comparable to the overhead obtained using the proposed methodology.\n\n2. The techniques used are quite standard: constructing HSTs and applying bucketing. Similarly, the data reduction approach for $k$-center with outliers follows the classic Gonzalez algorithm.\n\n3. The results appear to primarily target Euclidean spaces. Although the authors provide a short extension to general metrics in the appendix, the final theorem statement is not presented, leaving the precise bounds unclear. Moreover, for general metrics, the input already has $n^2$ distance entries, so sorting and applying binary search is already near-linear time, reducing the apparent benefit of the proposed approach."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
