The work employs VariableJitter augmentation to stabilize training with Fourier features. However, this setup lacks fair and step-by-step ablation studies.

To properly isolate the effects, the paper should include step-by-step comparisons across the following variants: baseline, baseline+aug, fourier, fourier + aug.\n\n2. Lack direct evidence of mitigation spectral bias. The improvements should be supported by direct visualization or spectral analysis between with/wo fourier.\n\n3. Absence of real-world experiments. Real world 3D point clouds contain more noise (e.g. point sparsity, unstable depth sensors, noise or occlusion artifacts), which could lead to unstable learning of policy or sensitivity to spurious geometry. Besides, simulation engines has coarse contact resolution compared with real-world ones. Experiments on real hardware (even under noisy or partially occluded conditions) should make the results much more convincing. \n\n4. Limited contribution scope. The second contribution appears to be a standard validation of first contribution rather than an independent contribution. \n\n5. Limited scope to 3D policy. The motivation regarding spectral bias should also apply to 2D inputs. The authors' justification about RGB is sensitive to viewpoint or lighting is not convincing, especially the experiments presented in the paper are not directly related to these factors.
