These non-auto-regressive approaches involving different generative methods, including GAN, Diffusion, and Flow Matching for time series, have empirically demonstrated high-quality generation capability and accuracy. However, we still lack an appropriate understanding of how it processes approximation and generalization. This paper presents the first theoretical framework from the perspective of flow-based generative models to relieve the knowledge of limitations. In particular, we provide our insights with strict guarantees from three perspectives: Approximation, Generalization and Efficiency. In detail, our analysis achieves the contributions as follows:\n* By assuming a general data model, the fitting of the flow-based generative models is confirmed to converge to arbitrary error under the universal approximation of Diffusion Transformer (DiT).\n* Introducing a polynomial-based regularization for flow matching, the generalization error thus be bounded since the generalization of polynomial approximation.\n* The sampling for generation is considered as an optimization process, we demonstrate its fast convergence with updating standard first-order gradient descent of some objective.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["flow matching", "time series", "polynomial approximation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bd19659e477f59aa7ccbc262533d7b4c81ad9f12.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a unified theoretical framework for flow-based generative models specifically tailored for time-series generation and forecasting, providing three key classes of theoretical guarantees. Firstly, for Approximation, the authors demonstrate, by leveraging the universal approximation properties of Diffusion Transformers (DiT), that the model class can approximate the optimal conditional flow with arbitrary precision. Secondly, concerning Generalization, the introduction of a polynomial-basis regularization for the conditional flow results in an explicit upper bound on the generalization error, which is established under a noisy time-series model. Finally, in terms of Efficiency, the paper establishes convergence rates for the sampling process by casting it as a first-order optimization procedure under specific smoothness and regularity assumptions. Overall, the work's primary ambition is to be the first to deliver a comprehensive, end-to-end theoretical justification, covering approximation, generalization, and sampling convergence, for modern flow-based time-series models."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. **Motivation.** The paper targets a well-defined and important gap: the theory of generative models for time series lags behind rapid empirical progress.
