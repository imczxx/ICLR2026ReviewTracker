However, we find that many recent studies adopt experimental designs that systematically undermine the validity of their claims. From a survey of over 40 papers, we identify six recurring methodological flaws: agents are often homogeneous (Profile), interactions are absent or artificially imposed (Interaction), memory is discarded (Memory), prompts tightly control outcomes (Minimal-Control), agents can infer the experimental hypothesis (Unawareness), and validation relies on simplified theoretical models rather than real-world data (Realism). For instance, GPT-4o and Qwen-3 correctly infer the underlying social experiment in 53.1% of cases when given instructions from prior work—violating the Unawareness principle. We formalize these six requirements as the PIMMUR principles and argue they are necessary conditions for credible LLM-based social simulation. To demonstrate their impact, we re-run five representative studies using a framework that enforces PIMMUR and find that the reported social phenomena frequently fail to emerge under more rigorous conditions.

Overstated claim of necessity\n\nThe authors assert that all six requirements are necessary conditions for credible LLM-based social simulation (“We formalize these six requirements as the PIMMUR principles and argue they are necessary conditions…”). However, this claim is neither theoretically grounded nor universally applicable.\n\nSocial systems are complex, and different studies necessarily focus on specific facets. Depending on the research question, simplifying or omitting certain aspects can be both legitimate and necessary. For example, when using LLM agents to test prospect theory, modeling detailed interactions, memory, or realism may not be essential. Thus, these requirements should be treated as optional design dimensions, not rigid necessary conditions.\n\n2. Logical inconsistency and self-contradiction\n\nThe authors’ own experiments fail to satisfy their proposed principles. In Section 5, they mention how five requirements are satisfied but do not address Realism. In subsections 5.1 and 5.2, no empirical human data are used, which directly violates their own definition of Realism:\n“A simulation should use empirical data from real human societies as references rather than only reproducing simplified theoretical models.” This inconsistency weakens the credibility of their argument and demonstrates that the proposed framework is not realistically achievable even by the authors themselves.\n\n3. Binary evaluation is arbitrary and misleading\n\nTable 1 applies a binary classification to 41 prior studies, yet many principles (for example, Profile) are inherently continuous. For instance, “Agents should have distinct backgrounds, preferences, or cognitive styles…” but how much heterogeneity is enough? Having richer profiles beyond names is only marginally better, and the distinction between sufficient and insufficient is subjective. This binary labeling oversimplifies complex design choices and may unfairly undervalue prior contributions.\n\n4. Potential unfairness toward prior work\n\nBy applying these rigid standards retroactively, the authors risk undervaluing earlier research that deliberately simplified assumptions for theoretical clarity or computational feasibility. Social simulation is a tool for understanding human and social behavior, and which dimensions to emphasize or simplify should depend on the research question, not on a universal checklist.\n\n5. Limited coverage of existing frameworks\n\nThe review omits several major open-source platforms that are central to current LLM-based social simulation research, including\nYulan-OneSim (https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-OneSim), AgentSociety (https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentSociety), SocioVerse (https://github.com/FudanDISC/SocioVerse).

The paper lacks experimental details in replication, including sample sizes of replication experiments, statistical information on results (such as whether the decrease from 56% to 32% at line 368 is statistically significant), and details of modifications to each original experiment. The appendix only contains prompts, making it impossible to determine whether added details might change the original experimental intent, such as whether adding Big Five persona affects the original setup.\n\nW2. The principles and boundaries between principles are ambiguous. For example, what constitutes \"sufficient\" heterogeneity? In Cho et al. (2025) Herd behavior (Table 1, line 237), the authors consider it has profile, while the original paper appears to have only 2 agents using the same model without identity differences, with only simple peer labels. Other criticisms of this work are also ambiguous, such as line 425 stating \"no actual interaction occurs among agents,\" while in the original paper agents change behavior based on other agents' responses. Additionally, this work only references the simplified setup in Section 3 of Cho et al. (2025) without discussing the more complex multi-agent setup in later sections. Does assigning Big Five personality traits to agents violate the Minimal-Control principle? This may contradict the authors' criticism of using simplified theoretical models. Furthermore, if the task nature does not require agent heterogeneity, does adding personality traits increase variables requiring validation or ablation experiments? The Minimal-Control principle is very difficult to implement in actual MAS system design. What is essential versus steering? Is the reversed instruction used in paper replication over-control?\n\nW3. Compliance judgments on existing work may not be fair. Some simplified setups may be designed for specific research goals rather than reproducing real situations. In the review (Table 1), the authors could consider adding a column to indicate whether each work aims to reproduce real social situations, to evaluate the significance of compliance judgments. Again using the Cho et al. (2025) example, the objective of it seems to be mechanistic understanding of LLM's herd behavior factors instead of reproducing human-like herd behavior."}, "questions": {"value": "C1. In Table 1 line 244, \"Sugarscape\" as a simulation goal may not be the best expression. I believe most ICLR readers are unfamiliar with this classic experiment. Consider using other terms (for example, indicating it relates to resources/survival).\n\nC2. The 53% value in the abstract lacks context and does not reappear until page 6 of the paper. Readers cannot know what magnitude of deficiency this value represents in existing social simulations. Rather than providing this value, giving a brief example explaining what unawareness is might be better.\n\nC3. Some prompt designs may lack significance. For example, the \"FORGET ALL THE PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS\" setup at line 829 to test awareness does not mean agents will maintain the same awareness in actual experiments. Even if LLMs recognize in experimental design inquiries that this is a replication of a social experiment, behavior during simulation may not necessarily reflect this awareness. Under this setup, there may not be a causal relationship between whether the experiment can be identified and whether behavior is biased.\n\nC4. Differences in replication results may have multiple explanations, such as prompts, experimental framework implementation methods, randomness settings, number of simulations, etc. Primarily attributing differences to variations in PIMMUR dimensions may risk overclaiming.\n\nC5. The definition of realism is controversial. Social simulations that are not based on real data calibration can still be meaningful. On one hand, empirical data is collected and interpreted through theoretical frameworks, making pure empirical data difficult to define. On the other hand, simulation has particular significance for problems where original data is difficult to obtain. Many social simulation works involve no real data but are profoundly meaningful, such as the classic Schelling's Segregation Model.
