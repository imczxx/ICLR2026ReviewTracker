Existing 3DGS-based methods face a key trade-off: approaches using split-sum approximations fail to model secondary light effects, while those relying on heavy Monte Carlo integration suffer significant rendering slowdowns. To address this, we present IRGS++, an accelerated inter-reflective Gaussian splatting framework for inverse rendering that effectively handles both low-gloss and glossy materials. To reduce ray sampling in Monte Carlo integration, we implement multiple importance sampling with distinct distributions (cosine, GGX, and light sampling) to better capture light effects. We also apply a cross-bilateral filter to the Monte Carlo estimator, reducing noise while preserving quality with limited ray samples. Furthermore, we replace 2D Gaussian ray tracing with mesh-based ray tracing during relighting, cutting per-ray computations from hundreds of ray-splat checks to a single ray-triangle intersection. Extensive experiments demonstrate IRGS++'s superior performance among 3DGS-based competitors on both low-gloss and glossy datasets while achieving a 50-fold acceleration over IRGS.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Gaussian Splatting", "inverse rendering", "relighting"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b263955c1acffa94f41734e8eea2a5fd8c54c319.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/62c27b7c706c730b9b3ca56283a966226c85f922.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a novel inverse rendering framework, IRGS++, which introduces MIS and denoiser to reduce the variance and mesh-based ray tracing to improve the efficiency.

The same strategies have been used in previous work Nvdiffrecmc. And integrating mesh-based ray tracing in inverse rendering framework was also raised in previous work MIRReS.\n2. The performance gain is not good enough. As shown in table 1, the NVS and albedo estimation performance of IRGS++ is comparable with IRGS. The relighting performance of IRGS++ is better than IRGS, but it seems strange since the albedo estimation results of both methods are very close and Figure 8 shows that the performance of 2DGRT and mesh-based ray tracing is almost the same.

Limited Methodological Novelty\n\nThe core contributions largely comprise integrating well-established graphics techniques—such as MIS, denoising, and mesh extraction for ray tracing—into the existing IRGS framework. While effective, this represents an engineering combination of multiple prior works (e.g., Nvdiffrec-MC [1] for MIS/denoising, IRGS [2] as the base, and Ref-Gaussian [3] for initialization) rather than a fundamental methodological breakthrough. The paper would benefit from a deeper discussion justifying the specific choices of these components over alternatives.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Unclear Mesh-based Ray Tracing Details\n\nSection 3.4 seems to lack sufficient detail regarding the mesh conversion and attribute assignment.\n\n- It is unclear if there is a specific mesh-Gaussian binding process similar to recent works like [4]. Could you clarify the detailed process in Section 3.4 regarding how material attributes are assigned to mesh vertices? Is there an explicit mesh-Gaussian binding process involved (similar to [4])?\n- Does the proposed mesh-based ray tracing support multi-bounce indirect lighting, or is it limited to single-bounce? How does this compare to other recent mesh-based inverse rendering works that employ multi-bounce path tracing (e.g., [5])?\n\nIncluding [4,5] in the discussions could be beneficial.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The paper only compares with GS-based and NeRF-based methods, while there is also a rich literature of mesh-based inverse rendering methods, such as MIRRES [1].

The proposed method should be a 2-stage pipeline, where the first stage is using Ref-Gaussian to initialize the geometry and the second is the inverse rendering stage with raytracing.
