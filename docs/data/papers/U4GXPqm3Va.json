Among these approaches, iSTFT-based vocoders have gained attention. They predict a complex-valued spectrogram and then synthesize the waveform via iSTFT, thereby avoiding redundant, computationally expensive upsampling. However, current approaches use real-valued networks that process the real and imaginary parts independently. This separation limits their ability to capture the inherent structure of complex spectrograms. We present ComVo, a Complex-valued neural Vocoder whose generator and discriminator use native complex arithmetic. This enables an adversarial training framework that provides structured feedback directly in the complex domain. To guide phase transformations in a structured manner, we introduce phase quantization, which discretizes phase values and regularizes the training process. Finally, we propose a block-matrix computation scheme to improve training efficiency by reducing redundant operations. Experiments demonstrate that ComVo achieves higher synthesis quality than comparable real-valued baselines, and that its block-matrix scheme reduces training time by 25%.

ComVo leverages complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) for both the generator and discriminators, enabling better modeling of signal characteristics and thereby enhancing audio reconstruction quality. In addition, two practical techniques are proposed: (1) Phase quantization - stabilizes training by mitigating abrupt phase drift, and (2) Block-matrix computation - improves computational efficiency by performing block-wise operations on real and imaginary components of complex-valued tensors. Experimental results show that ComVo outperforms real-valued vocoders with comparable parameter counts across multiple evaluation metrics (e.g., UTMOS, PESQ, MR-STFT).

Therefore, for a fair comparison of model capacity and memory usage, the baseline parameter counts should be doubled.\n\nOverall, the ComVo model itself is competitive and valuable, and its performance improvements are noteworthy.

If the first Conv1D was not complex-valued, the phase quantization layer would not be required. What would happen if this sequence (complex Conv1D followed by phase quantization) was replaced with a single real-valued Conv1D layer? Such a comparison would help clarify the necessity and contribution of the phase quantization layer.\n- Why is the phase quantization layer not commonly employed in other complex-valued CNNs?\n- Could the authors provide a theoretical justification for why the phase quantization layer is beneficial or necessary for improved performance?\n- Why the inference latency of ComVo is noticeably slower than Vocos, despite adopting a similar architectural foundation?\n- A comparison of models with equivalent memory usage would be informative, since ComVo uses complex-valued tensors for its parameters, which actually consist of two float tensors.

The primary claim is that CVNNs are superior because they \"capture the intrinsic dependencies between the real and imaginary components.\" However, this central hypothesis is asserted rather than rigorously validated. The performance gains, while present, do not in themselves prove that this specific mechanism is the cause. My main conceptual issue is that for a spectrogram to be perfectly invertible back to a real-valued signal, it must satisfy time-frequency consistency. This means the space of valid spectrograms for real audio is a highly structured subspace within the broader domain of all possible complex spectrograms. By moving all computations into an unconstrained complex domain, the model may actually face the additional burden of learning to stay within this physically valid subspace, which might not be an advantage. The paper does not address this potential conflict.\nFurthermore, the overall architecture still relies on a standard Multi-Period Discriminator (MPD) operating on the real-valued waveform. The MPD is known to be a very powerful component in modern vocoders. Its presence makes it difficult to ascertain whether the observed quality improvements truly stem from the benefits of complex-domain feedback via the cMRD, or if the MPD is still doing the majority of the perceptual heavy lifting. Finally, from a structural standpoint, the detailed background in Section 2.1 on the fundamentals of CVNNs feels more appropriate for an appendix, as it disrupts the main narrative of the paper."}, "questions": {"value": "I hope the authors can address the following points to strengthen their claims and clarify the contributions of their work:\n1. The core premise of the paper needs a stronger defense. Given that the ultimate target is a real-valued signal, which implies its spectrogram must satisfy time-frequency consistency, why is it advantageous for the hidden layers to operate under general complex arithmetic rather than in a way that respects this physical constraint from the outset? Could the unconstrained complex modeling actually be a less efficient path to the desired solution space?\n2. The central claim is that the model better \"captures intrinsic dependencies\" between real and imaginary parts. Beyond the final performance metrics, is there any more direct analysis you can provide to support this? For instance, have you analyzed the learned phase-magnitude relationships or the structure of the internal representations to show they are more coherent than in real-valued models?\n3. The ablation study in Table 4 is insightful, but the powerful real-valued MPD remains a constant across all configurations. How can we be confident that the gains attributed to the complex-valued cMRD are not simply an artifact of having two strong discriminators, with the MPD still being the primary driver of quality? Have you considered an ablation where only the cMRD is used, to truly isolate its effectiveness?\n4. Other iSTFT-based models like Vocos and iSTFTNet also operate on complex spectrograms, but their motivation seems more direct—it's a computationally efficient and direct target for the network. Your paper claims a more fundamental modeling advantage. Could you elaborate on why your motivation leads to a better vocoder than one motivated purely by computational efficiency?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "HgaZ4k7OlV", "forum": "U4GXPqm3Va", "replyto": "U4GXPqm3Va", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17109/Reviewer_eE9R"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17109/Reviewer_eE9R"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17109/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761919987387, "cdate": 1761919987387, "tmdate": 1762927108079, "mdate": 1762927108079, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
