However, current methodologies present two primary limitations. First, reliance on synthetic anomalies and reconstruction loss metrics introduces inadequate supervisory guidance for targeted model optimization. Second, uniform optimization strategies applied indiscriminately across all image regions neglect spatial discrepancies in model confidence levels. We propose Pseudo-Label Supervision in Unsupervised Industrial Anomaly Detection (PLSAD), a novel framework integrating unsupervised learning with pseudo-label supervision. Our methodology focuses on the differences between the original images and the synthetic anomaly images, thereby decoupling reconstruction processes from discriminative feature learning. This dual-stream architecture not only enhances feature representation robustness but also mitigates error propagation through explicit separation of learning objectives. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive Intersection-over-Union Weighting (AIW), which dynamically evaluates the model's local performance through pseudo-label and synthetic ground truth alignment, and automatically emphasizes challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on three IAD benchmarks (MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA) confirm PLSAD's competitive performance in both detection accuracy and anomaly localization.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Industrial anomaly Detection", "Anomaly Detection", "Unsupervised Industrial Anomaly Detection"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/914813e18967a4ef5661d66796f205fc5d1aa5cc.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes PLSAD, a pseudo-label supervised framework for unsupervised industrial anomaly detection.\nBy integrating reconstruction and discrimination networks with adaptive IoU weighting, the method introduces explicit supervision from synthetic anomalies, leading to improved detection accuracy and localization.\nThe study is well-motivated and shows notable improvements across multiple benchmarks, though its overall presentation could be clearer and some figures and tables would benefit from more detailed explanatory context."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.The paper introduces a distinctive idea of reconstructing normal images from anomalous ones and leveraging the reconstruction loss to identify difficult regions.
