A key barrier is the lack of principled protein structure tokenizers (PSTs): existing approaches fix token size or rely on continuous vector codebooks, limiting interpretability, multi-scale control, and transfer across architectures. We introduce GeoBPE, a geometry-grounded PST that transforms continuous, noisy, multi-scale backbone conformations into discrete ``sentences'' of geometry while enforcing global constraints. Analogous to byte-pair encoding, GeoBPE generates a hierarchical vocabulary of geometric primitives by iteratively (i) clustering Geo-Pair occurrences with k-medoids to yield a resolution-controllable vocabulary; (ii) quantizing each Geo-Pair to its closest medoid prototype; and (iii) reducing drift through differentiable inverse kinematics that optimizes boundary glue angles under an $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ end-frame loss. GeoBPE offers compression ($>$10× reduction in bits-per-residue at similar distortion rate), data efficiency ($>$10× less training data), and generalization (maintains test/train distortion ratio of $1.0-1.1$). It is architecture-agnostic: (a) its hierarchical vocabulary provides a strong inductive bias for coarsening residue-level embeddings from large PLMs into motif- and protein-level representations, consistently outperforming leading PSTs across $12$ tasks and $24$ test splits; (b) paired with a transformer, GeoBPE supports unconditional backbone generation via language modeling; and (c) tokens align with CATH functional families and support expert-interpretable case studies, offering functional meaning absent in prior PSTs.", "tldr": "We propose a geometric byte-pair encoding tokenizer for proteins.", "keywords": ["protein", "geometry", "structure", "byte pair encoding", "tokenizers", "multi-scale protein structure", "folds", "backbones", "motifs"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2b5b235a40a930556a923c18a18191d91c436053.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/53c8a011394508d032fa25e8e6c922fb68a85649.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors present GeoBPE, a protein structure tokenizer which produces hierarchical tokenizations of proteins using a byte-pair encoding-like technique.

This induces distortions in the resulting geometry of a protein, which they resolve by making corrections at each stage of the tokenization.

By contrast ESM3's tokenizer does contain substantial information about residues which can be very distant in the linear sequence of the protein, yet GeoBPE does better on global reconstruction tasks. This is perhaps surprising and I wonder if the authors could comment on it.\n\nGenerally the peptide backbone bond lengths are very close to fixed (in fact there are usually restraints on these when solving structures by X-ray diffraction, NMR, or Cryo-EM). I wonder whether these are actually needed in GeoBPE; do the authors find clusters of motifs where these are very different, or are the bond lengths similar between all motifs?

GeoBPE is designed as a geometric analog to BPE. It works by iteratively building a hierarchical vocabulary of structural motifs, which involves: iteratively identifying the most frequent pairs of structural motifs and clustering their occurrences using k-medoids, then replacing these occurrences with a representative prototype from the new vocabulary.

The paper's explicit handles the geometric drift. The use of differentiable inverse kinematics to optimize glue angles is a principled solution to the problem of maintaining global structural integrity while performing local quantization. Ablation study shows this step is essential, as omitting it causes reconstruction RMSD to jump from 1.66 to 4.39.\n4. GeoBPE shows excellent out-of-distribution generalization.

The SSLM experiments (Table 7) indicate that the language model trained on the GeoBPE vocabulary struggles significantly with unconditional generation. This is evidenced by the low scTM (less than 0.3) and designability (less than 5%). Performance at this level is insufficient for most practical applications. This finding leads to serious concerns about using GeoBPE as a foundational component for practical development (e.g., for building multimodal structure and sequence language models, like ESM3).\n2. The paper demonstrates GeoBPE's high data efficiency, with appendix results showing that using only 1% of the training data will not introduce performance loss. While this is an advantage, it could also be interpreted as a potential risk. This finding might suggest that the model has a low capacity and hits a performance ceiling almost immediately, making it incapable of capturing the complex, subtle, and diverse structural patterns that can only be learned from large-scale datasets. \n\nGiven these points, I hope the authors will provide a detailed discussion about these concerns."}, "questions": {"value": "See above weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "j4fkTkGR2d", "forum": "55e5f3GVFc", "replyto": "55e5f3GVFc", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19170/Reviewer_MhKe"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19170/Reviewer_MhKe"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19170/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762380741972, "cdate": 1762380741972, "tmdate": 1762931174761, "mdate": 1762931174761, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
