This challenge is amplified by uncertainties that current methods fail to address holistically, as traditional single-objective approaches yield imbalanced solutions and lack a quantitative framework for navigating these trade-offs.\n\nWe propose a two-stage stochastic Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) that uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to generate scenarios, which are then clustered by K-means into a tractable set. The first stage determines grid topology, while the second adapts power dispatch to scenarios. Its objective function balances expected energy restoration (efficiency), a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) metric for robustness, and the Gini Coefficient for fairness.\n\nAblation studies on the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate our model can boost the N-1 reserve ratio by 22\\% for resilience with a modest 7\\% energy trade-off, or reduce the Gini Coefficient by 32\\% for fairness while maintaining high energy output.

Second, renewable sources such as solar and wind introduce uncertainty into the power grid that must be considered when designing a restoration plan: specifically, “worst-case” scenarios where e.g., renewable energy suddenly becomes unavailable are important to consider.  To approach this, the authors propose to use a CVaR (conditional value at risk) metric to quantify robustness against these worst-cases, a Gini Coefficient to capture equity, and a generative model + K-means to generate “worst-case” scenarios that are tractable for considering as part of a MILP pipeline."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The usage of CVaR to capture the tail risk induced by renewables is a nice inclusion that speaks to the realistic challenges posed by renewables.\n\n Modeling of the underlying constraints and physics is correct and aligns well with practical considerations for grid restoration.\n\nSubject to some questions I have that relate to the presentation of the experimental results, the proposed framework appears to be effective on the standard IEEE 30-bus test case used in the experiments."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "ICLR papers typically have a strong machine learning component, and my sense is that this paper might be slightly out of scope for ICLR — I have some questions about the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which constitutes the main “predictive” component of the paper (see below).  Beyond ICLR, I think the paper would be received well at conferences like ACM e-Energy, ACM BuildSys, IEEE PES, or a journal like IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid.\n\nFigures throughout are a little hard to read — the text size is small and contrast is poor in some places (e.g., cylinder D, Figure 1).\n\nThe presentation of the experiments could be improved — four approaches are presented (“Baseline”, “Constrained Baseline”, “Game Theory”, and “Stochastic CVaR”), with the latter presumably being the main contribution of the paper, but I cannot find the concrete description of each model and how they differ beyond the phrase “ablation study” on line 393."}, "questions": {"value": "Line 210 states “we employ a non-linear, Pareto-based weighting scheme that penalizes significant drops in any single KPI”, but the definition of “Broad Gini” on line 215 seems to be a linear weighted sum of the different KPIs — could you elaborate on this point?  I am likely missing something.\n\nOn line 218, it looks like the heading “1. Min N-1 Ratio” should start on the next line.\n\nAbout the Gini coefficient — if one load is particularly large (e.g., an industrial electricity consumer), does that necessarily make the Gini coefficient “more inequitable” when the grid is fully restored?  When the grid is partially restored, I am convinced that the Gini coefficient is the right thing to do since it encourages us to balance across loads (e.g., all loads get some base level of power), so this question is more to check my understanding.  It may be reasonable to compute the “fairness” of restoration with respect to some arbitrary partitioning (e.g., Neighborhood A, Neighborhood B, Industrial Customers) — is that a straightforward change under your model?\n\nFigure 2: Scenario 2 generated by the HMM seems to suggest a solar PV output of >= 60% for nearly 24 straight hours, which is not possible on Earth.  Am I misinterpreting the graph, or is this a limitation of the HMM forecast (not capturing physical laws)?  Since the “worst-case” scenario probably corresponds to scenario 1 (no solar generation), I imagine this wouldn’t change the downstream optimization, but it raises questions about the quality of scenarios generated by the HMM.  Table 1 shows that the basic statistics match up, but I think these statistics won’t capture some structural properties that might be hard to enforce in a predictive model (e.g., it’s never sunny at midnight).\n\nLine 310: I think this is an incomplete sentence: “The generated scenarios reveal tail risk.

The paper presents a standard two stage MILP stochastic problem where multiple objectives are modeled as a linear combination of terms.  The problem is then solved using a standard MILP solver.  So, there is not an algorithmic contribution.  The only potential contribution is then in the model itself, which is limited to the metrics used to evaluate the solution (unmet demand, risk, fairness, etc.).  However, there is a large body of work exploring variation of these metrics (and combinations) – a simple search of power system restoration, multi-objective, etc., reveals many papers tackling this problems).  For this to be a contribution, the paper needs to be able to assert that these metrics have never been used and the combination of these metrics yields new insights and solutions that could not be gleaned from the prior work.  There is also a claim that the HMM for producing load forecasts is a contribution.  There is an extremely wide body of work on load forecasting/load scenario generation in the power engineering literature, and it is not clear how the paper’s HMM is a contribution in the context of this literature. \n2.\tPaper mixes modeling elements from distribution and transmission network modeling.  In particular, why is there are a radiality requirement (equation 7 and 8)?  This is only a requirement for distribution system modeling, whereas the rest of the model description focuses on transmission modeling (uses transmission IEEE benchmarks, models a single phase balanced system, etc.).\n3.\tThe paper presents two distinct objective functions (linear combination of equations 16-19 and equation 23). Why are two presented?  Which one is used? Maybe one is a first stage objective and the other the second stage objective?\n4.\tWhat are the two stages?  The first stage appears to be a whole sequence of topologies and unit commitments (first paragraph of section 3).  Why can’t the sequence of topologies and unit commitments vary between load scenarios?  These actions, esp. unit commitment, don’t need to be fixed for a given load scenario. This can change depending on conditions, especially during emergency situations. Regardless, the formulation does not formerly describe the problem as a first and second stage stochastic program so it is very difficult to understand the problem.\n5.\tWhat is restoration?  The paper does not describe what the restoration is.  Typically restoration is about determining the sequence of lines to re-energize, but that is not at all clear.\n6.\tA description of the data is not provided, with most data being described as caseXX.  Most readers will not know what caseXX refers to.\n7.\tRuntimes and scalability of the model are not provided.\n8.\tGame theory is stated as a crucial component of the hybrid architecture.

However, I’m still concerned about whether the generated scenarios are representative enough for restoration planning, especially in the tails that drive CVaR and resilience. Could you share any tool-level benchmarking beyond Table 1 (e.g., code, seeds, datasets, out-of-sample tests)? Also, why did the authors not consider making using of off-the-shelf baselines like the widely used ChroniX2Grid and show that key findings (e.g., Broad-Gini trade-offs) persist when swapping in these off-the-shelf generators? ChroniX2Grid is open-source and benchmarked and used in many downstream applications like Grid2Op. In any case, please consider either adopting or rigorously benchmarking against community-validated generators such as ChroniX2Grid (often paired with Grid2Op). \n\nClosed-loop impact: The MILP experiments do expose static trade-offs on IEEE cases but they are static, that is they stop short of demonstrating benefits in sequential, closed-loop operations where contingencies unfold over time. A more impactful evaluation would be to embed your “Broad Gini” objective into a Grid2Op environment as a reward function and test whether optimizing it via RL improves survival time and operational robustness while maintaining fairness/efficiency across standard Grid2Op test cases. Such an analysis will be much more impactful and beneficial. Tools like Grid2Op are already readily available, so this such an analysis should be easy.\n\nRelated works on trade-off quantification: While your study frames a broader trilemma (efficiency–resilience–equity), there is adjacent literature that explicitly quantifies cost–survival-time trade-offs in grid operations.
