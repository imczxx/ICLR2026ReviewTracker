Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model can focus on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that the model can naturally support selective decoding and reduce the number of decoding operations by ~2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to dense non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the embedding-space formulation naturally supports open-vocabulary classification and retrieval without any architecture modification.

Moving VL learning from the discrete token space to a continuous semantic space is a well-motivated and promising direction to address the known efficiency and latency bottlenecks of standard generative VLMs.\n\n2.The \"selective decoding\" mechanism (Sec 4.3) is a standout contribution. The idea of monitoring the latent embedding stream for semantic variance and only triggering the expensive text decoder when a significant shift is detected is an elegant and practical solution for real-world, low-latency video streaming applications. \n\n3.The model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across a wide and diverse range of video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of the learned representations for both zero-shot and finetuned tasks."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. While the paper emphasizes that the shift from token-space to embedding-space simplifies the target distribution, it provides no rigorous analysis of the measurability and discriminability of the resulting semantic embedding space.\n\nTo substantiate this claim, the authors should provide supplementary analysis, such as:\n\n(i) Visualization or quantitative studies on the embedding space's structure (e.g., its clustering properties, separability) to demonstrate this claimed simplification.\n\n(ii) A theoretical elucidation of the target distribution's compressibility, perhaps through the lens of the Information Bottleneck principle.\n\n(iii) A crucial ablation study comparing the performance impact of using different embedding spaces (e.g., from CLIP, SONAR, BERT-base) as the prediction target.\n\n2. L2 loss implicitly assumes a unimodal, deterministic target distribution.Real-world VL tasks are full of \"one-to-many\" ambiguities (e.g., \"the light went out\" vs. \"the room became dark\"). Both are valid but semantically distinct answers. The L2 loss will penalize the model for predicting either correct answer, forcing the predictor to regress towards a non-existent \"average\" embedding located somewhere between the two valid target points. This regression to the mean will likely result in semantically \"blurry,\" generic, or even nonsensical decoded outputs. The paper completely fails to address this fundamental limitation.\n\n3. Unfair and Misleading Efficiency Comparison: The core comparison in §4.2, which pits a 0.5B VL-JEPA predictor against a 1B VLM baseline, is fundamentally biased. The authors claim superior parameter efficiency, but their 0.5B predictor is not a neutral model; it is \"cherry-picked\" from the top-most, most semantically potent layers (L8-16) of the 1B Llama model. The paper's own ablation study (Table 5) confirms this bias, showing that these top layers (45.20% accuracy) are vastly superior to the bottom layers (35.86%). This is not an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison and does not prove the framework's efficiency, but rather the known fact that top-level LLM layers handle more complex semantics.\n\n4. Lack of Statistical Rigor: The paper suffers from a critical lack of statistical validation. All reported results—including all SOTA claims in the tables and the key efficiency curves in Figures 3 and 4—appear to be point estimates from a single training run. No error bars, standard deviations, or significance tests are provided. This makes it impossible to determine if the reported gains are statistically significant or merely the artifact of a single, fortunate random seed, which undermines the scientific validity of all conclusions.\n\n5. Missing Ablation on the Critical Y-Encoder Component: The entire methodology is critically dependent on the properties of the frozen y-encoder (SONAR). The paper fails to provide the most crucial ablation study: testing the VL-JEPA framework with different frozen text encoders (e.g., CLIP's text encoder, or a standard Sentence-BERT). Without this, the paper's claims are not generalizable. It is impossible to know if the authors have discovered a robust, general-purpose framework or simply a special-case solution that is uniquely and luckily compatible with the SONAR embedding space."}, "questions": {"value": "1.How does the L2 loss framework handle inherently multi-modal or ambiguous targets where multiple, semantically distinct ground truths exist?

What is the performance impact of replacing the SONAR encoder with a standard CLIP or Sentence-BERT encoder?\n\n4.Can you clarify the 2.85x saving calculation (is it 1Hz / 0.35Hz)? More critically, can you provide any statistical validation (e.g., mean and std. dev. over 3+ runs) for your key SOTA claims, or at least for the comparison in Fig 4?\n\n5.Loss Function: Why was L2 loss chosen over Cosine Similarity loss? Cosine loss would ignore magnitude and only focus on direction, which might be a more robust objective.
