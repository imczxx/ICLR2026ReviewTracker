Existing privacy protection practices assume earlier training data is less sensitive and thus focus on the latest arriving samples. We challenge this assumption by tracking per-sample membership-inference risk across sequential fine-tuning rounds of popular transformer-based models, ViT for image data, and BERT for text data. Our experiments reveal the \\emph{Privacy Déjà Vu Effect}: new data can \\emph{remind} the model of semantically similar legacy samples, possibly elevating their privacy risk significantly. We further demonstrate that this resurgence is closely correlated with the latent-feature-space similarity between old and new examples. These findings underscore the need for a more comprehensive privacy protection mechanism in continual fine-tuning.

The authors ultimately conclude that the privacy déjà vu effect is a “local phenomenon”, driven by a few highly similar samples, but this interpretation offers little predictive or practical value.

Only two rounds of fine-tuning are tested, and the dynamics over multiple rounds remain unknown. The datasets (Tiny-ImageNet and IMDb) seem small. Using more datasets and conducting additional rounds could make the conclusions more convincing. Moreover, the study only uses the ViT and BERT models to observe the phenomenon in basic tasks such as image classification and text sentiment analysis.\n\n2. The measurement of similarity between features is overly simplistic. The authors only consider SSIM and NTK similarity; however, several more recent works [A, B] provide more detailed measurements of feature similarity. Some discussion of these alternative similarity metrics would be interesting.\n\n[A] Insights on representational similarity in neural networks with canonical correlation. Morcos et al., NeurIPS, 2018.\n[B] Similarity of Neural Network Representations Revisited. Kornblith et al., ICML, 2019.\n\n3. It would be more insightful if the experiments were designed to test the similarity of representations across different layers. Intuitively, as depth increases, the representations (or features for image data) may become more similar across different datasets. An extreme case is the last layer in image classification problems, where the representations of different data points collapse to the same point—known as neural collapse [C]—which has also been observed in private fine-tuning of ViT [D]. Related to this work, when neural collapse occurs, the last-layer representations of new and old data may become very close, or even identical, as they collapse to the same feature vector. Thus, if the conclusion of this paper is correct, one may be able to identify old data points more easily based on the new data based only on the last-layer features (please correct me if I am misunderstanding). This could be an interesting direction for future studies. For the current version, some discussion on the similarity between features of specific layers (such as the last layer) and its potential relationship to MIA would be valuable.\n\n[C] Prevalence of neural collapse during the terminal phase of deep learning training.

During fine-tuning, the paper uses a very low learning rate ($3 × 10^{-6}$). Intuitively, a low learning rate causes the model parameters to change slowly, thereby preserving information from the old datasets. I suspect that a larger learning rate might lead to less leakage of old data. It would be helpful if the authors provided experiments or at least some discussion on how hyperparameters such as the learning rate affect the conclusions of MIA.\n\n5. Several related works are missing. First, the original paper on differential privacy [E] is omitted. In addition, an important paper on MIA [F] is missing. Furthermore, the TPR/FPR ratio perspective on DP originates from Kairouz et al. (2015). The authors mention that it is related to DP; however, this relationship is formalized through the concept of $f$-DP, which measures privacy levels using the flipped ROC curve, as proposed by [G].\n\n\n[E] Differential Privacy.
