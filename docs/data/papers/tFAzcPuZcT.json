The main architectural changes include *early downsampling* and *halving internal channels*. These are standard engineering practices for model compression and efficiency, not **novel architectural designs or new methods for learning representations**.\n2. **Lack of comparison on GAN-based models**: The paper's experimental validation lacks a crucial component in its discussion of *GAN-based generative models for precipitation*. In the related work section (Section 2), the authors correctly identify the importance of deep generative models, citing high-impact work such as DGMR (Ravuri et al., 2021) and NowcastNet (Zhang et al., 2023). These models, both published in *Nature* and recognized for their strong performance, are a key pillar of the state of the art in this field.\nDespite acknowledging this work, the main experimental comparison in Table 1 completely **omits comparisons against these (or any other) GAN-based generative methods**. This is a significant gap in the evaluation. Without benchmarking against this entire class of SOTA models, it is impossible for the reader to assess the paper's true performance, and the claim to \"surpass... deep-learning nowcasting models\"  remains unsubstantiated.\n3. **Contradiction Between Quantitative Metrics and Qualitative Results**: A significant weakness undermines the paper's experimental conclusions: the quantitative metrics and the qualitative case studies appear to contradict each other directly.\n- Quantitative Metrics: The paper's aggregated metrics, specifically the Frequency Bias Index (FBI) in Table 7 and Figure 8, suggest a key advantage for RainPro-8 in forecasting heavy precipitation. At the 10.0 mm/h threshold, RainPro-8 reports an FBI of 1.636, which is notably lower (i.e., less over-forecasting) than the 1.821 reported for MetNet-3*. **This metric suggests the author's model is more balanced**.\n- Case Study Results: The paper's own qualitative visualizations repeatedly show the opposite. In the case study for the +8h forecast in Figure 19, the Ground Truth shows only a small area of precipitation at the >10.0 mm/h (yellow) level. However, **RainPro-8 predicts a large, distinct area of heavy rain, while the MetNet-3 forecast for the same event shows a substantially smaller overforecasted area**. This same pattern, where RainPro-8 visually over-forecasts heavy rain more severely than MetNet-3, is apparent in the other examples provided (Figure 17).\nThis fundamental discrepancy, in which all qualitative examples in the paper contradict the aggregate metrics for heavy rain, is neither acknowledged nor explained. This casts serious doubt on the reliability of the reported results and the validity of the paper's evaluation."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "mzrSMRSbLh", "forum": "tFAzcPuZcT", "replyto": "tFAzcPuZcT", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17561/Reviewer_AAd8"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17561/Reviewer_AAd8"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17561/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761990778566, "cdate": 1761990778566, "tmdate": 1762927424531, "mdate": 1762927424531, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
