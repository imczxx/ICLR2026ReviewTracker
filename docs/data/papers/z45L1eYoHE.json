While existing models have achieved strong performance under the fixed-node assumption, they rely on node-dependent parameters and fail to adapt when the network evolves, i.e., when old nodes are removed and new nodes with limited history are added. This expanding-node forecasting scenario introduces two critical challenges: (1) learning heterogeneous node representations without coupling learnable parameters to node count, and (2) enabling effective adaptation to new nodes with scarce observations. To tackle these challenges, we propose SNIP (Structured Node Interaction Prompting), a model-agnostic framework that constructs static spatial-temporal priors from historical observations and topology, and dynamically refines them during model training. Specifically, SNIP generates structured priors from three perspectives: periodic patterns across nodes, spatial-temporal interactions under time delays and graph structural information. These priors are projected into model as node promptings and then dynamically refined. For new nodes, SNIP initializes priors by similarity-weighted mixtures of old nodes and updates them with limited history, enabling efficient few-shot adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that SNIP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in expanding-node scenarios. Beyond accuracy, SNIP provides plug-and-play generality and computational efficiency, bridging the gap between fixed-node precision and expanding-node adaptability in spatial-temporal forecasting.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Spatial-temporal Series", "Expanding-Node Forecasting", "Node Prompting"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1364ccf96c56e9ff6ecfebdc36fd31c09889e9da.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/59896e357cbf8c39e9b103faf5a736b3bf58f634.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the problem of spatial-temporal forecasting with expanding nodes in a flexible and efficient manner.

The idea of treating these priors as non-learnable node identity prompts and then refining them online is a novel take on node-specific conditioning without parameter-node coupling.\n\n- Introduces a similarity-weighted initialization procedure for new nodes, which transfers priors from existing nodes in proportion to cross-correlation strength and dominant delay, and argues that this enables few-shot adaptation for nodes with almost no history.\n\n- The experimental protocol is fairly thorough, with four datasets across traffic and energy domains, explicit base/expansion/test stages, and explicit partitioning of nodes into remain, deleted, and new.  The baselines span models without node-specific prompting (DLinear, iTransformer, DUETformer), STGNN / Transformer backbones with their node embeddings removed (GWNET, STID, STAEformer, etc.), continual learning / expanding-graph or prompt-tuning style methods (STKEC, EAC), and STEV, which is explicitly designed for expansion-like scenarios (Expanding-Variate TS Forecasting).
