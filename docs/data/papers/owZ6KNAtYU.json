However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called Graph Homophily Booster (GRAPHITE) to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs. Furthermore, our proposed graph transformation alone can already enhance the performance of homophilic GNNs on heterophilic graphs, even though they were not originally designed for heterophilic graphs.

Many prior works have explored similar strategies for improving graph neural network (GNN) performance, such as feature augmentation or graph transformation methods. The core idea lacks significant innovation, which might reduce its contribution to the broader research community.\n\n2)\tScalability Concerns: Although the paper claims that the proposed method is computationally efficient, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how GRAPHITE performs on very large-scale graphs.

More empirical evaluation on large graphs or an analysis of the method’s time complexity would be valuable.\n\n3)\tNarrow Focus on Discrete Features: The proposed method mainly focuses on graphs with discrete node features. However, many real-world applications (e.g., social networks, biological networks) involve continuous features.
