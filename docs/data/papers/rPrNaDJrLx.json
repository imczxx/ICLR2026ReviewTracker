Existing approaches either simplify policy learning by assuming independence across sub-actions, which often yields incoherent or invalid actions when coordination is required, or attempt to learn action structure and control jointly, which is slow and unstable. We introduce Structured Policy Initialization (SPIN), a two-stage framework that first pre-trains an Action Structure Model (ASM) to capture the manifold of valid actions, then freezes this representation and trains lightweight policy heads for control. On challenging DM Control benchmarks, SPIN improves average return by up to $39\\%$ over the state of the art while reducing time to convergence by up to $12.8\\times$.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "offline reinforcement learning", "batch reinforcement learning", "deep reinforcement learning", "combinatorial action spaces", "structured action spaces", "discrete action spaces", "representation learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5480a5956423a7f8507fa82d4c769d392eea7ea6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Problem: \n\nThe paper tackles offline reinforcement learning in large, discrete combinatorial action spaces, settings where the agent must select from exponentially many joint actions (composed of multiple sub-actions) and ensure these selected sub-actions form coherent combinations.

When you have noisy or high dimensional data, e.g. noisy sensors, high dim images, representation learning is the first thing we try to improve the signal to noise ratio of our data. So doing this for actions, using a standard masked reconstruction objective, seems very obvious, and not too \"novel\".
