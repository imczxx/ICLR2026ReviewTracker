Existing approaches either simplify policy learning by assuming independence across sub-actions, which often yields incoherent or invalid actions when coordination is required, or attempt to learn action structure and control jointly, which is slow and unstable. We introduce Structured Policy Initialization (SPIN), a two-stage framework that first pre-trains an Action Structure Model (ASM) to capture the manifold of valid actions, then freezes this representation and trains lightweight policy heads for control. On challenging DM Control benchmarks, SPIN improves average return by up to $39\\%$ over the state of the art while reducing time to convergence by up to $12.8\\times$.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "offline reinforcement learning", "batch reinforcement learning", "deep reinforcement learning", "combinatorial action spaces", "structured action spaces", "discrete action spaces", "representation learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/486bde15fbfdc51dadc3b4b46cec9463ab7647a8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Problem: \n\nThe paper tackles offline reinforcement learning in large, discrete combinatorial action spaces, settings where the agent must select from exponentially many joint actions (composed of multiple sub-actions) and ensure these selected sub-actions form coherent combinations.

When you have noisy or high dimensional data, e.g. noisy sensors, high dim images, representation learning is the first thing we try to improve the signal to noise ratio of our data.

We are encouraged that they recognized the merits of our work. Reviewers highlighted the strength of our method, describing it as **\"principled and empirically validated\"** [UAbS], **\"very intuitive\"** [Mkwm], and a **\"promising and elegant approach\"** [UAbS]. They emphasized that the separation of structure learning and control is **\"well motivated\"** [rC8Q], **effectively overcomes the slowness and instability of joint learning** [UAbS], and that it **addresses the computational cost issues** present in prior methods [98NV]. Reviewers also praised the clarity of the paper, calling it **\"well written and easy to understand\"** [Mkwm] and **\"clearly written and well motivated\"** [rC8Q], and found the experimental section to contain **\"interesting analysis\"** [Mkwm] with results that demonstrate **\"clear benefits in both performance and efficiency\"** [rC8Q].\n\nReviewers raised several important points, which we address comprehensively in our point-by-point responses. In this general remark, we summarize the two new experiments, new analysis, and clarifications included in the revised manuscript.\n\nBased on the reviewers' feedback, we conducted **two new sets of experiments** and performed **additional analysis** to:\n\n* **Isolate the contribution of the learned representation and show that SPIN's benefits are not tied to the SAINT architecture** by distilling the ASM into a lightweight, attention-free MLP policy head.\n* **Empirically justify our choice of a masked modeling pre-training objective** by comparing it against strong alternatives from both the generative and discriminative paradigms.\n* **Quantify the computational cost of SPIN’s two stages**, demonstrating that the ASM pre-training phase introduces only minimal overhead while substantially reducing the duration of the far more expensive RL stage.\n\nThese additional experiments and analyses further strengthen our confidence in SPIN's effectiveness.\n\nWe address the key themes raised by the reviewers through the following revisions and clarifications in the updated manuscript:\n\n* We clarify that our core novelty lies in the two-stage separation of structure learning and control, which isolates the hardest component of combinatorial decision-making — the discovery of the action manifold — and thereby renders the subsequent policy optimization stage simple and efficient [Mkwm, 98NV, rC8Q].\n* We clarify the principled nature of our experimental design, justifying our choice of benchmark and the fairness of our baseline comparisons [Mkwm, rC8Q].\n* We provide new results that address concerns about architectural rigidity and the choice of pre-training objective, confirming that SPIN is a robust and flexible framework for simplifying complex control problems [98NV, UAbS, Mkwm].\n\n### Notes to reviewers:\n\nPlease note that we use W# to address weaknesses and Q# to address questions in our individual responses. All line numbers refer to the updated version of the manuscript uploaded with the rebuttal.\n\nWe sincerely thank the reviewers again for their insightful comments, which have helped us sharpen the presentation and strengthen the contributions of the paper.
