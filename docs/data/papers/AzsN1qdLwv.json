However, existing methods suffer from suboptimal compression performance due to inefficient data representation of meshes. To address this issue, we propose a novel neural mesh compression method based on Sparse Implicit Representation (SIR). Specifically, SIR only records values of the signed distance field on regular grids near the surface, enabling high-resolution structured representation of arbitrary geometric data with much less memory cost while supporting precise surface recovery. Subsequently, a lightweight Sparse Neural Compression (SNC) network is constructed to extract compact embedded features from the SIR and encode them into a bitstream. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art mesh and point cloud compression approaches in both compression performance and computational efficiency across diverse mesh models.

Furthermore, their cross-domain generalization testing provides convincing evidence that the method generalizes beyond its training distribution.\n\nClarity: The paper effectively communicated why sparse representation addresses inefficiencies in dense approaches. The primary contributions and insights are easy to understand and follow.\n\nSignificance: Substantial compression gains (30-90% bitrate reduction over state-of-the-art) across multiple datasets represents genuine practical value. The ability to handle non-watertight surfaces and performance gain could warrant additional development to transition this into a viable alternative for existing methods."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The absence of systematic ablation studies represents a critical methodological gap. The paper makes numerous design choices e.g., sparsity threshold, channel network width, etc., described as \"empirically set\" or \"default\" without justification. We cannot determine which components drive performance or whether results are robust across hyperparameter variations. At minimum, the authors should ablate the sparsity threshold, which dictates the rate-distortion tradeoff, network architecture choices, and loss component contributions. Without these studies, the work reads as \"we tried something and it worked\" rather than \"we understand why our design succeeds.\"\n\nTable 2 mixes heterogeneous implementations of the work (Python/GPU) and compares it against optimized C++/CPU implementations, making it hard to truly discern if the  observed speed differences originated from algorithmic insight or implementation choices.\n\nThe non-watertight surface handling lacks sufficient justification. The paper claims the method \"robustly represents\" non-watertight meshes based solely on showing it works in practice, without explaining why it should work reliably. While the intuition makes sense, missing the explanations of when and why the approach succeeds or fails, measurements of whether geometric properties are preserved correctly, and comparisons with methods specifically built for handling non-watertight surfaces weakens the paper. A deeper analysis showing when it works, when it doesn't, and how well it preserves geometric structure is valuable here."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

It is not clear what aspects of the proposed approach are truly original. More on this in the next point.\n- Insufficient comparison with Tang et al.: The method seems to be heavily inspired by that of Tang et al (cited in the paper). As such, it is not clear what aspects of the paper are novel and what are borrowed from existing works. For example, Tang et al, also uses a sparse representation, using an occupancy map (which is losslessly coded and transmitted) to encode the occupied voxels. These occupied voxels are also found using marching cubes algorithm (like the current paper). This allows Tang et al. to avoid coding and transmitting voxels that don’t carry useful information (Fig 3 in Tang et al.). This fact is not mentioned in the paper and/or attributed to Tang et al, though the figures of Sparse SDF in the paper (e.g. Figure 4, first and last diagram) are reminiscent of Figure 3 in Tang et al. Similarly, Tang et al, uses a small autoencoder to encode/decode features of only the occupied blocks of voxels. Again, this is not acknowledged/mentioned in the paper. Further, Tang et al, also uses a rate-distortion loss (eq 1 in Tang et al) to train a compressed representation (similar to eq. 3 in current paper).\n\nOverall, I find it quite concerning that sufficient credit/comparison is to made with the prior art of Tang et al, despite the obvious similarities in the proposed method.
