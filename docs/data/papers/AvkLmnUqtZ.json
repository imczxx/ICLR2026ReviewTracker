Recent advancements have redefined this problem as a continuous optimization task by incorporating differentiable acyclicity constraints. These methods commonly rely on algebraic characterizations of DAGs, such as matrix exponentials, to enable the use of gradient-based optimization techniques. Despite these innovations, existing methods often face optimization difficulties due to the highly non-convex nature of DAG constraints and the per-iteration computational complexity. In this work, we present a novel framework for learning DAGs, employing a Stochastic Approximation approach integrated with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)-based optimization techniques. Our framework introduces new projection methods tailored to efficiently enforce DAG constraints, ensuring that the algorithm converges to a feasible local minimum. With its low iteration complexity, the proposed method is well-suited for handling large-scale problems with improved computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our framework through comprehensive experimental evaluations, which confirm its superior performance across various settings.", "tldr": "We propose a scalable framework for learning DAGs using Stochastic Approximation with SGD and efficient projection methods, offering improved performance and computational efficiency for large-scale problems.", "keywords": ["Structure learning", "Continuous Optimization", "Directed Acyclic Graphs"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1eff0a5531a8af74944e56bf24954f7c63973891.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes ψDAG, a framework for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure learning based on Stochastic Approximation (SA) principles combined with projected stochastic gradient methods.

For the second idea, the proposed projection mechanism is purely heuristic and lacks both theoretical justification and novelty relative to prior constrained optimization methods. Moreover, the paper overlooks several related approaches, such as BOSS, which first determines a variable ordering and then performs score-based structure learning with a BIC score and greedy search, as well as various hybrid methods that use constraint-based algorithms to obtain an initial DAG or skeleton for subsequent optimization.

This approach reduces the search space from all possible DAGs, an exponentially large space, to the space of topological orderings, enabling a more efficient algorithm suited for large-scale problems.

The proposed approach decomposes the problem into largely independent subproblems: optimization → projection onto the constraint-satisfying solution space → (weakly-)constrained optimization, forming a three-stage framework.\n- In the final step (step 3) of this three-stage process, optimization must be performed while preserving the topological order of vertices determined in step 2. To handle this, the paper introduces a valid method based on computing the transitive closures and applying masking to enforce the order constraints within optimization.\n\n- Previous methods that needed to handle strict constraints over an exponentially large DAG search space, but the proposed method with Algorithm 3 used in step 2 can now reduce the problem to enforcing strict constraints over node orderings in step 3. This effectively narrow down the search from the exponentially combinatorial space of DAGs to the permutation space of node orderings, which is smaller, and leads to a more efficient and logically grounded solution in the proposed method.\n\n- Experimental results demonstrate empirical superiority in both accuracy and computational efficiency compared to representative existing methods, including NOTEARS (Zheng et al., NeurIPS 2018), GOLEM (Ng et al., NeurIPS 2020), and NOCURL (Yu et al., ICML 2021).\n- Each of the points is thoroughly explained in the appendix, which is more than great."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Since the idea of using stochastic gradient descent and the idea of using projection methods seem largely independent, an ablation study analyzing the contribution of each would make the work more informative. For example, in non-convex hard-constraint optimization problems like those with L0-norm penalties, projected gradient methods are a traditional approach. However, it’s well known that even simple gradient descent combined with projection often faces challenges in terms of convergence guarantees and optimality. These issues typically require additional techniques or relaxations, and simply replacing the gradient method with a stochastic version likely doesn’t resolve them on its own. \n\n- The SI provides detailed explanations, but a clearer discussion in the main text about how existing methods handle hard DAG constraints and how the proposed method takes a different approach would help readers better understand the contributions of this work. \n\n- The rationale for using stochastic gradient methods from the perspective of Stochastic Approximation (SA) vs. Sample Average Approximation (SAA) is valid as described, but a bit misleading. In practice, the difference between the sample average and the expectation is often handled with some form of regularization in SAA. So, while adopting SA may offer benefits in terms of computational efficiency or convergence stability, the current explanation suggesting it directly improves approximation accuracy may be a bit confusing. That said, recent work has shown that stochastic gradient methods can offer implicit regularization in complex optimization landscapes, so this could be useful to clarify the benefit with a more careful explanation.\n\n- It seems the formulation reuses a standard setup, but since the objective function implicitly becomes quadratic, it would be helpful to include a brief explanation. When the noise term ( N ) is Gaussian, a quadratic objective is appropriate. However, for cases like exponential or Gumbel noise, as tested in the experiments, it’s not immediately clear whether the quadratic objective is still valid. One possible reason for the proposed method’s stability might be that, while the DAG constraint is complex, the error term’s quadratic form provides favorable properties, and this could be indirectly contributing to its effectiveness."}, "questions": {"value": "I'm not a researcher in this specific area, so I'd like to ask a few clarification questions:\n\n- From a general optimization design perspective, is the main takeaway that, in the case of DAG constraints, methods that explicitly account for graph structure are more effective, meaning that standard approaches like Projected Gradient Methods or Proximal Gradient Methods with convex relaxations are not sufficient?\n\n- On p.15 of the appendix, are the objective functions in the existing methods optimized using techniques other than stochastic gradient methods? Since the objective function and the optimization strategy are conceptually separate, it seems that one could, in principle, apply stochastic gradient methods to equations (11), (12), and (13) by handling constraints via Lagrangian multipliers and using proximal methods for the L1 terms. Was this tested? Or is there some technical barrier that makes introducing stochastic gradient methods into this problem particularly challenging? A clearer explanation of this point would be appreciated.\n\n- Both the existing formulations and the proposed method use a quadratic loss term, but is there no assumption of Gaussian noise? As shown on p.7, the noise ( N ) is tested not only with Gaussian noise, but also with Exponential and Gumbel noise. In those cases, wouldn’t a linear loss be more appropriate for Exponential noise, and a logistic loss for Gumbel noise? Wouldn't this part affect the entire paper?\n\n- In lines 290–293 on page 6, it says, “if we know the true topological ordering ord(G∗), then we can recover the true DAG W∗ with high accuracy.” However, in practice, we don’t actually know the true topological ordering, and we can't guarantee that the node ordering obtained in Step 2 is the true one. So, should we understand this not as a theoretical guarantee of finding the exact solution, but rather as a claim that the search space has been reduced from the combinatorial DAG space to the permutation space of node orderings?\n\n- Since the true topological ordering generally can't be identified, that means even when using the proposed method, if the ordering obtained in Step 2 isn't the true one, the solution won't converge to the correct one, as we can see in Figure 2, right? I’d appreciate it if you could provide some clarification, as the takeaway in Section 4.1 wasn’t entirely clear to me."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "yCGoj40cpE", "forum": "AvkLmnUqtZ", "replyto": "AvkLmnUqtZ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2052/Reviewer_Hg8k"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2052/Reviewer_Hg8k"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2052/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761981113548, "cdate": 1761981113548, "tmdate": 1762916005988, "mdate": 1762916005988, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
