To achieve a better alignment with the given condition, guidance-based methods are proposed and become a standard component of diffusion models. Though the guidance-based methods are widely used, the theoretical guarantee mainly focuses on the variance-preserving (VP)-based models and lacks current state-of-the-art (SOTA) variance-exploding (VE) models for conditional generation. In this work, for the first time, we elucidate the influence of guidance for VE models and explain why VE-based models perform better than VP models in the context of Gaussian mixture models from classification confidence and diversity perspectives. For the classification confidence, we prove the convergence rate for the confidence w.r.t. the strength of guidance $\\eta$ for VE models is  $1-\\eta^{-1}(\\log \\eta)^2$, which is faster than $1-\\eta^{-e^{-T}}(\\log \\eta)^{2 e^{-T}}$ result for VP models ($T$ is the diffusion time). This result indicates that the VE models have a stronger ability to align with the given condition, which is important for the conditional generation. For the diversity, previous works show that when facing strong guidance, VP models tend to generate extreme samples and suffer from the modal collapse phenomenon. However, for VE models, we show that since their forward process maintains the multi-modal property of data, they have a better ability to avoid the modal collapse facing strong guidance. \nThe simulation and real-world experiments also support our theoretical results.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diffusion Models", "Guidance-based Method", "Convergence Analysis"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0841c9edad54df3a068537c74eea56bca755d0a1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This article studies how classifier guidance affects classification confidence and mode collapse in Variance-Exploding (VE) and Variance-Preserving (VP) SDEs.

Despite producing the desired results, the evidence remains insufficiently strong. I believe that it would be beneficial if more experiments were included, such as the CIFAR dataset. \n2. The assumption of identity variance may be overly restrictive. Even if the marginal distributions are the same, differences across conditional distributions may manifest not only in their means but also in substantial variations in their variances. It would be valuable to examine whether the authors' analysis remains valid under scenarios where the variances of the conditional distributions differ significantly. Similarly, this concern warrants experimental validation. The authors could consider conducting experiments on datasets where conditional distributions exhibit considerable divergence in variance.\n3. In Section 5, the authors present a qualitative analysis of the diversity. Though logically coherent, it would be beneficial if authors incorporate quantitative metrics related to diversity—such as the Inception Score—into their experiments. By doing so, the theoretical conclusions derived from the analysis could be further supported from an empirical perspective.\n4.
