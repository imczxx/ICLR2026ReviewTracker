One successful approach to these goals has been to exploit the geometric constraints imposed by the language model architecture and parameters. In this work, we show that a lesser-known geometric constraint—namely that language model outputs lie on the surface of a high-dimensional ellipse—functions as a signature for the model, which be used to identify which model an output came from. This ellipse signature has unique properties that distinguish it from existing model-output association methods like language model watermarks. In particular, the signature is hard to forge: without direct access to model parameters, it is practically infeasible to produce logprobs on the ellipse. Secondly, the signature is naturally occurring, since all language models have these elliptical constraints. Thirdly, the signature is self-contained, in that it is detectable without access to the model input or full weights. Finally, the signature is exceptionally redundant, as it is independently detectable in every single logprob output from the model. We evaluate a novel technique for extracting the ellipse on small models, and discuss the practical hurdles that make it infeasible for production-size models, making the signature hard to forge. Finally, we use ellipse signatures to propose a protocol for language model output verification, which is analogous to cryptographic symmetric-key message authentication systems.", "tldr": "We show that all language models impose elliptical constraints on their outputs, which can be used as a hard-to-fake signature to identify a model from its outputs.", "keywords": ["fingerprint", "watermark", "language model", "signature", "accountability", "cryptography", "forgery", "security"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2f09ed39319c16836f70a5d8606078686771f3a8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c445ce95055af8b676dfe265ad497757580b8267.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel method for verifying the output attribution of closed-weight LMs, termed the \"Ellipse Signature.\" The authors build upon a key geometric observation: due to the normalization layer (mapping hidden states to a sphere) and the subsequent linear layer (an affine transform) at the end of modern LM architectures, the model's outputs (logits) are strictly constrained to lie on the surface of a high-dimensional hyperellipsoid.The paper's core contribution is demonstrating that this \"naturally occurring\" signature is highly \"forgery-resistant\". In sharp contrast to prior work on \"linear signatures\", which are easy to forge (requiring only $O(d)$ queries), the authors theoretically and experimentally argue that \"extracting\" the ellipse signature is computationally prohibitive. It requires $O(d^2)$ API queries to acquire sufficient points and $O(d^6)$ computational time to fit the ellipsoid parameters.
