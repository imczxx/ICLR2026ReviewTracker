Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models' long, elaborate reasoning traces.\nIn this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness.  Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models’ misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Reasoning Models", "Ai supervision", "Misalignment"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3236ca18d010cce2d999055eb0e1eeb5df1624cb.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The manuscript tackles two challenges around chains of thought (CoT) in LLMs: (1) the CoT might not be faithful, i.e., it contradicts the final result and (2) monitoring COTs seems tricky, and LLMs currently underperfom.

Token budget trade-offs\n\nSection 5 shows that longer CoTs correlate with higher accuracy and monitorability.\n\nCould you provide Pareto curves showing trade-offs between token length, accuracy, and monitor performance?\nThis would help practitioners decide how much extra reasoning is worth the cost in real deployments.\n\n---\n7.

The main limitation lies in the lack of formal and rigorous evaluation objectives. The paper does not clearly define or quantify concepts such as unfaithful explanations or monitor reliability within CoT. For example, does CoT fidelity depend solely on whether the model explicitly references the prompt? Should it be considered faithful if the semantic content aligns despite differing expressions? Or if a model appears to mention the prompt but merely parroted it as an explanation, should this be considered faithful? Furthermore, faithfulness must be defined relative to an ideal CoT (or a true CoT), yet the paper neither defines nor constructs such an ideal, nor provides a measurable distance between the generated CoT and the ideal one. Similarly, monitor reliability lacks clear formalization and quantitative evaluation.\n\n2. The design of the evaluation metrics lacks theoretical grounding. It is unclear why Robustness is defined as AKRa×VRand Scheming as (1-VR)×CIRa. When prompts and resistance are semantically non-independent, the multiplicative form may systematically overestimate or underestimate the true violation probability. Furthermore, these metrics appear tailored for specific tasks (i.e., multiple-choice adversarial prompts), limiting their broader applicability. \n\n3. The monitor design lacks generality.
