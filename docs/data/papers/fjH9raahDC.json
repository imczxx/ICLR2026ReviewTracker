Many powerful and data-efficient neural networks predict molecular energies and forces from single atomic configurations. However, one crucial aspect of the data generation process is rarely considered while learning these models i.e. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. MD generates trajectories of atomic positions of molecular systems moving from higher energy states to lower energy stable/equilibrium states. This work explores a novel way to leverage molecular dynamics (MD) data, when available, to improve the performance of such predictors. We introduce a novel auxiliary loss function that uses the temporal relationships within MD trajectories, called FRAMES. Counter-intuitively, we demonstrate that minimal temporal information, captured by pairs of just two consecutive frames, is optimal for this task, while using longer trajectory sequences can introduce redundancy and degrade performance. The auxiliary loss operates on pairs of consecutive frames, encouraging the model to inherently learn physically meaningful relations/correspondences between the configuration and the forces. During test time, the model predicts energy/forces only from the current configurations. On the widely used MD17 and ISO17 benchmarks, FRAMES significantly outperforms its Equiformer baseline, achieving highly competitive results in both energy and force accuracy. Our work not only presents a novel training strategy which improves the accuracy of the model, but also provides evidence that for distilling physical priors of atomic systems, more temporal data is not always better.", "tldr": "We show that using an auxiliary loss on just two consecutive molecular dynamics frames is an optimal and counter-intuitive strategy for significantly improving the accuracy of neural network", "keywords": ["Molecular prediction", "AI for Science", "graph neural networks", "computational physics", "Temporal information"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d47bbb0d1309a01ec8c285d3f309871166bc45b6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose FRAMES, a training strategy for machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) where trajectory data is learned at the same time as energies and forces, thereby increasing the amount of geometrical and physical information available to the model and improving prediction accuracies for the MLIP.

Using them together to improve MLIP accuracies is however an original and interesting idea. The quality of the investigation is high, all design choices and experiments are reasonable and justified, and the clarity of the presentation is excellent."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "In my opinion, the work has a single major weakness, which unfortunately prevents it from having a wide significance in the field. Modern datasets for MLIPs are not generally obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. While this dataset construction technique was popular around 2017 (although, even at that time, it was never the one primarily used by actual practitioners in chemistry), it is now at best used as one of the many splits that go into a well-crafted dataset. More often than not, it is not used at all. Popular alternatives include sampling from equilibrium databases, rattling of equilibrium structures, cutting (to obtain surfaces), random structure searches, random defect creation, random element substitutions, cell distortions and so on. Maybe for this reason, the authors limit their investigation to two relatively old datasets (MD17, ISO17) which would definitely not be used to train state-of-the-art models today. As such, I believe the evaluation is lacking, but I do not know if improving it is possible, given that recent datasets cannot easily be trained with the proposed strategy. A similar recent idea, denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS, which is incidentally not referenced by the authors), is struggling to be used consistently despite its applicability to arbitrary (including modern) datasets. This is due to its modest gains in accuracy (which are comparable to those shown here), compared to a moderately tedious implementation (also comparable to the architecture developed in this work). As such, I do not realistically see many people in the field benefitting from FRAMES.\n\nOther weaknesses:\n- In the abstract, the sentence \"MD generates trajectories of atomic positions of molecular systems moving from higher energy states to lower energy stable/equilibrium states\" is incorrect. This is not geometry optimization. If this were true, MD would eventually have to lose all its energy and freeze. In short, in molecular dynamics, it is not the positions that are updated with something proportional to the forces, but the momenta. This creates a much more complex dynamical system.\n- The literature review section is lacking in many aspects. Recent evidence points to the fact of \"incorporating E(3)-equivariance\" not being \"crucial\" (line 84) for MLIPs. On the contrary, unconstrained models can achieve similar accuracies and at least equal computational efficiency compared to equivariant models. In the same section, something called \"TEMPO\" (line 87) is mentioned. I can only suppose this was an earlier name for FRAMES. As mentioned earlier, DeNS deserves a mention as a related piece of work, trying to achieve a similar effect to the current work. FlashMD, a modern variant of MDNet, provides a good analysis to what the authors correctly identify as the need for only two structures to predict the positions of the new frame. Finally, recent literature on architectures for MLIPs in chemistry and materials is omitted, although I can totally understand if this is due to the page limit.\n- Comparison to state-of-the-art architectures other than Equiformer is very limited, and, once again, this is probably due to the fact that only MD-derived datasets are usable for this method. Nonetheless, the authors could try their method to improve a different architecture for completeness."}, "questions": {"value": "I have no questions for the authors at this stage.

Please comment on practical relevance given that MD trajectories are typically sub-sampled to avoid strongly correlated training data.\n- Results with a second architecture (e.g., EGNN, NequIP, MACE, PET) would strengthen the argument for generality, but I do not view this as essential for acceptance.\n- Using $\\mathbf{p}$ for positions is an unconventional choice for MD, as it is commonly used for momenta. $\\mathbf{r}$ is the usual choice.
