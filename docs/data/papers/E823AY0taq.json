However, existing evaluation frameworks, primarily designed for text, are not equipped to handle the unique vulnerabilities introduced by audio’s acoustic properties. We find that significant trustworthiness risks in ALLMs arise from non-semantic acoustic cues, such as timbre, accent, and background noise, which can be used to manipulate model behavior. To address this gap, we propose AudioTrust, the first framework for large-scale and systematic evaluation of ALLM trustworthiness concerning these audio-specific risks. AudioTrust spans six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination, safety, privacy, robustness, and authenticition. It is implemented through 26 distinct sub-tasks and a curated dataset of over 4,420 audio samples collected from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency calls, and voice assistant interactions), purposefully constructed to probe the trustworthiness of ALLMs across multiple dimensions. Our comprehensive evaluation includes 18 distinct experimental configurations and employs human-validated automated pipelines to objectively and scalably quantify model outputs. Experimental results reveal the boundaries and limitations of 14 state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted with diverse high-risk audio scenarios, thereby offering critical insights into the secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models.

Speed of speech is also a factor that can influence the jailbreaking result of ALLM, but is not studied as one of the attacking methods.\n\n3. An area that worth study is related to bio-metric voice inference of a non-public person. For example, John Doe, who is NOT a celebrity or a well-known person in the public domain, but whose voice is leaked into the pretraining data (maybe unintentionally), would ALLM be able to recognize the voice and claim \"this is John Doe's voice\" based on the prompt without given a reference voice of John Doe?"}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Validity of \"physical attribute inference\" as violation of privacy: they authors defined privacy physical attribute as model's capability to deduce the speaker's attribute, such as age, ethnicity based on the prompt voice, and claimed that \"open-source and closed-source ALLMs performed poorly in addressing privacy inference leakage\". --- there is a difference between deducing attributes directly on the prompt, vs deducing attributes on the prompt and linked it with ALLM's internal knowledge that related to privacy personal information. I don't agree that deducing the obvious attributes alone is considered violation of privacy. For example, in image domain, be able to tell appearance age of a portrait is not widely considered as a privacy violation, as long as there is no further inference on private information beyond that."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "rkYzMUJeES", "forum": "E823AY0taq", "replyto": "E823AY0taq", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8590/Reviewer_uGbs"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8590/Reviewer_uGbs"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8590/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761803502767, "cdate": 1761803502767, "tmdate": 1762920436392, "mdate": 1762920436392, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces the first comprehensive benchmark AudioTrust for assessing the reliability and safety of Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs).
