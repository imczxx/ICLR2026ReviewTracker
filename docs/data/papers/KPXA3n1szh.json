The resulting patterns are often neglected by temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). To formally analyze the expressive power of TGNNs, we lack a generalization of graph isomorphism to temporal graphs that fully captures their causal topology. Addressing this gap, we introduce the notion of consistent event graph isomorphism, which utilizes a time-unfolded representation of time-respecting paths in temporal graphs. We compare this definition with existing notions of temporal graph isomorphisms. We illustrate and highlight the advantages of our approach and develop a temporal generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm to heuristically distinguish non-isomorphic temporal graphs. Building on this theoretical foundation, we derive a novel message passing scheme for temporal graph neural networks that operates on the event graph representation of temporal graphs.

The strengths of the paper is listed as follows. However, there are some weaknesses in this work (see next Section) and thus I am currently more neutral on the work, leaning weak accept. \n\n- **a novel graph isomorphism for temporal graphs**. The authors proposed a novel temporal generalisation of graph isomorphism called time-respecting path isomorphism which focuses on the the concept of time-respecting path. \n\n- **clear presentation**. The ideas in the paper is clearly presented and relatively easy to follow. However, potentially avoiding large blocks of text and adding highlights or more visualisations may further improve it. \n\n- **insight into existing theory**. The comparison with existing graph isomorphism framework on temporal graphs is useful, such as comparison with the timewise isomorphism recently proposed. My overall take is that there are many different possible notions of graph isomorphism on temporal graphs due to the extra degree of freedom introduced in the temporal dimension and having more diverse perspectives is useful. \n\n\n- **included limitations.** The authors are also very frank and included a detailed limitations sections. Overall, I think this is useful for discussion and gaining insight into the authors' understanding of the current work and how it is positioned in the literature."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **lack of TGNN baselines**. As the authors also pointed out, there is a lack of comparison to other TGNN architectures. This makes the empirical evaluation limited. While it is true that many TGNNs are designed for link prediction, recently there are also a number of papers focusing on graph tasks on temporal graphs. Here are some examples [1], [2], [3]. Comparing with SOTA graph task architectures on large real world datasets can better demonstrate the significance of the proposed architecture\n\n- **Architecture categorisation**. While the proposed isomorphism is compared with current graph isomorphisms in temporal graphs, there is less detail on how current architectures would fall into the new consistent event graph isomorphism. Would some architectures be more powerful than 1-WL here? How to design more powerful architectures in this isomorphism notion? \n\n- **Dataset statistics**. How big are the real world datasets used in RQ2? What are the dataset statistics? Can we link the task in RQ2 to some real world application? \n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Shamsi K, Poursafaei F, Huang S, Ngo B, Coskunuzer B, Akcora CG.

This motivates applying a prior \"Dir-GNN\" method for directed graphs to this augmented event graph, since the method has been proved as strong as the D-WL test, a directed version of the Weisfeiler-Leman test.

Isomorphism on temporal graphs has been previously studied in the GNN literature and the technical developments (c.f., proofs) in this work appear fairly straightforward.\n\n* The manuscript provides a weak and sometimes imprecise account of prior literature. In the abstract, authors state “we lack a generalization of graph isomorphism to temporal graphs that fully captures their causal topology”. To properly back their claims, I expect an in-depth discussion on how their definition — and the expressive power of their proposed message-passing algorithm — compare to those in Gao & Ribeiro (2022) and Souza et al. (2022). Also, the account of the latter reference around Line 154 is incorrect. Souza et al. (2022) show that CAW and TGNs are not equally expressive — see Fig 1 in their manuscript. In summary, I believe the positioning of this work to the prior literature ought to be clearly elucidated.\n\n* Weak motivation. As I understand, when the authors refer to ‘causal influence’ they are broadly concerned with the flow of information between nodes respecting the order in which events occur. However, they often resort to vague terms like “causal topology”  to motivate their work. Despite having no clear definition, it is not clear how this relates to what the ML community understands as causality/causal inference. \n\n* Weak experimental campaign. Authors only compare their method against TGN and a static base using datasets that do not match the recent literature in TGNNs.
