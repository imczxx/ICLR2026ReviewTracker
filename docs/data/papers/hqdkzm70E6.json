However, the inherent temporal irregularity, arising from heterogeneous sampling rates, asynchronous observations, and variable gaps, poses significant challenges for reliable modeling. Existing methods distort the **temporal sampling irregularity** and missing pattern, while failing to capture **variable decay irregularity** in the clinical domain, leading to suboptimal representation. To address these limitations, we introduce DBGL: Decay-Aware Bipartite Graph Learning for Irregular Medical Time Series. DBGL first introduces a patient–variable bipartite graph that simultaneously captures irregular sampling patterns without artificial alignment and adaptively models variable relationships for temporal sampling irregularity modeling, enhancing representation learning. To model variable decay irregularity, DBGL designs a novel node-specific temporal decay encoding mechanism that enables each variable to decay at different rates based on sampling interval, yielding a more accurate and faithful representation of irregular temporal dynamics. We evaluate the performance of DBGL on four publicly available datasets: P19, Physionet, MIMIC-III, and P12. Results show that DBGL outperforms all baselines, and our code is also available in the supplementary material.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Irregular Medical Time Series", "Graph Representation Learning", "Smart Healthcare"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/48e9b424d35f3bd3baf6a2dae516a8c50784afaf.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a081a8d22f386f4cc12e906a9b58b458510ba1e9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces DBGL to solve “temporal sampling irregularity” using a bipartite graph and “variable decay irregularity” using node-specific temporal decay encoding.

First of all, “distort temporal sampling irregularity” at line 15 is already solved by the bipartite graph representation proposed in GraFITi[1] and adopted by TimeCHEAT[2] (included in baselines). DBGL merely changes the existing time-variable bipartite graph to a variable-patient one. Secondly, “variable decay irregularity” at line 16 is a problem specific to RNN-based models and is not a characteristic of irregular time series. The concept of “decay” is related to the forgetting mechanism in GRU-D, so the claim “most methods impose uniform or overly simplistic decay assumptions” at line 65 does not apply to methods like graph-based (TimeCHEAT[2], Raindrop[5]) or attention-based ones (SeFT[4]).\n\n2.\tSome claims in the paper are biased or wrong. (1) The claim “two fundamental limitations persist in existing approaches. One is the distortion of inherent irregularity, where resampling eliminates informative missingness…” at line 62 assumes resampling is a problem cannot be solved by existing methods, while TimeCHEAT[2], GRU-D[3], SeFT[4], Raindrop[5] did not use resampling at all. (2) The claim “variable-variable modeling neglects asynchronous interactions between patients and variables…” at line 63 is confusing. Since “patients” are essentially equal to “samples” in medical irregular time series datasets, this phrase is equal to “variable-variable modeling neglects sample-variable modeling”. They are two independent types of modelling perspectives and are not related at all. Therefore, the logic of this claim is chaotic.\n\n3.\tDBGL is composed of two main components: a patient-variable bipartite graph and a modified version of RNN. Patient-variable bipartite graph seems to be responsible for variable dependency learning, while RNN is responsible for temporal one. However, since the time-variable bipartite graph in GraFITi[1] and TimeCHEAT[2] can already model temporal and variable dependencies simultaneously without any problems in “temporal sampling irregularity” or “variable decay irregularity” (see explanations in weakness 1), DBGL’s more complicated design seems to be inferior.\n\n4.\tPatient-variable bipartite graph in Figure 1 does not provide any useful information in illustrating how it works. Graphs from t1 to tn look exactly the same. If the plotted IMTS input on the top left is p1, then why are p1 and v2 connected in the bipartite graph at t2? The green v2 does not have observation at t2.\n\n5.\tDBGL runs extremely slow using the codes provided in supplementary materials, similar to the speed of ODE-based models, which raises doubts about whether the design mechanisms are worth the trade-off.\n\n6.\tImplementation codes in supplementary materials seem to include lines written by LLMs, while the disclaim in Appendix G does not mentioned its usage.\n\n[1] V.

Limited Scope of \"Variable Decay\" Evaluation: The paper's central claim is modeling \"variable decay irregularity,\" where each clinical variable decays at a different rate. However, the evidence for this is primarily indirect, demonstrated through overall performance gains and ablation studies. A key missing analysis is a direct examination of the learned decay rates (λ_{p,n}^t). The work would be significantly strengthened by visualizing or statistically analyzing these rates across different variable types (e.g., vital signs vs. lab tests) to validate if they align with clinical intuition (e.g., heart rate changes minute-to-minute, while a creatinine level changes over hours or days). Without this, it remains unclear if the model is learning clinically meaningful, distinct decay patterns or simply using the mechanism as a flexible, yet uninterpretable, fitting tool.\n\n2. Scalability and Complexity Concerns: The proposed method constructs a bipartite graph at each time step, which is a key to its success but also its primary computational burden. For long sequences with many patients and variables, this could lead to significant memory and time complexity, potentially limiting its application to real-time clinical settings or very large datasets. The paper would benefit from a more formal complexity analysis (e.g., O(|V| |E|) per time step) and a discussion of this trade-off. An actionable suggestion for future work would be to explore strategies for dynamic graph sparsification or sampling to improve scalability without a significant loss in performance.\n\n3.
