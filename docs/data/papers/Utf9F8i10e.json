Existing methods either require temporally resolved high-frequency observations, or rely on geometric arguments that apply only to conservative systems, limiting the range of dynamics they can recover.\n\nHere, we present a new framework that reconciles these two perspectives by reformulating inference as a stochastic control problem. Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by structure in the system’s invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from severely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating geometric inductive biases into stochastic system identification methods, with broad applications across physics, biology, and control.", "tldr": "A geometry‑guided framework for reconstructing overdamped Langevin dynamics from sparsely sampled trajectories.", "keywords": ["Geometric Inductive Biases", "Dynamical Systems", "Control Theory", "Metric Learning", "Stochastic Methods"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a7fe5c855da4dc769e149b48fbf365959eec7314.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a geometry-aware EM framework for learning overdamped Langevin dynamics from sparse temporal observations.

The core geometric contribution of this paper thus appears to overlapwith MFM yet this is not acknowledged.\n3. **Lack of ablations** - No sensitivity analysis with respect to the learned metric quality.

The use of Gaussian Processes for drift inference, even in its sparse form (as mentioned in the Appendix), limits the practical application to very low-dimensional systems and thus potential impact.\n5. **Presentation** - The paper contains several editing issues: ,issing implementation details on the metric, typo in Fig. 1D (“obsevrations”), text occluded around line 244, and inconsistent or missing bolding of best results in Table 1.
