To address these limitations, we propose Orion, a framework that integrates trainable causal inference with attention mechanisms, optimized through progressive training. Our key contributions include: (1) the TE-CausGAT module, which jointly performs causal discovery and validates learned structures via do-interventions; (2) the Belt Block architecture, which processes hourly, daily, and weekly patterns in parallel; (3) intelligent data retrieval using a fine-tuned large language model; and (4) a progressive three-stage training strategy that progressively transitions from feature learning to causal discovery to end-to-end optimization. Orion achieves new state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks: in traffic forecasting, it improves MAE by 6.60% on METR-LA, 8.65% on PEMS-08, and achieves optimal results across multiple prediction horizons on PEMS-04; in epidemic forecasting, it improves MAE by 22.70% on CA and 37.73% on TX.
