Local motifs within protein structures, such as active sites, are the most critical components for linking structure to function and are key to understanding protein evolution and enabling protein engineering. Existing computational methods struggle to identify and compare these local structures, which leaves a significant gap in understanding protein structures and harnessing their functions. This study presents PLASMA, the first deep learning framework for efficient and interpretable residue-level protein substructure alignment. We reformulate the problem as a regularized optimal transport task and leverage differentiable Sinkhorn iterations. For a pair of input protein structures, PLASMA outputs a clear alignment matrix with an interpretable overall similarity score. Through extensive quantitative evaluations and three biological case studies, we demonstrate that PLASMA achieves accurate, lightweight, and interpretable residue-level alignment. Additionally, we introduce PLASMA-PF, a training-free variant that provides a practical alternative when training data are unavailable. Our method addresses a critical gap in protein structure analysis tools and offers new opportunities for functional annotation, evolutionary studies, and structure-based drug design.

The authors introduce PLASMA, a deep learning framework that reformulates residue-level substructure alignment as a regularized optimal transport (OT) problem. The method consists of a \"Transport Planner\" that uses differentiable Sinkhorn iterations to generate an alignment matrix and a \"Plan Assessor\" to compute an interpretable, overall similarity score. The paper presents both a trainable (PLASMA) and a training-free (PLASMA-PF) variant. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PLASMA outperforms existing structure-based (e.g., TM-Align) and embedding-based (e.g., EBA) methods in detecting motifs, binding sites, and active sites, especially in cases of low global similarity. The method is also demonstrated to be significantly more computationally efficient than baselines."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "Overall, the formulations are clear.\n\nThe prosed method is efficient and effective.\n\nThe reformulation of substructure alignment as a regularized optimal transport problem is a novel and well-justified approach for this domain. This formulation naturally accommodates the partial and variable-length matches common in biological substructures, which the paper correctly identifies as a limitation of standard OT-based alignment methods.\n\nThe strong performance of PLASMA-PF, which requires no task-specific training, makes the method highly practical for scenarios where labeled data is scarce.\n\nThe qualitative case studies presented in Section 6.4 and Figure 5 are convincing. They effectively demonstrate PLASMA's ability to identify biologically meaningful local alignments between proteins with very low sequence identity and different global structures, and correctly contrast these interpretable results with the baseline EBA."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The approach relies on embedding models like protein language models, which may be biased to certain types of proteins. This reliance would potentially result in problems the downstream alignment task. It would be beneficial to test PLASMA on underrepresented proteins, e.g., orphan proteins.\n\nIn table 1, the results are tested over 3 different seeds. More repetition would make the results more robust.\n\nThe justification for the \"Plan Assessor\" design (Section 4) feels somewhat heuristic. Specifically, the confidence weight $\\alpha$ is derived using a 2D convolution with a fixed identity kernel to detect diagonal patterns. The rationale for this specific operator over other potential methods (e.g., a learnable kernel, or a different path-detection algorithm) is not fully explored, nor is the sensitivity to the kernel size.\n\nThe paper does not provide an ablation study on the key hyperparameters of the Sinkhorn algorithm. The temperature parameter $\\tau$ and the number of iterations $T$ (Section 3) are critical for controlling the sparsity and accuracy of the final alignment matrix $\\Omega$, as the paper itself notes. While Appendix D.2 mentions hyperparameter setup, no results are shown to demonstrate how performance (e.g., accuracy and alignment sparsity) varies with these choices.\n\nThe formulation of PLASMA-PF is ambiguous. The paper states that it \"bypasses the siamese network and directly computes costs from $LN(H)$\". It is not explicitly stated how this cost is computed. It is unclear if it still uses the hinge-loss formulation from Equation 2 with $\\phi_{\\theta}$ as an identity function, or if it uses a different distance metric (e.g., cosine distance) entirely."}, "questions": {"value": "Could the authors please clarify the exact mathematical formulation of the cost matrix $\\mathcal{C}$ used in the parameter-free PLASMA-PF variant? How is the cost computed \"directly... from $LN(H)$,\" and how does this computation relate to Equation 2?\n\nCould the authors elaborate on the claim that the LMS metric cannot be meaningfully applied to the EBA baseline? Since EBA produces residue-level alignments, it seems this metric should be applicable and would provide a valuable head-to-head comparison of alignment quality, not just score-based classification performance."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "3BRm31dy0S", "forum": "FileqNzZzn", "replyto": "FileqNzZzn", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12893/Reviewer_4sr4"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12893/Reviewer_4sr4"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12893/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761549710069, "cdate": 1761549710069, "tmdate": 1762923675449, "mdate": 1762923675449, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper works on identifying and understanding protein structure for efficient and interpretable residue-level protein substructure alignment.

Foldseek also falls under the category of models described here. epLSAP-Align (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf309) is also very similar and should be cited given it leverages the OT formulation on structures directly. Another related method is ActSeek, which should also be cited: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12343037.\n- Although a preprint, I would already cite Folddisco as concurrent work, as it fulfills the same nice and needs https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.06.663357v1. If the authors can benchmark against this method it would be great, but not strictly necessary. \n- More generally, I have a feeling that the writing could benefit from a tighter list of contributions in the introductions to clearly contrast the contributions of the work (mostly the machinery on top of the pLM and siamese networks as well as some other mentioned technical contributions like the losses and scores) to other works.\n\nMost of the weaknesses are nitpicks, here are some things I would like to see improve in terms of presentation:\n- I think the results of test_extra currently in Appendix G are the most relevant results since effective generalization is most relevant. Swapping this with table 1 is I think more appropriate, especially considering those results still show strong performance.\n- It would be great to have a concrete percentage for the colors relative to TM-Align.\n- The contrast ratio for the colors in figure 5 is pretty bad and barely readable when printed. The squares subsetting the proteins could be also bigger for the proteins.\n- There is some interchangeable terminology which can be made more precise. \"substructure,\" \"local structure,\" \"motif,\" \"functional site,\" \"active/binding site\" are used interchangeably but they are not completely: motifs can be discontinuous, binding sites often involve side chains only, “substructure” could mean a whole domain.\n- The description of the diagonal kernel could be made a bit more explicit by highlighting it surfaces continuous diagonal elements.\n- \"which causes troubles\" needs to be reformulated, e.g. to \"which causes problems\".\n- appendix references should be made more explicit, indicating more precisely what's in each of them."}, "questions": {"value": "The plan assessor does a kxk identity deconvolution to detect motifs, but this assumes sequence continuity on both proteins, which would downweight cases where there are structural motifs that are non continuous.
