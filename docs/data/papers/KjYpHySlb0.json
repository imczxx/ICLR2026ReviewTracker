To learn powerful representations, an agent should actively explore states that contribute to its knowledge of the environment. Temporal representations can capture the information necessary to solve a wide range of potential tasks while avoiding the computational cost associated with full state reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an exploration method that leverages temporal contrastive representations to guide exploration, prioritizing states with unpredictable future outcomes. We demonstrate that such representations can enable the learning of complex exploratory behaviors in locomotion, manipulation, and embodied-AI tasks, revealing capabilities and behaviors that traditionally require extrinsic rewards. Unlike approaches that rely on explicit distance learning or episodic memory mechanisms (e.g., quasimetric-based methods), our method builds directly on temporal similarities, yielding a simpler yet effective strategy for exploration.", "tldr": "We propose an exploration method based on temporal contrastive representation, our method maximizes state coverage as perceived through the lens of these learned representations.", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "exploration", "intrinsic motivation", "surprise", "empowerment", "contrastive learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/42e8eb302577421db6cb1b8daa8a5853406a7c32.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Based on the work of Jiang et al.

Temporal Similarity as Intrinsic Reward:\n\nThe use of temporal similarity as an intrinsic reward is explored in [1]. The novelty of this approach needs further clarification.\n\n2.

What are the specific benefits of these two design choices? A more detailed explanation would be helpful.\n\n3.  Experimental Results and Task Rewards: \n\nThe experimental results show that the visited states are more diverse. However, how does this diversity benefit RL training with task rewards?\nI believe this is not a significant burden on the authors, as they could simply incorporate the extrinsic reward into the current intrinsic reward framework. The absence of this experiment makes it difficult for readers to fully believe in the method's adaptability.\n\n4.

This new intrinsic reward directly follows the previous work \"Episodic Novelty Through Temporal Distance (ETD).\" The main motivation is to simplify the ETD method, with the following improvements:\n\n- ETD learns the temporal distance between states.  Distance meaning it should at least satisfy the properties of a quasi-metric. C-TEC demonstrates through experimental results that learning a quasi-metric is unnecessary; it is sufficient as long as the representation can reflect the temporal relationship between states.\n- ETD calculates the intrinsic reward by computing the distance between the current state and every state in the episodic memory, taking the minimum value as the intrinsic reward (backward-looking). In contrast, C-TEC samples a future state according to a geometric distribution and calculates the distance between the current state and that future state as the intrinsic reward (forward-looking)."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The algorithm uses the idea of temporal distance as an intrinsic reward.

I believe \"Discovering Diverse Behaviors\" corresponds to learning a set of policies, each with a different behavior. However, the paper is clearly not doing this. This title is ambiguous.\n\n- In line 256, the paper divides the intrinsic reward into a \"surprise\" term and a \"familiarity\" term. The \"surprise\" term can be understood as promoting exploration, but I do not understand the role of the \"familiarity\" term. I also do not quite understand the role of \"mode-seeking\" in exploration. Does the author mean that a high reward should be given to states that have been visited but are temporally distant, rather than giving a high reward to unvisited states?\n\n- C-TEC is (forward-looking) while ETD is (backward-looking). Besides the fact that the forward-looking approach does not require an episodic memory, are there any other advantages compared to the backward-looking approach?
