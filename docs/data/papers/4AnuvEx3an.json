Among the most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption (LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a new class of reparametrization methods for transfer learning, designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as fine-tuning large language models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Fine-Tuning", "LoRA", "Random Matrix Theory", "Transfer Learning"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/83ef4c10d6b84df5465a2a84a6e530f6dc4e232d.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/085d8c28d5e6216bda14ead0ae836de4ffd22b02.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes $\\alpha$-LoRA, a reparameterization family that rescales each row of a frozen base weight matrix by a learned factor α when applying a trainable (optionally low-rank) update.

The following comments are therefore made from a more practical and empirical perspective.\n\n1. **Scope of theory.** The RMT analysis is confined to one-layer linear (ridge) classification under a Gaussian mixture with identity covariance. While the paper is transparent about this, the gap to two-layer (or multi-layer) nonlinear networks remains large, so the theory’s prescriptive power for LLMs is still indirect.\n2. **Connection to low-rank structure is not formalized.** The core theory is agnostic to LoRA’s low-rank reparameterization. $\\alpha$ -rescaling could be  applied to many PEFT variants. The paper positions $\\alpha$ -scaling as complementary, but does not analyze interactions with rank choice or decomposition schemes, which would strengthen the story.\n3. The idea of rescaling pre-trained channels is established in prior literature. Notably, IA³ fine-tunes LLMs by learning multiplicative factors on intermediate activations within linear transformations—an operation that is effectively equivalent to scaling the output channels of the associated weight matrices  𝑊. This close correspondence substantially diminishes the methodological novelty.\n4. **Sample efficiency** The $\\alpha$-update uses fresh mini-batches separate from those used to update the adapters. This design may trade sample efficiency for generalization. \n4. **Experimental concerns**:\n\n- **Baselines.** Since the paper mentions complementary methods (e.g., DoRA), including such baselines would better position $\\alpha$-LoRA beyond vanilla LoRA\n- **Hyperparameters.** The appendix shows different adapter LRs and LoRA vs. $ \\alpha$-LoRA on several tasks, which can favor $\\alpha$-LoRA. The authors even uses different $T$ or ``val split`` for different seed on RTE, SST2 and QQP. While I appreciate the authors’ transparency, the need for such delicate hyperparameter tuning raises concerns about the method’s robustness and practical effectiveness.\n- **Limited scale of empirical evaluation**. The experiments are conducted on relatively small datasets and modest-sized models. The experiments would be more convincing if the authors could include evaluations on larger-scale benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) and more capable models such as LLaMA 2-7B/13B."}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "E2OQpcsISa", "forum": "4AnuvEx3an", "replyto": "4AnuvEx3an", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11441/Reviewer_pnWA"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11441/Reviewer_pnWA"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11441/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760616022700, "cdate": 1760616022700, "tmdate": 1762922555741, "mdate": 1762922555741, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes $\\alpha$-LoRA, a PEFT variant that rescales the frozen base weights row-wise by a vector $\\alpha$ before adding a (low-rank) adapter, i.e., for a layer with frozen $W^\\star \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text{out}}\\times d_{\\text{in}}}$ the update is\n$$\nW_{\\text{new}} = \\alpha \\odot W^\\star + W,\\quad W =  AB \\text{ (LoRA) },\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text{out}}}$ and $\\odot$ is row-wise scaling.

In other words, within the suggested framework, the paper can derive an optimal $\\alpha$ for generalization. However, there is a lack of motivation for why this reparametrization scheme is a good idea in the first place. E.g, why not have $w_A = A w + \\Delta w$ for $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$? Why not use other reparametrization schemes?\n- **(W3)** The paper takes a **very large** leap from fine-tuning binary linear classifiers to fine-tuning **language models**. The method is modified heavily: **(i)** row-wise rescaling of the base weights instead of a single scalar, **(ii)** parameter delta is parameterized by a low-rank adapter instead of a full weight matrix, and **(iii)** the optimal $\\alpha^*$, is no longer closed form (which is the main contribution of the paper) and is optimized with the parameters (unclear how this effects generalization). While the empirical results are positive, I don't believe that this can be considered the same method, and in terms of a pure empirical contribution, a comparison to the broad literature on LM fine-tuning and PEFT more broadly is lacking.
