While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures, enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (LinearRAG), an efficient framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

Entity activation is a crucial initial step in LinearRAG. However, the authors do not clarify how the framework handles queries from which no entities can be extracted.

Additionally, if extracted entities are ambiguous and cannot be disambiguated without the query’s full context, could this lead to activation of incorrect entities and degraded retrieval performance? An explanation addressing these scenarios would strengthen the paper.\n\n2. In Equation 5, the matrix M is not defined. Moreover, since σ_q is a ∣S∣×1 vector (per Equation 4), its transpose σ_q^T is 1×∣S∣, which mismatches the dimension ∣V_e∣ of α_q^(t-1) (from Equation 3). A more detailed explanation of this equation and its dimensions is necessary.\n\n3. LinearRAG’s dynamic pruning currently applies a fixed threshold across all expansions. Given that dynamic pruning aims to produce high-quality semantic paths, empirical evaluation of this fixed-threshold approach is warranted but absent from the manuscript. Furthermore, since distant entities are generally less important than closer ones, justification for using a uniform threshold would be valuable.\n\n4.

The Tri-Graph merges entity mentions based on string matching, which ignores polysemy (different entities with the same name).

Using binary weights (0/1) for sentence-entity edges fails to capture the varying semantic importance of different entities within a sentence. This uniform weighting strategy is a simplification that may amplify the influence of \"noisy\" or peripheral entities during the propagation step, potentially harming result relevance and interpretability. \n\n3.
