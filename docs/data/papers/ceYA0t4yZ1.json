Recent extensions incorporating machine learning (ML) adjustments have made RDD an appealing approach for researchers utilizing causal ML toolkits. However, many real-world applications, such as production systems, involve multiple decision criteria and logically connected thresholds, necessitating more sophisticated identification strategies, which are not clearly addressed in the recent literature. We derive a novel identification result for the complier effect in the multi-score RDD (MRD) setting by extending unit behavior types to multiple dimensions. Further, we show that under mild assumptions, this identification result does not depend on subsets of units with constant response. We apply our findings to simulated and real-world data from opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing, employing estimators that adjust for covariates through machine learning. Our results offer insights into enhancing current production policies by optimizing the cutoff points, demonstrating the applicability of MRD in a manufacturing context.", "tldr": "We derive new identification results for the Multi-Score RDD framework and apply ML-adjusted RDD estimators to manufacturing data accordingly.", "keywords": ["Causal Machine Learning", "Regression Discontinuity Design", "Treatment Effect Identification", "Causal Inference Application"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fac446faace82def7b69ab0844051726dd25357b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/842396a70d0a9bb06beab3d39d0c89e57a7528aa.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper extends the classic Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) framework to multi-score RDD (MRD), where treatment decisions are based on multiple thresholds.

These technical details are not always well-motivated or explained. A more intuitive approach would be to use the empirical application as a running example throughout the theoretical section, which would make the theoretical results more tangible. Since the empirical data is 2-dimensional, I suggest that the authors limit the theoretical results to the 2-dimensional case and move the more general case to the appendix.\n\nThe unit categorization section introduces multiple propositions and a lot of notation to formalize the different types of units (compliers, defiers, etc.). However, this section is not well connected to the empirical relevance of the results. Although Theorem 1 relies on unit categorization, the paper doesn’t clearly explain how these concepts apply to the data or how they influence the interpretation of the results. It might be more efficient to introduce these categories in a more intuitive way, rather than getting bogged down in formalism early on. The reader would benefit from a clearer link between the theoretical framework and the empirical application.\n\nThe discussion of assumptions related to the continuity and unit categorization in MRD is valuable but would benefit from further elaboration on how these assumptions might hold or fail in different empirical settings, particularly for industrial applications.\n\nWhile the empirical section demonstrates the applicability of the framework, additional robustness checks on the sensitivity of results to changes in thresholds or decision rules would provide stronger evidence for the framework's validity in production contexts."}, "questions": {"value": "Have you considered including visualizations to help illustrate the unit categorization and the identification results? In the RDD literature, visual aids, such as plots of discontinuities, are a valuable tool for empirical researchers. For example, Figure 4 is a great example of how to present the results visually, which aids in understanding the treatment effect at the cutoff.\n\nWhile the paper focuses on identification, it would be helpful to provide more details on how researchers can implement the estimation procedure based on the identification results. For instance, how should researchers practically apply the unit categorization framework to estimate treatment effects using the MRD method?
