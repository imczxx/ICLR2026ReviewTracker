Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent paradigm ReAct centers on the integration of single-step reasoning with immediate action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks that require long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm **AdaPlan**, aiming to synergize high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward **PilotRL**, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model’s ability to follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that **PilotRL** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78% comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.", "tldr": "We propose PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by progressive reinforcement learning.", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Agent Paradigm", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dc2958f813ab9f25e867eed4365ce4ef87c4b8fd.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/be5cc2255a9fa9853ce0ee4592e9a6476d289125.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The article proposes a hierarchical learning method for agentic LLM, which features an adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, and PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by progressive reinforcement learning.

The planner dynamically generates and updates high-level global plans based on real-time environmental feedback, guiding the executor to avoid short-sighted decisions and align actions with long-term goals.\nPilotRL: A global planning-guided progressive reinforcement learning (RL) framework built on AdaPlan. It trains LLMs in three sequential stages: (1) enhancing the executor’s ability to follow global plans; (2) optimizing the quality of plans generated by the planner; (3) jointly refining the coordination between planning and execution.\nExtensive experiments on 6 benchmarks (e.g., ALFWorld, BabyAI) show that PilotRL achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct (an open-source model) trained with PilotRL outperforms the closed-source GPT-4o by 3.60% and GPT-4o-mini by 55.78% (at comparable parameter scales), and exhibits strong generalization on out-of-domain tasks."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Instead of using naive RL or SFT, PilotRL’s three-stage training (executor enhancement → planner optimization → joint coordination) is a novel combination of skill-building and RL. This sequential design avoids conflicting training signals (e.g., optimizing plan quality before the executor can follow plans) and addresses SFT’s generalization flaw by using RL to foster transferable skills rather than trajectory memorization."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.

The paper evaluates PilotRL on 6 benchmarks, but all tasks are text-only or lightweight symbolic environments (e.g., ALFWorld: text-based household navigation; Wordle: word guessing; BabyAI: grid-world navigation).

The authors identify three primary challenges with current methods: (1) the ReAct paradigm's focus on single-step reasoning, which is insufficient for long-horizon tasks; (2) poor coordination between isolated planner and executor modules ; and (3) the tendency of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to memorize trajectories, which limits generalization.\n\nTo address this, the authors propose a two-part solution. First, they introduce AdaPlan, an adaptive agent paradigm where a unified model acts as both a global planner and an executor. This global plan is not static but is continuously updated based on environmental feedback. Second, they propose PilotRL, a training framework based on AdaPlan that uses progressive RL. Experiments show that an 8B open-source model (LLaMA3.1) trained with PilotRL achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing the closed-source GPT-4o by 3.60% and significantly outperforming baselines like SFT and standard RL."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The core contribution, the progressive reinforcement learning curriculum, is a significant and novel approach. Instead of tackling the complex, multi-objective problem of planning and acting simultaneously, the framework logically scaffolds the agent's capabilities. It first learns to follow (Stage 1), then to plan (Stage 2), and finally to coordinate (Stage 3). This staged approach is a highly intuitive and effective solution to the inherent difficulty of training complex, multi-faceted agents.\n\nThe AdaPlan paradigm itself is a robust architectural choice. By unifying the planner and executor into a single model , the framework directly addresses the \"coordination problem\"  that plagues isolated, multi-model systems. Furthermore, the plan is adaptive, meaning it is refined based on new observations, which is demonstrably more resilient than \"one-shot\" planning.\n\nThe paper's empirical results are strong. The claim that an 8B open-source model can be trained to surpass GPT-4o on a suite of agentic benchmarks is a major finding. This suggests that advanced, progressive RL training, rather than just model scale or pre-training, may be a key to unlocking high-level agentic capabilities, offering a path for open-source models to compete with proprietary systems.\n\nThe paper is clearly written. The authors effectively use diagrams to contrast their approach with the limitations of ReAct, SFT, and isolated planners . The three-stage training process is well-defined, and the motivation for each stage is persuasively argued"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The paper states, \"we employ the frontier model DeepSeek-V3 to simulate real-world environmental behaviors\". This is a potentially confounding, methodological choice. For tasks like ALFWorld and BabyAI, which have well-defined, executable simulators, the agent is not interacting with the actual environment. Instead, it is interacting with another LLM (DeepSeek-V3) that simulates that environment. This abstraction means the agent is learning to solve a text-based language game with DeepSeek-V3, not necessarily learning to solve the embodied task. This setup undermines the claims of performance on benchmarks like ALFWorld.\n\nIn the ablation for unified vs. isolated architectures (Table 4), the isolated model was trained by \"separately training the planner and executor modules... with each component trained for 2 epochs\" . This does not appear to be an apples-to-apples comparison. The unified model received a 4-epoch progressive curriculum. It's unclear if the isolated model received the same total number of training steps or the same progressive curriculum. The 5.63% performance drop  could be an artifact of a different, and potentially suboptimal, training scheme, rather than a true reflection of the architecture's inferiority"}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could the authors please clarify the exact interaction loop for a task like ALFWorld? When the PilotRL agent outputs \"Action: go to tustand\" , is this action fed into the canonical ALFWorld simulator to get a new state, or is it fed back into DeepSeek-V3 , which then generates a plausible text observation (e.g., \"On the tustand, you see a vase...\")?\n\n2. The training and evaluation are deeply reliant on DeepSeek-V3 as both a reward model and the final judge. Were any steps taken to mitigate the risk that PilotRL is simply \"reward hacking\" or \"overfitting to the judge\"? For instance, was a different high-capability LLM (like GPT-4o) ever used as a \"second opinion\" judge during evaluation to see if the performance gains hold?\n\n3. To ensure a fair comparison in Table 4, was the \"Isolated\" model trained with the same progressive 3-stage curriculum as the unified model (e.g., Stage 1 training only the executor, Stage 2 only the planner, Stage 3 both)?
