Despite the recent advances, the explanations of existing MVQA are often incomplete and non-causal, neglecting key evidence, intermediate steps, and alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we present PathFinder, a graph-structured reasoning framework, in which medical entities are represented as nodes and causal/evidential relations as edges, enabling systematic traversal of diagnostic pathways. In PathFinder, we define two structural reasoning dimensions: step-wise exploration, which encourages PathFinder to traverse intermediate entities with causal links, and branch-wise exploration, which encourages exploring alternative diagnostic routes and ruling out unlikely options.Further, we introduce Graph-GRPO to integrate graph-structured supervision with two process-level rewards: a Step Reward for causally coherent reasoning, and a Branch Reward for systematic exploration of alternatives, complemented by outcome accuracy. Experiments on seven multimodal and seven text-only benchmarks consistently show that PathFinder outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while producing reasoning results that are causally coherent and structurally comprehensive.

Here are some common questions:\n\n**1. Open-End Task**\n\nIn addition to the conventional QA and VQA benchmarks, we further evaluate our model PathFinder’s performance on an open-end task: medical report generation. The results are summarized in Table7 in the appendix, including two widely adopted benchmarks: CheXpert Plus, and IU-Xray. We follow the leaderboard in Lingshu and their evaluation codes and specifically report two semantic-based metrics ROUGE-L and CIDEr, one model-based metrics RaTE. Our PathFinder-7B model achieves competitive or superior results compared with both state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models. Together with Table 3&4, these results show that our model superior performance in both close-end (V)QA and open-end medical report generation task. We provide a short table here. For the full table, please refer to Table 7 in the appendix, with an example in Figure 11.\n\n### Table: Medical report generation tasks (CXP: CheXpert Plus and IU-Xray)\n\n| Model | ROUGE-L (CXP) | CIDEr (CXP) | RaTE (CXP) | ROUGE-L (IU-Xray) | CIDEr (IU-Xray) | RaTE (IU-Xray) |\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n| GPT-4.1 | 24.5 | 78.8 | 45.5 | 30.2 | 124.6| 51.3 |\n| MedGemma-4B-IT| **27.1** | _79.0_| **47.2** | 30.8| 103.6| 57.0|\n| LLaVA-Med-7B| 18.4 | 45.5| 38.8| 18.8  | 68.2  | 40.9  |\n| HuatuoGPT-V-7B| 21.3 | 64.7| 44.2 | 29.6 | 104.3 | 52.9 |\n| Qwen2.5VL-7B| 22.2| 62.0 | 41.0| 26.5 | 78.1| 48.4 |\n| Lingshu-7B | _26.5_  | _79.0_ | 45.4| **41.2** | **180.7**| _57.6_ |\n| *PathFinder-7B (Ours)* | 26.1| **88.7** | _46.9_ | _35.0_ | _153.6_  | **63.5**  |\n\n**2. Reasoning Correctness:**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for raising the concern regarding factual correctness and reliability of the reasoning data. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human evaluation with a licensed medical expert, covering both the constructed SFT data and the model’s structured reasoning outputs. For detailed explanation, please refer to appendix A.10 and Table 11&12&13 in the revised submission PDF.\n\n(1) **SFT data verification**: We randomly sample 200 SFT data examples and ask the medical expert to evaluate three key dimensions: (i) factuality of structured nodes, (ii) logical consistency of edges, (iii) sufficiency of justification for the final conclusion. As shown in Table below, the pass rate exceeded 98% across all dimensions, indicating that the constructed reasoning graphs are accurate and coherent. While full manual verification of 100k samples is infeasible, this sample provides strong evidence for overall data quality.\n\n### Table: Survey of human evaluation of SFT data\n\n| Dimension   | Factuality | Consistency | Justification | Average |\n|-|-|--|-|-|\n| SFT Data | 198/200| 196/200| 195/200| 98.2%|\n\n(2) **Model output evaluation**: We further performed a two-stage evaluation of PathFinder-7B’s outputs in two way: \n\n(i) **Blind Correctness Assessment**: We sample 80 model outputs (40 correct / 40 incorrect) from 2 VQA (MedX-M, MMMU-Med) and 2 QA (MedX-T, MMLU-Pro) datasets. The cases are mixed and the ground truth label is withheld. The expert judges the correctness solely based on the structured reasoning without knowing the ground truth label. As summarized in Table below, clinicians correctly identified 38/40 correct and 40/40 incorrect predictions, demonstrating that the model’s reasoning traces contain sufficient clinical signals for expert to reliably assess correctness. \n\n### Table: Blind correctness assessment of model output\n\n| Model \\ Human | TRUE | FALSE |\n|-|-|-|\n| Correct (40)|38|2|\n| Incorrect (40)|0|40|\n\n(ii) **Reasoning Quality Assessment**: We then evaluate the 40 correctly predicted cases (10 per dataset from MedX-M, MMMU-Med, MedX-T, MMLU-Pro) along factuality, consistency, and justification. Results show that the model achieves >95% pass rate, confirming that PathFinder-7B produces factually grounded, logically coherent, and well-justified reasoning chains.\n\n### Table: Reasoning quality assessment of model output\n\n| Dimension| MedX-M | MMMU-Med | MedX-T | MMLU-Pro | Average |\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n| Factuality| 9/10| 10/10| 10/10| 10/10| 97.5%|\n| Consistency| 9/10| 10/10| 9/10| 10/10| 95.0%|\n| Justification| 9/10| 10/10| 9/10| 10/10| 95.0%|"}}, "id": "FONzQ9JPPi", "forum": "m4Sj27sdm7", "replyto": "m4Sj27sdm7", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5421/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5421/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5421/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763728550780, "cdate": 1763728550780, "tmdate": 1763728550780, "mdate": 1763728550780, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces PathFinder, a graph-structured reasoning framework for medical visual question answering (Med-VQA).
