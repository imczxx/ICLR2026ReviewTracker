While prior studies advanced coding theory, workflow design, and simulation tools, challenges such as synthesis costs, sequencing errors, and biological constraints (GC-content imbalance, homopolymers) limit practical deployment. To address this, our framework draws from quantum parallelism concepts to enhance encoding diversity and resilience, integrating biologically informed constraints with deep learning to enhance error mitigation in DNA storage. NeuroDNAAI encodes binary data streams into symbolic DNA sequences, transmits them through a noisy channel with substitutions, insertions, and deletions, and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Our results show that traditional prompting or rule-based schemes fail to adapt effectively to realistic noise, whereas NeuroDNAAI achieves superior accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate low bit error rates for both text and images.

However, the encoder that transforms binary information into a DNA sequence does not add any redundancy for error correction. This approach appears to contradict fundamental principles of information theory. \n+ The authors propose using a single DNA strand of 3,136 nucleotides as the storage medium. However, synthesizing a single strand of this length is not feasible with current biochemical technologies, which are typically limited to synthesizing sequences of up to approximately 200 nucleotides directly.\n+ The experiments on MNIST are not convincing due to the dataset's inherent properties. MNIST images contain significant redundancy, especially with large areas of black pixels, which can make the decoder's performance appear better than it is. Additionally, these simple images are not sensitive enough to synchronization errors (indels), a key challenge in DNA storage, making MNIST a poor choice for rigorously evaluating the system's capabilities.\n+ A convincing way for the authors to verify the effectiveness of their approach would be to encode a randomly generated binary string, recover it through the proposed method, and present the resulting BER."}, "questions": {"value": "+ The questions raised in the Weakness section. \n+ Line 018. The abstract states that the framework 'draws from quantum parallelism concepts' to enhance encoding diversity.

It is unconventional to dedicate this much space in the main text to describing a well-known dataset like MNIST. This information is typically shortened or placed in an appendix.\n+ The authors claim a “detailed biological noise simulation” as a core contribution; however, the experiments section provides little evidence or analysis to support this claim. \n+ Section 4.3.
