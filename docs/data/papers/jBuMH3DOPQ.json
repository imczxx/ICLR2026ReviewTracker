However, existing TTDG methods primarily rely on style transfer strategies operating at a coarse granularity, which prove ineffective for pixel-level prediction tasks such as image super-resolution (SR). To address this limitation, we propose a multi-codebook based test-time domain generalization framework (MC-TTDG). Our method leverages both domain-specific and domain-invariant codebooks to achieve fine-grained representation learning on source domains, and performs pixel-level nearest-neighbor feature matching and transfer to accurately adjust target domain features. Furthermore, we introduce a voting-based strategy for optimal domain-specific codebook selection, which improves the precision of feature transfer through multi-party consensus. Extensive experiments across diverse data distributions, and network architectures demonstrate that the proposed method effectively transfers feature distributions for SR networks.

The replacement of coarse style transfer with fine-grained codeword substitution is a logical and well-motivated design choice. The visual and quantitative results strongly suggest that this approach is far more effective than style-based methods for SR.\n- The authors have conducted a thorough set of experiments.

While the application is novel, the core disentanglement method is not. \n- While the problem formulation is novel and the engineering is solid, the work feels more like a clever and effective application of existing ideas to a new domain. Although, I think integrating prior methods for other task is novel, there should at least be experiments showing how and why such prior method is the best while others do not fit.
