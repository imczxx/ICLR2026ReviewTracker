Unlike prior works that emphasize deep strategic mastery, LudoBench targets an initial reasoning challenge uninitiated gamers face: *correctly comprehending a new tabletop strategy game for the first time*.  \n\nWe examine whether, given a visual depiction of a tabletop scene and a corresponding ruleset, a model can correctly answer grounded questions about the pictured scenario. Concretely, LudoBench tests three cumulative situated game-comprehension capabilities: (1) *Environment Perception*, (2) *Heterogeneous Rules Integration*, and (3) *Short-horizon Optimization*, to progressively stress-test the foundational reasoning required for real-world game comprehension. \n\nEvaluating frontier LMs on three diverse strategy games, we find that even the strongest models achieve only ~68% accuracy on simple environment perception tasks and fall below 10% on situated multi-step comprehension puzzles that hobbyist gamers can routinely solve.\nOur extensive failure analysis and knowledge-ablation experiments reveal that *models largely fail to comprehend rich cross-modal reference knowledge* and are subsequently unable to apply this knowledge to messy and unfamiliar situated environments. Our findings highlight the many steps remaining for current methods to succeed on complex multimodal reasoning in the real world.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["game reasoning", "multimodal qa", "vision-language grounding", "benchmark", "situated reasoning", "tabletop games", "board games"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3164b7bfdbcf4ac6bd0397dccfb7be1e8b10e1b5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper examines the multimodal reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the complex, rule-driven setting of tabletop strategy games. The authors propose a three-tier framework of game understanding — environment perception, heterogeneous rule integration, and short-horizon optimization — and evaluate how well models perform across these layers. Using a newly constructed benchmark, LUDOBENCH, which includes three real-world board games of varying complexity, the study assesses eight state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen-VL 2.5 32B, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet) under three rulebook input conditions: text, image, and none. The results reveal that even at the lowest tier—environment perception—performance is inconsistent, and it degrades sharply when rule retrieval and planning are required. Common failure modes include misreading cluttered board states, retrieving but misapplying rules, overlooking opponents’ states, and hallucinating illegal actions. Taken together, these findings indicate that current LLMs are not reliable “rule oracles” for analog tabletop play and underscore the need for stronger cross-modal grounding and faithful rule execution."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. Clear, well-structured writing and figures make the method and setup easy to follow.\n2. The paper’s three progressive competencies — environment perception, heterogeneous rules integration, and short-horizon optimization — mirror how humans build understanding step by step. This structuring makes results interpretable and helps localize failure modes.\n3. The experiments show models often perform worse with visual inputs than with plain-text rules — the opposite of human behavior. This is an interesting, discussion-worthy result.\n4.  The study employs a multi-stage annotation pipeline that includes checks for annotator–expert agreement, which enhances the reliability of the benchmark. This methodological rigor improves the transparency, reproducibility, and credibility of the reported results."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. While tabletop games offer well-defined, structured rule systems, they are highly domain-specific and differ markedly from real-world reasoning contexts.  In this setting, rule comprehension can overshadow genuine reasoning, which may limit the benchmark’s ability to reflect broader inferential capability.  Consequently, it is unclear how LUDOBENCH performance should be interpreted as a measure of general reasoning: the paper provides no evidence that its scores correlate with wider reasoning skills or transfer beyond tabletop domains.\n2.  Many tabletop rulebooks and gameplay descriptions are publicly available online. How do the authors ensure that the evaluated models had not already seen the same or similar rule texts during pretraining? If not, superior performance under text-based conditions might partially reflect memorization rather than genuine reasoning or rule integration. \n3. The benchmark covers only three tabletop games with a steep difficulty jump (1.2 → 2.6 → 4.6) and narrow genre coverage. This constrains external validity and makes it hard to trace how performance scales with incremental complexity."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The paper states that the setting “reflects the experience of real-world gamers during first-time gameplay,” and the conclusion emphasizes “one-shot” scenarios. However, the human baselines (expert / hobbyist) are clearly not first-time players. How do the authors reconcile this with the stated goal, and would a novice baseline alter the model–human gap?\n2.  In some T1-Perception results (e.g., model o1 on KingDomino and Res Arcana), the no-rulebook condition outperforms having rules. What explains this inversion?\n3.  Many cards in tabletop games contain stylized artwork that diverge from LLM pretraining data or real life. Given that even basic perception is challenging, the study should first separate perception from reasoning with a dedicated pretest (e.g., card/asset/symbol recognition) before tier-by-tier game reasoning."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "xkP4RHYheJ", "forum": "TOgQ00DEek", "replyto": "TOgQ00DEek", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23072/Reviewer_cEf5"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23072/Reviewer_cEf5"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23072/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761018641213, "cdate": 1761018641213, "tmdate": 1762942500560, "mdate": 1762942500560, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces LUDOBENCH, a new multimodal reasoning benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of VLMs to act as \"rules oracles\" for complex tabletop strategy games.

The results, while conclusive for these specific games, may not generalize to the thousands of other tabletop games.

Given the significant impact of prompt engineering on LLM performance, the results could be sensitive to this choice. It is unclear if more sophisticated prompting techniques (for example breaking down the query into Chain-of-Thought steps for the model) could provide better performance. A more detailed ablation study on prompting would strengthen the conclusion that the failures are fundamental to the models, not just the evaluation setup.  The authors could also report the top-k accuracy to highlight if the models sometimes know the right answer (which would indicate that they could get way better at this task with some finetuning)."}, "questions": {"value": "- Why would this benchmark in particular be more valuable than all the others that already exist?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "mElBimBSby", "forum": "TOgQ00DEek", "replyto": "TOgQ00DEek", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23072/Reviewer_k6xk"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23072/Reviewer_k6xk"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23072/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761856665531, "cdate": 1761856665531, "tmdate": 1762942500174, "mdate": 1762942500174, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce a benchmark, LudoBench, to evaluate the abilities of multimodal large language models on three categories of tasks—perceiving board game states, integrating rulebook knowledge to evaluate game states, and solving short-horizon optimization tasks (e.g. \"which legal move would get the most points?\").
