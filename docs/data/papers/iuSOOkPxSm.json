Specifically,\nREACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.\nExperimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL.\nIn addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s).\nWe further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive. \nOur code and demos are available on https://sites.google.com/view/react-drive.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Autonomous Driving", "Vision Language Models", "Work Zones"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5c0f88fe52d3c589ced4ac667eaff4cea7a4113c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper shows common VLMs fail on the work zone and analyze failure patterns on the ROADWork dataset.

To mitigate these issues, they propose REACT-Drive, a framework that integrates RAG with constraint-based code generation to improve planning robustness and efficiency."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The entire REACT-Drive framework depends heavily on the outputs of a YOLOv12 detector fine-tuned on ROADWork and monocular depth estimation from MiDaS. Any perception errors, such as missing novel work-zone objects (enew barrier types or colored cones) or inaccurate depth estimates, would propagate through the scene graph, retrieval, and planning stages, fundamentally compromising system safety and reliability.\n\nThe decision to generate and execute Python code at runtime introduces considerable safety risks. In safety-critical systems like autonomous driving, planners are typically deterministic, rigorously tested, and verifiable. Allowing a VLM to generate executable code in real-time is highly unpredictable; even minor errors in logic or boundary conditions could lead to catastrophic failures. The current self-verification mechanism， which only checks destination proximity and drivability, is insufficient to ensure trajectory feasibility, dynamic stability, or interaction-aware behavior.\n\nFor the experiment, metrics such as ADE and FDE are reported in pixel space, which does not faithfully reflect real-world driving safety. A small pixel error may correspond to a dangerous deviation in the physical world.\n\nCritical aspects of trajectory quality, including passenger comfort (jerk, acceleration), compliance with traffic rules (lane discipline), and interpretability, are not evaluated.\n\nThe comparison with a fine-tuned VLM baseline is arguably unfair, as REACT-Drive benefits from a database of failure cases. A more appropriate baseline would enable all models to access the same failure-case knowledge.\n\nThere is no comparison with classical or optimization-based planning methods, like MPC, leaving it unclear whether the proposed VLM-based complexity is necessary or beneficial compared to well-established methods.\n\nThe physical evaluation is conducted in an open-loop setting using only 15 scenarios (100 images). This is insufficient to support claims of generalization, especially for a long-tail problem. The study does not demonstrate performance in closed-loop simulation or real-world deployment, where interaction with other agents and control uncertainty become critical.\n\nThe pipeline involves multiple heavyweight components, including object detection, depth estimation, scene graph construction, subgraph matching, VLM-based code generation, and RAG retrieval. The end-to-end latency, including all perception modules, is likely to exceed acceptable limits for real-time autonomous driving (typically 100–200 ms), even if the planning module alone reports low latency.\n\nThe eight failure patterns are derived through clustering followed by human summarization. This process is inherently subjective, and it is unclear whether these patterns are comprehensive, mutually exclusive, or consistently identifiable—especially ambiguous ones like “overreaction to signs”.\n\nThe framework does not address how the failure-case database would be updated online or how it would handle multi-agent interactions.\n\nThe evaluation is limited to the ROADWork dataset. Broader validation on other benchmarks  nuPlan/Waymo) would better demonstrate generalizability beyond work zones. (Given that it is difficult in daily life to navigate solely through work zones, it would be highly unreasonable for this model to incur such significant computational overhead merely for work zone interactions. It should demonstrate strong generalisability.)\n\nThe dataset does not systematically include challenging conditions such as extreme weather or nighttime scenes, which are critical for assessing robustness.\n\nFrom the perspectives of academic rigour and industrial deployment, it introduces excessive complexity and potential points of failure. The authors should reconsider the high-risk design of \"run-time code generation\". A more robust alternative would be to utilise cases retrieved via RAG to directly generate parameters for high-level semantic objectives or cost functions. These parameters could then be processed by a rigorously validated, deterministic optimiser to generate the final trajectory. This approach would incorporate VLM's semantic comprehension capabilities while ensuring the safety and reliability of the planning process.\n\nIn summary, while the paper addresses a relevant problem and presents a novel idea, fundamental concerns regarding the safety of the runtime code generation and the insufficient empirical validation prevent it from meeting the acceptance bar for ICLR in its current form. Significant additions to the experimental evaluation and a thorough reconsideration of the core planning paradigm are required."}, "questions": {"value": "See the Weaknesses section"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5Gx0TJWyza", "forum": "iuSOOkPxSm", "replyto": "iuSOOkPxSm", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9191/Reviewer_bZho"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9191/Reviewer_bZho"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9191/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761992884383, "cdate": 1761992884383, "tmdate": 1762920861116, "mdate": 1762920861116, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
