This paper challenges that view by proposing a direct framework to model the scaling of downstream accuracy from the training budget. We demonstrate that for a fixed token-to-parameter ratio, a simple two-parameter scaling law accurately describes this relationship. Our findings are validated by experiments on models with up to 17B parameters trained on up to 350B tokens, showing that downstream capabilities scaling can be described using a scaling law. Furthermore, we extend this framework to extrapolate and predict accuracy of target model with up to 6.7x larger training budget based on a set of smaller experiments. We will release a complete list of model losses and downstream evaluation results at various different scales to support reproducibility and encourage future research.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Downstream Metrics", "Pretraining", "Evaluation", "Benchmarks", "LLM"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/28481c66a028f7bb8945176d1ad4d11a05b21204.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper investigates the power of scaling laws in language models to directly predict downstream performance from models' parameter count and dataset size.

The authors mentioned that they used optimizer setup from [1] as well as  $\\mu P$ for hyperparameter transfer but they don't mention any hyperparameter tuning or at least their motivation to use specific hyperparameters.\n- In [2] authors note that it's hard to predict single benchmark performance with their two-stage approach reliably while the average across 17 benchmarks can be predicted quite well. Using the one-stage approach described here, can the average of multiple downstream task accuracies be reliably predicted?\n- In two-stage approaches (Fig. 7) what specific proxy metric was used?\n- In table 9, we see high $R^2$ and RMSE for different proxies and downstream tasks, which should prove that all proxy metrics are strong predictors for downstream performance, while in the Fig. 7, fits with higher RMSE and $R^2$ do not necessarily have the best predictive power (e.g. in Fig. 7a BNSL has higher $R^2$ and RMSE than TwoStage-Logistic and yet TwoStage-Logistic has lower MAE and MRE on held-out points).  So does the statement *\"most proxy metrics demonstrate strong predictive power for downstream task performance\"* still hold?\n- Why modelling downstream performance without irreducible error? In principle, yes it is possible to have 100% accuracy on a downstream task, however, in practice it is known that the real benchmark data can have ill-posed, mislabeled or ambiguous questions [3].\n\n\n### References\n\n1.

What do you think about applying the scaling law fits to predict a single aggregated metric, such as the average downstream accuracy across a broad set of tasks? Scaling laws are often used to understand and guide the training of generalist models that need to perform well across many tasks. Would your proposed fits extend to that setting, and how would you think about aggregating or weighting the different task metrics?\n2. The scaling law fits for all benchmarks in the paper look very good, and I appreciate the mention of cases where non-monotonic behavior makes direct fitting difficult. I’m curious to know in what other situations this direct fitting approach might fail beyond the ones you’ve already discussed.
