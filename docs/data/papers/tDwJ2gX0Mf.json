These graphs are typically sparse to reduce the cost of geometric verification required for each candidate edge. In this paper, we focus on robust pose graph initialization, performed at the very beginning of the SfM pipeline. Traditionally, this step relies on image retrieval methods applied independently to each image, connecting it to the $k$ most similar ones according to, e.g., embedding similarity. While effective in practice, this greedy approach does not allow communication across image pairs during graph construction. We address this limitation through the novel concept of edge prioritization, which ranks edges by their utility for SfM. We achieve this through the following two contributions. First, we propose an image representation network combined with a graph neural network (GNN), trained with SfM-derived supervision to predict edge ranks. The GNN exploits global context from the entire image set to guide pair selection. Second, we introduce an edge selection strategy based on minimum spanning trees, which uses predicted ranks to identify the most promising pairs. By integrating global information at both stages, our approach substantially improves SfM reconstruction in the high-speed regime, particularly when operating with very sparse pose graphs.

While retrieval backbones (CosPlace, AnyLoc, DINOv2-SALAD, MegaLoc) are compared as sources of scores, it remains unclear how the proposed global ranker stacks up against pairwise overlap predictors / re-rankers explicitly designed to suppress non-matchable pairs before verification (e.g., overlap-based voting or pairwise matchability models). The related-work section cites such directions (e.g., VOP/overlap prediction), but end-to-end comparisons at graph-building time are limited.\n- Dependence on backbones. The best results use MegaLoc (DINOv2 + SALAD) features. Although the method is backbone-agnostic in principle, the practical gains may attenuate under lighter encoders; the ablation with SALAD suggests some degradation. A more systematic latency/accuracy trade-off across encoders would be valuable.\n- High-speed / Sparse Regime. The paper highlights improvements under budget-limited, very sparse pose-graph initialization, instantiated by varying the number of MSTs k. Using k as a proxy conflates sparsity with compute/time budgets and lacks a standardized, method-agnostic definition; as a result, cross-method fairness and external validity remain unclear.\n- Policy & disclosure nit. Appendix notes that “LLMs were used for polishing the text,” which is fine as disclosure, but ICLR typically expects clarity on what content (if any) was machine-generated and whether any evaluation artifacts were affected (they were not, per the paper).

The weight uses 𝑤𝑖𝑗=1−𝑟𝑖𝑗. How sensitive is MST construction to monotone transforms of 𝑟𝑖𝑗? Have you considered pairwise uncertainty (e.g., predictive variance) to down-weight brittle edges during tree construction? \n- Broader baselines at the construction stage. Could you include overlap-prediction / matchability baselines that re-score candidate pairs prior to RANSAC, run under the same MST framework (i.e., replace 𝑟𝑖𝑗)? This would disentangle benefits from (a) global reasoning and (b) MST selection itself. \n- Runtime composition.

Yes, $u_{ij}$ & $v_{ij}$ are available using prior SfM methods on the standard dataset, but then those become the effective \"ground truth\", which will define an upper-bound on performance, won't they?\n- Equations 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 define the components of the Graph Neural Networks used in this work. I certainly want to know the motivation and intuition behind these designs. Neural networks are black-boxes by themselves; the best we can do in practice is to explain the choices made and establish them using appropriate evaluations of the chosen parameters through ablations. This work falls short on that count and appears ad-hoc overall.\n- Cosine similarity is all that is used by traditional methods (L188). In L197, $f_l$ uses the individual embeddings and their cosine as input. How does this add to the traditional method?\n- How did the dimnesonality of 256 come for $e_{ij}$? What is the dimensionality of the embeddings $d_i$?\n- Does $f_{MLP}$ directly predict the edge rank $r_{ij}$ as given in Eq 6, with lower numbers representing better matches?\n- For $r_{ij}$ given in Eq 9, it would seem higher is better (more inliers is good) which will be like an edge-score and not an edge--rank. Is there some confusion here, which may be just notational? Particularly in the light of the para in L240-242.\n- The loss used is not clear to me. What is $\\hat{r}_i$ in Eq 10? Is it computed by sorting r values from Eq 9?\n- IDCG iis computed from ground truth ranking, using  $r_i$ in place of  $\\hat{r}_i$, if I understand correctly. However, $v_i$ and $r_i$ are related. That would make IDCG a constant, won't it? Is that the intention?\n- Eq 11 will suggest higher the better for $r_{ij}$ as MST uses minimum of $w_{ij}$. Is that correct?\n- Use of Multiple MSTs: If I get it right, Xiao (2021) and Gan (2024) also used them. The novelty of this work is in using them with learned signals. Why is this so significant (L293)?\n- Is it true that the multi-MST approach guarantees k disjoint paths? Later MSTs may involve the infinite weight edges given non-dense connectivity, won't they? What is the impact of that?\n- The use of graph clustering is mentioned (L295). What is its impact? Does the procedure need to construe the $n^2$ graph first before partitioning? Do they need all $e_{ij}$ values?\n- Fig 3: Unfortunately, I don't see a clear win for the proposed method over the SOTA. Performance seems adequate at k=3 also. Results here are mixed at best.
