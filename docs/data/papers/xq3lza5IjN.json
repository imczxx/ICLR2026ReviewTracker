Weight pruning is an efficient model compression technique that can reduce model size without retraining LLMs. However, due to the massive number of parameters, it is infeasible to estimate the importance of weights globally, and most prior studies assign a uniform sparsity ratio across all layers. Recent findings reveal that layers contribute unevenly to LLM performance, making it necessary to investigate Layer-wise importance. Existing Layer-wise sparsity allocation methods, such as OWL and DLP, rely on weight scoring and carefully designed score proxies to estimate Layer-wise importance and sparsity ratios, while enforcing identical sparsity to blocks and projection weights within a layer to avoid performance degradation. In this work, we propose Layer-wise Sparsity Allocation (LSA) for LLM pruning, which quantifies Layer-wise importance by evaluating the minimal linear reconstruction error (LSE) of each transformer layer under the assumption that 50\\% of its least important weights are removed. Moreover, our method supports non-uniform sparsity allocation at block- or projection-level granularity within layers, without incurring catastrophic performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that LSA maintains high performance at high sparsity levels. At an overall sparsity ratio of 70\\%, LSA surpasses state-of-the-art methods across language modeling tasks and seven zero-shot tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Layer-wise Sparsity Allocation", "Large Language Model Pruning", "Linear Reconstruction Error"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/545709f919ec90141daaa3a617a3120113b76584.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Layer-wise Sparsity Allocation (LSA), a new method for pruning large language models by measuring layer importance via minimal linear reconstruction error (LRE) rather than relying on heuristic weight scores such as those used in Wanda, OWL, or DLP.

The proposed LRE offers a novel perspective for measuring layer importance. However, the paper lacks a thorough comparison or discussion of how LRE relates to previously established metrics, such as Hessian-based saliency or gradient magnitude. It would strengthen the work to analyze potential correlations between LRE and these existing indicators, clarifying whether LRE captures complementary or more comprehensive information. Furthermore, while the empirical performance of LRE-based pruning is impressive, the underlying intuition and theoretical motivation behind why LRE serves as a better proxy for layer importance remain insufficiently explained.\n\n2. It is great to see that the paper includes experiments on structured pruning and N:M sparsity. However, these results would be more convincing if they also included comparisons with existing layer-wise sparsity allocation methods such as OWL and DLP, to better contextualize the advantages of LSA in structured settings.\n\n3. The authors claim that the sparsity ratio $p$ used to compute the linear reconstruction error is not a sensitive hyperparameter. However, the provided evidence is limited to models of similar size and within the same family.

It follows traditional methods to compute the layer importance first and then allocate the sparsity for each layer according to the importance. The framework is very similar to previous works such as DLP, including the importance score and the sparsity allocation range between [pr - $\\beta$, pr + $\\beta$].  Some detailed part may be different, but the framework and other parts are similar to provious works. The technical contribution may be limited. \n\nThe experimental results with detailed baseline comparsion mainly focus on 70% sparsity. The results of other sparsity are very rare, and other sparsity does not have baseline results. It is better to compare with baselines under different sparsity ratios to demonstrate the general performance, not only under 70% sparsity. \n\nIt mentions to be more efficient. It is better to provide more detailed analysis about the efficiency such as complexity comparison. It is hard to see why it is more efficient, more discussions with detailed complexity demonstration can enhance this part. \n\nIn the experiemnts, the improvements seem to be marginal. The performance is very close to DLP with a very small gap. Some results are different from the original DLP paper. For example, in table 5, for sparsegpt on Llama2 7B, it reports LSA with PPL 18.63 and DLP with 18.68 PPL.  The gap is very small. And in the original DLP paper, the PPL is 18.58 under the same configuration, which is better than 18.63.  Different runs may lead to different results with small variantions. The current gap is minor, and another run may change the result leading to a better baseline. The appendix also shows that in many cases, the baselines can outperform the proposed method. The  experimental improvements  seem to be marginal, and it does not seem to be significantly better than baselines. \n\nThere are some other methods which also investigate the sparsity allocation for different layers, such as [R1,R2]. It is better to discuss the comparison with more baselines. \n\nSparseGPT and wanda are basic llm pruning methods. There are more advanced pruning methods such as [R3], which can outperform SparseGPT with large margins under uniform sparsity. It is better to combine the proposed method with more advanced pruning methods to demonstrate the advantages. \n\n[R1] Discovering Sparsity Allocation for Layer-wise Pruning of Large Language Models\n\n[R2] Adaptive Layer Sparsity for Large Language Models via Activation Correlation Assessment\n\n[R3] Fast and Effective Weight Update for Pruned Large Language Models"}, "questions": {"value": "See the weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "SaV4HjhZBP", "forum": "xq3lza5IjN", "replyto": "xq3lza5IjN", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10328/Reviewer_SSxf"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10328/Reviewer_SSxf"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10328/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761599382125, "cdate": 1761599382125, "tmdate": 1762921665463, "mdate": 1762921665463, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes LSA (Layer-wise Sparsity Allocation), a novel method for pruning large language models (LLMs) that quantifies layer-wise importance by evaluating the minimal linear reconstruction error (LRE) under the assumption of removing 50% of the least important weights.
