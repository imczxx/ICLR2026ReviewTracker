While DPO effectively preserves the relative ordering between chosen and rejected responses through pairwise ranking losses, it often neglects absolute reward magnitudes. This oversight can decrease the likelihood of chosen responses and increase the risk of generating out-of-distribution responses, leading to poor performance. We term this issue Degraded Chosen Responses (DCR).To address this issue, we propose Balanced Preference Optimization (BPO), a novel framework that dynamically balances the optimization of chosen and rejected responses through two key components: balanced reward margin and gap adaptor. Unlike previous methods, BPO can fundamentally resolve DPO's DCR issue, without introducing additional constraints to the loss function. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning tasks show that BPO significantly outperforms DPO, improving accuracy by +10.1% with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and +11.7% with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. It also surpasses DPO variants by +3.6% over IPO , +5.0% over SLiC, and +3.1% over Cal-DPO on the same model. Remarkably, our algorithm requires only a single line of code modification, making it simple to implement and fully compatible with existing DPO-based frameworks.", "tldr": "Enhance preference modeling for direct preference optimization by dynamically balancing the optimization of chosen and rejected responses", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Direct Preference Optimization"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/31993d2eadba66479ca1822bf551ca2042ff0d1e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "One common phenomenon with DPO is the decreasing likelihood of preferred responses and this work aims to address this.

DPO is also most widely applied to human preference data such as HH-RLHF or UltraFeedback, so it is unclear whether BPO would lead to improvements for more common applications of DPO. An evaluation of the methods on such preference data would make the contributions stronger. \n\nTechnical Details- The work claims that BPO leads to accelerated convergence and reduced computational overhead. However, there is not strong support for either of these claims. It is unclear based on the reward dynamics shown or the analysis that there is faster convergence in practice, especially as in Figure 7, multiple of the DPO curves appear to have rewards plateau before the corresponding BPO curves. Regarding computational overhead, since a comparison of the rewards for the two responses is needed to compute the loss and gradient, the computational graph and activations for both responses need to be stored. Due to this and the fact that the selection of the min does not affect the memory needed to compute a backward pass, the computational cost should not significantly change. Parts describing the key advantages of BPO should be revised or provide concrete support for these claims. \n\nRelated Works - The work should discuss [1] which theoretically analyzes the decrease in response likelihoods and how embedding structure influences this. \n\n[1] Razin, Noam, et al. \"Unintentional unalignment: Likelihood displacement in direct preference optimization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.08847 (2024)."}, "questions": {"value": "- Can you provide clarification on the accelerated convergence and reduced computational overhead?\n- Can you provide results on how BPO behaves on common preference data settings, such as instruction-following?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "iyj1vIV0Z3", "forum": "b97EwMUWu7", "replyto": "b97EwMUWu7", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11430/Reviewer_2Cgr"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11430/Reviewer_2Cgr"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11430/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761854914675, "cdate": 1761854914675, "tmdate": 1762922546283, "mdate": 1762922546283, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, authors proposes a simple one-line modification to DPO using $min(r_w, - \\alpha r_l)$ instead of their difference to balance chosen/rejected response optimization.

The paper therefore lacks comparisons with key strong baselines, like SimPO or KTO or ODPO or BDPO or ORPO, some of which tackles the diminishing log prob of chosen samples as a problem. Only Vanilla DPO is not a reasonable baseline, obviously this is going to perform better than DPO. The authors must compare performance with SOTA right now that constitutes improvement over the main DPO algorithm and not restrict themselves to just the algorithms that are in this space. While I commend that the authors compare BPO with Cal-DPO and DPOP, I strongly feel this algorithm needs to be compared to the other SOTA to show the efficacy. Note: I am not asking the authors to do comparison with GRPO/GSPO type algorithms, but only with the direct preference type algorithms.\n\n2. Results lack confidence intervals and significance testing, making improvement claims difficult to validate.Please add them and mention the seeds. \n\n3. The authors claim that the BPO has superior capacity to navigate complex reasoning landscapes which is a strawman argument. It is unclear why, there is no intuition in the paper. At its base DPO type algorithms even for reasoning tasks would need to have a chosen vs a rejected reasoning trace perhaps during training, so it is not intuitive how this has superior performance compared to other pseudo RL algorithms like GRPO/GSPO equivalents.\n\n4. Further it seems performance of BPO seems sensitive to the variation of $\\alpha$ and loss as well. Its a bit difficult to understand what value to choose, its interplay with beta and the learning rate etc. \n\n5. The authors have only provided benchmarks on mathematical tasks for some reason. It is unclear what this simple change does to the model’s performance on other types of tasks.  \n\n6. Why do the authors think the AIME24 score went down between Qwen 2.5 math 7b instruction model compared to base for BPO? That is highly counterintuitive. \n\n7.
