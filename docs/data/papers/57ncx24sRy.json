Existing computational approaches are limited by their inability to jointly model the heterogeneous mechanisms underlying DDIs, which span molecular structure, pharmacodynamic function, and network-mediated relations. To address this limitation, we introduce \\texttt{M$^{2}$DDI}, a unified framework for dynamic multimodal fusion in DDI prediction. \\texttt{M$^{2}$DDI} utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, with each expert dedicated to a distinct pharmacological modality. A novel prior-enhanced dual-path gating strategy adaptively selects relevant experts for each drug pair by integrating mechanism-matched feature queries and ATC-based biomedical priors, thereby aligning expert selection with underlying pharmacological mechanisms and addressing the challenge of data incompleteness. Empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that \\texttt{M$^{2}$DDI} achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in new drug scenarios. Additional robustness experiments show that \\texttt{M$^{2}$DDI} maintains high predictive accuracy even when modality-specific information is partially missing, outperforming existing methods under similar conditions. Analysis of expert selection patterns further confirms alignment with established pharmacological mechanisms. These results establish \\texttt{M$^{2}$DDI} as an effective and mechanism-aware solution for comprehensive DDI prediction.

The proposed strategy is to synergize a heterogeneous expert pool and a prior-enhanced dual-path gating strategy for expert selection, which is similar to multi-head cross-attention mechanism where each head could be considered an expert attending to different aspects of the drug pair.\n- A prior-enhanced dual-path gating mechanism is designed to activate the top-K most relevant experts from a heterogeneous pool, and to dynamically decide which experts are relevant for a given input and how to weight their contributions. In the experiments, four structural experts, four functional experts, and one relational expert were configured while K was set-up to five for each prediction. Obviously, the number of relational experts insufficient and the rationale to determine K=5 is not discussed. Was this value empirically validated? An ablation study showing performance vs. different K values is essential.\n- The paper claims to align expert selection with underlying pharmacological mechanisms. How are these mechanisms formally defined and mapped to the proposed modalities (structural, functional, relational)? Is there a many-to-many relationship between mechanisms and modalities?\n- This paper would be strengthed by comparing graph-based fusion strategies instead of early vs. late fusion. The claim of dynamic multimodal fusion needs a more precise definition in the context of prior work.\n- What are the two distinct paths in the gating network? Is one path processing the raw drug-pair features and the other processing the ATC-code priors? How are their outputs combined (e.g., additive, multiplicative, concatenated) to produce the final gating weights? How is the ATC-based prior knowledge represented and integrated? Is it a simple embedding lookup, or is there a more complex encoding process?\n- Does the performance of M^2DDI degrade gracefully, and is the gating network's behavior interpretable when a key modality is missing (e.g., does it successfully re-weight its reliance to the available experts)?\n- The M^2DDI method proposed in this paper overlaps to some extent with the Multimodal Feature Optimal Fusion Drug Interaction Prediction (MOF-DDI) method [1], which integrates features from multiple data sources to predict drug interactions. Specifically, the MOF-DDI model comprehensively considers literature descriptions of drug interactions, biomedical knowledge graphs, and drug molecular structures to predict drug-drug interactions.\n\n[1] Wen, Q., Li, J., Zhang, C. and Ye, Y., 2023, October.

The paper compares Static Fusion and Ensemble as multimodal fusion approaches, but why not consider a more direct and computationally cheaper method? Specifically, obtaining embeddings from three modalities, learning a weight for each modality through an MLP, and then fusing them directly for prediction? This is important because M2DDI's improvement over Ensemble appears quite limited (S0: Ensemble 97.58 → 97.82; S2: Ensemble 46.45 → 46.49).\n\n2. In the ablation study shown in Figure 3, can the authors provide the Accuracy results? From Table 2, the improvements in Accuracy are marginal (S0: EmerGNN 97.42, Ensemble 97.58 → 97.82; S2: EmerGNN 46.34, Ensemble 46.45 → 46.49).\n\n3.

However, why does the structure-based baseline \"MLP\" exhibit the steepest performance degradation? Moreover, it would be more convincing to include additional graph-based baselines in this robustness evaluation.\n\n4.

More importantly, I am interested in understanding the expert selection dynamics during training. Are the scores of different experts often close to each other? Does the model always tend to select the same fixed set of k (5) experts, or does the selection vary significantly across different drug pairs?
