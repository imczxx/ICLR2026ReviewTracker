Explaining Neurons Activated by Absent Concepts", "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to provide human-interpretable insights into the behavior of deep neural networks (DNNs), typically by estimating a simplified causal structure of the model. In existing work, this causal structure most often includes relationships where the presence of an input pattern or latent feature is associated with a strong activation of a neuron. For example, attribution methods identify input pixels that contribute most to a prediction, and feature visualization methods reveal inputs that cause high activation of a target neuron — both implicitly assuming that neurons encode the presence of concepts. However, a largely overlooked type of causal relationship is that of *encoded absences*, where the absence of a concept increases activation, or vice versa, the presence of a concept inhibits activation. In this work, we show that such inhibitory relationships are common and that standard XAI methods fail to reveal them. To address this, we propose two extensions to attribution and feature visualization techniques that uncover encoded absences. Across experiments, we show that standard XAI methods fail to explain encoded absences, illustrate how they can be revealed, how ImageNet models exploit them, and that debiasing can be improved when considering them.", "tldr": "Some concepts are absent from the input yet still influence the output, and current XAI methods cannot account for such encoded absences.", "keywords": ["Deep Learning", "Explainable Artificial Intelligence", "Computer Vision"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f52cb2f31a94c8cb3a81e5cbe3fb8aa24ff5967e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/27104105e4fea4858edc1dbbe8ff590a00598934.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper argues that the common XAI approach assumes that neurons activate for current concepts and largely ignores neurons whose activation increases when a concept is absent.

In this reviewer's opinion, the clear, causal definition of “encoded absence” and framing of absences as first-class explanatory objects, not merely negative saliency, represent a contribution as it reframes minimization and multi-class saliency as tools for surfacing inhibitory evidence rather than merely as technical variants.\n\n2. I should also state that I found the \"mechanistic demonstrations\" to be useful rather than cosmetic. For example, in Figure 3, we see that a Hassenstein–Reichardt-style toy is implemented, where the first output unit encodes the absence of right-to-left motion; established target attributions and max-patch visualization fail there, while the proposed non-target attribution and minimization succeed. The green-pixel toy then shows a learned unit with positive weights to red/blue and negative to green, cleanly matching the “encoded absence” construction.\n\n3.

The connection between negative evidence to encoded absence is not fully causal. Non-target negative attributions on out-of-class inputs conflate many forms of anti-evidence. The draft paper sketches a causal definition (see definition 2.1, referenced around the non-target discussion). However,  the experiments rarely isolate just the hypothesized concept while holding all else constant. The authors may want to explore the issue further. Controlled counterfactuals may be useful in that regard. Just one suggestion, although other options may be more useful.\n\n2. The ImageNet “least-activating patch insertion” result risks a distribution shift. Corners and copy-paste borders can depress activations for the wrong reasons.  In my view, copying and pasting “least-activating” patches into corners could introduce artifacts, such as edges and texture breaks. The strong suppression may partly be from low-level off-manifold cues rather than true concept absence encoding. It's not clear in the current draft.\n\n3.

For example, the notion of **negative features**—or features contributing against a prediction—has been addressed in approaches such as **Shapley values** [1]. Furthermore, the idea of leveraging the **entire dataset** to obtain a global understanding of both positive and negative influences aligns with the concepts of **prototypes and criticisms** introduced by Kim et al [2]. (2016).  I do see the value in incorporating information from **other classes** to explain the **absence of features** in the target class; however, I feel this idea could potentially be **explored using existing techniques**.\n\n- Experiment's motivation: The purpose of the experiment in **Section 5.3**, particularly the use of a **minimization patch**, is not entirely clear. It seems expected that such a patch would decrease the activationas you specifically chose to include a patch that minimizes activation. Was this measured at the **last layer**? Additionally, it would be interesting to test the opposite case: what happens if you insert a highly activating patch (e.g., replacing the Border Collie’s snout with that of a Leonberger)?\n\n- Experimet’s methodology: The examples in **Figure 6** appear to have been selected a monosemantic subset of patches based on **visual similarity**, which is inherently qualitative. Was there any **systematic human evaluation** to support this categorization? Moreover, it could be insightful to **classify these patches individually** to examine whether they carry recognizable semantic meaning for the network—this could make the conclusions more robust.\n\n- Discussion: Regarding **Figure 6**, were the channels shown important only for this specific class? If so, how does the **polymorphism of channels** (i.e., channels being important for multiple classes) affect the analysis? Clarifying this would strengthen the interpretation.\n\n[1] Lundberg, S.

For the extensions, as the authors noted, the algorithms are unchanged. Therefore, there is not enough contribution in the paper to support publication. More details are provided below:\n   - At the conceptual level, the concept of **encoded absence in activations and neurons has already been extensively studied**. The authors attempt to distinguish their approach from counterfactuals by stating that *“our approach is applied on a neuron level allowing for a mechanistic understanding”* However, encoded absence has already been examined in the context of neuron explanations. For example, previous work (Mu et al [1]) explicitly includes the NOT operator in neuron explanations, and compositional explanations reflect the absence of certain concepts. The class of compositional explanations has been widely explored and extended in the literature. The same is true for the property of *“whose absence causes high activations, or vice versa, whose presence strongly suppresses the activation of a specific internal”* These properties have been demonstrated in several works (e.g., [2, 3]), so sections 2.1 and 2.2 do not represent novelty at the conceptual level. Note that the lack of acknowledge of this area of work induced authors to **several overclaims** over the text about proofs related to this phenomenon.\n   - Both the **proposed extensions have also been previously introduced and widely studied in the literature**. The minimization objective for feature visualization is a well-known method, **as even acknowledged by the authors**. The same applies to feature attribution, where similar mechanisms have been used and proposed before. The authors argue that *”while these methods share the same underlying algorithms, their intent and interpretive framing differ fundamentally”*. From the reviewer’s perspective, this is not enough to substantiate a contribution. In fact, the proposed “interpretative framing” is tied to the concept of absence, which is itself not novel, as previously described.\n   - To the best of my knowledge, the only novel application appears in the debiasing experiments (but I could be wrong). However, the paper’s narrative revolves around neurons and the concept of absence in general, which is not novel. The debiasing section is not presented as a main contribution and comprises only a small part of the experiments. \n\nBased on this analysis, this is the paper’s main issue, which cannot be resolved without a complete change of narrative. Other concerns are related to the following areas:\n\n- **Missing details and structure**: Several details are missing in the main text (and the appendix does not clarify them). For example, how are non-target attributions computed at the mathematical level? Is it just a visual comparison of the same sample but with attributions to different classes (as seems to be the case from the code), or is there a mathematical process to select specific samples from other classes for the explanations? How are these samples selected? Is it just a visual combination over the full dataset?\n\n- **Overgeneralized statements**: There are several broad statements such as *“standard XAI methods fail to explain encoded absence”* that are vague and inaccurate. The authors discuss a few methods in section 4, highlighting their weaknesses with respect to encoded absence. However, the list is not exhaustive, and from a scientific perspective, listing all the methods that do not address a phenomenon is not informative. It would have been more useful to discuss methods similar to (or approaching) the proposed approaches and the differences among them. The current list omits several relevant works and includes some odd citations. For example, self-explainable DNNs are included but not relevant in later sections or experiments, and some relevant references (e.g., [4], which addresses reasoning like “this does not look like that,” and supports encoded absence) are excluded. This also applies to work on neuronal explanations mentioned earlier. Listing just one or two examples per class is not sufficiently informative and cannot justify claims such as “standard XAI methods”.\n\n[1] Mu, Jesse, and Jacob Andreas. \"Compositional explanations of neurons.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 17153-17163.\n\n[2] La Rosa, Biagio, Leilani Gilpin, and Roberto Capobianco. \"Towards a fuller understanding of neurons with clustered compositional explanations.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2023): 70333-70354.\n\n[3] Oikarinen, Tuomas, and Tsui-Wei Weng. \"Linear explanations for individual neurons.\" Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning. 2024.\n\n[4] G.
