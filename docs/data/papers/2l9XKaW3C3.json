Finding some refinements of the Nash equilibrium is important because the Nash equilibrium may take sub-optimal actions in states that can not be reached in equilibrium. In this work, we improve the framework of the counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) algorithm, proving that our algorithm can converge to the refinements of the Nash equilibrium under some assumptions. The extensive-form perfect equilibrium (EFPE) and the sequential equilibrium (SE) are two refinements of the Nash equilibrium, they improve on this shortcoming of the Nash equilibrium by assuming that players make mistakes. Most current sequential equilibrium and extensive-form perfect equilibrium computing algorithms are not iterative algorithms and need to solve linear programs, which are ineffective on large-scale games. Our method gives a local perturbation in all the states in the game and gives a suitable perturbation descent method. We compare our Sequential Perturbed Counterfactual Regret Minimization (SPCFR) algorithm with CFR variants and the approximate EFPE computing algorithm, perturbed CFR. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing CFR-based methods on popular games, including Kuhn Poker, Leduc Hold'em, and GoofSpiel.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Computer Games", "sequential equilibrium", "CFR", "algorithmic game theory"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/709ec236a498332fb7bb49a3531bf226112843d5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces the Sequential Perturbed Counterfactual Regret Minimization (SPCFR) algorithm, an iterative algorithm designed to compute refinements of the Nash Equilibrium (NE), specifically the Sequential Equilibrium (SE), in two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games.

The front matter (Introduction, Related Work, Preliminaries) feels disproportionately long for a 9-page submission—the paper does not present its core contribution until the end of page 5. It would help to surface the main ideas earlier (e.g., add a brief Motivation section) and consider moving parts of Related Work to the appendix.\n2. The figures need substantial improvement. \n  - In Figs. 1–2, text is too small, and the lines in Fig. 2 lack clarity. \n  - Using a log scale for the top row in Fig. 1 could make trends clearer. \n  - In Fig. 1, “Goofspiel” appears inconsistently (capitalization) and I am unsure what the “3” in the title denotes.\n  - The sharp jumps in the Leduc plot (especially the lower-right panel of Fig. 1) likely indicate an implementation issue; this deserves investigation rather than being described as mere “fluctuation.” \n  - In addition, the parameters “$a$” and “$b$” for SPCFR are not explained in the text (they only appear in Algorithm 1).\n3. I do not fully understand the necessity of fixing the functional form $\\delta_T(I)=\\frac{1}{a+b\\,Q(I)}$. Theoretically, $\\delta_T(I)$ only needs to be sufficiently small; a simpler or smaller schedule might suffice. Also, if the pseudocode is literal, then $Q(I)$ may change across different nodes within the same infoset in single iteration, implying $\\delta_T(I)$ is not consistent within that iteration—please clarify whether this is intended.\n4. The paper mentions Liar’s Dice (line 435) but does not include it in the experimental evaluation.\n5. The experimental scope is relatively limited (which may be due to hardware or the full-traversal design). It would help to state explicitly in the main text why only a small set of environments is used, or to scale up (e.g., larger-deck Kuhn/Leduc/Goofspiel). Including more recent baselines such as PCFR [1] would also strengthen the comparisons.\n6. The presentation could be more intuitive. Since the target equilibrium accounts for dominated strategies, it would be informative to show a case study—for example, in Leduc—where a player deviates into an off-path/dominated strategy and compare SPCFR’s response to CFR/DCFR.\n\n---\n\n[1] Farina G, Kroer C, Sandholm T.

The main claim of the paper is that SPCFR is an effective iterative method for computing SE. However, the experiments primarily compare against algorithms that compute NE (CFR, CFR+, DCFR). The most critical comparison would be against other iterative algorithms that aim for equilibrium refinements, such as the OOMD-based approach by Bernasconi et al. (2024) mentioned in the related work. Without this, it is difficult to assess the practical advantages of SPCFR over the state-of-the-art in this specific subfield. The comparison in Figure 2 is against a \"perturbed CFR\", but this seems to be a baseline implemented by the authors rather than a well-established algorithm from prior work.\n \n2. The motivation for an iterative approach to SE is its potential scalability to large games where methods based on solving linear programs are infeasible. However, the experiments are conducted on very small benchmark games (Kuhn Poker, Leduc Hold'em, 3-card GoofSpiel). These games are not large enough to convincingly demonstrate the scalability and practical necessity of the proposed algorithm. A stronger case would be made by evaluating SPCFR on a game that is known to be challenging for non-iterative solvers.\n\n3. Clarity on Theoretical Assumptions: Theorem 2 provides a necessary and sufficient condition for convergence that requires the cumulative reach probability of every node h to tend to infinity. This is a very strong condition. It is not immediately obvious how the proposed perturbation schedule guarantees this for nodes that are deep in the tree or are only reachable via multiple \"mistakes\". A more detailed discussion of how this assumption is met in practice would strengthen the paper."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Could you discuss the feasibility of applying SPCFR to a larger game, and why such an experiment was not included in the current version?\n\n3.
