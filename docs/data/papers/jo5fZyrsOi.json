Pruning mitigates this challenge by removing unimportant parameters, yet conventional post-training pruning and reset-to-initial sparse training approaches incur high retraining costs or degrade performance on large models. To improve stability, prior post-training work suggests rewinding weights to intermediate checkpoints, though at the expense of costly offline analysis. We propose GDSTAR, a Gradient-based Dynamic Sparse Training framework with Adaptive Rewinding that supports models of different sizes and complexities without offline retraining. During training, GDSTAR (1) dynamically identifies stable rewind points using the Frobenius norm of gradients, (2) selects weights for pruning using accumulated gradient magnitudes, and (3) ensures stable optimization using a controlled pruning rate with exponential decay. Experiments across diverse DNNs and datasets show the efficiency and scalability of GDSTAR, which achieves up to 96% sparsity while maintaining accuracy, with only a 0.94% average drop compared to dense models. Compared to the state-of-the-art sparse training approach, GDSTAR improves accuracy by an average of 0.72% (up to 2.13%), under the same sparsity ratios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Dynamic Sparse Training", "Adaptive Rewinding", "Efficient Deep Learning", "Pruning", "and Scalability"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d6efe3ccaaa442575d9822bddc6bae6a7779b642.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d8dd820a8afa31dd23fcee95b083176e0e4df179.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces GDSTAR (Gradient-based Dynamic Sparse Training with Adaptive Rewinding), a sparse training framework that dynamically identifies optimal rewind points and prunes unimportant weights during training.

Existing DST methods do not require or use weight rewinding, while demonstrating better sparsity and generalization results than the authors present on larger models and datasets.\n* The background cites none of the predominant dynamic sparse training work over the last 5 years, never mind the SOTA work from within the last year. For example, Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), Rigging the Lottery Ticket (RigL), MEST, Gradual Magnitude Pruning . The mainly cited paper (McDanel et al) is an arxiv preprint from 2022 that appears to have not been published anywhere, and outlines a pruning (not sparse training) method.\n* The paper relies on evaluation on only tiny toy datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10), and in the case of CIFAR-10, completely inappropriate and over-parameterized models for CIFAR-10 (VGG-19, ResNet-34 and ResNet50. Even in this setting the results do not achieve as high a sparsity or generalization on CIFAR-10 as demonstrated by existing DST methods (e.g. SET/RigL).\n* On the only part of the paper I believe is anywhere near a novel and interesting contribution, online weight rewinding, the authors compare their online weight rewinding method - i.e. choosing weights from an iteration k - and compare those to the baselines of random initialization (k=0) and dense training (full training). A proper evaluation would compare with the exhaustive weight rewinding of LTH the authors motivate their work with. Using any weight rewinding (i.e. k>0) is going to surpass the generalization of k=0 trivially.\n\nI can understand missing one or two citations, or coming from a different research community and being unaware of SOTA papers.
