It uses terms which I would not consider as common knowledge such as “shared concept memory” and some misleading phrases such as “The representation, therefore, can stably identify and track 3D trajectories”---reading this I would assume the representation operates on sequences of images (i.e., videos) but it is a multi-view image representation if I am not mistaken. I suggest making the abstract more “abstract” to appeal to the general reader.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe two key challenges presented in the introduction for “fully utilizing object-centric representations” (lines 52-53) should be backed-up by citations or by results in this work but these are not referenced. This paragraph reads more like—“these two aspects of our method are what is missing”---but the challenges and their causes are not clearly described.\n\n**Assumptions and Limitations**\n\n*Agent and background masks*: this assumption makes the overall method no longer unsupervised. That in itself is not a problem but could introduce a limitation which stems from reliance on humans to e.g., define what is considered the “background” as opposed to being learned from data. It seems that the method strongly relies on the assumption that these masks can be obtained with high fidelity which may make the overall pipeline brittle when this is not the case. The authors claim that these masks can be obtained using foundation models. If so, why not obtain the entire object-centric representation using foundation models? Is your representation-learning method applicable without the dedicated background and agent slots?\n\n*Identifying the meaning of latent block attributes*: your method seems to produce human-interpretable disentanglement in the latent slot representations of scenes considered in this work, which is impressive and a positive outcome in my opinion. That said, your RL policy architecture relies on the human interpretation of the role of each block, which is another form of supervision that can make scaling difficult and introduce brittleness.\n\n*Strong assumptions about a specific task embedded within the policy architecture*: The proposed Block Transformer is designed for a very specific kind of task which limits its wider applicability. The authors “suppose the task is to relocate objects with the matched attributes into the goal position” (lines 242-243), which is not just treated as an example but determines the processing of state and goal slots. The block-wise cross-attention only allows matching objects to attend to each other which is a strong inductive bias that limits its expressivity. What if the task requires reasoning about the relationships of multiple goal objects? What if the task is to bring all the objects to the location of a single predefined object? Every change in the task/reward incurs a change to the architecture, which is not a desirable property. Judging by the results in Figure 11, this limited expressivity seems to not be beneficial even for the task it was designed for, resulting in lower sample efficiency compared to the EIT with the same representation.\n\nLimitations of the approach should be discussed in the paper, possibly in the Conclusion section.\n\n**Experiments**\n\n*3D Block Slot Representation*: it is not clear how much of the improvement in the metrics you considered stem from the additional supervision versus the additional block structure. Experiments evaluating OSRT with the mask objective would help shed light on this matter.\n\n*Goal-conditioned RL*: As I see it, the strong assumptions about the task embedded within the architecture are the main reason for the improved performance on the unseen test tasks. Since the matching mechanism is not learned, these tasks do not require much generalization in the learning sense, would the authors agree with this statement? Thus, although these findings are interesting, they could be considered narrow. I find the results in Figure 11 much stronger and I suggest they be moved to or at least discussed in the main text. The explicitly 3D-aware representations result in significant gains in sample efficiency compared to the 2D representation when paired with the EIT, which points to the fact that they facilitate better in-distribution generalization of the RL policy. Please see my suggestion under **Questions**.\n\n*Misc*:\n- How many seeds were used for the experiments?\n- How many objects are present in the RL environments? It is not explicitly stated in the paper.\n- Are the OOD colors also unseen during the representation model training or just the RL agent?\n- I suggest highlighting results that are within a STD from the best performing method in Table 2."}, "questions": {"value": "**Suggestion**\n\nIn my eyes, the main contribution of the paper is the 3D-aware object-centric representation and its applicability for training RL agents that generalize. This view is based on the experimental results, but is not highlighted by the structure and sentiment of the paper (other than the title).\nThe following suggestion is structural and semantic, and is of course left to the discretion of the authors, i.e., it will not affect my recommendation for acceptance/rejection:\n\nCenter the contribution around the 3D block-slot representation, and present the block transformer policy as an *example* of how this representation can facilitate design of task-specific architectures (although I do not think policy architectures should be task-specific). I would move the results in Figure 11 to the main text and discuss how with a fixed policy architecture:\n1. 3D-aware representations can improve in-distribution generalization: evidence to that is the sample efficiency of OSRT and your representation compared to DLP on ID.\n2. 3D-aware representations with factored attribute structure (i.e., yours) can improve attribute-level compositional generalization: evidence to that is the performance of yours compared to OSRT in CG and CG (same color).\n3. Maybe discuss why OSRT performs better on OOD generalization with the same architecture.\n\n**Questions**\n\n- How much does the representation rely on knowing the amount of objects/slots in advance?\n- How stable is training the block slot representation in terms of disentanglement of objects to distinct slots and factors to distinct blocks? Does the desired factorization emerge consistently across training runs?\n- There are no details about the attribute matching mechanism in the block Transformer. Can the authors provide further details on how this is done?\n- Are the authors planning to release code or take other measures for reproducibility purposes?\n- A major benefit of the 3D aware representation in my opinion is that it may be view-agnostic. Have you considered training the policy when randomizing the viewpoints (maybe with some restrictions on their directions such that they will capture sufficiently different angles of the scene)? Demonstrating view-generalization capabilities can have a very large impact on the robotics community since vision-based control methods are largely not robust even to slight variations in camera angles to my impression."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Ijb4vMkiGx", "forum": "GE0IFoDx8a", "replyto": "GE0IFoDx8a", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16912/Reviewer_xPHR"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16912/Reviewer_xPHR"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16912/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760831474782, "cdate": 1760831474782, "tmdate": 1762926938792, "mdate": 1762926938792, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a 3D block-slot representation for vision-based reinforcement learning (RL), targeting improved compositionality, interpretability, and 3D-awareness in multi-object manipulation domains.

A comparison among different configurations—such as applying block-slot attention to all slots, a mixed setup, or using only vanilla slot attention—would strengthen the justification. Similarly, the auxiliary mask losses in Equation 4 are not ablated.  \n   - Key hyperparameters such as the number of slots, blocks (Table 3), and prototypes are chosen without detailed diagnostic analysis.

The method’s conceptual innovation is modest.

This makes the contribution primarily engineering integration rather than algorithmic advancement. The claimed novelty of “3D-aware block-slot” reduces to combining volumetric rendering with slot decomposition.\n\n2. A major conceptual gap is the reliance on explicit segmentation masks for two dedicated slots: Eq. (2) defines auxiliary losses requiring binary masks for the background and agent (manipulator). Without such supervision, it’s unclear whether the model can autonomously discover these roles. This violates the unsupervised or weakly-supervised assumption common in object-centric learning, where slots are meant to emerge purely from reconstruction signals.
