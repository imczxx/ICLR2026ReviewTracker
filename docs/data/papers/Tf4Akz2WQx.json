Past decades have emerged a lot of efforts on theoretical characterizations and modeling plasticity of SN P systems; however, it still remains challenging that interacts with real-world environments due to the limited expressive capacity and the non-differentiable nature of their excitation mechanism. This paper proposes a Learnable Spiking Neural P System with Interval Excitation (LSNP_IE) for real-valued processing. The proposed LSNP_IE employs an interval excitation mechanism and a potential adjustment module, which improve modeling plasticity and enable excitation stability, respectively. The whole system can be adjusted by surrogate gradients beyond hardware.

The paper tries to discuss three key innovations:\n\n1. Interval Excitation Mechanism: The traditionally strict point-triggered firing condition (where the potential must exactly equal the threshold) is relaxed to an interval. This improves the model's robustness and ensures continuous information flow when handling real-valued (floating-point) data.\n2. Potential Adjustment Module: The paper introduces two normalization-like modules (M1 and M2) to align the input and residual potentials and to shift the fused potential's distribution towards the excitation interval, ensuring firing stability and effective learning.\n3.

The effectiveness of these modules is also validated through ablation studies.\n2. Clear Structure.

For the broader audience, SN P systems are a relatively niche concept. The introduction and related work mention that SN P systems possess a \"parallel and distributed architecture\" and \"modularity,\" hinting at their potential for hardware implementation. However, the paper fails to articulate more concretely what unique advantages this architecture offers over more established SNNs or traditional ANNs for tasks like image classification. This lack of justification might leave readers questioning the necessity of introducing the complexity of P systems.\n2. The potential adjustment module is formally very similar to Batch Normalization or Layer Normalization. While the ablation study proves its necessity, the paper could provide a deeper discussion on its design motivation. Is it merely an engineering trick to \"push\" the potential values into the firing interval? Did the authors consider other, simpler methods (like clipping or simpler scaling/shifting)? Clarifying this would help in understanding whether this module is a general-purpose solution within the SN P framework.\n3. The paper is somehow a disconnect between its core motivation and its experimental design. It argues that SN P systems offer advantages beyond standard SNNs, but then evaluates the model exclusively on image classification—a task where SNNs are already well-established and highly effective. I think the experiments thus fail to provide a compelling answer to the crucial concern: why should one utilize SN P framework if they do not showcase a experimentally unique capability (e.g., in computational modeling, structured problem-solving) that would justify its additional complexity over SNNs."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Could you comment on the choice of experimental tasks? Given that a key motivation for SN P systems is their unique structure inherited from P systems, have you considered tasks where this structure might offer a more distinct advantage over standard SNN architectures (beyond visual classifications)?
