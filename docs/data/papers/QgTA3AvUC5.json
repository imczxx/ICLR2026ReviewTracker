Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training. Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView, DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach. Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16 mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance, thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in aerial applications.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Open-Vocabulary", "Aerial", "Object Detection"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/009b7de80acb645fa57c4764a08febe57d05edab.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a cross-view open-vocabulary object detection framework that aims to transfer open-vocabulary knowledge from ground-view vision-language models to aerial imagery.

The two proposed contrastive losses are both conceptually straightforward extensions of standard InfoNCE or CLIP-style objectives. The paper would benefit from a clearer explanation of how these losses fundamentally differ from existing multi-view or domain adaptation approaches (e.g., CLIP2Scene, RegionCLIP, or ViLD). Adding theoretical insights or a more principled analysis of the alignment mechanism would strengthen the technical contribution.\nThe data generation pipeline, while practical, largely depends on off-the-shelf models (OWLv2) and ChatGPT-generated text without explicit quality control or quantitative validation of the generated samples. The absence of a discussion on how noise or bias in these pseudo-labels affects training limits the transparency and reproducibility of the approach.\nMoreover, the experiments, though extensive, could be improved by providing more diagnostic evaluations—such as embedding visualizations (e.g., t-SNE or attention maps) to verify cross-view alignment—or comparing with domain adaptation baselines designed for aerial imagery. Finally, the paper’s structure could be streamlined: Sections 3.3–3.4 contain overlapping descriptions that could be condensed to improve readability.\nOverall, the work’s main limitation lies not in execution but in depth of technical innovation and analysis.

This technique enables the model to align image features not only with original class names but also with expanded vocabulary, thereby enhancing open-vocabulary detection capability"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Quality Control in Vocabulary Expansion:\nGenerated Category Quality: When GPT generates synonyms based solely on category text, how do you ensure the quality and relevance of generated categories? For example, if the original category is \"small car\" and GPT generates fine-grained categories like \"SUV,\" this may cause misalignment between image features (depicting small cars) and text embeddings (describing SUVs).\nFine-grained Category Overlap: The xView dataset already contains many similar fine-grained categories (e.g., mobile-crane, container-crane, tower-crane). Expanding vocabulary for these fine grained categories may introduce severe category overlap issues, which is particularly detrimental to fine-grained classification performance. \n\n2.

These details are crucial for understanding and reproducing your method.\n\n3. Formatting and Presentation Issues: \n1)The paper contains citation format errors throughout. \n2)Most experimental results in the experiments section lack units (eg. mAP or others), which is poor practice for scientific writing. 3)The model architecture details are not clearly presented (e.g., backbone, training data size), making it difficult to assess the fairness of comparisons. And it would be beneficial to include FPS metrics to facilitate direct comparisons with future work.\n\n4. Counter-intuitive results:\nResults in Table 2: The zero-shot performance surpasses fine-tuned results, which is counter-intuitive. Could the authors provide more detailed explanations or additional comparisons with recent open vocabulary detectors (e.g., Grounding DINO, LAE-DINO) to validate this finding? Table 3: There appears to be a dataset mismatch. CastDet uses the VisDrone_ZSD dataset (h ttps://aiskyeye.com/submit-2023/zero-shot-object-detection/), not the standard VisDrone (Images) dataset.
