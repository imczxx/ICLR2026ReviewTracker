We introduce a novel framework that reformulates point cloud compression as model compression. Our framework models high-fidelity point cloud geometry and attribute with compact implicit neural representations (INR) separately and then compresses the model parameters directly via quantization and entropy coding, decoupling representation from compression. To ensure this neural representation is both faithful and efficient, we employ Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as the INR backbone. Thanks to its superior approximation properties and parameter efficiency, KAN can easily capture fine-grained details missed by traditional MLP. Extensive evaluations on datasets such as KITTI, ScanNet, and 8iVFB demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the MPEG standard and prior implicit neural representation approaches. Notably, it achieves competitive rate-distortion performance against state-of-the-art deep learning codecs. Our findings establish implicit neural compression as a powerful and practical pathway for developing the next generation of high-efficiency point cloud codecs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["implicit neural representation", "point cloud compression"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/43f0a56c3553594fc982ee02ec9c09a9310540fe.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Point cloud Implicit neural COmpression (PICO), a framework that transforms point cloud compression from a signal processing issue to a neural network compression problem by modeling geometry and attributes separately with compact implicit neural representations and compressing their parameters via quantization and entropy coding. This approach decouples geometry and attribute modeling to prevent feature entanglement and separates representation from compression for precise control over rate and quality. PICO employs a multi-scale rate control mechanism, using a pre-computed Pareto frontier for coarse-grained architecture selection and tunable L1 regularization for finer-grained parameter sparsity, enabling precise bitrate allocation through quantization step size adjustment. The framework adopts the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-inspired Learnable Activation Function Network as its INR backbone, which captures high-frequency details with fewer parameters and is further enhanced for PCC with positional encoding and radial basis functions. Evaluations on the 8iVFB, KITTI, and ScanNet datasets demonstrate its superiority over MPEG standards and other PCC methods. The contributions include PICO's precise rate control and real-world optimization, the lightweight and effective LeAFNet backbone, and the reformulation of PCC as neural network compression."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "I am fond of the proposed idea.
