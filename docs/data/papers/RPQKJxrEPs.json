In this problem we are given two node sets $A$ and $B$, a distance metric $d$ on $A \\cup B$ and two probability distributions $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ defined on $A$ and $B$ respectively. The goal is now to move the probability mass of distribution $\\mu$ from $A$ to $B$ such that $\\nu$ is formed. Alternatively $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ could also be seen as node weights on $A$ and $B$ (each summing up to $1$) and we need to match the respective weights to each other. The respective movement or matching should then minimize the $W_p$ distance with respect to the distance metric $d$.\n\nThe authors point our that it is already known that the problem can be solved exactly with running time $O\\left(n^{2+ o(1)}\\right)$ using a min-cost flow algorithm. However, this algorithm is not feasible in practice and there has been significant research over the last years both trying to find practical algorithms as well as trying to obtain a theoretical running time in $O(n^2)$, even if this means that not the optimum solution is found.\n\nThe main contribution of the submission is a randomized $2$-layer clustering scheme that allows to create a weighted directed graph of expected size $O(n^{3/2})$ such that the shortest path distance between two nodes $a \\in A$ and $b \\in B$ in this graph is at least $d(a,b)$ and at most $(4 + \\epsilon) d(a,b)$. Crucially all paths from $a$ to $b$ only contain a single weighted edge. As a result also the value $d(a,b)^p$ gets only distorted by a value of $(4+\\epsilon)^p$ by this construction (for $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$). \n\nAfterwards the authors apply the min cost flow algorithm by Chen et al. using these new distances. Given that the cost of the algorithm depends on the number of edges in the respective graph which got reduced from $O(n^{2})$ to $O(n^{3/2})$, this improves the running time accordingly. The distance graph can be calculated in $O(n^2)$, and the author end up with an $(4+ \\epsilon)$-approximation with expected running time $O(n^2)$ under reasonable assumptions. For the case that $p = \\infty$ they provide an alternative approach with a similar running time.\n\nBesides this, the submission provides an algorithm for the $W_p$ matching problem, which can be seen as the special case of the $W_p$ optimal transport problem where both $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are uniform distributions. The advantage of this algorithm seems to be that it has a reasonable practical running time even though the theoretical running time is mostly comparable to the more general algorithm. The approximation ratio stays $(4 +\\epsilon)$ (or $(8 + \\epsilon)$ respectively). It is also shown that if one finds an $(2 - \\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the $W_\\infty$ matching problem in $O(n^2)$, this would imply that one could find a perfect matching in bipartite graphs in $O(n^2)$. This can be seen as a hardness result.\n\nFor their experiments the authors generated data sets using either a uniform or a truncated normal distribution in up to 10 dimensions. They do not evaluate the practical performance of their $W_p$ optimal-transport algorithm directly (probably due to the inefficient min-cost flow algorithm). Instead they only evaluated the quality of the $2$-layer clustering scheme. They showed that the size of the clustering fits the expected theoretical bounds and obtained that in their experiments the maximum distance distortion of this clustering often was between $3$ and $3.5$ while the average distortion was closer to $1.5$. They also provided some experiments for their $W_p$ matching algorithm with the approximation ratios seemingly approaching values between $2$ and $2.5$ with larger number of nodes (at most 8000). An exception seems to be the algorithm for $p = \\infty$. Here the ratio reaches the value of $3$ and it is unclear if the value would increase even more for larger point sets.

We would like to emphasize three aspects that clarify why our results are highly relevant in practice.\n**First**, although this was *not highlighted in the submitted version*, our algorithm naturally operates in the **query model**, which is an immediate consequence of our clustering-based framework. In many practical scenarios—such as OT over word embeddings in NLP, histograms over learned visual dictionaries, or distributions over latent codebooks in generative models—the support set is fixed while many different distributions must be compared. In this regime, our method performs a one-time $O(n^2)$ preprocessing step to build the clustering and spanner structure, after which *each* subsequent OT computation runs in $O(n^{1+\\varepsilon})$ time for a $O(1/\\varepsilon)$-approximation. We will make this query-model interpretation explicit in the revised version, as it substantially strengthens the practical relevance of our algorithm.\n\n**Second**, although this was *not mentioned in the submitted version*, our clustering framework also yields a **fully combinatorial** $O(1/\\varepsilon)$**-approximation algorithm** with running time $O(n^{2+\\varepsilon}\\log⁡ U)$ when combined with a standard capacity-scaling approach. Thus, the scalability of our method is not tied to the min-cost flow algorithm of Chen et al.; the framework can be instantiated in multiple algorithmic regimes and remains robust even without Chen et al. We will include this result in the updated version of the paper.\n\n**Third**, to the best of our knowledge, we provide the **first practical quadratic-time approximation algorithm for $W_\\infty$** that works for **arbitrary metric spaces**. Existing approaches either require special metric structure (e.g., grids, low-dimensional Euclidean spaces) or rely on constructions (such as $p$HSTs) that fundamentally do not apply when $p=\\infty$. Our work fills this gap by giving the first general, implementable algorithm with provable guarantees.\n\nTaken together, these three points show that our contribution is not only theoretically novel but also practically meaningful: it yields real computational benefits in common application regimes, supports multiple scalable implementations, and provides the first general-purpose approximation algorithm for $W_\\infty$ across arbitrary metric spaces."}}, "id": "KTNbtJ5aUv", "forum": "RPQKJxrEPs", "replyto": "RPQKJxrEPs", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21439/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21439/Authors"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21439/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763699293378, "cdate": 1763699293378, "tmdate": 1763699293378, "mdate": 1763699293378, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents the first scalable, constant-factor approximation algorithm for the $W_{p}$ optimal transport (OT) problem that runs in nearly quadratic time.

The objective is to find a transport plan $\\sigma: A \\times B \\rightarrow R_{\\geq 0}$ that minimizes the $W_{p}$ cost, defined as $w_{p}(\\sigma):=(\\sum_{a\\in A,b\\in B}\\sigma(a,b)\\times d(a,b)^{p})^{1/p}$.

The primary algorithm constructs a directed spanner graph based on these clusters and computes an approximate solution by running a minimum-cost max-flow algorithm on this graph. A second, simpler algorithm for the matching problem uses the same clustering to build efficient dynamic data structures (for bichromatic closest pair and weighted nearest neighbor queries) which are then used within a Gabow-Tarjan cost-scaling matching framework.\n\n** Experiment sumamry **\n\nThe paper provides an empirical evaluation of the simpler combinatorial matching algorithm (from Section 3.2) on synthetic data.
