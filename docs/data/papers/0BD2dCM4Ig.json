During our investigation, graph vector quantized-masked autoencoder (gVQ-MAE) stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs (e.g., social networks and molecular graphs); Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) - (1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale. Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised (1.4%), few-shot (3.1%), and zero-shot (3.3%) scenarios.", "tldr": "We propose MoT to address optimization pitfalls in GFMs and achieve SOTA cross-domain generalization.", "keywords": ["Foundation Model; Graph Pre-training; Vector Quantization"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2abdb6e4ce624e14ff91cd45148798851f75c236.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/fedf3aa3843901c06791f68b4f82d7bafef5c686.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies graph foundation model, and proposes a MoE module together with a graph self-supervised learning-based regularization term to enhance the performance."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

This is just a small portion of GFM research, and I don't see any of these works presenting promising results.

Specifically:\n- In theorem 4.2, the intuition is correct since MoT incorporates a larger function class than that of vanilla edge representation construction via allowing node-to-edge dual message passing. However, upon checking the proof it seems that equation 15 in appendix E is NOT a valid lower bound, for example take $q(\\mathcal{E} | Z) \\equiv 100$ as a constant encoder, then we simply arrive at $I(Z, \\mathcal{E}) \\ge \\log 100 + H(\\mathcal{E})$ which violates the fundamental inequality in information theory that mutual information is upper bounded by entropy. Additionally, I checked the reference [1] and there seems to contain no such variational lower bounds of MI (lower bounding MI is non-trivial and often obtained lower bounds are not very meaningful). If the authors did find a place that validates this lower bound please state it in a clear fashion, **I think this bound is incorrect, and therefore the MI gap proof is likely to be incorrect as well**------it seems that the logic in the proof thereafter are somewhat messy.\n- In theorem 4.3, the statement itself is problematic: As there are altogether $M$ codebooks with each containing $K$ codewords, the entropy of any distribution supported on this collection is upper bounded by $\\log(MK)$ which further upper bounds MI. It is therefore strange to see the authors using $\\log(MK)$ as an MI lower bound. Upon investigation of the proofs in section E.2, once again it seems everywhere contains mistakes------In equation 23, what does *the probability of correct domain-specific mapping* mean? it appears pretty awkward to me that a uniform probability somehow emerges as some correct choice without formal justification. A more critical error comes right after in equation 25 that uses the inequality $I(S; Z) \\ge H(S) - H(S|Z)$, but **this is a well known equality that defines MI**. [2]\n\nThat said, I think the two aforementioned errors are rather critical, as even researchers with entry-level knowledge of information theory would identify the incorrectness of such statements, which makes me seriously suspect that LLMs are abused in writing such hallucinatory statements without careful fact checking. Furthermore, I noticed that there is no disclosure of LLM usage segments in the appendix of this paper. \n\n## Novelty issues\nThe technique of edge-wise semantic fusion described in equation 2 is actually a well-known technique in graph representation learning community that utilizes the edge-to-node duality, or line graph in the undirected graph case. Such adaptation are present even in pioneer works of GNN developments [1] and has later turned into broader protocols [2, 3]. Therefore I do not think this idea is new.\n\n## Presentation issues\nWhile there are plenty of summaries appeared at the start of paragraphs, I think the contents of the paper are organized in a non-natural way. For example, in section 3.2 the authors presented empirical investigation with improvements brought by the proposed methods, but without description of the method. I think perhaps this is a little bit harsh."}, "questions": {"value": "The most important question is: **How did you get your theory results?**\n\n[1].

The adaptation of the Information Bottleneck (IB) in Definition 4.1 appears inconsistent with prior IB methods [1][2]. Instead of constraining the latent space to retain only minimal sufficient information within the input graph data, the objective in Definition 4.1 simultaneously maximizes mutual information with domain-specific semantics $S$ and graph topology $\\mathcal{E}$. It appears to overemphasize domain-dependent semantic/topological information and weaken the theoretical connection to the proposed framework.\n\n3. Most experiments focus solely on the accuracy.
