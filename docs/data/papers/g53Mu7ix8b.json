Multivariate curve resolution (MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed signals into components (base patterns) and their concentrations (intensity), playing a key role in understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified number of components, usually unknown in real data. Once data or component number increases, the scalability of these MCR approaches face significant challenges. This study reformulates MCR as a data generative process (gMCR), and introduces an Energy-Based solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the smallest component set and their concentrations for reconstructing the mixed signals faithfully. On synthetic benchmarks with up to 256 components, EB-gMCR attains high reconstruction fidelity and recovers the component number within 5% at 20dB noise and near-exact at 30dB. On two public spectral datasets, it identifies the correct component number and improves component separation over MF-based MCR approaches (non-negative variants [NMFs], ICA, MCR-ALS). EB-gMCR is a general solver for fixed-pattern signal unmixing (components remain invariant across mixtures).

Before addressing individual concerns, we clarify the core problem to bridge potential understanding gaps.\n\nWe provide a toy example to illustrate what MCR is. In short, MCR decomposes observed superposition signals into underlying components and their concentrations. Consider this simple example:\n\n**Given observations:**\n$$\n\\\\begin{aligned}\n\\\\text{Sample 1:} \\\\quad &[1, 1, 0, 0] = 1 \\\\times C_1 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{Sample 2:} \\\\quad &[0, 0, 1, 2] = 1 \\\\times C_2 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{Sample 3:} \\\\quad &[1, 1, 1, 2] = 1 \\\\times C_1 + 1 \\\\times C_2\n\\\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n**The decomposition is:** $C_1 = [1,1,0,0]$, $C_2 = [0,0,1,2]$ (not normalized for visual clarity) with concentrations $[[1,0], [0,1], [1,1]]$.\n\n**Why is this \"generative\"?** Each observation is generated by: mixture $= \\\\sum (\\\\text{concentration} \\\\times \\\\text{component})$. Real-world signals with fixed patterns can be combined in more complex non-linear ways, so we use an aggregation function $\\\\Phi$ instead of simply assuming linear addition. This compositional structure is the natural description of how superposition signals form. We model this generation process to perform decomposition (conditional inference), not to synthesize new mixtures.\n\n**Traditional MCR's main weakness is lack of scalability.** This manifests in two ways: scaling to large datasets, and decomposing new samples efficiently. Traditional methods initialize fixed-size matrices: concentration $C \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{M \\\\times N}$ and components $S \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{N \\\\times d}$, where $N$, $M$, $d$ are predefined component number, collected sample size, and data dimension. As the toy example shows, we can easily collect more data from the same signal source and expand the dataset:\n\n$$\n\\\\begin{aligned}\n\\\\text{Sample 1:} \\\\quad &[1, 1, 0, 0] = 1 \\\\times C_1 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{Sample 2:} \\\\quad &[0, 0, 1, 2] = 1 \\\\times C_2 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{Sample 3:} \\\\quad &[1, 1, 1, 2] = 1 \\\\times C_1 + 1 \\\\times C_2 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{Sample 4:} \\\\quad &[2, 2, 0, 0] = 2 \\\\times C_1 \\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{Sample 5:} \\\\quad &[0, 0, 2, 4] = 2 \\\\times C_2\n\\\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIntuitively, $C_1$ and $C_2$ remain the main components, but traditional MCR must recompute everything when any new sample is added. This toy example uses clean signals, but recomputation amplifies noise effects, causing numerical instability.\n\n**For scaling to large component numbers or dataset sizes:** Specifying $N$ before running the algorithm means we must search over candidate $N$ values and rerun the algorithm for each one. This becomes prohibitively expensive when $N$ and $M$ are large. Moreover, we found that traditional MCR methods cannot maintain effective decomposability even when given the correct $N$. They fail to preserve reconstruction quality when $N$ exceeds several hundred. While we tested up to $N=256$, EB-gMCR maintains better decomposability as $N$ increases (Fig. 2f and 2h: near-ground-truth component counts at N=256).\n\n**Regarding the convergence proof:** We aim to justify why and how the complex loss function (Eq. 13) can reach an endpoint through end-to-end training. The proof does not claim to prove why this framework and loss function work for signal unmixing—the framework is heuristic and the design comes from physical intuition. We hope this clarification helps reviewers better understand the problem we address and the roadmap this paper provides for solving signal unmixing challenges.\n\nWe address specific reviewer questions in individual responses below."}}, "id": "Nrv4e6j1lg", "forum": "g53Mu7ix8b", "replyto": "g53Mu7ix8b", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5762/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5762/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5762/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763645861124, "cdate": 1763645861124, "tmdate": 1763645861124, "mdate": 1763645861124, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a generative model for signal unmixing that includes a generic aggregation function, concentration generator, and component patterns, all of which are implemented by deep learning networks.
