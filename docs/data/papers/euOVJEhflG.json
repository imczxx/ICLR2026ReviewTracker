The authors build upon and extend prior approaches that address several key limitations, achieving a better approximation ratio.\n\n\nAuthors consider two main settings: one where the facility setup cost is uniform across all locations, and another where the costs vary by vertex (the non-uniform cost structure).

While the discussion connects partially to existing literature, the algorithmic descriptions are particularly detailed and well explained.

While the theoretical contributions are strong, the practical relevance particularly in learning-augmented settings could be strengthened through empirical validation.

It is unclear whether these are standard assumptions in prior literature or newly introduced for tractability. If these are common, the authors should explicitly cite supporting works; if they are novel, a more thorough discussion or justification of their necessity and implications is required. As of now, some of these assumptions appear tailored to make the analysis feasible rather than naturally arising from the problem structure. Comments by the Authors are desirable. \n\nThe paper also references the open challenge of achieving an approximation factor of O(log /log log K) in the non-uniform cost case. However, this result is asymptotic, and this limitation is not highlighted in the discussion. It is very desirable if Authors explicitly acknowledge this gap and outline possible directions for bridging this gap.\n\nAs far as the presentation is concerned, several definitions such as critical balls, levels, and probabilistic rounding steps are dense, making it hard to parse. Many readers would like to have easy to explain examples or see illustrations (schematic diagrams); they could greatly enhance the readability for the readers that are less familiar with the literature. \n\nFinally, while the derived bounds involving factors like (log \\Delta) are theoretically interesting, the tightness of these bounds is not well discussed.

At least small scale (initial) experimental results evaluating the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed rounding algorithms would be useful. \n\n\nAre there specific optimization techniques that Authors recommend for implementing the algorithms efficiently in practice? \nThe analysis assumes that the fractional mass y^t_v​ remains fixed during the rounding process or can be approximated as such via vertex splitting. Could you comment on real-world scenarios where this assumption may not hold strictly? How would potential violations of this assumption affect the validity or tightness of the approximation guarantees?\n\n\nThe derived bounds naturally depend on the aspect ratio of the metric space, \\Delta_t​. In dynamic or evolving settings where this ratio may vary significantly over time, how sensitive are the theoretical guarantees to such changes? \n\nIn the absence of experimental results, it remains unclear how the proposed methods compare with existing online facility location algorithms, such as those by Meyerson or more recent learning-augmented approaches.
