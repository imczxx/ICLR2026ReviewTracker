Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner’s dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is that LLMs lack a principled mechanism for mutually beneficial decision making. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment ($\\textbf{GTAlign}$), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when payment modes of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare over baseline methods across diverse tasks.", "tldr": "We train the LLM assistant through reinforcement learning guided by game-theoretic principles.", "keywords": ["Human-Centered AI", "Game Theory", "Large Language Model", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d5f0f507ffefc401b75f70485ab73bd277bcd05c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/135d585307c5342babd4d7e15d3effebb67d61a2.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a game-theoretic alignment framework called GTALIGN, which aims to achieve mutual welfare in interactions betweenLLMs and users.

The main approach can perhaps be more accurately described as an optimization procedure rather than a game.

There seems to be a fundamental difference between what the paper proposes and a game. No equilibrium concept was applied. From what I can see, the main idea is more like evaluating payoffs and optimizing LLM response based on the evaluation. \n\n- The description of the approach could be made clearer.

The conclusion is grounded on the improved performance over the base model and the SFT model, as well as several other welfare aggregation methods under the same regime. I have to say the improvement over the baselines that the authors listed is fairly expected. There should be other (RL) baselines, for example, without the proposed generation regime, to justify the necessity of the proposed technique and see whether it is true that the LLMs trained with existing techniques are indeed struggling with maximizing mutual welfare.\n\nAnother piece missing, unfortunately, is the scaling trend of the proposed method. In order to claim a principled framework, I think it is necessary to demonstrate the method's scalability. This can be addressed by including models $\\geq$ 7B parameters, which is fairly standard for academic evaluations.  \n\n**Clarity**: \n\nSeveral parts are unclear to me:\n* The details of the \"sequential games training\" in Fig.3 and Table 2 are missing, which should at least be demonstrated in the appendix.\n* The concrete definition of each factor, i.e., how you calculate them numerically, is missing.\n* The training details in the Appendix, including both the SFT stage and PPO stage, are not sufficient for me to understand how the model is trained.
