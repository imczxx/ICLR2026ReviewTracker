It optimizes policies via surrogate objectives based on importance ratios, which require nontrivial likelihood evaluation. Although the Gaussian policy assumption simplifies the likelihood evaluation step, it could potentially restrain the performance of the resulting policy. Replacing Gaussian policies with continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) represented via ordinary differential equations (ODEs) enhances expressiveness for multi-modal actions but inevitably leading to much more challenging importance ratio evaluation. Conventional likelihoods computation with CNFs is typically conducted along full-flow paths, which demands costly simulation and back-propagation and is prone to exploding or vanishing gradients. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel on-policy CNF-based reinforcement learning algorithm, named PolicyFlow, which integrates expressive policies with PPO-style objectives while avoiding likelihood evaluation along the full flow path. PolicyFlow approximates importance ratios using velocity field variations along a simple interpolation path, reducing computational overhead while preserving the stability of proximal updates. To avoid potential mode collapse and further encourage diverse behaviors, PolicyFlow introduces an implicit entropy regularizer, inspired by Brownian motion, which is both conceptually elegant and computationally lightweight. Experiments on diverse tasks in vairous environments such as MultiGoal, IsaacLab, and MuJoCo Playground show that PolicyFlow achieves competitive or superior performance compared to PPO with Gaussian policies and state-of-the-art flow-based method, with MultiGoal in particular demonstrating PolicyFlow’s ability to capture diverse multimodal action distributions.", "tldr": "We present PolicyFlow, an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that unites continuous normalizing flows with PPO-style optimization and a novel Brownian entropy regularizer for expressive and stable multimodal policies.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Continuous Normalizing Flow", "Entropy Regularization", "Proximal Policy Optimization", "Multimodal Policy"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3b7c732b3942c2e03bc52e547c444d309781bbc5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel on-policy algorithm named PolicyFlow.

The design aims to capture multimodal action distributions and improve policy expressiveness. The use of a Brownian motion-inspired implicit entropy regularizer seeks to enhance exploration without introducing explicit entropy terms in the loss.\n\nAlthough this approach is conceptually sound, the paper does not provide strong empirical or theoretical evidence that PolicyFlow meaningfully improves over PPO. The observed results in Figures and Tables suggest comparable performance rather than clear gains. The discussion of results should better address why these similarities occur and whether the proposed approach offers other advantages, such as stability or robustness.\n\nThe focus on comparison with FPO is noted, but it is unclear why this method receives particular attention when the central comparison should remain with PPO. It would be helpful to clarify the methodological differences that justify this choice. The analysis could also include visualization or theoretical examples that demonstrate how the normalizing flow structure affects action representation or optimization dynamics.\n\nWhile the Brownian entropy regularizer is an appealing idea, its effect on exploration and stability is not quantified. A comparison with standard entropy regularization would help assess whether it provides genuine benefit or simply replicates existing behavior. Similarly, the discussion on computational efficiency should more clearly address the trade-offs between the added parameterization and any observed gains in performance.\n\nThe runtime and parameter analyses are appreciated, as they help contextualize the computational implications of the proposed method. However, since the improvements are small and the training time increases, the practical benefit of adopting PolicyFlow remains uncertain. The lack of variance reporting in Tables 1 and 2 also limits confidence in the consistency of the results.\n\nIn summary, the idea of integrating normalizing flows into policy gradient methods is interesting and potentially valuable, but the paper does not yet establish sufficient justification, theoretical insight, or empirical advantage to support its adoption.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1.
