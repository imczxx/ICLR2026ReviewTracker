Existing methods often query indirect radiance from Gaussian primitives pre-trained for novel-view synthesis. However, these pre-trained Gaussian primitives are supervised only towards limited training viewpoints, thus lack supervision for modeling indirect radiances from unobserved views. To address this issue, we introduce radiometric consistency, a physical constraint that provides supervision towards unobserved views by minimizing the residual between each Gaussian primitive’s learned radiance and its physically-based rendered counterpart. Minimizing the residual for unobserved views establishes a self-correcting feedback loop that provides supervision from both physically-based rendering and novel-view synthesis, enabling accurate modeling of inter-reflection.\nWe then propose Radiometrically Consistent Gaussian Surfels (RadioGS), an inverse rendering framework built upon our principle by efficiently integrating radiometric consistency by utilizing  Gaussian surfels and 2D Gaussian ray tracing. We further propose a finetuning-based relighting strategy that adapts Gaussian surfel radiances to new illuminations within minutes, achieving low rendering cost ($<$10ms). Extensive experiments on existing inverse rendering benchmarks show that RadioGS outperforms existing Gaussian-based methods in inverse rendering, while retaining the computational efficiency.", "tldr": "Radiometric Consistency for Gaussian Surfels provide accurate indirect illumination for inverse rendering", "keywords": ["Radiometric Consistency", "Indirect Illumination", "Gaussian Splatting", "Inverse Rendering"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4168942059f0e8a21b88e2b7ff23b449d62d204d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a physically grounded inverse rendering framework called RadioGS.

A primary concern is the conceptual framing of \"radiometric consistency\". The paper presents this as a \"novel physical constraint\", but its fundamental distinction from standard methods for computing indirect illumination, such as path tracing, is unclear. The underlying physical constraint is simply the rendering equation. This method appears to be a form of optimization where a learned or cached representation of global illumination is regularized to match a physically-based render. If this interpretation is correct, then radiometric consistency is not a new physical principle but rather an efficient approximation or caching strategy designed to enforce it. The novelty would then lie in the caching technique itself, not the underlying physics.\n\n2. The formulation of the indirect radiance term, $L_\\text{ind}$, is critically underspecified. Despite being a cornerstone of the proposed method, the paper lacks a clear mathematical definition for how $L_\\text{ind}$ is computed. The text refers readers to Eq. 4 and Eq. 5 (line 240), but this reference is confusing and unhelpful. Eq. 4 defines the BRDF, and Eq. 5 merely decomposes incoming radiance into direct and indirect components without providing a computational model for the latter. The method's implementation for this crucial term is left to textual descriptions (e.g., lines 240, 268), which is insufficient for a clear understanding and reproduction of the work.\n\n3. The evidence supporting the central claim of improved indirect illumination modeling is indirect and appears weak. The paper validates its method via ablation studies on end-to-end metrics (e.g., NVS, albedo PSNR) across a limited set of scenes. However, these final metrics can be influenced by many factors in the rendering pipeline. Without a direct, quantitative evaluation of the indirect illumination component itself—for instance, by comparing the rendered indirect pass against a ground-truth path-traced equivalent—it is difficult to conclude that the performance gains stem specifically from more accurate indirect radiance estimation. Relying on proxy metrics from a small number of scenes makes the current conclusion insufficiently substantiated."}, "questions": {"value": "1. See W1.
