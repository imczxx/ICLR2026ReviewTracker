Meanwhile, novel-view synthesis has seen major advances with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), where models learn a compact representation from 2D images to render 3D scenes, albeit at the cost of large models and intensive training. \nIn this work, we extend the approach of QVFs by introducing QNeRF, the first hybrid quantum-classical model designed for novel-view synthesis from 2D images. QNeRF leverages parameterized quantum circuits to encode spatial and view-dependent information via quantum superposition and entanglement, resulting in more compact models.\nWe present two architectural variants. Full QNeRF maximally exploits all quantum amplitudes to enhance representational capabilities. In contrast, Dual-Branch QNeRF introduces a task-informed inductive bias by branching spatial and view-dependent quantum state preparations, drastically reducing the complexity of this operation and ensuring scalability and potential hardware compatibility.  \nOur experiments demonstrate that---when trained on images of reduced resolution---QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF baselines while using less than half the number of parameters. These results suggest that Quantum Machine Learning can serve as a competitive alternative for continuous signal representation in high-level tasks in Computer Vision such as 3D representation learning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["quantum machine learning", "novel-view synthesis"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5cab1d1add13c71a05226601966f0382721af76a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/5f8e8ee493c714f84aa55243ff2252ddddc6bbc0.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work proposes the first hybrid quantum-classical model for novel-view synthesis of 2D images.

Beyond the straightforward hybridization, the authors propose a Dual-Branch quantum embedding that separately encodes position and viewing direction before composition, explicitly targeting NISQ constraints (shallower circuits, reduced state-preparation burden). This is a creative combination of implicit neural representations and quantum feature maps that broadens how NeRF-like volumetric rendering can be parameterized.\n\nQuality: On two datasets, QNeRF attains comparable or better PSNR than a classical NeRF baseline with fewer than half the learnable parameters, indicating a favorable accuracy–parameter trade-off.

The problem setup, the transition from classical MLPs to PQC blocks, and the end-to-end rendering pipeline are explained in a way that makes the contribution reproducible. Definitions and symbols are used consistently, and the motivation for the Dual-Branch construction is articulated with sufficient intuition.\n\nSignificance: QNeRF offers a new template for marrying NeRF-style continuous scene representations with quantum embeddings, potentially enabling future lines of work on quantum-accelerated volume rendering, quantum feature maps for 3D geometry, and hardware-aligned implicit modeling."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited practicality of the model. When the number of qubits is $n$, the overall complexity of QNeRF remains $2^n$, e.g., in the MLP replacement and state preparation. Even if the PQC step has complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, the end-to-end complexity is still $2^n$. Moreover, quantum computation typically requires many measurement shots and has inefficient backpropagation, so the wall-clock time of running QNeRF on a quantum computer may be much higher than classically simulating QNeRF.\n\n   Suggestion: Optimize the model architecture so that the motivation for introducing quantum computation is more compelling. Alternatively, compute the end-to-end resource consumption of QNeRF and compare it against the time for classical simulation; specify the conditions under which QNeRF achieves quantum advantage, and then discuss the practical value of QNeRF.\n\n2.

Important dimensions are missing, such as how performance scales with the number of qubits, how results depend on the number of shots, and how noise affects inference/training.\n\n   Suggestion: Add the above missing numerical studies to substantiate the claims."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Scaling with qubit count and depth. How does QNeRF’s performance change with the number of qubits (n)?

Under what parameter regimes—qubit count ($n$), layer depth ($l$), number of shots, noise strength, etc.—can QNeRF achieve practical quantum advantage?

The paper states that, compared to the Full QNeRF approach, the dual-branch strategy reduces the number of amplitudes exponentially.
