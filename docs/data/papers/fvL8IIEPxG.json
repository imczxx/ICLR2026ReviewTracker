This paper challenges this paradigm by investigating a more realistic regime: one where memory is abundant enough to mitigate forgetting, but full retraining from scratch remains prohibitively expensive. In this practical \"middle ground\", we find that the core challenge shifts from stability to plasticity, as models become biased toward prior tasks and struggle to learn new ones. Conversely, improved stability allows simple replay baselines to outperform the state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the GPU cost. To address this newly surfaced trade-off, we propose Weight Space Consolidation, a lightweight method that combines (1) rank-based parameter resets to restore plasticity with (2) weight averaging to enhance stability. Validated on both class-incremental learning with image classifiers and continual instruction tuning with large language models, our approach outperforms strong baselines while matching the low computational cost of replay, offering a scalable alternative to expensive full-retraining. These findings challenge long-standing CL assumptions and establish a new, cost-efficient baseline for real-world CL systems where exemplar memory is no longer the limiting factor.", "tldr": "We study continual learning in a realistic setting where exemplar memory is abundant, while computation resources are limited.", "keywords": ["continual learning", "model merging", "machine learning", "large language models"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dd524ef7b506f877aa897f14043e51eafab88f90.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d91e6c950f9ea1e0356d24ead38c49d963ff256d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Traditionally, continual learning has been studied under the memory-restricted setting (i.e., completely exemplar-free or only limited buffer sizes allowed). Authors argue that this is unrealistic under modern standards: compute, and not memory-costs, are the main drivers for the high costs related to model training. Thus, authors study the setting where larger-than-common buffer sizes are used, and where instead the compute availability is the driving factor for comparison. They find that, as the memory buffer grows and thus allows storing more samples of prior tasks, the challenge in CL shift from forgetting to plasticity. Models are stable wrt old tasks, but not plastic enough to new tasks. To alleviate, they propose using stochastic weight averaging and resetting weights with relatively little gradient activity.

The core idea of reseting certain parameters for plasticity also is interesting.\n\n2. In the high-sample regime, the proposed method almost always outperforms existing baselines by 2-3 points. \n\n3. The paper has nice ablation experiments such as comparing replay with reset (table 3), reset strategies (table 5). The plasticity loss experiment (Fig2) in particular suggest the issue with lower plasticity with increasing size of past examples.

My main concern is with the framing of the paper for continual learning and its potential application. The point about GPU cost being dominant with storage is fine, but the main problem is that the data itself might not be available in the first place. So storage was never the real issue, it is access to data. For a practical example, assume we have llama-3.2b instruct model but we don't know what data was used in the base to instruct training. Here, the authors are essentially assuming we have access to the underlying data, which is not the case. A few other points:\n\n(i) While storage cost is not a problem, the cost of downloading setting up s3 buckets high throughput speed for gpu access are all real costs. These need to be highlighted. \n\n(ii) If the authors are motivating it based on cost, some experiments on exact cost saved for practical reference should be provided.\n\nThis is not to say the original point about GPU vs storage cost isn't correct, but that storage is not the only factor, data access itself is a big one. The entire argument essentially dilutes the author's novelty.\n\n2. It seems a naive full-fine-tuning baseline is missing in Table 2 ? Difference between proposed method and full-fine-tuned on the same set would be very helpful. \n\n3. Authors primarily explore task-based paradigm only, but it seems the method might be more impactful in task-free settings [Ref1]. \n\n4. For LLM datasets, authors only consider TRACE dataset, so tough to know the generalizability.. Given that authors are exploring image-based and llm-based separately, it might be worth repeating experiments on multi-modal datasets as well such as on VisCOLL [Ref2]. \n\n5. (Minor) Some qualitative visualizations would be very helpful.\n\n6. (Minor) For Trace experiments, the training hyper-parameters are underspecified. What is the fine-tuning method for llama-3.2-1B? Some experiments using LoRA adaptors would also be interesting. \n\n---\n[Ref1]: Aljundi, Rahaf, Klaas Kelchtermans, and Tinne Tuytelaars. \"Task-free continual learning.\" In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 11254-11263. 2019.\n\n[Ref2]: Jin, Xisen, Junyi Du, Arka Sadhu, Ram Nevatia, and Xiang Ren. \"Visually grounded continual learning of compositional phrases.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00785 (2020).\n\n\n---\n\nOverall Rating: 4/10\n\nThe main framing of gpu vs storage cost is not really novel. While the authors get 2-3 points improvement in high-sample regime, it is unclear how interesting that is.
