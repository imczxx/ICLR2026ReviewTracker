This gap is particularly critical in mental health, where patient questions often mix symptoms, treatment concerns, and emotional needs, requiring answers that balance clinical caution with contextual sensitivity. We present COUNSELBENCH, a large-scale benchmark developed with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test large language models (LLMs) in realistic help-seeking scenarios. The first component, COUNSELBENCH-EVAL, contains 2,000 expert evaluations of answers from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and human therapists on patient questions from the public forum CounselChat. Each answer is\nrated across six clinically grounded dimensions, with span-level annotations and written rationales. Expert evaluations show that while LLMs achieve high scores on several dimensions, they also exhibit recurring issues, including unconstructive feedback, overgeneralization, and limited personalization or relevance. Responses were frequently flagged for safety risks, most notably unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that LLM judges systematically overrate model responses and overlook safety concerns identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct COUNSELBENCH-ADV, an adversarial\ndataset of 120 expert-authored mental health questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation of 3,240 responses from nine LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns. Together, COUNSELBENCH establishes a clinically grounded framework for benchmarking LLMs in mental health QA.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["large language models", "mental health", "human evaluation"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4aa7337ab37316bd273d103a48d28d1e554a5c76.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on open-ended mental health question answering (QA) questions.

There is rich annotations and represents one of the largest expert-annotated datasets for open-ended mental health QA but also has high interannotator agreement.\n* There are two benchmarks that covers not only systematic evaluation of the LLM and human responses, but an expert-authored adversarial set designed to stress-test LLMs.\n* Provides a critical evaluation of LLM-as-Judge paradigm highlighting the inability to flag problematic content and safety concerns identified by human experts.\n* Multiple pilot studies were introduced to refine the evaluation protocol with thorough analysis of annotator behavior and clear methodology provided."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* There are slight scale limitations of the dataset as there are only 100 questions (5 per topic, 20 topics) which were chosen by popularity and may not fully reflect the diversity and subtly of mental health questions (as motivated by in the introduction). Similarly, the adversarial benchmark contains only 120 questions, although there are 20 per failure mode.\n* There is a heavy reliance on automated evaluation of the adversarial responses which seems to go against the findings of the LLM-as-Judge critique. The same model was also used to evaluate the failure modes that were identified in the original responses of the first benchmark (GPT-4.1 and GPT 4, respectively).\n* The adversarial benchmark, while interesting from a high-level perspective, is confusing. It seems to determine whether high trigger rates indicate model problems as determined by GPT-4.1. However, it's not clear what makes a question adversarial versus difficult? Also, it has been designed from 2 failure modes from the 3 original base models but then tested across new models (like Claude). Is the expectation that they are model-specific problems or really universal vulnerabilities? \n* Is it truly fair to benchmark against the human baselines as they were often informal and vary in quality as they could be answered anonymously. Are these fair comparisons with one another? \n\nMinor:\n* The use of 2000 expert annotations is slightly misleading as the dataset contains 100 total questions with 4 different responses and 5 annotators per response pair. This is never explicitly stated as this breakdown.\n* Phrasing in line 404-405 is slightly confusing? \n*There are inconsistent periods throughout the text.

It did not rely on students or crowdworkers, but instead recruited 100 mental health professionals to provide 2,000 evaluations. These 100 professionals hold 32 distinct license/degree types and span 43 specialization areas, ensuring the professionalism and diversity of the results.\n- **Clinically Grounded Evaluation Dimensions**: The study moves beyond simple \"accuracy\" to define six clinically crucial dimensions: overall quality, empathy, specificity, factual consistency, medical advice (safety), and toxicity. These dimensions were developed based on clinical literature and expert consultation, truly capturing the core of mental health QA.\n- **Innovative Adversarial Benchmark**: The second component, COUNSELBENCH-ADV, is highly innovative. It moves beyond passive evaluation by analyzing failure modes identified in COUNSELBENCH-EVAL (e.g., GPT-4 suggesting specific therapy techniques, Llama-3.3 being judgmental, and Gemini-1.5-Pro being apathetic) . Experts then authored 120 new questions specifically designed to trigger these identified failures, creating a systematic way to actively stress-test models.\n- **Key Falsification of \"LLM-as-Judge\"**: As the \"LLM-as-Judge\" paradigm gains popularity, this paper provides a powerful demonstration of its limitations in high-stakes domains. The study found that LLM judges \"systematically overrate model responses\" and \"overlook safety concerns identified by human experts\". For instance, LLM judges failed to identify most toxic content or factual errors.

The \"human therapist\" baseline was sourced from the \"top-voted answer\" for each question on CounselChat. The authors acknowledge that these \"forum contributions are informal and vary in quality\". Curiously, LLaMA-3.3 outperformed this human baseline on five of the six dimensions. This makes the results hard to interpret: have LLMs surpassed human performance, or have they simply surpassed a (potentially low-quality) standard of informal forum answers?\n- **Limitation of a Single Data Source**: All patient questions were sourced from a single public forum, CounselChat. The style of questions and needs expressed in this asynchronous, public format may differ significantly from those in private therapeutic conversations, EHR messages, or peer-support forums.\n- **Reliance on LLM-as-Judge in Adversarial Evaluation**: This presents a core methodological contradiction. In COUNSELBENCH-EVAL, the paper demonstrates that LLM-as-Judge is unreliable. However, to assess the 3,240 responses in COUNSELBENCH-ADV, the study used GPT-4.1 as a \"scalable labeling tool\". While the authors validated this as a \"practical proxy\" via a human spot-check (72.9% agreement), this reliance undoubtedly weakens the reliability of the adversarial results."}, "questions": {"value": "In the first part of your paper, you convincingly demonstrated that LLM judges \"systematically overrate\" responses in the mental health domain.
