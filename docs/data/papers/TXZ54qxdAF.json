While existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments.  \nSpecifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so that the strong model can learn from the failed trajectories accumulated by weak models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents, we further construct ``trajectory trees,\" a hierarchical representation that organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis, we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

The core idea is to fine-tune a stronger model using trajectories sampled by a weaker model. In order to achieve this, the authors propose to construct _trajectory trees_ (which are game/decision trees applied to text generated by LLMs) from the weak model rollouts, and use this tree to select which paths should be used to tune the stronger model. They present two approaches: select preference pairs for DPO from divergence points in the tree (TreeDPO), or use MCTS to identify paths with strong performance for SFT (W2SG with MCTS). For TreeDPO, they prove a theorem that, under strict assumptions, guarantees performance improvement over a strong SFT baseline. Finally, the empirical results on WebShop, Science World, and AlfWorld suggest W2SG methods  can improve the strong model's performance. \n\n**Recommendation:**\\\nEven though this topic falls quite far outside my area of expertise, I am an expert on exploration in sequential decision-making environments and reinforcement learning.  With this perspective, I recommend to reject this paper.

From my understanding, the goal of the W2SG paradigm seems to be around aligning strong models to the preferences and intentions of a weaker model (whilst ideally not losing performance). However, the approaches in this paper don't seem to share this goal. Instead, they seem solely focused on improving the strong agent's performance. As such, the proposed methods don't seem to be part of the core objective of the W2SG paradigm, but the paper _is_ framed in this way. Instead, the approaches are very reminiscent of the field of exploration and MCTS in reinforcement learning, where the objective is to use diverse, exploratory trajectories to improve the performance of a policy in a sequential decision making environment. However, the paper is not framed in this way, and seems to lack positioning within this particular field of research. Therefore, the framing of the paper seems to fit neither of these two paradigms in its current state. \n- It is not possible to judge the significance of the empirical results.
