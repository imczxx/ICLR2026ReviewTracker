We introduce XAI-Annotate, a novel framework that transforms classification explainability into automated annotation. By leveraging saliency maps from correctly classified samples, our method distills latent segmentation cues into high-quality masks—without requiring segmentation labels. XAI-Annotate combines saliency-to-mask distillation, boundary-aware refinement with expert feedback, and multi-scale concordance validation to ensure clinical relevance. Validated on breast ultrasound data, our approach demonstrates significant annotation efficiency gains while maintaining strong segmentation performance. This work bridges the gap between interpretability and deployability in medical AI.", "tldr": "XAA transforms classification explainability into clinical annotations by distilling XAI heatmaps into segmentation masks, enabling radiologist-efficient refinement while preserving diagnostic fidelity.​", "keywords": ["Explainable AI (XAI)", "Automatic Mask Generation", "​Annotation-Efficient Learning", "​Saliency-to-Mask Conversion", "Breast Ultrasound Segmentation", "​Human-AI Collaboration", "​Computation-Efficient Annotation", "Dice Coefficient"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
