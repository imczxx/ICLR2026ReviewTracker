This approach not only reduces the number of evaluations but also enhances image quality for I2I Translation tasks.\nOur experiments demonstrate that DBMSolver outperforms prior methods across multiple datasets and resolutions, significantly improving visual quality and reducing computational overhead.\nDBMSolver improves the scalability of diffusion-based I2I Translation by bridging the gap between theoretical elegance and real-world applicability.", "tldr": "We propose a novel, training-free solver for Diffusion Bridge Models, making Image-to-Image Translation better and faster.", "keywords": ["Diffusion Bridge Models", "Diffusion Models", "Image-to-Image Translation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4b59dc2dcf6e426fc4885cbd300a4c71df79774b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposed a training free algorithm DBMSolver to accelerate existing diffusion bridge models for image-to-image translation problems, which is based on high order exponential integrator theory for bridge SDE and bridge ODE.

I appreciate that the major advantage of the proposed method is that its training free, which is different from other methods for acceleration of diffusion bridge models, such as distillation. However, there is a gap between NFE, which is used in DBMSolver, and distillation method, such as CDBM (He et al.) and IBMD (Gushchin et al.), which achieved good I2I results with 2 or 1 NFE. In particular, Table 5 and 6 in IBMD show that the distillation models achieve very close results to the results, which are reported in Table 2 and 5 in DBMSolver with NFE=6, while using only NFE=2 or NFE=1. The paper lacks of clear discussion of practical results of the proposed training free method in relation to existing fast distillation diffusion bridge models.\n2. Lack of evaluation. The method used only the FID metric to evaluate the image generation quality for 4 image-to-image translation problems: DIODE, edges-to-handbags, face-to-comics, CelebAMask-HQ. In DBIM and DDBM methods, diffusion bridge models for the problems of DIODE and edges-to-handbags were evaluated with other metrics - paired LPIPS and MSE, and image generation IS. Additional image quality metrics (paired or no-reference) are important in the light of the observation in Section 5.2 of IBMD work, where the authors found that for edges-to-handbags and DIODE-Outdoor image-to-image translation problems the evaluation protocol of DDBM and DBIM leads to report of FID on training set, while testing sets are too small for FID computation. \n3. Lack of discussion of existing theoretical results regarding exponential integrator for bridge diffusion models with the proposed Proposition 1 and 2. The novelty of the proposed theoretical results should be highlighted in relation to existing methods, which apply exponential integrator theory for data-to-data translation models with diffusion bridges. In particular, the results of Proposition 1 and 2 in DBMSolver seem to be very close to the results of Proposition 3.2 in Bridge-TTS work of Chen et al. \n4. Lack of ablation studies. Since the DBMSolver mixes steps from Bridge ODE and Bridge SDE solutions, there is a question which formulation provides better practical results. In particular, authors used $k = 2$ for Bridge ODE, but didn't explore the option $k = 2$ for Bridge SDE. I also expect that Bridge SDE formulation provides a diversity, which is important for multimodal image-to-image translation problems (see also Table 1 and Table 2 in BBDM). The explanation behind the choice of Bridge ODE instead of Bridge SDE would explain the method better. \n\nReferences:\n\nCDBM - Consistency Diffusion Bridge Models.

Building on this insight, they propose DBMSolver, a novel ODE-based diffusion bridge sampler that eliminates the need for stochastic sampling while maintaining high fidelity.
