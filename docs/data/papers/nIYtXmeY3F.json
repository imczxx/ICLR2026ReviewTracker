I think the authors should carefully address each of the following weaknesses.\n\n1. For example, this paper focuses on using endgame positions to identify adversarial positions. However, it is not clear why it only investigates endgame positions, which are relatively easy positions. Furthermore, it is also not clear how these discovered endgame positions help.\n\n2. Although chess has an extensive endgame database, the proposed method should not be limited to endgame scenarios and the chess environment. It would be convincing to incorporate other games (e.g., Go, Hex, Othello) to demonstrate the generalizability.\n\n3. Studies on adversarial in board games have been widely investigated, and some of them can also generate the adversarial position or policy [1-2]. Their approach can also automatically discover adversarial positions without the limitation to endgame positions. The paper should carefully review these backgrounds, explicitly describe the differences between the proposed methods and previous methods, and even compare the approaches in the experiments.\n\n[1] Lan, Li-Cheng, et al. \"Are alphazero-like agents robust to adversarial perturbations?.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 11229-11240.\n\n[2] Wang, Tony Tong, et al. \"Adversarial policies beat superhuman Go AIs.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2023.\n\n4. The paper lacks an analysis of the number of different clusters identified by each sampling method. The experiment results indicate that the Uniform Sampling method is underperforming, while AS-LE is outperforming. This suggests that the improvement of AS-LE is limited to similar positions in the same cluster, rather than increasing the number of clusters. A comparison of cluster diversity across sampling methods would be more convincing."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Please address each concern raised in the weaknesses.\n\n2. What's the motivation of this work? Why is this work mainly focusing on endgames? Can it be applied to other games without the endgame database? How can these discovered endgame positions benefit future research?\n\n3. The part of \"Intra-Engine Transferability\" and results show that transferability decreases as the difference between search-node budgets grows. Intuitively, the adversarial chess positions that fool a stronger engine (high simulation) should also mislead a weaker one (low simulation), implying high transfer from weak to strong. However, the results show the opposite trend. Providing a deeper analysis would be helpful.\n\n4.  Section 6.2 refers to Figure 7, but no Figure 7 appears in the paper.
