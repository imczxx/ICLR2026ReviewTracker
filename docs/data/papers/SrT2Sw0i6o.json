Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians within the view frustum remains roughly constant. Leveraging this temporal correlation, we propose a temporal-aware LoD search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the remaining rendering stages. For the remaining rendering process, we accelerate the bottleneck stage, rasterization, via preemptive $\\alpha$-filtering. With all optimizations above, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices.

Inconsistent description of splatting and rasterization. The manuscript presents inconsistent descriptions of the rendering stages, alternating between 'search and splatting' and 'search and rasterization'. \nIt would be better to use consistent terminology throughout the paper, preferably standardizing on either 'rasterization' or 'splatting' when referring to this stage.\n\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY  \n1. Confusing description of Fully-Streaming LoD Tree Traversal. It appears that the proposed method is an improved implementation of the naïve LoD Tree Traversal rather than a newly introduced strategy. It would be helpful to first present the baseline LoD Tree Traversal and discuss its limitations, then explain how the proposed traversal improves efficiency.\n2. Theoretical power decay. Although the experimental power decay is shown in Fig. 7, it would strengthen the paper to include a theoretical analysis. Specifically, the theoretical minimum value of power decay could be derived from the maximum distance between the projected Gaussian center and the pixels.\n3. The difference between preemptive α-filtering and direct Gaussian filtering. Please clarify the difference between preemptive α-filtering and filtering Gaussians with low opacity during the culling stage.\n\n\nEVALUATION\n1. Experimental setup.
