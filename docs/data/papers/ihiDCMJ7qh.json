While graph-based models excel at capturing molecular topology, they operate on a single atomic scale, overlooking crucial higher-order information from functional groups and spatial geometry like bond angles. To address this, we propose ECHO, a multi-scale graph learning framework that hierarchically integrates information from atom-level topology, functional-group semantics, and bond-angle geometry. ECHO introduces a hierarchical cross-scale attention mechanism for bidirectional information flow between fine-grained and coarse-grained graph representations, enabling mutual refinement. To further synthesize these diverse features, a novel hypergraph fusion module is designed to capture high-order interactions. Extensive experiments show that ECHO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the significant advantage of its multi-scale approach and offering new insights into the interplay between different structural scales in molecular representation learning.

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2019.\n\n3.Details regarding functional group-related methods are severely lacking:\n\n    3.1 The distinction between molecular fragments and functional groups: The paper does not explicitly define the specific meaning of \"functional group\" as used herein. In cheminformatics, a \"functional group\" refers to a specific chemical moiety (e.g., hydroxyl group -OH) possessing particular chemical properties, whereas \"molecular fragments\" may broadly encompass any substructure. Does the paper refer to strictly defined functional groups or broader \"molecular fragments\" obtained through algorithms (e.g., ring-breaking)? This ambiguity in definition directly impacts the reproducibility and comparability of the methodology.\n\n    3.2 Definition, Library, and Number of Functional Groups: The paper mentions \"build a functional group graph from the RDKit mol object and the atom graph\" but provides no elaboration whatsoever: (1) Which specific functional group definition library was used (e.g., RDKit's built-in, PubChem's, etc.)? Or were custom rules employed? (2) How many distinct functional groups were actually identified and utilized in the model? How does this number impact model complexity and performance? \n\n    3.3 For metal complexes or inorganic compounds (e.g., silicon- or phosphorus-containing molecules), does the functional group definition method described in the paper remain applicable? If not, the model's universality would be severely limited. The paper provides no clarification on this point, constituting a significant omission."}, "questions": {"value": "1.How is the accuracy of automatically identified functional groups from molecules ensured? Are there validation steps? If identification errors occur, how significantly do they impact model performance? These uncertainties remain unevaluated.\n\n2.Why use only MACCS fingerprints? The paper selects MACCS fingerprints for initializing functional group nodes but fails to explain why MACCS was chosen over other fingerprints (e.g., MorganFP, ECFP). As a predefined, substructure-based key-type fingerprint, do its 166 bits optimally represent the semantic meaning of functional groups? Were experiments conducted to compare how different fingerprints characterize functional group nodes? The absence of this justification makes the feature selection appear arbitrary.\n\n3.Dissolution experiments demonstrate performance degradation upon removal of functional group/geometric information, yet the paper merely concludes that \"the module is important\". The paper fails to deeply analyze why the model performs better with functional groups added. Is it because functional groups themselves provide strong discriminative features, or because heterogeneous graph structures facilitate better message passing? In which specific cases (e.g., distinguishing isomers, identifying active sites) does functional group information play a crucial role? The lack of case studies and attribution makes the advantages of \"multiscale fusion\" appear vague.\n\n4.Despite ablation experiments, validation of the method's core components remains insufficient. For instance, regarding the collaborative readout module, comparisons were limited to \"with\" versus \"without\" scenarios, lacking contrast with more complex readout approaches such as Set Transformers [R1] or other hypergraph pooling methods [R2]. This makes it difficult to demonstrate its superiority.\n\n[R1] Lee et al. Set Transformer: A Framework for Attention-based Permutation-Invariant Neural Networks. ICML 2019.\n\n[R2] Feng et al.

Fundamental contradictions in core module descriptions. In the key “synergistic readout” section, the threshold-based discrete hypergraph construction method described in the main text and the distance-based continuous fusion scheme derived in the appendix are two completely different algorithms.\n2. Inconsistencies in model architecture description: The manuscript first states that two separate heterogeneous graphs are constructed, yet the subsequent attention update formulas require atom nodes to simultaneously receive information from both functional group and bond-angle nodes, implying a single unified graph structure.\n3. Incomplete methodological justification: There is a lack of comparative experiments with the most relevant baseline models, such as methods that enhance multi-scale features on homogeneous graphs, making it impossible to convincingly demonstrate the gains brought specifically by the heterogeneous graph structure rather than by multi-modal information alone."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The manuscript does not sufficiently justify why a heterogeneous graph structure is necessary, rather than simply enhancing a homogeneous graph by incorporating multi-scale information into node features (e.g., concatenating functional group and geometric embeddings). The lack of comparative experiments with such an enhanced homogeneous graph baseline makes it impossible to conclude that the observed performance gains stem from the heterogeneous graph structure itself, rather than merely from the inclusion of multi-modal information. Moreover, the authors’ rationale for not conducting ablation experiments, stating that “without this information, the model is no different from GAT”, is invalid. The proper comparison should involve adding these features to the nodes within a standard GAT.\n2. The description of the hypergraph convolution readout method is severely unclear:\n(1) The manuscript does not clearly specify whether the “vectors” used to construct the hypergraph are graph-level global representation vectors or the set of embeddings of all nodes. If the former, constructing a hypergraph from only four vectors is overly arbitrary and lacks theoretical justification; if the latter, the authors should explain how the computational complexity arising from a large number of nodes is handled.\n(2) The threshold-based discrete hypergraph construction method described in the main text is non-differentiable and cannot support end-to-end training. In contrast, the appendix derivation uses a continuous distance matrix, which is differentiable but deviates from the hypergraph construction logic described in the main text. These two approaches differ fundamentally in both mathematical basis and implementation, constituting a critical contradiction.\n(3) The mechanism for choosing the similarity threshold is not explained, and it is unclear whether its manual setting has any theoretical justification. The hypergraph convolution formula lacks a weight matrix and normalization, posing risks of numerical instability. Additionally, the chemical rationale for “connect if similar” is not discussed, leaving open the possibility of introducing invalid edges.\n3. Earlier in the manuscript, it is stated that two separate heterogeneous graphs are constructed. However, the subsequent attention formulas require atom nodes to simultaneously receive information from both functional group and bond-angle nodes, implying the existence of a unified heterogeneous graph. This inconsistency between the structural description and the algorithmic design renders the information flow paths completely unclear and must be clarified.\n4. Regarding the fusion mechanism for the final model representation, the manuscript exhibits serious logical confusion and missing descriptions. The “gated fusion” module mentioned in the Introduction is completely absent in the Methods section, and the overall workflow depicted in Figure 2 (first performing graph feature fusion, then synergistic readout) fundamentally conflicts with the textual description in the Introduction, which states that the graph readout is added to the Morgan fingerprint.\n5. At the end of Chapter 1, the statement “In this chapter, we will illustrate how our model is composed and how it works” appears. However, this content actually belongs to Chapter 2 (METHODS). It is recommended to move it to the corresponding chapter to maintain a rigorous manuscript structure.\n6.
