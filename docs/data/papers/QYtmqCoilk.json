A prevailing viewpoint posits that edges with highly negative curvature will induce graph bottlenecks and the over-squashing phenomenon. In this paper, we critically re-examine this view and put forward our central claim: **high negative curvature is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for over-squashing**. We first construct a family of counterexamples demonstrating the failure of discrete curvature, where some edges are severely squashed, but the curvature still appears positive. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate that the most commonly used discrete curvature measure --- Ollivier–Ricci curvature --- fails to detect as many as 30%~40% of over-squashed edges. To alleviate this limitation, we propose Weighted Augmented Forman-3 Curvature ($\\mathsf{WAF3}$), which significantly improves the detection of over-squashed edges. Additionally, we develop a highly efficient approximation algorithm for $\\mathsf{WAF3}$, enabling curvature computation on graphs with five million edges in only 23.6 seconds, which is 133.7 times faster than the existing algorithm with the lowest complexity for curvatures.", "tldr": "high negative curvature is not a necessary condition for over-squashing", "keywords": ["Discrete Curvature", "Over-squashing", "GNNs"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/701633289ee1f146fcd31e2bc239de4439d46552.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper challenges the common assumption that discrete curvature is a reliable proxy for detecting over-squashing in GNNs, showing via a family of counterexample graphs and formal results that many severely squashed edges can still have positive curvature—so high negative curvature is sufficient but not necessary for over-squashing. To quantify this gap, the authors introduce MOSR, a metric that counts the fraction of truly over-squashed edges missed by a curvature rule; across models and 21 datasets, Ollivier–Ricci misses roughly 30–40% of such edges, and a betweenness analysis indicates that curvature mostly finds “bridge” edges while often ignoring in-cluster bottlenecks. They then propose Weighted Augmented Forman-3 (WAF3), a degree-weighted refinement that theoretically avoids the counterexamples and empirically reduces MOSR relative to prior curvatures while retaining low complexity.

It shows solid technical quality through explicit counterexamples, theoretical guarantees for the proposed WAF3 variant, and careful complexity considerations, including an equivalent weighted-Jaccard view and a MinHash-based approximation that makes large-scale computation practical. The presentation is clear: definitions, constructions, and algorithms are spelled out with enough detail to reproduce both the counterexamples and the fast estimator.

The novelty of WAF3 also needs sharper positioning: prior work on curvature-based structural encodings (e.g., “Effective structural encodings via local curvature profiles”) should be cited in the introduction and connections to other works that use (weighted) augmented Forman–Ricci variants (e.g., “Augmentations of Forman’s Ricci curvature and their applications in community detection”) should be cited and discussed."}, "questions": {"value": "Could you provide intervention-based validation showing that using WAF3 to guide rewiring, edge weighting, or attention bias leads to consistent gains in downstream GNN performance versus Ollivier–Ricci and prior Forman variants, with compute-matched baselines, multiple seeds, and analyses of where improvements concentrate (e.g., non-bridge bottlenecks)?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "kqNBwWjkpa", "forum": "QYtmqCoilk", "replyto": "QYtmqCoilk", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7280/Reviewer_QN1W"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7280/Reviewer_QN1W"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7280/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761245207342, "cdate": 1761245207342, "tmdate": 1762919407559, "mdate": 1762919407559, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper argues that having a negative discrete curvature (e.g., Ollivier–Ricci, Forman variants) is not a necessary condition for over-squashing in GNNs.

MPNN is a generalization of GCN. This is problematic since most of the results in over-squashing in the previous literature are for MPNNs, while in this paper, they’re only true for GCNs. This reduces the scope and impact of the proposed work and diminishes the results in Table 4, since the theoretical understanding is only available for GCN.\n- Similarly, multiple formal statements (Lemma 2, Theorem 5) say “Assume an L-layer MPNN as in (1).” But Eq. (1) is the symmetric-normalized GCN layer with ReLU; it is not a general MPNN. The proofs that rely on the exact matrix M therefore apply to GCN-style propagation; generalizations would require additional conditions on the aggregation kernels.\n- The last part of Section 4 lacks clear intuition on how over-squashing relates to bottlenecks and how this differs from “bridges”. Prior theory (e.g., Topping et al.) does not imply that removing bottlenecks eliminates over-squashing, yet the paper does not provide a concrete narrative or example to reconcile this. In particular, the manuscript does not illustrate what an intra-cluster over-squashed edge looks like (low betweenness, still over-squashed) or explain the mechanisms that make it over-squashed despite no obvious bottleneck. This gap makes the conceptual contribution harder to follow and weakens the takeaways of Section 4.\n- The choice of the Forman-3 curvature for the extension seems arbitrary. Indeed, the balance Forman w/o 4-cycle and the Jost-Liu Forman have the same complexity as the Augmented Forman-3 according to Table 1. However, those are not compared in Table 2, and we don’t know if these other two computationally efficient metrics are better or worse than the Forman-3 curvature.\n- I understood the reasoning behind Figure 4, but I feel it’s also important to compare the efficient version of the proposed curvature in terms of MOSR, as in Table 4. This new version might be more efficient, but the main point of this paper is to avoid missing the over-squashed edges where the curvature is positive, and if this is not the case for the efficient formulation, why should one go with this alternative? If the important point is the ordering (I agree with the authors on this), why should one choose this approach over something that achieves the correct rank, while being perhaps more efficient?\n\n\n**General comment**: This is a timely paper, but two pieces are missing to make the contribution fully convincing. (1) The manuscript does not clearly connect the proposed most efficient curvature variant to the central claim of the paper (reducing missed over-squashed edges). Please make the causal chain explicit: why this efficient metric preserves the ordering or detection properties that matter for oversquashing, and how that supports the paper’s main thesis. (2) The paper lacks a large-scale, real-world evaluation demonstrating impact. A straightforward way to address this is to plug the efficient curvature into an existing rewiring pipeline and report results on a sparse OGB node property benchmark—e.g., ogbn-products or ogbn-papers100M—including both accuracy and compute (runtime/memory). This would substantiate scalability claims and show that the efficiency gains translate into practical benefits without undermining effectiveness.\n\n\n**Minor comments:**\n\n- Line 58: “This theorem…”, which theorem?
