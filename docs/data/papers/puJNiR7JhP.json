Instead, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) methods offer an alternative solution to generate promising results using high-quality reference (Ref) images to guide reconstruction. However, existing RefSR datasets focus on limited scene types, primarily featuring\nhuman activities and architectural scenes. Plant scenes exhibit complex textures and fine details, essential for advancing RefSR in natural and highly detailed scenes. To this end, we meticulously captured and manually selected high-quality images containing rich textures to construct a large-scale plant dataset, PlantRSR, comprising 16,585 HR–Ref pairs. The dataset captures the complexity and variability of plant scenes through extensive variations. In addition, we propose a novel RefSR method specifically designed to tackle the distinct challenges posed by plant imagery. It incorporates a Selective Key-Region Matching (SKRM) that selectively identifies and performs matching between LR and Ref images, focusing on distinctive botanical textures to improve matching efficiency. Additionally, a Texture-Guided Diffusion Module (TGDM) is proposed to refine LR textures by leveraging a diffusion process conditioned on the matched Ref textures. TGDM is effective in modeling irregular and fine textures, thereby facilitating more accurate SR results. The proposed method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on our PlantRSR dataset and other Benchmarks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Plant dataset", "Image Super-Resolution", "Reference-based Super-Resolution"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/addf48092b954febc956b86bbcbffe2797414891.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a new reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) method for plant imagery.

The inclusion of the source code strengthens the paper's credibility and reproducibility. However, it is important to release both code and data for full reproducibility.\n\n**New Dataset:**\nThe efforts for constructing a large-scale dataset are appreciated. This RefSR dataset for plant imagery may enable new research about, e.g., agricultural and forestrial imaging techniques.\n\n\n**Effective Method Designs:**\nSKRM demonstrates balanced performance-efficiency, as evidenced by comparisons in Table 2 and Table 8 (Appendix). TGDM also shows clear advantages over existing fusion methods in Table 3."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**1. Dataset and Method Significance:**\nThe significance of introducing a large-scale and domain-specific dataset requires further establishment.\n\n***(1) Downstream Impact:*** \nDemonstrating downstream applications (e.g., improved plant disease detection accuracy) of plant imagery super-resolution would significantly strengthen the practical value of this work.\n\n\n***(2) Generalization:*** \nAn important question is whether learning to address the challenges of RefSR in plant imagery leads to models to generalize. The authors are suggested to investigate whether a model trained (or fine-tuned) on this PlantSR dataset can achieve improved performance on existing non-plant RefSR datasets. This helps demonstrate a broader value of PlantSR towards developing more powerful RefSR approaches.\n\n\n***(3) Dataset Split Rigor:***\nThe extremely high train-test split ratio (around 60:1) choice requires justification. A discussion on how the 100 test images were selected to represent the dataset's diversity and complexity is necessary for a reliable RefSR evaluation for plant imagery.\n\n\n**2. Technical Novelty of TGDM and its Evaluation:**\nWhile TGDM is claimed as one of the major contributions, its technical novelty is limited, as a combination of existing techniques, including the conditional diffusion process (Ho et al., 2020; Li et al. 2024), the Residual State Space Block (Gun et al., 2024), and the sub-pixel convolution (She et al. 2016).\n\n***(1) Incomplete Ablation Study:***\nThe ablation study in Table 3 is incomplete. To evaluate its internal designs, a detailed ablation within the TGDM is required, including the Residual State Space Block and the sub-pixel convolution. Without this, the module feels like a black box where its true novelty remains unclear.\n\n\n***(2) Marginal Gains vs. Computational Cost:***\nThe performance gain from the diffusion step appears marginal (e.g., +0.1PSNR and +0.0007SSIM). Given the well-known computational overhead of diffusion models, a clear analysis of the performance-efficiency trade-off is necessary to justify this choice. What is the additional inference time/FLOPs? Is there any significant visual improvement?\n\n\n***(3) Unfair Comparisons to Diffusion Baselines***\nThe comparisons with diffusion-based methods in Table 9 (Appendix) are unfair, as those methods are not designed or trained for the RefSR task. A fair evaluation would require modifying and training these baselines with the same RefSR framework (using the reference images and the same losses). Without this, the evaluation on the diffusion step of TGDM is not informative.\n\n\n**3. In-Depth Discussion on Limitation:**\nThe authors acknowledge performance degradations in processing dissimilar LR-Ref pairs, which is appreciated. To strengthen the depth of discussion, the authors are suggested to answer:\n(1) To what extent of dissimilarity would the method fail? Would it be possible to use semantic feature distance to measure the dissimilarity and plot performance (PSNR/SSIM) against this metric? This may provide concrete insight into the operational boundaries of their method.\n\n(2) To what extent of degradation would the method suffer when processing unmatched LR-Ref image pairs? Considering diffusion is used in this method, would it generate new and unwanted patterns?\n\n**Justification for Recommendation** This paper presents a new dataset and a new RefSR method, with promising results. Meanwhile, the broader impact of the dataset and the novelty/necessity of TGDM require a more rigorous establishment. The core issue lies in reframing the contribution from \"a good method for plant image RefSR\" to \"a dataset and method that advances the general understanding and capability of RefSR\"."}, "questions": {"value": "**(1) Dataset Impact:** Beyond a new benchmark, can the authors demonstrate the practical impact of the proposed PlantSR dataset? For instance, does using the proposed RefSR method on this data lead to improved performance on a downstream task like plant species classification or disease detection?\n\n**(2) Generalization:** Does training on this plant-specific dataset produce any generalizable knowledge? Please consider reporting results of a model (pre-trained or fine-tuned on PlantSR) evaluated on a standard, non-plant RefSR benchmark (e.g., CUFED5).\n\n**(3) TGDM Novelty & Ablation:** Please provide an internal ablation study (e.g., removing the RSSB, and modifying the conditioning mechanism). Can the authors provide a runtime/FLOPs analysis to justify the cost-to-benefit ratio of the diffusion step inside TGDM?\n\n**(4) Limitations:** Can the authors provide a more quantitative analysis of this method's limitations?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "JGWzc14dFQ", "forum": "puJNiR7JhP", "replyto": "puJNiR7JhP", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18236/Reviewer_VMqn"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18236/Reviewer_VMqn"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18236/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760868153334, "cdate": 1760868153334, "tmdate": 1762927971622, "mdate": 1762927971622, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Aiming at the problems that the existing reference super-resolution (REFRSR) data sets lack the coverage of plant scenes and the existing methods are difficult to deal with the complex texture of plants, this paper proposes a large-scale plant-specific REFRSR data set PlantRSR and the corresponding REFRSR method.
