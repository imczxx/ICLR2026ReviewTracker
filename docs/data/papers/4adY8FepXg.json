While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work, we present \\textbf{Pusa} V1.0, a versatile model that leverages \\textbf{vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA)} to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video diffusion framework. Note that VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means that it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model.\n\\textbf{Unlike conventional methods like Wan-I2V, which finetune a base text-to-video (T2V) model with abundant resources to do image-to-video (I2V), we achieve comparable results in a zero-shot manner after an ultra-efficient finetuning process based on VTA. Moreover, this method also unlocks many other zero-shot capabilities simultaneously, such as start-end frames and video extension ---all without task-specific training. Meanwhile, it keeps the T2V capability from the base model.} Mechanistic analyses also reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial explosion inherent to the vectorized timestep. This work establishes a scalable, efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis, democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.", "tldr": "Pusa proposes a new fintuing paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video diffusion framework, achieving SOTA level performance with unprecedented training efficiency", "keywords": ["Vectorized Timesteps", "Flow Matching", "Temporal Modeling", "Video Generation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/933d915ccf754bf8f5c38aa4200f8bb29b03990d.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/101eab4010e722d6a30c6959f0df0bb3508de64a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Pusa V1.0, a lightweight adaptation for large pretrained text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models that replaces the scalar timestep with a vectorized timestep (one per frame) and learns with a frame-aware flow-matching objective.
