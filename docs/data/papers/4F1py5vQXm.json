To bridge this skills gap, we explore if Large Language Models (LLMs) Agents can translate natural language specifications into secure TFHE code. We introduce a novel, three-phase agentic framework designed to overcome the primary failure points in this process. First, in the Instruction Phase, we automatically refine user queries into a structured Formal Prompt. Second, during the Generation Phase, a specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool provides the agent with accurate API knowledge from TFHE documentation. Finally, in the Feedback Phase, an automated Security Check module analyzes the output for cryptographic flaws and provides targeted feedback for iterative correction. We comprehensively evaluate our framework by testing four LLMs across five programming tasks of increasing difficulty. Our results demonstrate that baseline framework often produce functional but insecure code, while our framework is uniquely superior, consistently generating solutions that are simultaneously compilable, functionally correct, and secure. This work establishes a robust methodology and benchmark for TFHE code generation, demonstrating a viable path toward democratizing secure computation.", "tldr": "We built a three-phase agentic framework that enables Large Language Models to automatically generate secure and functional TFHE code, bridging the expertise gap that currently limits the adoption of privacy-preserving computation.", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Agents", "Code generation", "Fully Homomorphic Encryption", "Retrieval Augmented Generation"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e3dc92c63cad3c54ab5ee692fca20f1f9d5bd84f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces TFHE-CODER, a three-stage agentic framework for secure Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) programming.

The proposed method leverages agentic LLMs with enhancements like RAG and post validation to improve the generation accuracy. However, there are several concerns over the empirical evaluation and technical contributions.\n\nThe evaluation of the proposed method is limited. The benchmark tasks are simple Machine Learning (ML) tasks, which are as simple as vector/matrix multiplications and basic ML models like MLP or CNN. These tasks are often too simple to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as human developers can also easily implement these tasks. It would be more convincing to show the effectiveness of the method on more complex and diverse tasks, including natural language processing models, transformer-based models, and other non-ML tasks. Additionally, the reproducibility of the evaluation is not well demonstrated. Although the paper mentions that the seeds are fixed, the randomness in LLM generation can still lead to variance in results. It would be helpful to repeat each experiment multiple times and report the average performance with confidence intervals.\n\nThere is limited guarantee on the security and functional correctness of the generated TFHE programs. While the post validation step is a safe-guard to filter out incorrect programs, the paper cannot ensure that the validation conditions are correct and comprehensive. For instance, how do we know that the verification conditions in Dafny code are sufficient to eliminate all security vulnerabilities? Also, it is not clear that how the proposed method can ensure that the generated conditions are aligned with the developer's intent. More discussion on these aspects would be helpful.\n\nThe technical contributions of the paper appear incremental. The use of RAG and post validation are not new techniques in the context of LLMs. This work is a simple application of such techniques to the TFHE domain. The contributions would be stronger if such a technique can also extend to other cryptographic domains other than TFHE, such as MPC, partial HE, or ZK proofs."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "pGImVYqN2F", "forum": "4F1py5vQXm", "replyto": "4F1py5vQXm", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21267/Reviewer_er3J"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21267/Reviewer_er3J"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21267/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761977934065, "cdate": 1761977934065, "tmdate": 1762941660579, "mdate": 1762941660579, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the potential of Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate the generation of secure Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) code from natural language.
