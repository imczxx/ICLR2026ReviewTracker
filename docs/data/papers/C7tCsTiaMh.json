To overcome the scarcity of traffic data in emerging cities, recent studies have explored Federated Traffic Knowledge Transfer (FTT), which leverages data-rich source cities to assist data-scarce target cities without raw data sharing. However, existing FTT approaches are limited by three unresolved challenges: (i) potential *privacy leakage* since gradients or parameters generated during federated computing can still be inverted, (ii) severe *cross-city distribution discrepancies* that reduce transfer effectiveness, and (iii) \\textit{low data quality} caused by missing or unreliable sensor readings. To address these challenges, we propose **FedTT**, a novel federated framework for cross-city traffic knowledge transfer with privacy-preserving. FedTT introduces three innovations: (i) a lightweight **Traffic Secret Aggregation (TSA)** protocol that achieves secure knowledge aggregation without sacrificing efficiency or accuracy; (ii) a **Traffic Domain Adapter (TDA)** that explicitly aligns heterogeneous source–target distributions for more effective transfer, and (iii) a **Traffic View Imputation (TVI)** method that leverages spatio-temporal dependencies to complete missing traffic data robustly. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that FedTT achieves significant improvements over 14 state-of-the-art baselines, consistently reducing prediction error while maintaining strong privacy protection.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Traffic Prediction", "Transfer Learning", "Federated Learning"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/acfd2c0eaca567e36b32e920171e9c53cb04e3e8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes FedTT, a federated framework for cross-city traffic knowledge transfer (FTT) that addresses three key challenges in urban traffic prediction: (1) privacy leakage in federated computation, (2) cross-city data distribution discrepancies, and (3) low-quality or incomplete traffic data.

Although the paper uses mutual information for privacy analysis in the appendix, it doesn't appear to have the same strict privacy constraints as differential privacy. For example, the authors don't seem to define what level of privacy leakage is considered safe and what level of privacy leakage is unsafe. The main text seems to show that the proposed method is privacy-preserving empirically rather than using a rigorous theoretical analysis.\n\n- Unverified adversarial resistance: Although this paper evaluates the performance against data reconstruction attacks, it does not provide detailed implementation details of the data reconstruction attacks. The authors need to provide this detail. \n\n- Opaque domain adaptation process: The paper provides no visualization or interpretability analysis of how TDA aligns feature spaces between cities, weakening claims about its efficacy in reducing domain gaps. The authors need to provide more justification.\n\n- Potential instability of GAN-based alignment: The TDA module’s adversarial training may cause instability or mode collapse, especially when source and target cities have large structural differences. The authors need to provide more justification.\n\n- Missing theoretical justification for convergence: The paper does not provide convergence analysis or training stability proof for the combined optimization of TSA, TDA, and TVI modules, leaving open questions about scalability to larger federations.\n\n- Scalability of FedTT needs further consideration: The inability to transfer trained models to unseen cities increases deployment costs, as FedTT must be retrained for each new target city."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "None."}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "hldEY7duTR", "forum": "C7tCsTiaMh", "replyto": "C7tCsTiaMh", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23780/Reviewer_3SfM"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23780/Reviewer_3SfM"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23780/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761387250237, "cdate": 1761387250237, "tmdate": 1762942803095, "mdate": 1762942803095, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes FedTT, a novel federated learning framework for cross-city traffic knowledge transfer that addresses three key challenges: (1) privacy leakage, (2) cross-city distribution discrepancies, and (3) low data quality.

Why these traffic data or traffic prediction related cases/scenarios will have attacker during the inference time and what is the attacker's motivation. Traffic prediction is not like a domain needs strong data privacy.  Who will be the attacker and for what? In the ablation studies, the contribution of the TSA module is also subtle.\n3.

The paper presents a complete and effective framework, with convincing experimental results demonstrating its practical value for cross-city traffic prediction. However, in terms of originality, the method mainly integrates existing components.\n2. Although TSA avoids the use of heavy cryptographic schemes, it is not formally compared to differential privacy (DP) methods, nor is its attack resistance quantitatively analyzed. For fairness, it would be preferable to first align the privacy protection strength under the same threat model, like evaluating resistance to inversion attacks before comparing the resulting utility. This would provide a more objective assessment of TSA’s real advantage in the privacy–utility trade-off.\n3. The writing in several parts of the paper lacks rigor and occasionally overstates the contribution. For instance, the statement after line 182 “Existing federated traffic transfer methods often overlook the challenges associated with low-quality traffic data...” is inaccurate. In reality, numerous prior studies, including recent works on federated traffic prediction and cross-domain transfer, have explicitly addressed low-quality or missing traffic data. Such phrasing may give the impression of exaggerating the novelty of this work. Similar issues appear multiple times throughout the paper.
