For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to generalize.\nWe introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal (*what* it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (*how* it is executed). Experiments show that\nour method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4\\% on Mind2Web and 13.9\\% on unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20\\%. (3) In self-exploration settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work across different sites. \nBy enabling the agent to identify and refine its own goals, the \\ours enhance the agent a better curriculum, leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of continual learning in adaptive environments.", "tldr": "We proposed PolySkill, a framework that guides Web Agents to induce skills that is generalized and transfer better across different websites, unlike existing methods that produce over-specialized, non-transferable skills.", "keywords": ["Skill Induction", "Agent", "Polymorphism", "Continual Learning", "Large Language Models"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0ff9d09983a4d1c3bf855d1c268f8262982ac0bc.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a method to induce skills that transfer across websites, by decoupling their abstract goals and concrete implementations.

Writing Clarity Issue: confusing concepts of “websites” and “domains”.**\n> Different websites do not necessarily associate with in-domain and out-of-domain. Two websites can either belong to the same domain (e.g., both United and Spirit Airlines are for traveling) or not (e.g., Amazon for shopping and United for traveling). That being said, this paper aims to induce skills that transfer across websites, but it is unclear (at least from the intro) if these are websites within the same domain or across different domains.\nFurther, from the experiments, the proposed method only works for websites in-domain, so claiming its effectiveness in out-of-domain scenarios lacks evidence.\n\n**2. Missing Skill Count Measures.** \n> While the success rate and efficiency gains are promising, the paper fails to report the number of skills (abstract class and specialized implementations). Ensuring a small number of skills is important as it avoids redundancy in the skill library. The very low number of steps introduces concerns that there may be one skill unnecessarily targeting each specific example, instead of trying to capture shared similarities across examples. Reporting this dimension, similar to Table 3 in [1,] would help address this concern.\n\n**3.
