Yet in cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, focuses narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific complexities, and lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for trading applications. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \\textbf{CTBench}, the first \\textbf{C}ryptocurrency \\textbf{T}ime series generation \\textbf{Bench}mark. It curates an open-source dataset of 452 tokens and evaluates models across 13 metrics spanning forecasting accuracy, rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-task evaluation framework: the Predictive Utility measures how well synthetic data preserves temporal and cross-sectional patterns for forecasting, while the Statistical Arbitrage assesses whether reconstructed series support mean-reverting signals for trading. We systematically benchmark eight state-of-the-art models from five TSG families across four market regimes, revealing trade-offs between statistical quality and real-world profitability. Notably, CTBench provides ranking analysis and practical guidance for deploying TSG models in crypto analytics and trading applications.

All TSG models' generated data are used with the same XGBoost model for downstream prediction. Different TSG models may be better suited for different types of predictors as some models like Transformer are more sensitive to long-term dependencies, so using a fixed predictor may introduce evaluation bias and fail to fully reflect the generality of the generated data.\n3.
