However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel, predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence.\nOur framework makes two primary contributions:  the **Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP)**, a computationally efficient ($O(N\\log N)$)  and task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given forecasting instance, and the **Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR)**, a frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of \"predictability drift'', demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over time.  Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift, moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful, predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a deeper understanding of model behavior.

This is atypical in practice (commonly \\(N_h \\neq H\\)) and may bias frequency resolution/weighting. Sensitivity or an extension to unequal lengths is missing.\n\n- Boundary correction handles only mean jump: SCP subtracts a mean mismatch at the split but not slope/curvature changes. If a trend shift occurs at the boundary, the bound can over-attribute error to “unpredictable” power.\n\n- Univariate treatment for inherently multivariate problems: Analyses are largely per-channel.\n\n- Limited model coverage in key figures: Central plots (e.g., per-sample “predictable energy vs. error”) highlight a single baseline (DLinear).

Rigorous theoretical evidence is necessary but lacking to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed metrics over the state-of-the-art standard evaluation metrics.
