Despite recent advances,  forecasting accuracy remains limited due to the challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual features, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCast, a large language model (LLM) driven framework that leverages language-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for context-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a discrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal tokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To effectively bridge the semantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are embedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained LLM, further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives. Building upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are then decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple real-world datasets, whose results reveal the performance of our framework and highlight its potential as a generative framework for multimodal time series forecasting.

The choice of model size contradicts typical expectations for LLM usage and requires further explanation.\n\n- The multi-stage training process (e.g., symbolic discretization, cross-modal alignment, and generative fine-tuning) introduces significant computational overhead. It seems that each stage requires separate optimization. The training cost and efficiency of this approach compared to existing baselines are not adequately discussed.\n\n- The overall design of the framework lacks novelty.

The discussion of related work on contextual information integration could be strengthened. While many existing approaches incorporate numeric contextual signals to enhance forecasting, the integration of unstructured contextual information requires cross-modal alignment strategies. Several recent studies have explored this direction; however, this emerging line of work is not sufficiently discussed or contrasted with TokenCast.\n2. In line 181, the paper states that RevIN may risk leaking future information. However, this claim might not be fully justified, as RevIN typically computes normalization statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) based only on the lookback window within the input sequence.\n3. In line 82, the paper states that it is unclear whether time series forecasting can be addressed through autoregressive generation over discrete tokens. However, this direction has been explored in prior work. For example, Chronos and AutoTimes both employ a decoder-only architecture and transform numeric time series into discrete tokens via value-based quantization."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

However, in Figure 2, the textual tokens appear in front of the time series tokens, which seems inconsistent.\n3.
