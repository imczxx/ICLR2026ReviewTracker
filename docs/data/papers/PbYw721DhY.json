Recently, single-cell foundation models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and clustering tasks. \nHowever, these models are limited to discrete prediction heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need.\nWe introduce Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity, tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to unseen cells.\nEmpirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.  These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of unseen cells.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["AI for Science", "Large Language Model", "Multimodality", "Bioinformatics"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/069ea67150b914b1c69c0eea35f9138be4573ed4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Cell2Text, a multimodal generative system that converts single-cell RNA-seq profiles into structured natural language summaries, addressing the limits of discrete prediction heads that reduce cellular complexity to fixed labels.

The current design, which feeds gene embeddings directly into the system prompt of the LLM, lacks a clear biological or computational rationale. Since the system prompt is meant for textual instructions rather than numerical embeddings, this configuration is not meaningful. Moreover, the “Sequence embeddings” input format does not specify which embeddings correspond to which genes, making it impossible for the LLM to infer the biological context or interpret the underlying signals. A more explicit mapping or token-level alignment between gene identifiers and embeddings would be required for interpretability and reproducibility.\n\n2. Restricting the base language model to Meta-Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and Gemma3-4B-it significantly limits the expressive capacity and reasoning ability of the framework. Larger models, such as Llama-3.1-70B, Gemma-27B, or equivalent-scale open-weight LLMs—could substantially enhance biological text generation and cross-modal understanding. The architecture should therefore be designed to support flexible integration with larger instruction-tuned models to fully exploit the potential of multimodal learning.\n\n3. Text Generation Evaluation Scope\nThe evaluation of text generation quality using broad metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore is overly general. Instead, it would be more informative to benchmark specific task-oriented generation capabilities, such as functional annotation summarization, disease association reasoning, or pathway interpretation. Furthermore, cell description generation need not be constrained to a single textual annotation per cell—multiple complementary textual outputs (e.g., morphology-focused, pathway-focused, or disease-context summaries) could capture richer biological semantics.\n\n4. Baselines for Cell Type Annotation\nThe comparison with baseline models omits key categories of state-of-the-art methods:\n\nTraditional annotation models: such as ACTINN, CellTypist, and scDeepSort, which remain strong supervised benchmarks for cell type identification.\n\nLLM-based approaches: including LangCell, CellWhisperer, CELLama, Cell2Sentence, and Cell2Sentence-Scale, which represent the most relevant recent multimodal and text-generative frameworks in this domain.\nIncluding these baselines would provide a more comprehensive and credible performance comparison."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Leveraging LLMs for single-cell transcriptomic data should take advantage of their large context windows to encode all expressed genes, rather than limiting input to 4,096 genes. Highly expressed genes are not necessarily biologically meaningful, like housekeeping genes, for instance, can dominate expression without contributing to cellular identity.\n\n2. The claim that a two-layer feedforward network with non-linear activation can preserve biological nuances lacks theoretical justification. It is unclear how such a simple projection adequately maps complex gene-level embeddings into the natural language semantic space.\n\n3. The output of the modality adapter is ambiguous. If the input consists of 4,096 gene embeddings, does the adapter output the same number of projected embeddings, or a single aggregated representation? This requires clarification.\n\n4. The choice of relatively small models—Meta-Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and Gemma3-4B-it—is restrictive. Larger instruction-tuned models like Llama-3.1-8B or Llama-3.1-70B would likely provide greater reasoning capacity and biological interpretability.\n\n5. The Geneformer and the LLM do not share a common tokenizer or embedding space, leading to significant distributional mismatch. The proposed modality adapter alone may not be sufficient to fully bridge this gap.\n\n6. It is conceptually flawed to input embeddings into the LLM’s system prompt.
