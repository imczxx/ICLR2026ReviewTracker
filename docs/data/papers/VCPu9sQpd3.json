This limitation is particularly problematic in applications to science and engineering, as complex features can be critical for discovery and analysis. To address this, we introduce Split Component Embedding Registration (SpliCER), a novel architecture which splits the image into sections and distils information from each section to guide the model to learn more subtle and complex features without compromising on simpler features. SpliCER is compatible with any self-supervised loss function and can be integrated into existing methods without modification. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: i) we demonstrate that existing self-supervised methods can learn shortcut solutions when simple and complex features are both present; ii) we introduce a novel self-supervised training method, SpliCER, to overcome the limitations of existing methods, and achieve significant downstream performance improvements; iii) we demonstrate the effectiveness of SpliCER in cutting-edge medical and geospatial imaging settings. SpliCER offers a powerful new tool for representation learning, enabling models to uncover complex features which could be overlooked by other methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multiplex Immunofluorescence", "Simplicity Bias", "Hyperspectral Imaging", "Knowledge Distillation"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/643ebb29f987e4bb594600f1fce9e7f655ad6ef7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/84af4a53d4a9eeac7e3e4e63cb31b6ed6fef0a85.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose Split Component Embedding Registration (SpliCER), a training paradigm in which they split an image into a primary image and different image sections, enforcing learning of features of all sections.

It would be interesting to have the authors evaluate if their method would be compatible with newer methods, in particular, iBOT. This is largely because I believe iBOT, which uses Masked Image Modeling, may show similar behavior: When doing a masked view of the image it may occlude many features (similar to the partial images in this paper), hence learn a diverse set of features as well. Generally I find the amount of baseline methods the authors pair their method with somewhat limited. Additional examples of their method, e.g. with MAEs would be great. \n\nMoreover, I find the datasets the authors evaluate to be somewhat small in scale, and far from a more realistic setting. It would be interesting to see an ImageNet pre-training experiment to compare their performance when encountering prevalent larger-scale image datasets, or maybe a training on one of the larger (>10k Chest X-Ray datasets) to show the method translates. \n\n**Justification**:\nWhile I like the method, the current evaluation lacks baseline pre-training methods and larger-scale datasets to allow judging if the method translates to more real-world pre-training settings and actually works. In particular, an experiment on ImageNet-1k, would be nice to compare how the method translates to larger datasets, and the inclusion of another SSL baseline (iBOT) would be amazing to judge how their method synergizes with more state-of-the-art pre-training methods.

The idea of learning from decomposed inputs and addressing feature learning biases has been extensively explored in prior work:\n   \n   - **Multi-view contrastive learning**: Tian et al. (ECCV 2020, \"Contrastive Multiview Coding\") and Bachman et al. (NeurIPS 2019, \"Learning Representations by Maximizing Mutual Information Across Views\") thoroughly explored learning from multiple views of the same input with information maximization objectives.\n   \n   - **Feature decorrelation and redundancy reduction**: Bardes et al. (ICLR 2022, \"VICReg\") and Zbontar et al. (ICML 2021, \"Barlow Twins\") addressed similar issues of learning diverse features through decorrelation mechanisms.\n   \n   - **Simplicity bias in self-supervised learning**: Shah et al. (NeurIPS 2020, \"The Pitfalls of Simplicity Bias in Neural Networks\") and Robinson et al. (NeurIPS 2021, \"Can Contrastive Learning Avoid Shortcut Solutions?\") systematically analyzed how models learn simple features over complex ones in SSL settings.\n   \n   The distinction from TriDeNT (Farndale et al., 2023b—already cited by authors) is primarily the embedding chunking mechanism, which is a relatively minor architectural modification rather than a fundamental methodological advance. The paper does not clearly articulate what prevents prior methods from achieving similar outcomes.\n\n2. **Weak Theoretical Foundation**:\n   \n   a) **Section 5's gradient analysis is heuristic**: The analysis in Equations 4-6 assumes a \"sufficiently sparse primary projector\" (line 409) such that ∂ē_k/∂θ_{g,j} ≈ 0 for j ≠ k, but this assumption is never formally justified or empirically validated. The authors provide no:\n      - Formal conditions under which this sparsity holds\n      - Empirical measurements showing chunks are actually decoupled\n      - Analysis of what happens when this assumption is violated\n   \n   b) **Information-theoretic claims lack rigor**: \n      - Equation 1 presents an optimization objective based on mutual information (MI), but provides no discussion of how to estimate or optimize these MI terms in practice\n      - The decomposition in Equation 3 into \"superfluous\" and \"predictive\" information is standard information bottleneck analysis\n      - No formal proof that SpliCER avoids the stated issues\n      - The claim that \"features from X_k dominate the predictive information\" leading to bias (lines 415-417) is stated without formal conditions\n   \n   c) **No sample complexity or convergence analysis**: The paper lacks any formal analysis of:\n      - How many samples are needed for SpliCER to be effective\n      - Convergence guarantees\n      - Conditions under which the method provably learns complex features\n\n3. **Problematic Experimental Design**:\n   \n   a) **MNIST-CIFAR is a weak benchmark**:\n      - This is an artificially constructed dataset that doesn't reflect real high-content imaging scenarios\n      - The \"simple\" vs. \"complex\" feature distinction is overly binary and doesn't capture the continuous spectrum of feature complexity in real scientific images\n      - The baseline already achieves 64% on rMNIST (Table 2c), showing it learns both feature types; the improvement to 68.4% is marginal\n      - A model trained on CIFAR alone achieves 72.6%, but SpliCER only reaches 68.4%—why not just train on CIFAR if that's the goal?\n   \n   b) **Insufficient baseline comparisons**:\n      - **No comparison with modern SSL methods**: The paper only compares with VICReg (2022) and SimCLR (2020). Missing comparisons with:\n        - **MAE** (He et al., CVPR 2022, \"Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners\")\n        - **DINO** (Caron et al., ICCV 2021, \"Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers\")\n        - These methods may naturally learn diverse features through their architectures\n      \n      - **The Σ-JE baseline is non-standard**: This baseline is not established in literature, making it difficult to contextualize the contributions. How does SpliCER compare to simply training separate encoders for each component and concatenating representations?\n      \n      - **No ablation against redundancy reduction methods**: Papers like Barlow Twins (Zbontar et al., ICML 2021) explicitly address feature redundancy—how does SpliCER compare?\n   \n  \n\n4. **Critical Missing Ablations**:\n   \n   a) **Chunking strategy**: \n      - Only equal-size chunks are explored\n      - What about non-uniform chunk allocation based on component importance?\n      - How sensitive is performance to chunk size?\n      - What happens with 2, 4, 8, or 16 chunks instead of n=number of components?\n   \n   b) **Number of components (n)**: \n      - No systematic study of how performance scales with n\n      - Does adding more components always help, or is there a point of diminishing returns?\n      - What about computational cost as n increases?\n   \n   c) **Component selection**: \n      - How should users choose which components to use?\n      - What happens if uninformative components are included?\n      - The paper mentions allocating \"more features to informative channels\" (line 481) but never demonstrates this experimentally\n   \n   d) **Comparison with simpler alternatives**:\n      - Would simply augmenting each component separately achieve similar effects?\n      - What about weighted loss functions that emphasize complex features?\n      - Does the method work if you just train on the \"complex\" components directly?\n   \n   e) **Architecture choices**:\n      - Why ResNets specifically? Would Vision Transformers behave differently?\n      - How does projector architecture affect chunk specialization?\n      - No ablation on projector depth, width, or activation functions\n\n\n\n5. **Limited Experimental Scope**:\n   \n   a) **Small-scale experiments only**:\n      - All experiments use relatively small ResNet models\n      - No experiments with modern architectures (ViT, Swin Transformers)\n      - No experiments at scale (ImageNet-scale pretraining)\n      - Unclear how the method scales to foundation models\n   \n   b) **Domain-specific method comparisons missing**:\n      - For spatial proteomics: No comparison with domain-specific methods\n      - For medical imaging: No comparison with medical imaging SSL methods beyond generic VICReg/SimCLR\n      - For hyperspectral: No comparison with remote sensing-specific methods\n   \n   c) **Insufficient evaluation metrics**:\n      - Only downstream classification accuracy is reported\n      - **No analysis of what chunks actually learn**: Are they truly specialized? Is there redundancy?\n      - **No feature visualization**: What do different chunks capture?\n      - Figure 3c shows correlation with marker intensities for Orion-CRC only—what about other datasets?\n      - No analysis of feature diversity, rank, or representational geometry\n\n\n### Minor Issues:\n\n6. **Presentation and Clarity Issues**:\n   \n   \n   a) **Notation inconsistency**:\n      - Both z and e are used for representations/embeddings with unclear distinction\n      - Sometimes \"representation\" and \"embedding\" are used interchangeably\n      - The relationship between z_primary, ē, and ē_j needs clearer exposition\n   \n   \n\n7. **Related Work Limitations**:\n   \n   The paper appropriately cites relevant work on simplicity bias (Shah et al., NeurIPS 2020; Geirhos et al., Nature MI 2020; Robinson et al., NeurIPS 2021), multi-view learning (Bachman et al., NeurIPS 2019; Radford et al., ICML 2021), and self-supervised learning (Bardes et al., ICLR 2022; Chen et al., ICML 2020). However:\n   \n   a) **Insufficient contextualization**: The related work doesn't clearly explain how SpliCER differs from multi-view SSL methods beyond the chunking mechanism\n   \n   b) **Missing recent developments**: No discussion of recent SSL advances like MAE (He et al., CVPR 2022), DINO (Caron et al., ICCV 2021), or their potential applicability to this problem\n   \n   c) **Limited discussion of alternatives**: The paper doesn't discuss why existing approaches to learning diverse features (e.g., Barlow Twins' redundancy reduction) are insufficient"}, "questions": {"value": "Theoretical justification: Can you provide formal theoretical analysis showing when/why SpliCER provably avoids simplicity bias?
