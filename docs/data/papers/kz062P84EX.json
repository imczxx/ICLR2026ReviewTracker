A key insight in this area is that the feature norm gap between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data serves as a strong signal for identifying anomalous inputs. Building on this, we propose an innovative Universal Adversarial Training (UAT) framework that actively enlarges this norm gap. Our method introduces a single, learnable Universal Adversarial Map (UAM) that acts as a global regularizer to address shared vulnerable directions in the model. By regularizing the decision boundaries, this approach enlarges the gaps between ID classes, which enhances the model's generalization and its ability to distinguish OOD data. To further enhance detection at inference, we introduce a Channel-Calibrated Feature Norm (CCFN) scoring mechanism that refines the feature norm by suppressing irrelevant background activations. Our comprehensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that these innovations lead to substantial performance gains across various benchmarks.", "tldr": "We propose a universal adversarial training framework and a channel-amplified scoring strategy to actively enlarge the feature norm gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, significantly improving OOD detection performance.", "keywords": ["Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection", "Adversarial Training"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/24b3f5cb2e1a8ae3b17b9895ed7b286a172534f5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d0901861887c5c221d1226a097617dfd99205c67.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a novel framework aimed at improving out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by focusing on the feature norm gap between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data.

In Equation (2), the optimization objective of UAT is formulated as a max-min problem, which learns the universal adversarial map $L_{adv}$. However, the interaction between the cross-entropy loss and the adversarial perturbation in the objective function is not sufficiently explained, especially regarding how the perturbation alters the decision boundary. The method aims to regularize the model by pushing the decision boundary outwards, but the specific mechanism by which the adversarial map affects the decision boundary, particularly concerning class separation and feature compactness, is not fully articulated.\n2.  The paper introduces a channel-wise feature norm recalibration method in Equation (5), where the feature norm is calculated by averaging the squared norms of each rescaled channel. While the idea of emphasizing channels with high activation values is intuitive, the paper does not explain why this specific norm aggregation method (i.e., averaging across channels) is the most effective. Specifically, using the maximum activation value ($w_{c}=max_{h,w}ReLU(f_{c,h,w})$) to rescale the contribution of each channel may not always capture the most discriminative features, especially in complex datasets where activation values might vary more subtly across spatial locations. An alternative approach, such as considering the variance or higher-order moments of activations, might provide a more robust recalibration. A deeper exploration of why this specific method was chosen and a comparison with other possible aggregation strategies would help clarify its effectiveness.\n3.  The paper focuses on improving OOD detection performance but does not discuss the model's interpretability. Given the involvement of adversarial training, understanding how the universal adversarial map and channel recalibration affect the model's decision-making process would be beneficial."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can the authors provide a more in-depth analysis or visualization to specifically demonstrate how $L_{adv}$ (as described in Lemmas 1 and 2) leads to more compact intra-class features and more separated inter-class features?\n2.

How did their performance compare to the current method?\n3. Can the authors provide some analysis on interpretability? For instance, do the patterns learned by the UAM ($L_{adv}$) help in identifying specific input features?
