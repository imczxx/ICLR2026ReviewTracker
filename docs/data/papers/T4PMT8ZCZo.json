Current carbon accounting methods for large-scale AI models suffer from three key limitations: they overlook embodied carbon (from hardware manufacturing) or model it simplistically, rely on location-based carbon attribution that fails to reflect individual corporate efforts to decarbonize (e.g., via Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)), and are deterministic, ignoring inherent uncertainties. This paper proposes CarbonPPA, an uncertainty-aware carbon accounting model with market-based attribution for large-scale AI models. CarbonPPA integrates market-based carbon intensity to accurately account for the impact of PPAs and employs probabilistic modeling to capture uncertainties in the carbon accounting for AI models arising from spatiotemporal variations in manufacturing and operation, as well as evolving efficiency. We develop a comprehensive carbon dataset by aggregating related data from diverse sources, then we implement a simple yet effective Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) to the distribution of the parameters from the collected dataset. We compare CarbonPPA with LLMCarbon, the state-of-the-art carbon accounting model. The deviation of the accounting result is significant, reaching up to 251.58%", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["embodied carbon", "carbon footprint", "large-scale AI models"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fea05104c070a1c09da9c6f03010d3c087034c7d.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9f0712f19035a26f5d623e97cbeaa93fe8b20344.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes CarbonPPA, a novel carbon accounting framework for large-scale AI models that incorporates market-based attribution via Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and models both embodied and operational emissions probabilistically.

This directly addresses a pressing gap as AI workloads grow and Scope 2 guidance evolves.\n\n**Rich Empirical Evaluation** The paper evaluates four representative large models (XLM, T5, GPT-3, Switch) across spatial (265 regions) and temporal dimensions, showing large deviations from LLMCarbon. The released dataset (256 regions, 51 GPUs, 50 CPUs, PPA shares, etc.) is a valuable community resource.\nSound Methodology & Reproducibility: KDE-based distributional modeling of key parameters (yield, EPS, CIres) is technically solid; appendices provide full equations, data sources, and open-source code, enabling replication and extensions."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Weakness 1. Limited Ablation & Sensitivity Analysis.** While the aggregate deviations are large, the paper does not isolate the marginal contribution of (i) market-based vs. location-based attribution, (ii) embodied vs. operational uncertainty, or (iii) individual distributional assumptions. A factorial or Sobol sensitivity analysis would clarify which modeling choices drive the reported ranges.\n\n**Weakness 2. Scarcity of Real PPA & Residual-Mix Data** For most regions the authors set CIres = CIl due to missing residual-mix data; the “50 % & 90 % PPA” scenarios are illustrative rather than empirical. This weakens the practical claim that CarbonPPA “accurately” reflects corporate renewables investments; results may change once actual residual mixes are published.\n\n**Weakness 3. Narrow Hardware & Manufacturing Coverage** Embodied modeling focuses on processors, DRAM, and SSDs, but omits networking equipment, cooling, buildings, and packaging lines which can be 30–50 % of total embodied emissions (per recent LCA studies). Yield distributions are taken from public defect-density trends rather than fab-specific data, potentially under-estimating true variability."}, "questions": {"value": "see weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "GQfZYh4B06", "forum": "T4PMT8ZCZo", "replyto": "T4PMT8ZCZo", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17185/Reviewer_xchG"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17185/Reviewer_xchG"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17185/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761904717129, "cdate": 1761904717129, "tmdate": 1762927161651, "mdate": 1762927161651, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "hMZAnSFqQb", "forum": "T4PMT8ZCZo", "replyto": "T4PMT8ZCZo", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17185/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17185/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762929047455, "cdate": 1762929047455, "tmdate": 1762929047455, "mdate": 1762929047455, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware carbon accounting model with market-based attribution for large-scale AI models.
