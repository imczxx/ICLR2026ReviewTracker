The text in Fig. 1 is hard to read. Since the figure is not complicated, I recommend using a larger font size.\n2. I have reservations about the soundness of both contributions of this paper.\n\n    i) For the proposed dataset, the number of samples seems too small to adequately represent the three tasks, especially given the additional subtasks under each. Moreover, since the dataset is divided by tasks, it is unclear whether these tasks comprehensively capture the concept of context modification, or whether they are representative enough for context modification. Additionally, using cross-entropy to measure text fluency may be somewhat outdated, despite its high correlation with human judgments. The authors may consider complementing it with learned metrics, which can really measure the deeper semantic appropriateness and contextual coherence.\n\n    ii) For the two enhancement to EPO, first the authors should briefly introduce the core idea of EPO in the introduction. Second, without an explanation of why you chose EPO for improvement, these enhancements would seem random or incremental. Third, the implementation is relatively simple and heavily relies on GPT-4o and LLaDA. Will these variants still work well without such powerful auxiliary models? If not, why not directly build on these models instead?\n3. The experimental comparison is not convincing. A GPT-4o-assisted variant is naturally more fluent than its baseline and more task-effective than GPT-4o itself.

Which task?\n- The paper is not particularly easy to read in some parts; the flow of the paper could be significantly improved. A few more concrete examples, although the same thing applies for the actual flow ideas:\n\t1. Why is there a \"Background\" and \"Related Work\" section? It looks like they belong within the same section.\n\t2. There's a subsection (4.1) with no content on it, only on its subsubsections. Can't\n they just be subsections on their own?\n \t3. SAE is never defined in the main body of the paper, only on the appendices, Figure 13 where the role of the LLM is defined. EPO is defined both in the abstract and main body, but the acronym is used in the main body of the paper before being defined on page 3 (line 109). \n- One of the core contributions of this paper is the ContextBench benchmark, yet there is not discussion on relevant/related benchmarks that a future reader might want to look into as well. For example, how do the Story inpainting tasks relate to, or could be used on existing literature? On the same note, recent work on inpainting such as \"Inpainting-Guided Policy Optimization for Diffusion Large Language Models\" use mathematics datasets, could a paper like this benefit from using this benchmark as well?\n- The paper proposes two proposed methods seem to rely quite heavily on EPO, however there is no description or details provided, or related work regarding this method. Simultaneously, there is very little detail provided on the two methods the authors propose. From reading the short descriptions provided, they seem like a trivial modification of EPO, but this perception might be incorrect and possibly arising from the lack of information provided. I believe three short paragraphs on two core contributions of a paper is not sufficient to fully understand such a core component of the research presented here.\n- In my opinion, adding one or two additional methods to evaluate the two proposed methods against would be quite important. Relying solely on GCG, Human evaluations and GPT-4o as a baseline seems insufficient to me. A broad description of the participants/human evaluators would be desirable (age group, education level, etc.)\n- The human evaluation was conducted using solely two annotators, which seems insufficient.\n- [Suggestion] Increasing the font size on Figure 1 would improve readability\n- [Suggestion] A table summarizing the results on the Backdoor task would be useful (i.e., not in the appendix, since it's a core result)."}, "questions": {"value": "- Why use cross-entropy as a fluency metric if, as the authors recognize, it is an imperfect approach? What alternatives should readers consider? Why not use perplexity as a model fluency metric?\n- I am curious on the choice of GCG as a solution for the tasks in your benchmarks; I was aware of this method as a jailbreaking approach, designed to introduce \"nonsensical\" prefixes to prompts that would enable the generation of an unsafe output, or a non-refusal. Is there any research supporting the use of GCG for anything else other than jailbreaking?\n- Is this an IRB-approved study (or equivalent, if the authors are not based in the U.S.)?

To improve current performances on these task, the authors propose two enhancements to the gradient-based Evolutionary Prompt Optimization (EPO) method: EPO-Assist, which periodically queries GPT-4o to generate fluent variations, and EPO-Inpainting, which uses the bidirectional diffusion model LLaDa to infill non-critical tokens while preserving high-activation tokens.

The  threshold of 3-9 for cross-entropy also lacks principled justification. For the human evaluation part, only 80 examples were covered with just two annotators. A more robust fluency evaluation would strengthen claims, especially given that fluency is positioned as a core contribution. Authors should consider metrics like diversity (self-BLEU), semantic coherence (sentence embeddings), or larger-scale human studies to strengthen their claims.\n* The paper documents multiple instances where methods exploit shortcuts rather than providing genuine insights: (a) inserting target words directly, (b) exploiting polysemy (medical vs. behavioral \"rash\"), (c) using conjunctions to reverse implications, (d) question/task switching in backdoors. While acknowledged, these issues fundamentally undermine the interpretability goal. The authors mention manual inspection and cross-entropy filtering as mitigation but provide no systematic solution or quantification of how often gaming occurs. This is a critical limitation for safety applications.\n* Results show only 5.1% success rate for single-token password recovery (EPO) vs. 2.5% (GCG), with complete failure on multi-token sequences. For the auditing task, GPT-4o identified generated prefixes as outliers 100% of the time. These results suggest the proposed methods are not yet practical for real-world backdoor detection. The disconnect between token-by-token optimization and multi-token trigger sequences appears fundamental but is not adequately addressed. Moreover, the use of backdoored models from other papers is questionable, if these can be gamed by single-token triggers (e.g., \"Ukraine\" in line 451) that defeat in part the purpose of multi-token evaluation.\n* In terms of clarity, useful results such as those presented in Figure 7 are often relegated to the appendix but directly referred from the main text, making the discussion harder to follow. The \"Background\" section also feels out of place in its current position, as it relates more to the methods presented in Section 5, rather than the presentation of tasks from Section 4.
