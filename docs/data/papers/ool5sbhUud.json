Several key neural network wave function (NNWF) and graph neural network (GNN)-based architectures are missing or only superficially discussed:\n* PauliNet [1], one of the first NNWFs, was heavily inspired by SchNet but incorporates explicit electron–electron message passing.\n* FiRE [3] is a recent GNN-based wave function that achieves over 10× faster variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulations by exploiting sparsity patterns in message passing.\n* Moon [2] is conceptually very similar to the proposed GNWF, with the main difference being the absence of the initial electron–electron message-passing step.\n* [4] extends FermiNet by applying SchNet-like filters to electron–electron messages.\n* Contrary to the claim on l.212, PsiFormer [5] does not decouple electron–electron interactions into a Jastrow factor but rather models them explicitly via self-attention. The Jastrow term only contains explicit pairwise coordinates to satisfy Kato’s cusp condition.\n* Works on generalized wave functions such as PESNet or Globe remain ab initio methods, contrary to the claim in l.146–148. The meta-network in these models forms part of the wave function, even though it operates on nuclear positions.\n\n# Theory\nWhile it is correct that nuclei form the primary centers of electronic interaction (l.207–210), this framing does not accurately capture the main problem that NNWFs aim to address. The mean-field energy contribution is already well described by Hartree–Fock theory. NNWFs instead target the residual correlation energy—a small but high-frequency component arising from electron–electron correlations. This aspect is essential and is the primary motivation for the complex electron–electron interaction terms in NNWF architectures.\n\n\n# Experiments\nThe experimental results are unconvincing and show inconsistencies as well as questionable interpretations:\n* Figure 2: The original FermiNet paper [7] reported substantially lower errors. In [6], the authors trained a single wave function (rather than eight separate ones) across all atoms and their ionizations, achieving higher accuracy on all systems. For single-structure training, even higher accuracy would thus be expected [7].\n* Table 1: CCSD(T)-CBS does not provide reliable absolute energies and should only be used for estimating relative energies. As demonstrated in [6], larger systems can yield considerably lower absolute energies. The inclusion Globe as baselines is unnecessary in this context, as no generalization is evaluated, these numbers should be double checked and including failed runs as total energies seems misleading.\n* Overall, comparisons should focus on relative rather than absolute energies.\n\n## Minor\n* l.16,19: Electrons are not inherently “graphical”; they constitute a point set.\n* l.25: Clarify what new capabilities or insights are unlocked by the GNWF formulation.\n* l.74: Prefer using mathematical symbols rather than “pos.”\n* l.93: “Ansatz” (German for “approach”) denotes the functional form used to approximate the (ground-state) wave function.\n* Figure 1: The label “Single-Particle Wave Function” is misleading, as it could be mistaken for a mean-field wave function.\n* l.188–189: While translational invariance is enforced via relative coordinates, the wave function is not rotationally invariant or equivariant. True rotational invariance would require SO(3)-equivariance, but in quantum systems spontaneous symmetry breaking can occur (e.g., excited states of hydrogen).\n* l.296–300: The description implies that the many-electron orbitals are a novel feature of GNWFs, but such constructs are standard in existing NNWF architectures.\n\n[1] Hermann, Jan, Zeno Schätzle,Frank Noé. „Deep-Neural-Network Solution of the Electronic Schrödinger Equation“\\\n[2] Gao, Nicholas,Stephan Günnemann. „Generalizing Neural Wave Functions“.\\\n[3] Scherbela, Michael, Nicholas Gao, Philipp Grohs,Stephan Günnemann. „Accurate Ab-Initio Neural-Network Solutions to Large-Scale Electronic Structure Problems“\\\n[4] Gerard, Leon, Michael Scherbela, Philipp Marquetand,Philipp Grohs. „Gold-standard solutions to the Schrödinger equation using deep learning: How much physics do we need?“\\\n[5] Glehn, Ingrid von, James S.

While the proposed architecture is not exactly present in earlier literature, I do feel that it represents a rather incremental contribution that is not suitable for ICLR. Moreover, I am not convinced about the main claim regarding competitiveness with existing methods. The paper only reports experiments with systems of up to 30 electrons. Note that state of the art fermionic neural wave functions are now capable of treating challenging systems with several hundreds of electrons (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19909 or https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06087). But even on very small systems with 30 electrons (for example bicyclobutane), the presented architecture misses the accuracy of the \"small\" Psiformer model by 2mHa and of the \"large\" Psiformer by more than 13mHa. The crucial question whether the presented model is capable to match the accuracy of these more accurate models by increasing the parameters is not studied. For these reasons I do not think that the claim that the GNN approach yields \"comparable accuracy\" to Psiformer is not fully justified. Moreover, the claimed speedup of 24% is respectable but in my opinion not sufficient to justify publication in ICLR. Finally I mention that the accuracies of Psiformer are simply taken from the corresponding paper. It is entirely possible that reducing the Psiformer model a bit (fewer parameters) and running the experiments again would yield the same or better accuracy than the proposed method with even fewer parameters. \n\nThe paper seems not very carefully written.

It remains unclear where the efficiency arises—from algorithmic complexity (O(N·M) vs. O(N²)), parameter count reduction, or implementation details. There is no complexity ablation or equal-parameter comparison. For example, it is uncertain whether a PsiFormer with the same number of parameters as GNWF would show comparable performance. Without such fairness analysis, the claim of architectural efficiency remains speculative.\n\n**Unconvincing Argument on Physical Grounding**: The paper claims GNWF is more “physically grounded” than Transformer- or Pfaffian-based ansatzes, but this is not logically or empirically justified. The traditional ansatz methods (Slater + Jastrow, Pfaffian, FermiNet) are themselves physically constrained and theoretically well-grounded in antisymmetry and orbital factorization. The paper does not provide a clear argument for why these methods are “less physical.” Instead, it relies solely on energy results—which are not superior to PsiFormer—to support this claim. As a result, the notion of “physically grounded” remains qualitative rather than quantitative.\n\n**Lack of Comparison to Other Modern Ansatz Models**: The paper does not include comparisons to recent, expressive anti-symmetric architectures such as Neural Pfaffian or PauliNet, which are directly relevant baselines.

Moreover, since a Pfaffian-based antisymmetry can, in principle, also be incorporated into the GNWF framework (for example, by using GNN-derived single-particle orbitals as the input to a Pfaffian determinant), it would be valuable to either (a) include this variant or (b) discuss how such an integration could be achieved. Evaluating GNWF with a Pfaffian-style antisymmetry could strengthen the argument that the GNN-based ansatz is general enough to subsume existing architectures.\n\n2. **Globe+Moon Comparison under Convergent Settings** :The paper states that Globe + Moon training repeatedly failed to converge. Could you clarify whether this failure is due to unstable optimization, mismatched hyperparameters, or architectural incompatibility with your data setup? If Globe + Moon can be made to converge under its original settings, would GNWF still outperform it in accuracy or computational efficiency on the same settings? A controlled comparison under a convergent configuration would clarify the source of differences.\n\n3. **Fair Parameter and Runtime Comparison**: The reported runtime improvement might partly stem from using fewer parameters rather than from intrinsic architectural advantages. Could you provide results where PsiFormer and GNWF are trained under equal parameter budgets? For example, how does GNWF perform if PsiFormer is down-scaled to the same parameter count (~1.04 M)? Conversely, if GNWF uses the full parameter size of PsiFormer (~1.65 M), does its accuracy or speed change proportionally?
