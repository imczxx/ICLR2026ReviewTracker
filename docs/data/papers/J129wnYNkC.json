In fact, recent literature suggests that such complex behaviours are likely to occur when the number of agents increases.\nIn this paper, we study Q-learning dynamics in network polymatrix games where the network structure is drawn from classical random graph models.  In particular, we focus on the Erdős-Rényi model, which is used to analyze connectivity in distributed systems, and the Stochastic Block model, which generalizes the above by accounting for community structures that naturally arise in multi-agent systems. \nIn each setting, we establish sufficient conditions under which the agents' joint strategies converge to a unique equilibrium. We investigate how this condition depends on the exploration rates, payoff matrices and, crucially, the probabilities of interaction between network agents. \nWe validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations and demonstrate that convergence can be reliably achieved in many-agent systems, provided interactions in the network are controlled.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multi-Agent Learning", "Quantal Response Equilibrium", "Q-Learning", "Learning in Networks", "Random Networks"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f63906b43d6b736e473cf0a0d9a9c487b1551cfd.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3e4f0f000c293fe930ecb1506cc943830e0fbd97.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies the convergence of Q-learning dynamics (QLD) - a model of continuous time dynamics which balances exploitation with exploration through a parameter T_k for each player k - in random networks, i.e., networks in which nodes are agents (players) and games between agents are played if an edge is randomly assigned between them. For the theoretical results, the paper assumes that the game across all edges is the same, i.e., a bimatrix game with matrices A, B. The paper shows that a sufficient condition for QLD to converge is that the exploration parameter is large enough for all players in the network, and specifically if it is larger than the product of the highest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and a \"similarity of payoffs\" index. The paper sharpens this result in two settings of random networks - one in which each edge is assigned randomly with probability p and one in which nodes form clusters with probabilities of edges being different within and between these clusters.

While I may have misunerstood some parts, I think that disentagling the impact of cooperative/competitive underlying game on convergence and doing more extensive experiments in games not covered by (the limiting) assumption 1, would strengthen the paper.

The results are asymptotic in terms of both the algorithm running time and the number of players $N$.

Could the authors comment on the feasibility of deriving non-asymptotic results for either the number of agents or the running time?\n\nThe asymptotic nature of the results also cast shadows on the validity of the solution concept QRE, as the results may only hold for large $N$, which corresponds to a high exploration rate and thus renders the QRE uninformative.\n\n### Related Work\n\nHussain et al. (2024) appears to be a closely related work based on the authors' description and is not a concurrent work as it is heavily cited in the paper.

The authors should provide a more detailed comparison of the two works to clarify the novelty of the current work, including but not limited to what graph structures are considered in Hussain et al. (2024), how are they fundamentally different from the random graphs considered in this paper, and what results are obtained in Hussain et al. (2024).\n\nSome works on learning dynamic graphon games might be relevant to the paper, as learning unknown payoff functions is the key setting of the paper and extending to Markov games.\n\n### Other\n\nOnly continuous-time Q-learning dynamics are considered.

Moreover, the authors may want to discuss how Assumption 1 affects the players' action space.

The paper's limited focus on normal-form games and the continuous-time counterpart is not explicit in the abstract and introduction until lines 64-72. More importantly, the restrictive Assumption 1 is not clear in the abstract and introduction.\n- Implicit information structure:\nIt is not clear whether agents know the model or can observe the others' strategies. For example, (1) involves r_ki(x_{-k}(t)). Then, how agent k can compute it without knowing r_ki and x_{-k}(t). Note that x_{-k}(t) is the probabilistic strategy rather than the action taken. Furthermore, does that update take place for all actions i. Then, how the agent can know the reward associated with actions not taken without knowing the model. If the agent knows the model, this should be explicit since the literature review criticizes existing works using model knowledge.\n- Restrictive symmetry assumption:\nThe core Lemma 1 depends critically on Assumption 1 assuming identical bimatrix payoffs on all edges. This limits generality. Furthermore, under homogenous formulations, mean-field games (with continuum of agents) and mean-field-type games (with many agents) also have convergent learning dynamics. The statement at line 042-043 saying \"...as the number of players grows, non-convergent behavior becomes the norm.\" is misleading in that regard.\n- Presentation of sufficient vs. necessary conditions:\nStatements like \"higher exploration rates are necessary for convergence\" at lines 242-243 are misleading. The results only prove sufficiency, and counterexamples could exist where QLD still guaranteed to converge under weaker conditions.\n- Lack of rigorous in asymptotic bounds:\nThe paper cites spectral radius results from Vu (2007) to establish almost-sure upper bounds but does not quantify the non-asymptotic behavior for finite N. A clear statement would say that for any \\epsilon > 0 there exists sufficiently large N such that if T \\geq Bound(N) + \\epsilon then the convergence of QLD is guaranteed. \n- Ambiguity in the \"p\\rightarrow 0\" statement at liens 304-305:\nThe claim \"if p \\rightarrow 0 faster than 1/N, QLD converges almost surely as N\\rightarrow \\infty\" lacks clarity and mathematical rigor. The dominant term p(N-1) can remain bounded, yet we also have \\epsilon \\sqrt{N}. Therefore, it is not clear with what rate QLD can converge. Furthermore, such a statement could be misinterpreted as by making p go to zero we can ensure convergence while a change in p implies a different game.\n- Limited literature review:\nThe literature review should discuss the seminal works: Shapley (1964) provided a counterexample of two-agent three-action game in which fictitious play does not necessarily converge to unique equilibrium. There is also famous Jordan's game in which fictitious play may not converge. Hart and Mas-Colell showed that for any uncoupled learning dynamics (not incorporating opponent payoffs), there exists a game in which they do not converge to equilibrium. More importantly, some citations are not provided in the references. For example, Leonardos et al (2024) is cited at lines 94 and 192. However, there is no such reference in the references.
