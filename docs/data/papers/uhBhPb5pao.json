However, few existing methods account for recurring structures, or patterns, that appear within the data. We present Pattern-Guided Diffusion Models (PGDM), which leverage inherent patterns within temporal data for forecasting future time steps. PGDM first extracts patterns using archetypal analysis and estimates the most likely next pattern in the sequence. By guiding predictions with this pattern estimate, PGDM makes more realistic predictions that fit within the set of known patterns. We additionally introduce a novel uncertainty quantification technique based on archetypal analysis, and we dynamically scale the guidance level based on the pattern estimate uncertainty. We apply our method to two well-motivated forecasting applications, predicting visual field measurements and motion capture frames. On both, we show that pattern guidance reduces PGDM's prediction error by up to 40.67% and 11.10%, respectively. Compared to baselines, PGDM also achieves lower error by up to 65.58% and 82.54%.", "tldr": "This paper presents Pattern-Guided Diffusion Models, which leverage inherent patterns within temporal data to predict future timesteps.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "archetypal analysis"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fac711ad2e429d53c11c3274413a46d571a6e4c3.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d668231f3ae0decceedd1f3433635489fc0fb009.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Pattern-Guided Diffusion Models (PGDM), a framework that enhances diffusion-based time-series forecasting by explicitly leveraging recurring patterns inherent in temporal data.

However, this assumption may not hold for all types of data sequences. Could the authors discuss the potential limitations of PGDM when applied to data sequences that do not exhibit clear patterns? Furthermore, the baseline methods TimeGrad and CSDI are general-purpose diffusion models for time series forecasting. Could the authors consider including more specialized baseline methods that are specifically designed for pattern-based forecasting to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of PGDM's performance? Additionally, how can PGDM be adapted or extended to handle data sequences that lack inherent patterns?\n\n2. **Experiment setup of MAE/GDE.** The authors describe in Sec.5 that *\"The first model ... lowest validation mean absolute error... The secon model ...  highest capacity\"*. However, I feel confused about the setup of proposing different model selection criteria. Could the authors clarify why MAE-based and GDE-based models should be simultaneously discussed. Furthermore, the GDE criterion is not clearly described. Could the authors provide more details?\n\n3. **Effectiveness of dynamic guidance scale.** The dynamic guidance scale is designed to adjust the influence of archetypal patterns based on the distance between historical samples and the archetypal patterns. However, in Human the motion prediction task, as demonstrated in Table 1, the improvement of $w>0$ is relatively small. How can the authors explain the limited effectiveness of the dynamic guidance scale in this context? Are there specific scenarios or types of data where the dynamic guidance scale is more beneficial?\n\n4. **Clarity of writing.** While the overall structure of the paper is logical, certain sections could benefit from clearer explanations. For instance, the authors could first provide a detailed high-level overview of data types with inherent patterns (such as Figure 3). This would help readers better understand the motivation behind PGDM before delving into the technical details. Could the authors consider revising these sections to enhance clarity and accessibility for a broader audience?\n\n5. **Novelty of proposed method.** The use of Archetypal Analysis (AA) to capture inherent patterns in data sequences is an interesting approach. However, AA itself is not a novel technique, and I believe it is natural to apply AA in this context. Could the authors elaborate on the specific contributions of PGDM that distinguish it from existing methods that utilize AA or similar techniques? How does PGDM advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion-based forecasting beyond the application of AA?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "tHFJIxkhY3", "forum": "uhBhPb5pao", "replyto": "uhBhPb5pao", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21607/Reviewer_NBP2"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21607/Reviewer_NBP2"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21607/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761919011767, "cdate": 1761919011767, "tmdate": 1762941852028, "mdate": 1762941852028, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
