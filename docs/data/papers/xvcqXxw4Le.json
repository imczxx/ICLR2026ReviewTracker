Max-E3SAT is the natural `maximizing' generalization of 3SAT, where we want to find an assignment to maximize the number of satisfied clauses. We introduce a clause prediction model, where each clause provides one noisy bit (accurate with probability $1/2 + \\varepsilon$) of information for each variable participating in the clause, based on an optimal assignment. We design an algorithm with approximation factor of $7/8+\\Theta(\\varepsilon^2/\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$. Our algorithm leverages the fact that in our model, high-occurrence variables tend to be highly predictable. By carefully incorporating a classic algorithm for Max-E3SAT with bounded-occurrence, we are able to bypass the worst-case lower bounds of $7/8$ without advice (assuming $P \\ne NP$). \n\nWe also give hardness results of Max-E3SAT in other well studied prediction models such as the $\\varepsilon$-label and subset prediction models of Cohen-Addad et al. (NeurIPS 2024) and Ghoshal et al. (SODA 2025). In particular, under standard complexity assumptions, in these prediction models, we show Max-E3SAT is hard to approximate to within a factor of $7/8+\\delta$ and Max-E3SAT with bounded-occurrence $B$ (every variable appears in at most $B$ clauses) is hard to approximate to within a factor of $7/8+O(1/\\sqrt{B})+\\delta$ for $\\delta$ a specific function of $\\varepsilon$. Our first lower bound result is based on the framework proposed by Ghoshal et al. (SODA 2025), and the second uses a randomized reduction from general instances of Max-E3SAT to bounded-occurrences instances proposed by Trevisan (STOC 2001).", "tldr": "We use clause predictions to solve fundamental constraint satisfaction problems beyond worst case guarantees", "keywords": ["Learning-augmented algorithms", "Learning augmented algorithms", "predictions", "constraing satisfaction"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b1e7f762cd628988292167ec744ee8399beefe8d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies Max-E3SAT with learning-augmented predictions.

The MAX-E3SAT problem involves a conjunctive normal form (CNF) formula where each clause consists of exactly three literals. The objective is to find a Boolean assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied clauses. After examining traditional prediction models—label advice and subset advice—the authors introduce a novel prediction model called \"clause advice.\" In this model, each clause can be represented by a vector of bits corresponding to the values of the literals in a given assignment. Essentially, each clause provides a noisy variant of the vector associated with the optimal assignment. Within this framework, each bit in the clause is modeled as a Bernoulli random variable that offers a slightly more accurate prediction than a random uniform choice.\n\nUsing $\\epsilon$ to represent this information, the authors develop a $ \\frac{7}{8} + \\Theta(\\epsilon^2 / \\log(1/\\epsilon)) $-approximation algorithm, that recovers the classical random choice algorithm when $\\epsilon$ tends to zero.
