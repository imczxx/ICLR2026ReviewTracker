To address the intricate yet highly practical challenges and enhance the reliability of representation extraction, heterogeneous feature fusion, and label semantic learning, we propose a Theory-Inspired Task-Relevant Representation Learning method named TITRL. \nFrom an information-theoretic standpoint,  we identify the sources of view-specific information that interfere with shared representations. By introducing dual-layer constraints on feature exclusivity and label integration, TITRL constructs a  general framework for task-relevant information extraction. Besides, through variational derivation, we demonstrate the existence of tractable bounds for the mutual information model that guides the optimization direction. Regarding label semantic learning, we establish flexible relationships between label prototypes by promoting the expression of sample-level label correlations. \nDuring the multi-view integration process , TITRL simultaneously incorporates early fusion through distribution information aggregation and late fusion weighted by prediction confidence, which improves  the semantic stability  while enabling dynamic view quality assessment. Finally, extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of TITRL against state-of-the-art methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Incomplete multi-view learning", "Multi-label classification", "Representation learning", "Label semantics learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/06f4ac75fc63262821943f689fd53423a65c2a13.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper also addresses the incomplete multi-view multi-label problem by proposing a theory-driven method named TITRL.

Is this the first work to propose this concept? Also, the title includes \"task-relevant.\" How is this concept specifically embodied in the method?\n\n2)Regarding the definition of important symbols, the paper frequently uses the tilde. For example, x^{(v)} with its (~), does denote the set of all views other than the view v?\n\n3)Why can the shared information term I_v^s not be optimized directly? The justification for the derivation from Equation 3 to the objective in Equation 4 is not entirely clear. Could you provide a more detailed explanation? Furthermore, since Equation 4 primarily constrains the shared component z, how does the method ensure that unique, view-specific information is also effectively integrated? Is the 'z' that appears in L_f computed according to Equation 15?\n\n4)The rationale for using the Product-of-Experts (PoE) framework is not explained in detail. Could you elaborate on this choice, especially since other methods exist for capturing multi-dimensional constraints or complementary information in data?\n\n5)Why does Equation 16 compute the similarity between a shared feature and a label prototype, which seem to exist in different semantic spaces? The initial label embeddings are not binary, and the stochastic encoder might introduce noise; how does the paper account for this? Additionally, the late fusion mechanism uses the model's own prediction confidence, L_con, as weights. Early in training, predictions are close to 0.5, leading to low and uniform confidence weights. Does this affect the stability and efficiency of convergence during the initial training phase?\n\n6)The paper does not seem to explicitly mark the positions of present versus missing data. How does the model achieve good performance in this mixed-data scenario? For instance, regarding the category-level constraint L_c, specifically the term D_kl{p(y|z(v))||p(y|x(v))}. If the source view x(v) itself is noisy or contains spurious correlations with the labels, does this constraint risk forcing the \"purer\" latent representation z(v) to mimic this noisy predictive distribution, thereby contaminating the representation?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Rnj69VLFDY", "forum": "bffiMLNRg2", "replyto": "bffiMLNRg2", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4652/Reviewer_9jZM"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4652/Reviewer_9jZM"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4652/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760689926925, "cdate": 1760689926925, "tmdate": 1762917491566, "mdate": 1762917491566, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "gGQDBtlQGJ", "forum": "bffiMLNRg2", "replyto": "bffiMLNRg2", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4652/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4652/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762919195342, "cdate": 1762919195342, "tmdate": 1762919195342, "mdate": 1762919195342, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This addresses a critical challenge in multi-view multi-label learning handling dual data incompleteness, where both feature views and labels are partially missing.

For example, the derivation for the information decomposition in Eq.3 is unconvincing, as this form is not a standard decomposition of conditional mutual information and requires rigorous proof. Furthermore, the derivation for Eq.10 (detailed in Appendix A.2, Eq.30-32) is questionable. Transforming the minimization of $H(y|z^{(v)}) - H(y|x^{(v)})$ directly into a KL-divergence term is not valid as their supports differ. Even if this were accepted as a surrogate objective, the objective should be $D_{KL}(p(y|x^{(v)})||p(y|z^{(v)}))$ rather than the $D_{KL}(p(y|z^{(v)})||p(y|x^{(v)}))$ as claimed in Eq.10. \n\n2.The paper omits critical implementation details, hindering reproducibility. For instance, the notations $p(y|x^{(v)})$, $p(y|z^{(v)})$, $p(y|\\{ z \\})$, and $p(y|\\{z^{\\sim(v)}\\})$ are used extensively throughout Sec 2.2 and in the loss functions without a clear definition. It is unclear if these are generated by extra categorical prediction heads, whether such heads are shared or separate, or if they represent distribution parameters or concrete predictions.\n\n3.The ablation study in Table 2 is insufficient to validate the specific contributions of the model's key components. It only removes broad loss terms ($\\mathcal{L}_f, \\mathcal{L}_c, \\mathcal{L}_a$) or a part of the fusion mechanism. Given that TITRL’s framework is very similar to prior work like SIP (Liu et al., 2024), the primary additions appear to be the $\\mathcal{L}_c$ loss and the confidence-based fusion mechanism.
