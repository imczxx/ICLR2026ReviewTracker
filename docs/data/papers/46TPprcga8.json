In the search of abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from structural MRI.  We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its  spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal patches are detected by the anomaly score based on the error and variance of the location prediction. By applying the network in a convolutional manner, this generates a pixel-wise heatmap of anomalies providing finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021 and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Anomaly detection", "Computer aided diagnosis", "Machine learning", "Magnetic resonance imaging"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
