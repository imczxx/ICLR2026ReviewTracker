Despite the increasing availability of ESG data disclosed by companies, the complex, relational, and unstructured nature of ESG reports poses significant challenges for large-scale LLMs. The surprising efficacy of small language models (SLMs) on domain-specific tasks challenges the prevailing belief that only massive, general-purpose models can tackle complex reasoning. Inspired by this observation, we investigate the potential of compact models in the nuanced field of ESG analysis, arguing that the path to true expertise lies in focused knowledge and structured collaboration. Our work presents a two-fold contribution to realize this vision: 1) We introduce ESGEXPERT-30K, a new knowledge-intensive dataset, to fine-tune a compact SLM into a specialized ESGEEK model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on domain-specific QA. 2) We propose DIAL-G², a novel framework where these expert agents form a committee to analyze full, multimodal corporate reports. In DIAL-G², agents populate a shared graph with conflicting arguments. The GNN then performs relational inference on this graph and uses its learned attention weights to direct the agents’ focus towards the most salient and contested information in a subsequent debate phase. This graph-guided approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness. Furthermore, on our newly contributed, large-scale ESGREPORT-RATING-50K benchmark, DIAL-G² achieves human-expert-level performance in end-to-end ESG score prediction. Extensive experiments show that DIAL-G² can overcome bottlenecks of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in domain-specific understanding, providing the ESG research community with a powerful new paradigm for scalable, relational, and interpretable AI.", "tldr": "This paper proposes a novel multi-agent framework where specialized AI agents debate the contents of ESG reports, referencing a shared knowledge base of official standards and company data to generate a final rating.", "keywords": ["ESG; Multi-Agent System (MAS)"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d54baee374c3ad9119fbd3441e7b7fd030d4480f.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f003cb5f6553ef58789a6a47477fa1fa33b4bf0e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work primarily focuses on two tasks related to ESG: question answering and scoring.

I could not find the dataset in the appendix. The authors stated in the **Reproducibility Statement** that the dataset is provided there, but I only found corresponding descriptions in the `readme.md` file.\n2.

Unfortunately, the specific meaning, implementation details, and design motivation of these components are omitted.\n3. The work lacks originality. Although it includes multiple components—two task datasets, models of different parameter scales, and a GNN architecture for scoring—most of the techniques used are existing ones. The dataset construction (using GPT-4o for QA generation), model fine-tuning (via SFT), and the GNN design mainly reuse or recombine prior works rather than introducing targeted technical innovations.\n4. The ESG task seems to lack distinctiveness. After reading the paper, it appears that ESG documents are not essentially different from those used in standard RAG or GraphRAG pipelines, which also involve extracting text and images from PDFs and performing similarity-based retrieval.

If the GNN architecture demonstrates clear superiority without disrupting the model’s “thinking” process, that would highlight its technical value.
