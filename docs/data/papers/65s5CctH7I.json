Crystal symmetry is one of the primary factors influencing high-order tensor properties, such as elasticity and piezoelectricity, making strict adherence to symmetry constraints essential. However, exactly guaranteeing symmetry compliance remains challenging. Recent approaches rely on enforcing symmetry but often fail to strictly preserve symmetry. In this work, we propose a novel method that guarantees exact symmetry compliance by predicting symmetry-constrained irreducible components of high-order tensors. Specifically, we first develop a computational procedure to identify the basis tensors corresponding to symmetry-constrained irreducible components under various symmetry conditions. This symmetry-constrained basis guarantees that the assembled full tensor strictly adheres to the required symmetry constraints. To predict the numerical values for these irreducible components, we then propose a spherical-harmonic convolutional neural network designed to effectively capture essential high-order tensor information. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves exact symmetry compliance without compromising prediction accuracy, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["high-order tensor properties", "irreducible decomposition", "crystal materials"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/29472514fde26f3e059cebf7caa738e5fe64457b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes selecting the correct irreducible spherical harmonics channels to account for the symmetry constraints in crystalline materials tensorial property prediction tasks, including dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic tensors.
