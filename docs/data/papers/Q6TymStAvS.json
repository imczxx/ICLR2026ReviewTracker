The major weakness is the paper's structure and writing. A significant portion of the early sections is dedicated to explaining well-established concepts, which may be inefficient for an expert audience at ICLR conference.\n- Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and Section 3 provide lengthy introductions to Classical Shadows and flow Matching. While context is necessary, these concepts are foundational and could likely be summarized more concisely, perhaps by focusing only on the specific aspects directly built upon by the authors. This would free up valuable space to elaborate on the novel contributions. If the author desires to present more specific or self-contained content, detailed information (including Algorithm 1 and 2) can be placed in the appendix.\n- Furthermore, the motivation in Section 4.1 is good, but the preceding three pages of background and related works dilute the paper's focus and delay the reader's engagement with the key ideas. In a highly competitive venue, it's crucial to present the core innovation as early and clearly as possible. \n\nA more effective structure might have been to briefly introduce the necessary concepts from FM and classical shadows within the introduction or a much shorter, combined background section, and then move directly to the motivation and detailed methodology of ShadowFM.\n\n2. The paper's core methodological sections (4.2 and 4.3) blend established theory with the authors' modifications. It would be better if the authors delineate their novel technical contributions from the baseline frameworks of RFM and DFM. As presented, it is difficult to isolate the exact innovations beyond the application of existing tools to a new domain.\n\n3. For the Anisotropic Dirichlet Flow, the increased methodological complexity does not consistently yield superior performance over the simpler Spherical Flow (e.g., in the Heisenberg model results of Table 3). What is the justification for this more complex model if its empirical advantage is not universally demonstrated across the tested problems?\n\n4. A critical observation from Table 1 is that the learning-free Classical Shadow baseline consistently outperforms all trained generative models, especially on the correlation metric and in the high-sample regime. Could the authors explain this performance gap and justify the practical utility of the generative approach if it fails to surpass a direct, learning-free estimation method?\n\n4. The primary motivation for introducing a non-Euclidean geometry is an experiment (Figure 2) suggesting that \"spin errors\" (e.g., $|X^{+}\\rangle \\rightarrow |X^{-}\\rangle$) are significantly more detrimental than \"basis errors\" (e.g., $|X^{+}\\rangle \\rightarrow |Y^{\\pm}\\rangle \\text{or} |Z^{\\pm}\\rangle$). However, the provided plot does not strongly support this claim. The performance gap between the two error types appears marginal across the tested error rates. The paper's assertion that spin errors are \"significantly higher\"  seems overstated. This weakens the central premise that a geometry specifically designed to maximize the distance between spin-flipped states is necessary and justifies the added model complexity.\n\n5. The paper's experiments compare the proposed methods primarily against other flow-matching variants. This comparison is too narrow and fails to benchmark against the true state-of-the-art in generative modeling for quantum states. Crucially, there is no comparison against machine learning models such as [1,2,3] and a benchmark [4], which have shown strong performance on similar tasks.\n\n[1] Huang H Y, Kueng R, Torlai G, et al.

Within this space, they apply flow matching to learn distributions of outcomes conditioned on Hamiltonian parameters, allowing the model to follow the curved geometry of quantum shadows instead of a flat Euclidean one. This leads to smoother sampling and better reconstruction of observables like correlation matrices and entanglement measures, even under noise or limited data.
