While hypergraph neural networks are powerful tools for identifying cancer genes by modeling higher-order functional relationships, they face a critical limitation in integrating multi-omics features. To address this, we propose DEMONet, a Dual-channel Multi-Omics Integration Hypergraph Network. DEMONet enhances multi-omics integration through three synergistic modules: (1) a tree-based sparse encoder that transforms raw multi-omics features into a robust, structured representation; (2) a biologically-informed node-weighted hypergraph convolutional layer to capture gene importances within functional hyperedges; and (3) a dual-channel architecture to prevent information interference between different hypergraph sources before final fusion. Benchmark results demonstrate that DEMONet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, improving AUROC by 1.9\\% and AUPRC by 2.3\\% over prior methods. Its generalization and robustness are further validated on two independent test sets. Analysis of multiple independent functional genomics data validated the significant biological associations between the DEMONet-predicted top candidate genes and cancer genes. Furthermore, TCGA survival analysis further reveals that 16 novel cancer genes identified by DEMONet are significantly associated with patient outcomes, highlighting the potential of our model to discover actionable targets for cancer research.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Cancer Gene Identification; Hypergraph; Multi-omics; Hypergraph Neural Network"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d3e2eebb9afff27e7d62798517d0d3ce237406e0.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9ca20e87a3e1179b4a37e5a3356c664ba3f2b213.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "To address the limitations of Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) in multi-omics feature integration—including inability to handle data heterogeneity, failure to capture the contextual functional specificity of genes due to the model’s assumption of node homogeneity within hyperedges, and poor performance of simple early fusion for multi-omics features—this study proposes DEMONet.

The core idea of HGNNs has already been applied in DISHyper, and dual-channel designs are also common (e.g., the baseline method MNGCL uses three channels for feature fusion). Additionally, there is content overlap between the Introduction and Related Work sections, and parts of the Introduction bear high similarity to DISHyper.\n2. $\\textbf{Lack of statistical completeness in experimental results}$: Although statistical significance is indicated when comparing with SOTA methods, no statistical significance is reported for ablation study results. Furthermore, standard deviations are omitted from all experimental results, making it impossible to assess result stability. Additionally, experimental evaluation is somewhat incomplete because it reports only AUROC and AUPRC, omitting ranking-oriented metrics such as precision@K and recall@K, which makes it difficult to gauge the model’s practical prioritization performance.\n\n3. $\\textbf{Inadequate verification of biologically-informed node weights}$: The authors claim that biologically-informed node-weighting can reflect gene heterogeneity, but no supporting ablation experiments are provided. It is recommended to supplement comparative experimental results between this weighting strategy and unweighted graphs (without node weights) to verify the effectiveness of the weights.\n4. $\\textbf{Unproven balance between model complexity and benefits}$: As shown in Table 3, the dual-channel variant improves AUROC and AUPRC by less than 0.013 compared with using either a single ontology graph or a concatenated hypergraph. Such a small margin might stem from the additional parameters rather than from a clear structural advantage, leaving some uncertainty about the necessity of maintaining two separate channels. The dual-channel architecture may potentially increase model complexity compared to single-channel methods. However, the authors do not provide quantitative metrics such as running time or peak memory usage. This makes it impossible to determine whether the likely substantial increase in complexity is justified, especially considering that the improvement in model performance appears to be only marginal.\n5. $\\textbf{A pronounced generalization gap is evident}$: The cross-validated AUPRC is roughly 0.90, whereas it falls below 0.15 on the external OncoKB and below 0.1 on the ONGene sets, indicating possible over-fitting to the training distribution and limited utility for novel driver-gene prioritization.\n6. $\\textbf{Unknown impact of Random Forest encoding parameters}$: The impact of the Random Forest parameters used for constructing sparse features on encoding results and subsequent model performance is not analyzed.\n7. DEMONet adopts a two-stage pipeline of \"Random Forest encoding --> HGNN feature extraction,\" where encoding performance directly affects subsequent feature extraction. It is recommended to explain why neural network encoding (to enable end-to-end training) is not used and compare the performance differences between the two-stage and end-to-end designs.\n8.
