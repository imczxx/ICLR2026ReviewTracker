Despite its omnipresence, research in machine learning rarely leverages B-reps directly; instead, STEP files are typically parsed with (proprietary) kernels and reduced to meshes, point clouds, or basic face-edge-vertex graphs. These simplifications discard important details (e.g., parametric patches or topology) present in B-reps and introduce additional challenges related to licensing, compatibility, and scalability.\n\nWe introduce Better STEP, an open source format that preserves the full fidelity of B-reps while enabling direct, efficient access in standard ML frameworks, removing dependence on proprietary software. In addition, we introduce an open-source Python library for querying and processing B-rep data. The Python package provides standard functionalities for querying geometry (e.g., surface sampling, normal estimation, curvature computation), as well as topological structure,\nthereby facilitating integration into existing pipelines.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360 and ABC datasets, comprising over one million CAD models. We further showcase the universality of our Python package by generating test data for four representative downstream tasks; these experiments did not require fine-tuning or modifying the original models, underscoring the ease with which our data can be integrated into existing machine learning workflows.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Boundary representation (B-rep)", "STEP format", "HDF5", "CAD dataset processing"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3d5f06a0cae7a3320627c7875ec06f4e6d330d12.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces Better STEP, an ML-friendly HDF5 schema that preserves exact B-rep geometry/topology with optional per-face meshes.

Listings 4 and 5 are used to replace the compute_labels function from Listing 2; however, inconsistent return formats (1/0 vs 1/None) are used between different examples. Additionally, Listing 3 does not provide any meaningful/helpful information. Pseudocode detailing how read_meshes/get_mesh worked would be more useful than the current provided code. In general, I think the provided code could be clearer, and more details could be provided in addition to the very high-level usage examples. Moreover, the examples could be made more compact; for instance, by removing the multiple empty lines from Listing 2, and utilizing abs.function_name instead of having similar imports in different Listings.\n- The contributions are not clear. The main contribution regarding the dataset is conversion, which is also repeated as part of the libraries as a conversion library. The provided dataset is a combined version of the ABC and Fusion 360 datasets, converted to the proposed format by parsing the STEP files with OpenCascade, extracting the geometric and topological information, and saving them into the proposed dictionary-like format. Based on this, it is unclear what additional improvements are provided beyond the geometric and topological information provided by OpenCascade. Moreover, failure percentages are reported for the meshing algorithm of OpenCascade, along with some failure case examples; however, the reasons for these failures are not discussed beyond the reported percentage failure rates. In addition, it is not clear whether StepToHDF5 should be considered a library here instead of a function handling inputs as part of the provided 'abs' library, which handles reading and navigating the HDF5 output files. Overall, the paper would benefit from improved structuring and clearer explanations regarding its contributions.\n- Even though the format is independent of the conversion process, only OpenCascade is utilized in the paper to convert STEP files to the proposed format. However, OpenCascade also has its own BREP format. Currently, the paper does not discuss the advantages/strengths of the proposed format over this format, which would strengthen the claims.\n- Limited comparisons and modality in experiments. The paper claims that the proposed format for B-reps would make them easier to use in standard machine learning frameworks. However, only point-cloud input models are considered. Moreover, only performances on existing models are reported, using point cloud inputs sampled from the proposed format and library, with no comparison to inputs sampled from B-rep or meshes directly. In these cases, the original performances are not reported, making it hard to evaluate the provided experiments. Additionally, there are no examples of training or fine-tuning. In my opinion, these provide very limited support to the claims. The paper would be significantly improved with the incorporation of geometric/topological deep learning models and/or mesh-based models.\n- The paper claims that the proposed dataset and format will \"bridge the gap, enabling LLM to generate complex B-rep models fully\"; however, no LLM-based experiments are provided to support this claim."}, "questions": {"value": "My primary concerns are the unclear claims and contributions, as well as the limited experimental results.
