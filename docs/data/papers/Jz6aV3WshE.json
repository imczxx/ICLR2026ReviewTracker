However, their application to large-scale engineering tasks suffers from significant computational overhead. And the fact that current models impose a uniform computational cost while physical fields exhibit vastly different complexities constitutes a fundamental mismatch, which is the root of this inefficiency. For instance, in turbulence flows, intricate vortex regions require deeper network processing compared to stable flows. To address this, we introduce a framework: Skip-Block Routing (SBR), a general framework designed for Transformer-based neural operators, capable of being integrated into their multi-layer architectures. First, SBR uses a routing mechanism to learn the complexity and ranking of tokens, which is then applied during inference. Then, in later layers, it decides how many tokens are passed forward based on this ranking. This way, the model focuses more processing capacity on the tokens that are more complex. Experiments demonstrate that SBR is a general framework that seamlessly integrates into various neural operators. Our method reduces computational cost by approximately 50\\% in terms of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), while still delivering up to $2\\times$ faster inference without sacrificing accuracy.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Neural Operators", "AI4PDE", "AI4Science"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e269cce42cbe49bca4a8a3216adf8ad756b2a862.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c9107d101caa925f59459745f8d0b9244bbebbf5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents an adaptive computation framework for Transformer-based neural operators, which the authors term skip-block routing.

There are quite a few typos and instances where the in-text citations are not formatted correctly. For example, \\cite is used instead of \\citep and there is no space between citations and other text. The exposition is also fairly dense and a bit repetitive, while concepts like physical intuition are buried in the details. Figures and tables aren't integrated into the narrative.\n- The authors state the importance map is static and fixed. Is this fixed across samples? This seems poorly designed for time-dependent PDEs, especially with strongly nonlinear, local dynamics. This also seems counter to the whole point of the paper, to adaptively conform to the local complexities of PDEs.\n- With the previous point, the time-dependent Navier-Stokes dataset shows very strong performance degradation. This is in contradiction to the author's statement that FLOPs may be decreased with no loss in accuracy.\n- The paper lacks a systematic analysis of this approach for different types of PDEs. Some PDEs are globally dominated, while others are locally dominated. Without more investigation to a broader set of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs, it is difficult to extrapolate the performance of the proposed method. Strong performance on a hyperbolic PDE would be very strong support for the authors' claims, but this is not investigated. \n- I always recommend authors to provide a clear statement on the limitations of the current approach."}, "questions": {"value": "- Could you clarify which types of PDEs your method is expected to perform well on? And do you expect it to perform well on hyperbolic or chaotic systems? \n- As mentioned in the paper, the complexity of time-dependent systems is often localized in space and time. Some good examples which demonstrate this come from \"the well\" dataset's rayleigh_taylor_instability [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00568 Figure 4], or the Kelvin Helmholtz and Curved Riemann problems in PDEGym [https://huggingface.co/collections/camlab-ethz/pdegym]. Can the authors provide a study applying one model to these problems? Perhaps transolver, as it gets the strongest results.\n- How could SBR's fixed routing plan generalize to time-evolving or non-stationary problems, where local complexity is constantly changing?\n- The importance score comes from a very simple network. Have you also tried more expressive models to calculate this score? \n- Could you provide a systematic breakdown of the efficiency and accuracy tradeoffs for different physical regimes?\n- Neural operators are notably resolution invariant. How does SBR perform under different resolutions?\n- Is it possible to relate SBR's token pruning more explicitly to adaptive mesh refinement?

The \"static routing\" design, which determines a fixed importance ranking based only on the initial state, is, in principle, incapable of capturing newly emerging complex regions in dynamic evolution problems. Concurrently, the \"hard skip\" mechanism copies skipped token features, thereby obstructing the global propagation of physical information (e.g., pressure, heat) through these \"simple\" regions and compromising physical fidelity.\n\n2. The paper completely omits FLOPs and accuracy comparisons against established, efficient non-Transformer baselines in the field. This absence makes it impossible to judge the SBR framework's absolute value; the results can only demonstrate a relative improvement over existing Transformer models.\n\n3. There is a significant disconnect between the paper's \"large-scale engineering task\" motivation and its experiments. All validations are confined to 2D, low-resolution datasets (e.g., $64 \\times 64$ NS2D). No experiments are provided for 3D problems or high-resolution scenarios to substantiate these large-scale claims.\n\n4. A core argument is that the SBR router \"identifies critical regions\". However, aside from analyzing the activations of baseline models in Figure 2, the paper provides no visualizations of what the SBR model itself learns to select versus skip. This leaves the core mechanism unverified, making it impossible to qualitatively assess whether it is learning physics or merely overfitting statistical artifacts.\n\n5. Beyond the limited 4-strategy comparison in Appendix D.2, the paper severely lacks a sensitivity analysis on the token ratios ($r_l$) within the schedule $S$. For instance, there is no ablation on the absolute magnitude of these ratios, making it difficult to assess model robustness and the trade-off curve.\n\n6.
