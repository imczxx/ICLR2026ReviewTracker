We present VisionLight, an RL framework that operates on real-time video input through two modes: (1) end-to-end processing of raw footage and (2) image-based feature extraction compatible with existing TSC systems. To address flow-change uncertainty, VisionLight introduces an Entropy Attention & Multi-agent Mechanism tuned for turn-based traffic. It achieves an average 56.8% improvement over SOTA baselines across three metrics, matches feature-driven RL models, and generalizes robustly under extreme weather without retraining, making it practical for real-world deployment.", "tldr": "VisionLight is an RL-based traffic signal control system using video input and entropy attention to improve flow prediction, outperform baseline SOTA, and remain robust under different weather conditions.", "keywords": ["VisionLight", "reinforcement learning", "traffic signal control", "video-based traffic management", "entropy attention"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f5b98213c981ef5d085ef33dc968ef23f6a36263.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
