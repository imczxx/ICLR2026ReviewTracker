Most existing approaches rely on supervised learning, severely limiting practical deployment given annotation scarcity.\n\nTo address this limitation, we propose the Label Transfer Hypothesis (LTH), a theoretical framework for tackling annotation scarcity.   The core hypothesis holds that when diseases present characteristic pathological features, precise lesion segmentation guided by clinical diagnosis and treatment logic can act as \"implicit diagnostic labels\" for disease classification—this enables knowledge transfer from segmentation to classification tasks.   This approach not only reduces annotation requirements while retaining the advantages of supervised classification, but also leverages the combination of the label transfer method and clinical diagnosis and treatment logic to obtain more reliable diagnoses.\n\nWe validate LTH on diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) classification tasks.

The experimental validation in the paper was conducted on two very small and highly balanced classification tasks, where the methods presented in Table 1 merely employed basic supervised approaches—specifically, supervised three-grading for RVO and MobileNet/ResNet18 for DME. However, it is essential to benchmark the proposed approach against state-of-the-art supervised methods on large-scale datasets to convincingly demonstrate its performance parity or superiority, rather than relying on comparisons with outdated or suboptimal models.\n2. The manuscript frequently asserts a \"Theoretical foundation for clinical interpretability,\" yet this pivotal claim remains largely unsubstantiated within the text. Furthermore, the core approach of leveraging lesion information to inform image-level classification is a conventional methodology, routinely employed in fields such as Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) for cellular pathology, where lesional cells are first detected before aggregating this evidence for a final diagnosis. Consequently, the methodological contribution appears limited.\n3.

It builds on the observation that characteristic lesions in diseases like diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion already encode diagnostic information. By treating these lesion annotations as implicit disease labels, LTH transfers knowledge from segmentation to classification tasks. This approach aligns with how clinicians reason through diagnosis, first identifying pathological features and then synthesizing them into conclusions.\n\nThe proposed pipeline involves three steps: lesion segmentation using a modified U-Net with attention mechanisms, feature extraction with a pre-trained VGG19 model and dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised disease classification through clustering of lesion patterns.

The paper addresses a clear and timely problem in medical image analysis: the lack of a unified framework that connects lesion-level segmentation with disease-level diagnosis. Most existing models either depend heavily on large labelled datasets or treat lesions as auxiliary cues rather than the foundation of diagnosis. The authors argue that this gap limits both scalability and clinical interpretability. Their problem statement reframes the task by proposing that lesion annotations, when guided by clinical reasoning, can act as implicit diagnostic labels, offering a way to reduce annotation costs while preserving diagnostic rigour.\n\n2. The system’s design effectively operationalizes this idea through a modular and clinically aligned workflow. It separates the process into three stages: segmentation, feature extraction, and clustering, mirroring how clinicians move from observing individual lesions to forming diagnostic conclusions. This structure allows each module to be trained or refined independently, supports transparent reasoning linked to identifiable lesion patterns, and makes the framework adaptable to other diseases with localized pathological markers. The result is an interpretable and resource-efficient design that bridges computational modelling with clinical practice."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Major weakness\n1. The main weakness is in the lack of true end-to-end learning and the limited validation scope. While the segmentation model is trained, the subsequent feature extraction and clustering steps are unsupervised and rely heavily on hand-crafted choices (e.g., lesion weighting, PCA reduction, clustering algorithm). This breaks the learning pipeline and limits adaptability to more complex or overlapping disease patterns. Additionally, the experiments are restricted to two retinal diseases (DME and RVO) using moderate-sized public datasets, without testing cross-dataset generalization, robustness to noisy annotations, or clinical deployment settings. As a result, it remains uncertain how well the Label Transfer Hypothesis scales to broader modalities or real-world clinical variability.\n\n2. The framework lacks theoretical or quantitative justification for the label transfer assumption itself. While the paper proposes that lesion patterns can serve as implicit diagnostic labels, it does not formally define or test the boundaries of this assumption, such as when lesions are non-specific, overlapping across diseases, or influenced by imaging artifacts. There is no mathematical proof or empirical analysis showing under what conditions the transfer remains valid. This leaves the “Label Transfer Hypothesis” more as an intuitive idea than a rigorously established principle, which may limit its general acceptance or theoretical impact.\n\nMinor - the paper includes various typos and missing references"}, "questions": {"value": "1.
