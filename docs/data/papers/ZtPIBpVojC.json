The vast majority of existing anomaly diagnosis methods offer limited theoretical insights, especially for anomaly localization, which is a vital but largely unexplored area. The aim of this contribution is to study the learning process of a Transformer when applied to MTS by revealing connections to statistical time series methods. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose the Attention Low-Rank Transformer (ALoRa-T) model, which applies low-rank regularization to self-attention, and we introduce the Attention Low-Rank score, effectively capturing the temporal characteristics of anomalies. Finally, to enable anomaly localization, we propose the ALoRa-Loc method, a novel approach that associates anomalies to specific variables by quantifying interrelationships among time series. Extensive experiments and real data analysis, show that the proposed methodology significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both detection and localization tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Anomaly detection", "Anomaly localization", "Multivariate time series", "Space-time autoregression", "Transformer"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/42f981cef80ad79683e271a60dede1995910c734.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/296b1e5ee336a139205d32afb276fab86e22d84c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tackles multivariate time series anomaly diagnosis, covering both detection and localization.
