The encoders are trained jointly via contrastive learning on 20K protein-ligand complexes from PDBbind and 77M ligand-based datapoints from ChEMBL, PubChem, and BindingDB. With ConGLUDe, multiple key drug discovery tasks, including virtual screening, binding pocket prediction, ligand-conditioned pocket selection and target fishing, can be addressed within a single model. ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art performance on virtual screening benchmarks and strong results across other tasks, demonstrating the benefit of joint structure-ligand training.

In particular, we appreciate that the reviewers recognized the power of integrating SBDD and LBDD within a single framework and valued the broad applicability of our model across many different drug discovery tasks.\n\nWe will provide a full set of point-by-point responses and additional experiments in the upcoming full rebuttal. For now, however, we already want to address two recurring concerns raised by multiple reviewers that appear to result from insufficient clarity in our presentation rather than fundamental limitations of our work:\n\n**1.) Technical novelty:**\n\nWhile our model does build on established components (an adapted VN-EGNN as the protein encoder, a simple MLP-based ligand encoder, and a CLIP-style contrastive loss), we use these components in ways that are distinct from prior work:\n* We are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to use VN-EGNN as a general-purpose protein and binding site feature encoder, rather than solely as a pocket prediction model whose final representations are not used for downstream tasks.\n* We uniquely apply the CLIP-style loss directly to a set of pocket representations on a single protein and for a given ligand, enabling the model to select the most likely binding pocket - a capability not explored in prior work.\n\nMore importantly, the **integration of these components is what allows the *combined* training on structure- and ligand-based data** in the first place, unlocking capabilities not achievable by prior methods: ConGLUDe can simultaneously predict whether a ligand binds to a protein and infer the most likely binding pocket, without requiring prior pocket information. In contrast, existing methods either require the pocket as input (e.g., DrugCLIP) and are thus limited to structure-based data, or provide no binding site information at all (e.g., SPRINT). Our framework bridges this gap and offers functionality neither approach can achieve alone.\n\n**2.) Performance and generalization:**\n\nAlthough improvements on individual benchmarks may appear modest when viewed in isolation, our model demonstrates consistently strong performance across diverse datasets and tasks. Notably, it is the *only* method to achieve state-of-the-art performance on *both* DUD-E, a dataset focused on structural complementarity, and LIT-PCBA, which captures broad ligand-activity patterns from HTS assays. This illustrates that our unified method effectively integrates structural and ligand-based information, enabling **robust generalization across heterogeneous tasks**. \n\nFurthermore, we show strong generalization capabilities of ConGLUDe to a new target fishing dataset with a distinct biological curation methodology. Baseline comparisons for these results will be provided in the full rebuttal."}}, "id": "JXzOSq2XSk", "forum": "jmXTF9Jaxa", "replyto": "jmXTF9Jaxa", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19074/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19074/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19074/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763158842680, "cdate": 1763158842680, "tmdate": 1763158842680, "mdate": 1763158842680, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ConGLUDe framework, which aims to unify structure-based and ligand-based drug design through contrastive geometric learning.

Could there be a more intrinsic fusion mechanism? For example, can knowledge learned from large-scale ligand data (such as target selectivity) more directly guide or constrain the learning process from structural data?\n\n3. The discussion of ablation results is insufficient. The ablation experiments in the appendix (Table G4) show that on the DUD-E dataset, the structure-only model significantly outperforms the complete model. While the authors note that DUD-E is less realistic than LIT-PCBA, this result somewhat undermines the core argument that \"fusing both data types is crucial.\" Consider moving this discussion to the main text with a deeper analysis of why this phenomenon occurs.\n\nMinor issues:\n\na.
