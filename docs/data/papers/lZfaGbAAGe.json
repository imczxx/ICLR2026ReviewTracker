State-of-the-art methods for these problems are severely limited by $O(N^3)$ computational complexity. Our method avoids this bottleneck, achieving near-linear \\textbf{$O(N \\log N)$} scaling per sweep.\n\nOur approach samples a joint probability measure over two coupled variable sets: (1) particle trajectories of the fundamental fermions, and (2) auxiliary variables that decouple fermion interactions. The key innovation is a novel transition kernel for particle trajectories formulated in the Fourier domain, revealing the transition probability as a convolution that enables massive acceleration via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The auxiliary variables admit closed-form, factorized conditional distributions, enabling efficient exact Gibbs sampling update.\n\nWe validate our algorithm on benchmark quantum physics problems, accurately reproducing known theoretical results and matching traditional $O(N^3)$ algorithms on $32\\times 32$ lattice simulations at a fraction of the wall-clock time, empirically demonstrating $N \\log N$ scaling. By reformulating a long-standing physics simulation problem in machine learning language, our work provides a powerful tool for large-scale probabilistic inference and opens avenues for physics-inspired generative models.", "tldr": "We present a FFT-Accelerated determinant-free Monte Carlo method for fermionic lattice models that samples a \\emph{joint} imaginary-time measure over particle worldlines and Hubbard--Stratonovich (HS) auxiliary fields.", "keywords": ["Quantum Monte Carlo", "Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation", "energy-based models"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4b6dd02efd197c90bfb87b947675cd65944ccdd0.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a method for solving Hubbard-type models by calculating the proposal probability using the FFT.

In Lattice quantum chromodynamics, the determinant problem is typically solved by the pseudo fermion fields that avoid computing the determinant in favor of solving a linear system (with conjugate gradient) and is combined with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. This approach has also been used in solid state physics (e.g. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37686-4) for problems similar to the the Hubbard model in this paper. Can authors comment on the HMC approach and compare it with their work?\n\n2.
