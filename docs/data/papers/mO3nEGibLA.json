The most useful outcome is a singleton prediction---an unambiguous decision---yet existing efficiency-oriented methods primarily optimize average set size. Motivated by this, we propose a new non-conformity score that is motivated by minimizing the probability of producing non-singleton sets while maintaining coverage. Starting from a non-convex constrained optimization problem as a motivation, we provide a convex-geometric reformulation and associated algorithm for computing the non-conformity score and associated split conformal prediction sets in $O(K)$ time for $K$-class problems. Using this score in split conformal prediction, we introduce Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction (SOCOP). We evaluate our method in experiments on image classification and LLM multiple-choice answering, comparing with standard non-conformity scores such as the (negative) label probability estimates and their cumulative distribution function; both of which are motivated by aiming to optimize average length.

The authors argue that the most useful outcome is a set with just one answer (a \"singleton\"), as it provides a clear, actionable result. \nThey introduce a method called SOCOP (Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction) which is specifically designed to maximize the frequency of these singleton predictions. \nInstead of only trying to make the prediction sets as small as possible on average, SOCOP try to produce unambiguous, single-answer outputs, creating a more practical trade-off for real-world applications where decision clarity is more important than a slightly smaller average set size.\n\n\n**Contribution**\n\nThe main contribution is a novel and highly efficient method to achieve this goal. \nThe authors derive a new \"nonconformity score\" from an optimization objective that directly penalizes non-singleton sets. \nTheir key innovation is a geometric insight that transforms the complex task of calculating this score into a simple computational geometry problem: finding the lower convex hull of a set of 2D points. \nThis allows the score to be computed in fast time, making the method practical even for problems with thousands of classes. \nExperiments on image classification and large language models show that SOCOP significantly increases the rate of singleton predictions (often by over 20%) with only a minimal cost to the average set size, proving its effectiveness and practical value."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "*   The paper's main strength lies in its novel objective function and the corresponding insight into evaluating conformal prediction. By shifting the focus from minimizing average set size to minimizing the probability of non-singleton sets (`P(size > 1)`), the work introduces a practical and well-motivated criterion for efficiency that directly relates to the goal of automated decision-making. This reframing provides a valuable perspective on what constitutes a \"useful\" prediction set in many real-world applications.\n\n*   This conceptual contribution is supported by a thorough and well-explained computational algorithm. The paper provides a deep discussion on how to make the proposed nonconformity score practical, culminating in an efficient O(K) method based on a geometric reformulation involving the lower convex hull. This ensures the method is not just a theoretical construct but a scalable tool that can be readily applied.\n\n*   The work can be seen as a natural and timely extension of recent research on improving the efficiency of conformal sets, such as the work on length optimization by [1]. While that paper focused on minimizing the expected set size, this paper explores a related but distinct objective—maximizing singleton frequency. This progression shows a thoughtful engagement with the state-of-the-art and pushes the conversation forward on defining and optimizing different notions of efficiency in conformal prediction.\n\n\n[Reference] \n\n[1] Kiyani, Shayan, George J.
