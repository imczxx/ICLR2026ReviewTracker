This stagewise development, driven by phase transitions on a degenerate loss landscape, means a sample's importance is not fixed but changes throughout training. In this work, we introduce a developmental framework for data attribution, grounded in singular learning theory. We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first confirm these predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in language models, where token-level influence changes align with known developmental stages.", "tldr": "We demonstrate that neural network influence functions can change dramatically over training due to stagewise development, which challenges the static attribution paradigm and motivates a shift to stagewise data attribution.", "keywords": ["Training data attribution", "influence functions", "singular learning theory", "stagewise development", "phase transitions", "developmental interpretability", "Bayesian influence functions"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4550f05d198fc2cb7dca8853f659a83edabd30e9.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a stage-wise influence framework to track how data influence evolves throughout training.

This challenges a foundational assumption in TDA and provides a compelling, theory-backed explanation for why static influence measures are insufficient for deep learning.\n* Strong Theoretical Grounding: The paper does an excellent job motivating its theoretical choices. It clearly explains the failure of classical IFs (reliance on an invertible Hessian) and the suitability of the BIF (Hessian-free, well-defined on degenerate landscapes). The derivation in Section 2.3, which uses the Law of Total Covariance to predict influence peaks at transitions, is elegant and provides a clear, falsifiable prediction.\n* Attempt to Demonstration at Scale: The authors successfully bridge this gap by attempting to demonstrating their predicted phenomena in Pythia LMs, beyond the toy setting. While these results are correlational (linking influence dynamics to known developmental milestones like induction head formation), they are a crucial step in showing this framework is relevant for models we care about."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* Discrepancy in Observed Dynamics between Toy and Large-Scale Models: A significant discrepancy arises between the compelling theoretical predictions validated in the toy model and the empirical results from the large-scale language model experiments. The core theoretical argument hinges on influence being a highly dynamic quantity, subject to non-monotonic changes and sign-flips (as clearly demonstrated in Fig. 3). However, the influence dynamics observed in the Pythia models (Fig. 5), while temporally staged, appear to be largely monotonic once they become non-zero.\n\nThis observation materially weakens the paper's central critique of static, endpoint-based attribution or simpler trajectory-aggregation methods (e.g., TracIn). If the influence of key data groups simply increases monotonically after a specific developmental stage, then traditional attribution methods applied at or aggregated near the end of training would likely still provide a reasonable approximation of data importance. The practical necessity of the authors' far more complex, dynamically-sampled framework is therefore less evident in the very setting (LLMs) it purports to be essential for.\n\n* Lack of Demonstrated Practical Utility or Actionable Insights: The paper compellingly argues that when a data point exerts its influence is a critical, and previously overlooked, dimension of attribution. However, the analysis remains at an observational level, and the practical utility of this framework is not demonstrated. It is unclear how these findings could inform model development, for instance, to train more capable or efficient models.\n\nA powerful validation of the framework's utility would be to move from this observational analysis to an interventional one. For example, could the authors leverage their findings to design a dynamic data curriculum? If, as the results suggest, the influence of \"induction pattern\" tokens becomes active only during a specific training phase, could dynamically up-weighting these examples during (or just before) that critical phase lead to demonstrably better model performance on induction-related tasks or faster convergence? Without such a demonstration connecting stagewise influence to actionable training strategies, the proposed method, while theoretically interesting, risks being perceived as a diagnostic tool that lacks a clear feedback loop into practical model improvement."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "qbJZhDQgrY", "forum": "8epkNiuAQC", "replyto": "8epkNiuAQC", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20207/Reviewer_Z984"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20207/Reviewer_Z984"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20207/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762491649717, "cdate": 1762491649717, "tmdate": 1762933706224, "mdate": 1762933706224, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
