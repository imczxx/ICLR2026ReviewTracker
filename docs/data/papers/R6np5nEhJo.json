However, its ability to generalize across diverse instances is a key challenge for practical applications. Current research on generalization primarily focuses on problem scale and node distribution. The distance metric between nodes, such as 2D Euclidean distance or geographical distance, is also an important characteristic of VRP instances. Unfortunately, existing NCO methods typically use a single distance metric for both training and testing, neglecting the diversity of distance metrics. To fill this gap, this paper systematically investigates the impact of distance metrics. First, we introduce a benchmarking framework that supports multiple distance metrics and evaluates model generalization across them. Experimental results reveal that models trained on instances with a single distance metric perform poorly on instances with different metrics. This suggests that variations in distance metrics pose a significant challenge to model generalization. Second, we examine several training data configurations and find that jointly training on data with diverse distance metrics significantly improves model generalization across different metrics. Moreover, by integrating our proposed method for distance metric generalization with prior advances for problem scale and node distribution generalization, the performance of NCO models on various real-world VRP instances is substantially improved.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Neural Combinatorial Optimization", "Vehicle Routing Problem"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3f28682667117ffa1eb262c4baaec6e2f955f614.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This manuscript proposes a Multi-Metric training strategy."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "This manuscript is well-structured."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**W1 Limited innovation:** Although the authors proposed a Multi-Metric training strategy, it is relatively simple.

The proposed \"Multi-Metric Training (MMT)\"  is presented as a novel method, but it is functionally identical to the standard, well-known data augmentation strategy of training on a more diverse dataset. The paper's own text highlights this contradiction: it frames \"Multi-Distribution Training (MDT)\"  (training on diverse node distributions) as prior art , while presenting MMT (training on diverse metrics) as its own contribution. This is a distinction without a difference; both are simple data augmentation strategies, and the core \"insight\" that training on diverse data improves generalization on that data is not a sufficient contribution for a top-tier methods conference.   \n\nThe motivation for the benchmark itself is underdeveloped. While the authors provide real-world applications for 3D Euclidean and Geographical distances , they fail to provide any practical justification for the inclusion of other key metrics, such as 2D/3D Manhattan or 2D/3D Maximum distances. Without this context, these additions appear arbitrary, undermining the practical significance of the benchmark. This supports the concern that experiments are being conducted for their own sake rather than to address clearly defined, practical needs.   \n\nThe paper's contribution appears incremental when viewed in the context of recent SOTA \"generalist\" NCO solvers. Works like UniCO (Pan et al., 2025)  are also leveraging matrix-based inputs  to unify entirely different problem types (e.g., TSP, HCP, SAT) , which is a far more significant generalization challenge than generalizing across different instantiations of a distance matrix.   \n\nFurthermore, the \"real-world\" experiment in Section 5 introduces significant confounding variables. To handle large-scale instances (up to 10k nodes), the paper embeds the NCO model into an iterative 'destroy and re-generate' heuristic framework. The final results in Table 3  show the performance of this combined system, making it impossible to decouple the gains from the MDMMT training strategy itself versus the gains from the powerful iterative search framework. A more rigorous design would have included a head-to-head comparison on medium-scale real-world instances without this heuristic wrapper to isolate the model's true performance.   \n\nFinally, the design of the MMT training set is arbitrary and lacks supporting ablation studies. The authors select {2D Euclidean, 3D Euclidean, Geographical} for MMT training  and show it generalizes to unseen metrics like 2D Manhattan. However, the paper provides no analysis as to why this specific combination is effective or if it is optimal. It is unknown if another combination (e.g., {2D Euc, 2D Manhattan, Obstructed}) would also generalize to 3D and Geographical metrics. This lack of analysis makes the specific MMT configuration feel arbitrary and its success on unseen metrics insufficiently explained.\n\nPan, W(2025). \"UniCO: On Unified Combinatorial Optimization via Problem Reduction to Matrix-Encoded General TSP.\" In The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)."}, "questions": {"value": "Can you clarify the methodological novelty of MMT?
