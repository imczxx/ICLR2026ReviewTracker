While machine learning has transformed weather prediction within individual domains, current models inadequately capture cross-component couplings critical for holistic Earth system modeling. Fundamental challenges emerge from the disparities in spatial and temporal scales and prohibitive computational costs of training integrated models ab initio. To overcome these limitations, we present the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Framework (COAF), a deep learning architecture that dynamically couples pre-trained atmospheric and oceanic models through adaptive spectral transformations designed to resolve scale mismatches. COAF introduces two pivotal innovations: An effective structure enabling energy-momentum exchange across domains without structural overhauls of existing models, and an online replay buffer mechanism that enhances long-term stability. Experimental results demonstrate COAF's effectiveness in operational scenarios, achieving a 10\\% reduction in latitude-weighted RMSE for key prognostic variables (Z500, T2m) beyond 10-day forecast horizons. These advancements establish a new paradigm for coupled Earth system modeling that balances physical consistency.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Ocean", "Atmosphere", "Coupler"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6626145d4c5717872aedc3ff028993d5f347b4e4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes COAF (Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Framework), a plug-and-play deep learning architecture designed to bridge oceanic and atmospheric forecasting models through learned flux exchange and temporal alignment mechanisms.

The “flux generation” mechanism, while framed as novel, is conceptually similar to cross-attention or feature fusion methods widely used in multimodal learning.\n\n- Ultimately, the lead time is too small for a coupled model. It should go beyond weather-scale, and into the subseasonal, seasonal, and climate scale. Otherwise, existing AINWP are well-suited for the task. The purpose of coupling should be to extend the timescale of forecasts. \n\n- Phrases like “establishes a new paradigm for Earth system modeling” overreach the evidence presented. The method has yet to demonstrate meaningful coupling feedbacks, scalability, or robustness across seasons and regions. Existing coupled ESM ML emulators already exists and should be at least benchmarked.\n\n- While the paper is thorough, it is overly dense with training algorithms (multi-stage coupler, online replay buffer pseudocode) that obscure intuition.

In particular:\n(a) The introduction is not clearly written, as it seems to make misleading statements in multiple places (see detailed point below)\n(b) The comparison is a bit unorganized (see comments below and the Questions section)\n(c) There are logical inconsistencies in multiple numbers provided\n\n2) The Introduction seems to glorify/overhype ML-based weather forecasting while at the same time undermining traditional weather forecasting (as has seemingly become a trend in AI-weather forecasting cliques). The authors seem to forget that the current ML models are trained on global data generated by traditional models, and these models are pretty robust and based on solid mathematics and numerical computing frameworks. For instance, Lines 51 to 55, the authors seem to point out the problems with traditional forecasting. Moreover, the text goes on to blindly (over)-cite all the AI-weather forecasting models out there to make a minor point. That is bad writing. This is worsened by a heavy lack of citations of traditional work (related to the HRES model on Line 103.) Even Line 49 could use more references, including Stockdale et al. (1997), Xue et al. (2020), and Zhou and Harris (2022). Similarly, on L135, the Srinivas et al. and Rainaud et al. references are very vague ones. I would recommend that the authors add more appropriate citations that discuss how the atmos-ocean coupling is accomplished in ECMWF or NCAR's models.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nZhou, L., & Harris, L.

This makes me question the working hypothesis that coupling atmosphere and ocean, as presented in this study, leads to improved medium-range prediction. Can the authors clarify why this is the case?\n3) Can you explain the rationale behind using GraphCast as a reference in Figure 3, but using FourCastNet in Table 2? To my understanding, ECMWF's AIFS (Lang et al. 2024) is the current state of the art, as has been discussed in multiple studies (Lang et al. (2024), Gupta et al. (2025)). I believe these (and other studies) should be references to make a clear point what justifies using GraphCast as the reference here.\n4) Is there any special provision to distinguish between the ocean and sea-ice component of the Earth system? There does not seem to be any such provision, which can lead to inaccuracies in A2O and O2A fluxes.\n5) Table 1: Given that FuXi and COAF offer similar performance, I would recommend adding FuXi to Table 1 as well.\n6) Also, I think Table 1 is misleading, as many models mentioned in the table were trained at a 0.25-degree resolution. Which makes them 5-6 times finer. This resolution corresponds to a 25-36 times increase in model size and thus training times. Moreover, these models also considered a much broader range of input variables and thus have more channels. Thus, accounting for this, I don't think the COAF Stage 3 training time itself offers any significant improvement in training times. \n7) I do not know what to make of Figure 4. It does not inform me of anything, I am not sure why all of a sudden the authors compare their prediction to ERA5 (and not HRES), and why no other model has been shown in the figure (GraphCast for instance). In its current state, I would rather just remove this figure and it does not provde any useful information whatsoever. \n8) Fig 3 and Fig 4 suggest to me that even including ocean-atmos coupling does not provide any notable improvements over medium-range timescales - making me question the central hypothesis behind the analysis. Can the authors comment on why that is?\n9) Fig 6: The large-scale features in geopotential height are arguably much easier to predict. The figure clearly shows that the COAF models fails to capture the small-scale features both at 5 day and 10 day lead times. This further reduces my confidence in the study and the \"SOTA\" forecasting skill reported in this study.\n\n\nMinor:\n1) L149: I don't think such explorations remain unexplored. There have been ample 'traditional' explorations.\n2) L363: HRES is NOT a dynamical core but a proper operational forecast model built on top of the spectral dynamical core\n3) Line 328-329: over 13 pressure levels, not along with.\n4) In Fig 3, IFS-HRES should not have a * because the original resolution for HRES is 9 km.\n5) Why are ocean variables not shown in the main text? Given that the central focus of the study is on atmos-ocean coupling?\n6) L478-479: COAF's performance cannot possibly be claimed as SOTA when it is not even compared against the actual SOTA (which is AIFS). Why not compare the prediction skill against ECMWF's AIFS instead, which is the actual state of the art in ML weather prediction right now?\n\nReferences:\n1) Lang, Simon, et al. \"AIFS--ECMWF's data-driven forecasting system.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.01465 (2024).\n\n2) Gupta, Aman, Aditi Sheshadri, and Dhruv Suri. \"MAUSAM: An Observations-focused assessment of Global AI Weather Prediction Models During the South Asian Monsoon.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2509.01879 (2025).\n\n3) Noah D.
