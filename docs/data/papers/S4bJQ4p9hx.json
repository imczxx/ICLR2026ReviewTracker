However, conventional atom-centric models, which treat chemical bonds merely as pairwise interactions, often overlook complex bond-level phenomena like resonance and stereoselectivity. This oversight limits their predictive accuracy for nuanced chemical behaviors. To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{DeMol}, a dual-graph framework whose architecture is motivated by a rigorous information-theoretic analysis demonstrating the information gain from a bond-centric perspective. DeMol explicitly models molecules through parallel atom-centric and bond-centric channels. These are synergistically fused by multi-scale Double-Helix Blocks designed to learn intricate atom-atom, atom-bond, and bond-bond interactions. The framework's geometric consistency is further enhanced by a regularization term based on covalent radii to enforce chemically plausible structures. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks, including PCQM4Mv2, OC20 IS2RE, QM9, and MoleculeNet, show that DeMol establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods. These results confirm the superiority of explicitly modelling bond information and interactions, paving the way for more robust and accurate molecular machine learning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Molecule Representation Learning", "Bond Modelling", "Molecule Property Prediction"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/28be061f7e5f9a6e3e1349f718c66298b971c6da.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The manuscript proposes DeMol, a model designed to capture atom–atom, atom–bond, and bond–bond interactions.
