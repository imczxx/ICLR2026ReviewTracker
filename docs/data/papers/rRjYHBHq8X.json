Unlike forms of regression that fit parameters assuming a fixed model structure, symbolic regression is a search problem over the space of expressions, represented, for example, as abstract syntax trees using a library of operators. Symbolic regression is typically used in settings with limited, noisy data in the natural sciences. However, searching for a single best-fitting expression fails to capture the epistemic uncertainty about the expression, which motivates a Bayesian perspective that enables uncertainty quantification and specification of natural priors to constrain the search space. In this work, we propose ERRLESS (Entropy-Regularised Reinforcement Learning for Expression Structure Sampling), a scalable approach for sampling the posterior distribution over expressions given data using maximum-entropy reinforcement learning. ERRLESS learns a neural policy that constructs expressions sequentially by building up their abstract syntax trees. At convergence, the policy samples expressions from the posterior. At test time, expressions can be sampled by rollouts of this policy. We demonstrate that ERRLESS achieves near state-of-the-art exact symbolic recovery on the AI Feynman benchmark. Beyond exact recovery, we demonstrate that the mean of the posterior predictive approximated by ERRLESS achieves a coefficient of determination ($R^2$) of $0.98$, highlighting the benefits of the Bayesian perspective in symbolic regression.", "tldr": "We use maximum-entropy reinforcement learning to approximate a posterior over expressions for symbolic regression.", "keywords": ["maximum-entropy reinforcement learning", "symbolic regression", "bayesian methods", "uncertainty quantification"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7b6c821a46675ded8ff8830070c9fdf7bde496f8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper study the a Bayesian symbolic regression (SR) framework and proposes  Entropy-Regularized Reinforcement Learning for Expression Structure Sampling \n\nERRLESS models a posterior distribution over expressions using maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (RL).

Using a neural policy trained via reinforcement learning to generate symbolic expressions has been extensively explored in prior works such as Deep Symbolic Regression (Petersen et al., 2019), the Finite Expression Method (Liang et al., 2022), PhySO (Tenachi et al., 2023), Neural-Guided Genetic Programming (Li et al., 2023). ERRLESS largely follows this paradigm, differing mainly in applying a Bayesian interpretation.\n\nThe paper could improve by clearly distinguishing what aspects of the Bayesian formulation are algorithmically new (e.g., how entropy regularization meaningfully approximates posterior inference beyond standard policy exploration) and by acknowledging that probabilistic sampling of expressions is already a common practice in symbolic regression.\n\nThe introduction and related work should also discuss Parsing the Language of Expression (Huang et al., 2025), which incorporates domain-aware symbolic priors, and other grammar-based Bayesian approaches (e.g., Probabilistic Regular Tree Priors, Grammar-Guided GP). This would provide a more accurate contextual positioning.\n\nBayesian Formulation and Computational Feasibility\n\nThe proposed Bayesian approach introduces significant computational overhead without evidence of efficiency or scalability benefits.\n\nModeling a posterior over both expression structures and parameters entails sampling from a high-dimensional, multimodal distribution, which is computationally intractable for expressions with many constants. In practice, the method collapses this to a simple Gaussian approximation, undermining the Bayesian claim.\n\nThe paper could improve by (a) including runtime and complexity analyses, (b) providing ablation studies showing how posterior sampling scales with model size, and (c) discussing approximations (e.g., variational or factorized posteriors) that might make the Bayesian framework practical.\n\nBottom-Up Generation Justification\n\nThe claimed advantages of bottom-up tree generation—namely producing valid intermediate expressions and easier dimensional checks—are not unique to this design.\n\nTop-down generation frameworks can also ensure dimensional compatibility through type constraints or operator masking (as in PhySO) and can extract valid subexpressions from partial trees.\n\nTo strengthen this component, the authors should provide comparative experiments or ablation results demonstrating concrete benefits (e.g., reduced invalid expressions or faster convergence) of bottom-up versus top-down generation.\n\nExperimental Scope and Analysis\n\nThe quantitative results show comparable or slightly worse performance than existing methods (e.g., 44% recovery on Feynman versus ~59% for PhySO and 50–60% for DSR/PySR). Yet, the discussion emphasizes conceptual rather than numerical advantages.\n\nThe paper would be stronger with statistical analyses (variance, confidence intervals) and runtime comparisons across methods, which would help clarify whether ERRLESS provides any tradeoff between accuracy, uncertainty, and efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, more real-world or scientific case studies (beyond synthetic and Feynman benchmarks) would help demonstrate the claimed benefits in uncertainty quantification or robustness.\n\nUse of Structural and Physical Priors\n\nThe inclusion of structural priors and physical constraints is not new. Prior work such as Parsing the Language of Expression (Huang et al., 2025), SciMED (Nature 2024), ParFam (OpenReview 2025), and Grammar-Guided GP already incorporate these ideas.\n\nThe authors could strengthen their contribution by proposing a more formal or learnable prior mechanism (e.g., data-driven estimation of structural likelihoods or adaptive physical-unit embeddings) rather than manually specified constraints.\n\nPresentation and Scope of Claims\n\nWhile the writing is generally clear, several claims (e.g., “amortizes sampling of both structures and parameters efficiently” and “bottom-up generation enables better physical reasoning”) are overstated relative to the evidence.\n\nThe authors should moderate such claims or substantiate them with direct quantitative or ablation evidence. Clarifying the limitations of the Bayesian approximation would improve credibility."}, "questions": {"value": "Clarification on Bayesian Inference Approximation\n\nThe paper frames ERRLESS as performing Bayesian inference over both structures and parameters. Could the authors clarify how the high-dimensional posterior over constants is represented and sampled in practice?\n\nIs the policy sampling parameters from a fixed Gaussian, or is there an adaptive approximation (e.g., variational or amortized posterior)?\n\nA more detailed description of the Bayesian approximation would help assess whether ERRLESS meaningfully captures parameter uncertainty or simply adds stochasticity to RL sampling.\n\nComputational Complexity and Runtime Evidence\n\nThe paper claims that ERRLESS amortizes parameter fitting into policy training, implying computational advantages. Could the authors provide runtime comparisons (e.g., training time or sample efficiency) versus existing methods such as DSR, PySR, PhySO, or FEX?\n\nHow does the method scale with expression depth, number of constants, or dataset size? Concrete complexity or scaling curves would make the efficiency claim more convincing.\n\nBottom-Up Generation vs. Top-Down Approaches\n\nThe authors argue that bottom-up tree construction ensures valid intermediate expressions and easier enforcement of dimensional consistency.\n\nCould they provide an empirical comparison or ablation study showing how bottom-up generation affects search efficiency, validity rates, or symbolic recovery compared to a top-down baseline?\n\nIf both strategies are possible, under what conditions is bottom-up generation more advantageous?\n\nQuantitative Analysis of Uncertainty Quality\n\nThe paper highlights uncertainty quantification as a strength. Could the authors provide quantitative metrics for uncertainty calibration (e.g., negative log-likelihood, coverage probability) and compare them with ensemble-based or bootstrapped SR methods?\n\nDemonstrating that the posterior uncertainty is useful (e.g., for model selection or active learning) would significantly strengthen the paper’s claims.\n\nEvaluation Breadth and Reproducibility\n\nThe benchmarks are limited to synthetic and Feynman datasets. Are there plans to test ERRLESS on real-world scientific or engineering problems, where uncertainty estimation might be critical?\n\nProviding open-source code and pre-trained policies would also enhance the paper’s impact and reproducibility.\n\nTreatment of Structural and Physical Priors\n\nThe use of structural and dimensional priors resembles earlier approaches such as Parsing the Language of Expression (Huang et al., 2025), PhySO (Tenachi et al., 2023), and ParFam (2025).\n\nCould the authors clarify what is new in their prior formulation—does it introduce learnable or data-driven components beyond manually specified grammar rules?\n\nIf possible, an ablation comparing ERRLESS with and without these priors would help quantify their contribution.\n\nInterpretation of “Amortized Sampling”\n\nThe phrase “amortizing sampling of both expression structures and parameters” is central to the paper’s narrative. Could the authors more precisely define this term?\n\nIs the amortization referring to shared policy parameters across different expressions (as in DSR) or to efficient reuse of parameter inference results?
