Building on recent advancements in 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), current surgical scene reconstruction (SSR) methods have made notable initial progress. Despite this progress, challenges remain in accurately tracking local tissue deformations during surgery, primarily due to the lack of deformation constraints within the local Gaussian neighborhoods of surgical tissues. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a local geometric refinement (LGR) framework based on 3DGS for high-fidelity SSR. Specifically, we first utilize prior visual information to efficiently perform the Gaussian initialization. Following the initialization, we incorporate local geometric constraints to accurately track the local non-rigid deformations occurring in the surgical scene. Furthermore, considering the low-quality scenarios in real surgeries, we apply low-quality enhancement to optimize the fidelity of local details in the preliminarily rendered scene. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that LGR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it achieves an average improvement of over 50\\% in terms of LPIPS, a metric that better reflects human perceptual consistency, while maintaining favorable computational cost. These results highlight the great potential of the proposed LGR for promoting practical applications in surgical scenarios. *Our code and model will be released publicly*.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Surgical Scene Reconstruction; Local Geometric Refinement; 3D Gaussian Splatting; Surgical Video Analysis"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e4759e55a381ffcadeaa74d82deaadd933f6c61e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d9baece9acd423e714fc304f486304d2e07da33e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces LGR, a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for semantic and dynamic surgical scene reconstruction.

First, the potential for metric inflation via LQE remains a concern: it is unclear whether LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM are computed against raw ground-truth images or LQE-enhanced targets. If both outputs and ground truths are post-processed, reported gains may conflate reconstruction quality with enhancement effects. Second, the supplementary material provides a PowerPoint file rather than a video, why? Moreover, qualitative comparisons across methods show only subtle differences; zoomed-in visualizations or pixel-wise error maps (e.g., LPIPS heatmaps) would better support perceptual claims. Third, although LGR is framed as generalizable, it is tightly coupled to domain-specific priors such as depth maps and surgical tool masks. Its adaptability to non-surgical scenes or monocular input remains unclear, and its robustness to noisy or missing priors is not evaluated. Finally, while the LQE module is shown to improve perceptual fidelity, its architecture and training regime are only briefly described. Further detail is needed to understand whether LQE introduces its own artifacts, how it avoids overfitting, and how it interacts with the rest of the pipeline. Besides, since the LQE is a common method, can the LQE imporve the performance of previous metheds like endonerf / forplane/ surgicalgaussian/endogaussian? Finally, the method relies on pre-calibrated camera poses, yet makes no reference to surgical SLAM systems (e.g., EndoSLAM, EndoGSLAM), which directly address pose estimation in deformable surgical scenes.

To address these limitations, LGR introduces three key components:1. Gaussian Initialization using multi-frame visual priors (RGB, depth, and tool masks) for robust point cloud seeding. 2.

Limited technical novelty in Gaussian initialization: The proposed Gaussian initialization largely replicates the strategy used in EndoGaussian (Liu et al., 2024b), relying on back-projection of RGB, depth, and mask priors without introducing a fundamentally new approach.\n2. Local geometric constraints lack originality: The Local Geometric Constraints (LGC) module employs a standard KNN-based neighborhood consistency formulation—common in many non-rigid deformation frameworks—and does not significantly advance beyond existing practices. Moreover, methods like HexPlane already inherently enforce local smoothness through their structured feature representation, making the added LGC potentially redundant.\n3. Low-Quality Enhancement (LQE) appears superficial: The LQE module seems to apply an off-the-shelf CNN-based image enhancement pipeline (inspired by Restormer/RSDFormer) to the rendered output, without clear justification that it is jointly optimized or specifically adapted to the surgical reconstruction task. It may simply be enhancing the ground truth or rendered image as a post-processing step, offering minimal integration with the core 3DGS framework.\n4. Incomplete experimental validation: While experiments on EndoNeRF and StereoMIS are provided, the paper omits evaluation on the Hamlyn dataset beyond a brief mention in the appendix.

Does the Local Geometric Constraints (LGC) module offer a meaningful advance over existing local consistency strategies? Since KNN-based neighborhood regularization is a well-established technique in non-rigid deformation modeling.\n3. How deeply integrated is the Low-Quality Enhancement (LQE) module into the core 3DGS reconstruction pipeline? If LQE is essentially a pre-trained CNN-based post-processing step applied to rendered images (inspired by Restormer/RSDFormer), in what way is it specifically tailored to or jointly optimized with the surgical scene reconstruction task, rather than acting as a generic image enhancer?\n4. Why is the Hamlyn dataset not included in the main experimental evaluation?

The core novelty of the paper to constrain the local consistency is not new and is essentially the same as the as-rigid-as-possible loss/rigidity loss, which has been widely used in the previous 4DGS works [1][2][3]. The experimental comparisons and analysis with these previous methods are also needed to show the improvement of the proposed work. \n2. The proposed LQE method also lacks novelty, which seems like a post-processing step to refine/repair the quality of rendered images before computing loss. However, this is not fair to the compared methods without this refinement. Additionally, it remains unclear whether the FPS results reported in Table 1 include the computational cost of this post-processing step.\n3. The related work is not sufficient and lacks a lot in 4DGS. As mentioned in 1, the related work needs to include the recent 4DGS works, but not limited to surgical reconstruction with 3DGS or NeRF. \n4. Missing comparison with recent 4DGS methods, for example, Surgicalgs[4], MoDGS[5], Instant4D[6], 4DGC[7]\n5. The effectiveness of the method is also questionable. As shown in Table 6, it seems that L_ssim accounts for the majority of gains in LPIPS and PSNR, while the proposed LGC-related losses contribute only marginal improvements. Additionally, Table 3 and Table 2 show that the module LQE contributes most to the improvement on LPIPS, which is a post-refinement module and not the core contribution of the paper.\n\n\n[1] Huang, Yi-Hua, et al. \"Sc-gs: Sparse-controlled gaussian splatting for editable dynamic scenes.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2024.\n\n[2] Lei, Jiahui, et al. \"Mosca: Dynamic gaussian fusion from casual videos via 4d motion scaffolds.\" Proceedings of the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference. 2025.\n\n[3] Wang, Qianqian, et al. \"Shape of motion: 4d reconstruction from a single video.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2025.\n\n[4] Chen, Jialei, et al. \"Surgicalgs: Dynamic 3d gaussian splatting for accurate robotic-assisted surgical scene reconstruction.\" International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention.
