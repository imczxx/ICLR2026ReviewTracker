Metamaterial discovery aims at identifying novel microstructures towards specific applications, such as transportation, robotics, etc. Traditional knowledge-driven metamaterial discovery methods are computationally expensive. While recent data-driven generative models accelerate design, they demand explicit numerical targets and struggle to understand the language descriptions of a concept or idea that is critical for the early design stage. Conversely, large language models readily understand such language intents but lack geometric awareness and physical constraints. To bridge this gap between language understanding and geometric awareness, we propose L**inguaMate**, an inference-time multi-agent optimization framework that empowers language-guided metamaterial discovery via symbolic-driven latent optimization. By jointly aligning language, geometry, and property spaces, LinguaMate discovers physically valid microstructures that extend beyond the boundaries of existing literature and training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LinguaMate (1) improves structural validity by up to 34% in symmetry and nearly 98% in periodicity compared to the strongest generative baselines; (2) achieves about 6–7% higher prompt-guidance scores while maintaining superior diversity relative to advanced reasoning LLMs; (3) qualitative analyses confirm the effectiveness of symbolic logic operators in enabling programmable semantic alignment; and (4) real-world case studies further validate its practical capability in metamaterial discovery.

It would be very helpful to have a walkthrough or pseudo code for the entire process of generating a new material in the main text. \n\n**Missing details**\n- Table 1 is not very helpful as many of the symbols are not defined in the main text.\n- It's not specified how the likelihoods for the generator are defined as far as I can tell.

For example, as far as I know CDVAE does not generate edge structures and it's unclear how that was handled in this case\n\n**Methodology**\n- The system is very complex, without substantial justification for the complexity. There isn't really a formal justification that the LLM components are improving the performance.\n-  Authors claim that the decoder is explicitly disentangled, but the diagram of the implementation suggests there are shared layers in the decoder. I don't understand how to reconcile these two things.\n  - Given this, it's unclear how meaningful the symbolic operations actually are.\n- The method relies on ML learned evaluation for optimizing for target properties, which could potentially bias the results.\n\n**Evaluation**\n- The main goal of this paper is property guided generation, however this isn't properly evaluated. The metrics reported are only validity, diversity and a questionable LLM evaluated metric for language guidance.
