Deep learning-based methods attempting to address this challenge suffer from overfitting due to sparse and biased training data and inadequate validation practices. We first show that the over-optimism in prevalent deep learning-based methods is due to incorrect validation setups, and their actual performance approaches that of random selection. We then present MotifScreen, a structure-based end-to-end virtual screening method that addresses these limitations through principle-guided multi-task learning. We ask our network to rationalize the prediction by understanding the principles of protein-ligand interactions in a step-by-step manner: 1) receptor pocket analyses, 2) ligand-pocket chemical compatibility, and 3) ligand binding probability given its compatibility. This multi-task framework, trained on a new dataset specifically curated for the task, significantly outperforms existing methods and classification-only baselines when evaluated on a stand-alone test set.", "tldr": "We propose MotifScreen, a structure-based virtual screening (VS) method that overcomes limitations of many deep learning VS models through principle-guided multitask learning, along with a new benchmark set designed to test true generalization.", "keywords": ["Virtual Screening", "Protein-Ligand Interaction Prediction", "Multitask learning", "Stucture-Based Drug Design", "Benchmark", "Graph Neural Networks"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3386c48a0bd18ed6c05843f65be7bb95fa59aba3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper argues that widely used SBVS benchmarks suffer from target leakage and ligand bias, which inflate reported DL performance.

This setup likely depresses MotifScreen's DUD-E EF1% (5.94) and weakens any one-to-one comparisons between the models. A fair test would retrain baselines under the proposed training dataset or evaluate all methods on a single leakage-controlled split.\n- **Use of $\\Delta$ (performance drop) without harmonizing metric ranges or training regimes.** The manuscript subtracts EF1%/AUROC values between external benchmarks and ChEMBL-LR to argue smaller degradation for MotifScreen. However, EF1% ranges and training conditions differ across benchmarks and methods, making raw subtraction potentially misleading. A consolidated table exists (Table D5), but $\\Delta$ remains hard to interpret as \"generalization\" without a common training/eval protocol.\n- **Early-enrichment evidence is mixed versus the strongest baseline.**  EF1% gains over SurfDock are not statistically significant (p = 0.161), which matters because early enrichment drives SBVS utility. The manuscript foregrounds AUROC, potentially obscuring this point.\n- **Ablation study's design choices look ad-hoc.** Ablations use a reduced dataset and report epoch 31 snapshots. Figure D2 indicates similar validation set's AUROC trajectories between \"aff+motif\", \"aff+motif+str\" configurations. Without multi-seed runs or later-epoch checks, conclusions about hierarchical synergy risk over-interpretation.\n- **ChEMBL-LR vs. LIT-PCBA: incremental benefit unclear.** The paper argues LIT-PCBA's low AVE is limited (reported on only 4 targets) and leakage under external training data source (e.g., PDBbind). However, LIT-PCBA already uses experimentally measured inactives and, by the authors' own RF results, remains difficult across all 15 targets ( including the 11 with potential leakage), yielding low AUROC even when leakage could help. This can be treated as an evidence that LIT-PCBA already probes generalization. Absent a uniform, leakage-controlled training/evaluation of all methods, it is unclear what ChEMBL-LR contributes beyond more targets with target-wise separation, rather than fundamentally stronger bias control."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **Normalization of $\\Delta$ metrics.** Since EF1% ranges and dataset compositions differ across benchmarks, how do authors justify interpreting raw $\\Delta$EF1% as generalization?

How many seeds were run for Table 3/Figure D2? Could authors report later-epoch or full-training ablations (or confidence intervals) to substantiate the hierarchical-synergy claim?\n3. **Cross-docking criterion.** Sequence identity >95% is a strong but it may be an indirect criteria in terms of SBVS where we generally knows about the binding pocket. Did authors consider pocket-level similarity (e.g., local alignment, cavity overlap)?\n4. **Inference score.** Please confirm that ŷ (final scalar binding prediction) is the ranking score used in all screening experiments, and note where this is specified in the main text.\n5. **EF1% and BEDROC reporting.** Since early enrichment is crucial in VS, why is BEDROC only in the appendix rather than in the main comparison tables alongside EF1%/AUROC?

Similar binding pockets tend to bind similar molecules, and similar molecules tend to interact with similar pockets — this assumption underlies all machine learning–based models in this field. Based on this, the actives in any test set will naturally have higher similarity to the reference ligands. Therefore, this so-called ligand bias reflects an inherent relationship within the data itself, and its presence has a certain scientific justification.\n\nSecond, in terms of model design, the proposed architecture lacks novelty. Components such as the SE(3) Transformer, EGNN, and grid-based representations have already been widely used in related molecular representation and virtual screening models.\n\nThird, the dataset, the use of random decoys makes the task overly easy. The real challenge lies in distinguishing structurally or physicochemically similar compounds; performance on average or dissimilar decoys is less meaningful. the BEDROC should be reported to show the top-ranking performance in table 1.\n\nFinally,  as a new benchmark, it should include a comprehensive evaluation across a wide range of models to ensure fairness and demonstrate general applicability."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

First, the absolute value of EF1% is influenced by the ratio of actives to decoys in each dataset. Moreover, different datasets (such as DUD-E and DEKOIS 2.0) were used to calculate the drop for different models, making the comparisons inconsistent. In addition, the paper does not report results on more recent virtual screening models but only  docking based methods.\n\n3. The key challenge of this task lies in the enrichment of active compounds at the top of the ranking list. Therefore, metrics such as BEDROC, which assign higher weights to top-ranked molecules, are more appropriate than AUROC.

Lack of a robust strategy to avoid false negatives.**\n\nThe authors construct their decoy set by sampling actives from other targets in ChEMBL. However, I question why the authors only use Tanimoto similarity to filter these decoys, without employing other computational tools (e.g., docking, cofolding tools) to prevent false negatives. For DEKOIS 2.0 or DUD-E, decoys are drawn from large ligand libraries like ZINC, which contain many inactive molecules, posing a lower risk of including false negatives. In contrast, ChEMBL is a library of bioactive compounds, and it is one of the most popular library to identify initial hits. It is plausible that compounds from this library could exhibit activity against a target, even if they are structurally dissimilar to known actives.\n\n**2. Is the constructed decoy set truly better than LIT-PCBA's inactive set?**\n\nIn Table 1, the authors claim that ChEMBL-RL achieves better bias control than LIT-PCBA due to a lack of protein-side data leakage. However, this is not a fair comparison, given that LIT-PCBA uses **experimentally validated inactives**, while ChEMBL-RL use **putative inactives** (i.e., cross-decoys). Removing bias from a limited set of _experimental_ data is arguably more difficult than drawing a decoy set from a large pool of _assumed_ inactives minimizing a bias.\n\nMoreover, the AVE values in the original LIT-PCBA paper appear lower than the values reported here. The authors should justify why they report the AVE for only 4 targets from LIT-PCBA.\n\n**3. Flawed EF1% comparison.**\n\nThe EF1% values in Table 2 cannot be directly compared across different benchmarks. This metric is highly dependent on the ratio of actives to decoys (i.e., the size of the decoy set), which differs between benchmarks.\n\n---\n\n## MotifScreen\n\n**4. Unfair comparative study.**\n\nMotifScreen is trained on three datasets (PDBbind, BioLip, and ChEMBL), creating a training set that is significantly larger (reportedly ~6x) than those used for the baseline models (PDBBind). For a fair comparison, the authors should either report MotifScreen's performance when trained only on PDBbind or retrain the baseline models using the same extended training set. For models like KarmaDock, which has separate structure and affinity modules, it seems feasible to retrain its affinity module using the binding affinity-only data in ChEMBL.\n\n**5. Poor performance on DUD-E.**\n\nIn Table D5, MotifScreen's EF1% on the DUD-E benchmark is only 5.94, which is substantially lower than the baseline models (9-16) and other state-of-the-art methods (e.g., GLIDE[1], RTMScore[2],  GenScore[3], PIGNet2[4]) that report EF1% > 20 (you can see the value in GenScore Paper). Given that MotifScreen uses an extended training dataset, this performance is insufficient to support the claim of robustness. The authors state they filtered the training set to avoid leakage; they should also report performance _without_ this filtering to clarify if this is the cause.\n\nWhile target leakage is a valid concern, many drug development campaigns focus on known targets. Therefore, evaluating performance on targets similar to the training set is still a necessary and practical assessment.\n\n**6. Missing evaluation on DEKOIS 2.0.**\n\nIn Table D5, results for MotifScreen on the DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark are absent. The authors should evaluate the model on the DEKOIS 2.0.\n\n\n---\n**Reference:**\n1. Halgren, Thomas A., et al. \"Glide: a new approach for rapid, accurate docking and scoring. 2.
