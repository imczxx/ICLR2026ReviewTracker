Recent advances leverage generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based methods, to better capture multi-modal action distributions and temporal dependencies. However, these approaches typically impose conditioning during the forward and reverse process, which inevitably introduces manifold deviation and estimation error. In this work, we propose BridgePolicy, a condition-free generative visuomotor policy that explicitly incorporates observations into the forward process through a diffusion bridge formulation grounded in stochastic optimal control. By sampling actions from observation distributions instead of random noise, BridgePolicy reduces stochasticity and achieves more controllable policy behaviors. However, directly bridging observations to actions poses new challenges, as the action distribution may exhibit mismatched data shape, and the robot observations are inherently multi-modal. In contrast, the diffusion bridge can only connect one-to-one distributions with the same shape.  To address the challenges of aligning distributional endpoints and handling multi-modal robot observations, we design a semantic aligner for distribution shape alignment, and a modality fusion module for unifying robot states and visual inputs. Experiments across 52 tasks on 3 benchmarks and 4 real-world tasks demonstrate that BridgePolicy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative policies.", "tldr": "BridgePolicy learns visuomotor policies without conditioning by bridging observations to actions via diffusion bridges.", "keywords": ["visuomotor policy learning", "imitation learning", "generative model"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1b897174dbd1ff6f1f9a0686a983f8c3149603d5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a46f91bd30648252cebbb2d6d4a67699947c1b76.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a new generative visuomotor policy that is condition-free and maps observations directly to actions through a diffusion bridge grounded in stochastic optimal control.

However, the paper provides no direct evidence to support this claim. The only evidence is improved task success, which is an indirect and inconclusive metric for this specific claim. \n\n2. **Poor Justification for Key Design Choices in the Aligner:** The proposed alignment loss (Eq. 9) is a core contribution, yet its components are poorly justified. The KL regularization term, $D_{KL}(z_{obs}, \\epsilon)$, forces the encoded observation latent distribution towards a standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, I)$. The paper claims this \"ensures the observation maintains its sampling ability,\" a vague and unsubstantiated statement. This regularization is highly counter-intuitive; it actively penalizes the model for learning the true, complex, multi-modal structure of the observation space, potentially leading to mode collapse. This directly contradicts the goal of leveraging \"information-rich observations\" and seems more like a VAE-esque regularization hack than a principled choice for a diffusion bridge endpoint. A strong justification for why one would want to destroy the natural structure of the observation manifold is absent.\n\n3. **Insufficient and Unconvincing Experimental Validation:** The empirical evidence, while showing positive trends, is not rigorous enough to support the strong claims of superiority. The simulation results are averaged over only 3 random seeds.\n\n4. **Crucial Ablations are Missing:** The paper fails to ablate the most important new hyperparameters introduced. The alignment loss introduces weights $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. The paper's performance is likely highly sensitive to these parameters, yet no ablation study is provided to analyze their impact or justify their chosen values. The parameter sensitivity analysis in Table 3 only investigates $\\lambda$ and $\\gamma$ from the base UniDB framework, which is insufficient. This is a critical omission that questions the robustness and generality of the method."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can the authors provide a rigorous theoretical or empirical justification for the KL regularization term $D_{KL}(z_{obs}, \\epsilon)$ in Equation 9? Forcing the information-rich observation endpoint $x_T = z_{obs}$ of the diffusion bridge to be distributed as a standard Gaussian seems fundamentally at odds with the goal of the model. Why should the learned latent observation distribution match unstructured noise? Have you investigated the impact of removing this term (i.e., setting $\\beta=0$)?\n\n2. The simulation results in Table 1 are based on only 3 seeds and exhibit very high variance, making the performance differences between BridgePolicy and the top baseline (FlowPolicy) statistically questionable. Could the authors please run experiments with more seeds (e.g., 5 or 10) and provide statistical significance tests to properly validate the claim of superior performance?\n\n3. The alignment loss $L_{align}$ introduces two crucial hyperparameters, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Their values could heavily influence the model's performance. Why was an ablation study on these hyperparameters omitted? Can you provide this analysis and explain how their values were determined for the final experiments?\n\n4. The paper's motivation rests on avoiding \"manifold deviation\" and \"fitting error.\" Beyond the final task success rates, can you provide any direct evidence that BridgePolicy actually mitigates these specific issues? \n\n5.
