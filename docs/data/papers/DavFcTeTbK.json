In contrast to small-scale scenes, large-scale scenes inevitably contain sparsely observed regions with excessively sparse initial points. In this case, supervising Gaussians initialized from low-frequency sparse points with high-frequency images often induces uncontrolled densification and redundant primitives, degrading both efficiency and quality. Intuitively, this issue can be mitigated with scheduling strategies, which can be categorized into two paradigms: modulating target signal frequency via densification and modulating sampling frequency via image resolution. However, previous scheduling strategies are primarily hardcoded, failing to perceive the convergence behavior of the scene frequency. To address this, we reframe scene reconstruction problem from the perspective of signal structure recovery, and propose SIG, a novel scheduler that Synchronizes Image supervision with Gaussian frequencies. Specifically, we derive the average sampling frequency and bandwidth of 3D representations, and then regulate the training image resolution and the Gaussian densification process based on scene frequency convergence. Furthermore, we introduce Sphere-Constrained Gaussians, which leverage the spatial prior of initialized point clouds to control Gaussian optimization. Our framework enables frequency-consistent, geometry-aware, and floater-free training, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a substantial margin in both efficiency and rendering quality in large-scale scenes.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Gaussian Splatting", "large-scale scene reconstruction", "signal structure recovery"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/30299237a44e4583503cd037dc1e959d9dae4831.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper identifies a key problem in scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting to large-scale scenes: the mismatch between sparse initial 3D points and high-frequency image supervision.
