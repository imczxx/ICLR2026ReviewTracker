Token dropping can reduce training cost, yet naïve strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT (Sparse--Dense Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers), a simple method that enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256^2, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG) nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality.

The authors propose SPRINT (Sparse-Dense Residual Fusion), a novel training and architecture strategy that enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT divides the DiT into three parts: a dense shallow encoder (fθ) that processes all tokens to capture local detail, a sparse deep middle block (gθ) that processes a subset of tokens to model global semantics, and a decoder (hθ) that fuses features from both paths via a residual connection. The method uses a two-stage training schedule (long sparse pre-training followed by short full-token fine-tuning) and a structured group-wise token sampling strategy to ensure local coverage. Additionally, the paper introduces Path-Drop Guidance (PDG), an efficient substitute for Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) that nearly halves inference FLOPs by bypassing the expensive middle blocks during the unconditional pass. Experiments on ImageNet show SPRINT achieves significant training speedups (e.g., 9.8x fewer TFLOPs to reach comparable quality to SiT-XL) and improved inference efficiency with PDG."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "1. Significant Training Efficiency: The primary strength is the massive reduction in training computation. The paper demonstrates that SPRINT can reach a quality level comparable to the 1400-epoch SiT-XL baseline in only 200 epochs, translating to a 9.8x reduction in TFLOPs. This is a highly practical and valuable contribution. \n 2. Novel and Effective Inference Acceleration (PDG): The proposed Path-Drop Guidance (PDG) is an excellent finding. It cleverly repurposes the SPRINT architecture to create an efficient alternative to CFG, using the shallow path as a \"\"weaker network\"\". This method nearly halves inference FLOPs while also improving generation quality, as shown in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 10, and Figure 7. \n 3. Simplicity and Generality: The SPRINT framework is conceptually simple and not tied to a specific architecture. The authors demonstrate its broad applicability by successfully integrating it with SiT, U-ViT, and the alignment-based REPA, showing consistent and significant improvements in all cases. \n 4. Strong Empirical Validation: The paper is supported by extensive experiments and insightful ablations. The validation of the sparse-dense design (Table 4), the structured sampling strategy (Table 5), and the optimal layer allocations (Tables 6, 8) builds strong confidence in the method's design. The analysis of feature specialization (Fig. 4) provides good intuition for why the method works."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited Ablation on Fine-tuning Stage: The paper adopts a fixed two-stage schedule: long sparse pre-training followed by a 100K-iteration full-token fine-tuning stage. While effective, the sensitivity to the duration of this fine-tuning is not analyzed. It is unclear how much fine-tuning is necessary to close the train-inference gap or if more fine-tuning would yield further gains. An ablation on this hyperparameter would strengthen the paper. \n 2. Conceptual Justification for PDG: The paper empirically shows that PDG works well by using the shallow path fθ as the unconditional estimate, inspired by Auto Guidance. This is effective, but a deeper conceptual analysis of why fθ is a suitable unconditional predictor would be beneficial. Does the SPRINT training force fθ to learn an \"\"average\"\" or \"\"blurry\"\" representation that mimics a true unconditional pass? A brief discussion would be insightful."}, "questions": {"value": "1.The performance of PDG is excellent. Does the SPRINT training enable PDG? In other words, could PDG (i.e., using only the first few layers fθ for the unconditional pass) be applied as an inference-time optimization to a standard, densely trained SiT model, or is the sparse-dense training process necessary for fθ to become an effective unconditional predictor?\n2.
