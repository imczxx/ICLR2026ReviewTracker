The paper defines a new and concrete research direction—graded image detoxification—that goes beyond existing binary filtering or red-teaming settings. The notion of progressively reducing toxicity while maintaining semantic coherence is both practically and conceptually valuable.\n\n2. The SPADE dataset is carefully constructed and well-documented. The integration of captions, contextual stories, and multiple detoxified variants per image demonstrates attention to detail and awareness of real-world moderation needs.\n\n3. The proposed sequential fine-tuning of ControlNet is well-motivated and systematically described. The design choice of conditioning on both the toxic image and story context provides a clear, interpretable mechanism for controlled detoxification.\n\n4. The authors employ a wide range of quantitative and qualitative assessments—CLIP similarity, FID, KR/CP metrics, t-SNE analysis, and error taxonomy—which together give a convincing picture of model behavior.\n\n5.

The dataset and baseline generation rely heavily on proprietary models (GPT-4, DALL-E 3), making full reproduction difficult once APIs change or become restricted.\n\n2.

The sequential fine-tuning strategy is central to the paper, but no direct ablation isolates its contribution relative to single-stage fine-tuning or other conditioning mechanisms.\n\n4. Although the curation process is systematic, the dataset size (≈2.5 k toxic images) and domain diversity may be insufficient to claim broad generalization across harm types or cultural contexts.\n\n5.

Lack of methodological innovation. The proposed Sequential ControlNet appears to be an engineering-level combination rather than a genuine conceptual contribution. Although the paper claims to introduce a new baseline, its core idea merely involves stage-wise fine-tuning of ControlNet without introducing any new architecture, loss function, or training strategy. Moreover, the comparative experiments fail to include strong and reasonable baselines (as mentioned in Appendix A).\n\n2. Dataset construction heavily depends on black-box APIs. All 7,500 detoxified images are automatically generated by DALL·E 3, yet the paper provides no clear description of prompt control or generation details (Appendix C only shows vague examples without a reproducible batch-generation protocol). The corresponding captions and stories are generated by GPT-4, but the authors do not disclose the temperature, top-p, or system prompt settings, nor do they assess whether GPT-4’s own toxicity or bias may have leaked into the dataset.\n\n3. Toxicity quantification is vague and unreliable. The paper reports toxicity scores (Toxic = 79.7, V1 = 73.4, V2 = 54.6, V3 = 35.8) but only provides a footnote stating: “Calculated using a CLIP classifier fine-tuned on the dataset from Hendrycks et al., 2021.” However, Hendrycks et al. (2021) is a value-learning text dataset without image-level toxicity annotations, raising concerns about the validity of these toxicity metrics.\n\n4. Core claim of “graded detoxification” lacks controllability verification. Although the paper emphasizes that the detoxification process is graded and controllable, it does not verify whether users can interpolate between toxicity levels. Furthermore, Table 2 shows that caption cosine similarity drops from 1.00 (R) to 0.60 (V3), yet no semantic analysis is provided to explain what content is lost. In reality, V1/V2/V3 represent discrete snapshots rather than a continuous, controllable space, making the approach unsuitable for real-world moderation scenarios that require dynamically adjustable safety grades (as claimed in the Abstract).\n\n5. Ethical risks are understated, overlooking cultural sensitivity and power asymmetry.\n(1) The paper implicitly assumes “detoxification = positive,” without discussing who defines toxicity. For example, the keyword list (Appendix B.1) includes phrases such as “Fat-shamed girl” and “Obese person,” which reflect a body-shaming perspective and treat “fatness” itself as toxic.\n(2) In Table 7, the prompt “A student being bullied” is detoxified into “accidentally bumped into a locker,” which trivializes actual violence and risks secondary harm."}, "questions": {"value": "None."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "LpSPvxRuA9", "forum": "z4PeAwPNon", "replyto": "z4PeAwPNon", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission244/Reviewer_GqTk"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission244/Reviewer_GqTk"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission244/-/Official_Review"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762917821939, "cdate": 1762917821939, "tmdate": 1762917821939, "mdate": 1762917821939, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
