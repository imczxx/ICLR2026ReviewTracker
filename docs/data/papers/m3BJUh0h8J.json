Although deriving a variance-based bound is interesting, the resulting formulation does not provide any new fundamental insights into generalization. In fact, it is well established in the literature that stability (and algorithmic stability) implies better generalization (see all works on algorithmic stabiity, e.g., Section 4.3 of [1]). While the authors redefine stability in terms of variance rather than sensitivity to the removal of one training sample (β-stability as in algorithmic stability), the two notions are equivalent as can be shown through the Efron–Stein inequality. Consequently, the proposed framework does not provide any new theoretical insights, it essentially reinterprets existing stability-based results in a different mathematical form (with a novel yet simple proof trick).\n\n- **Incomplete coverage of related work:**  The authors fail to mention and discuss several related works that derive information-theoretic generalization bounds (e.g., [1–5]). In particular, [1] and [5] also provide stability-based analyses closely related to the one proposed here. [1-5] are only examples here. In fact, the literature in this area is now quite rich, and omitting prior works prevents readers from understanding how the current approach differs or improves upon prior efforts. I recommend that the authors expand the related work section to include and properly discuss all relevant recent studies.\n\n- **Weak empirical validation:** The experimental results are confined to a Bayesian linear regression task and a few toy classification setups, which provide only preliminary evidence for the proposed framework. However, these tasks are simplistic and low-dimensional. There is no demonstration on real-world or deep learning scenarios, where the tightness or practical relevance of such bounds would matter most. Furthermore, comparing  only against two classical information-theoretic baselines (MI bound of Xu & Raginsky (2017) and CMI bound of Steinke & Zakynthinou (2020)) is insufficient. These are indeed foundational bounds, but the comparison omits more recent and stronger bounds, such as those from [1–5], which employ sample-wise or conditional decompositions and often achieve much tighter estimates in practice. Without benchmarking against these more contemporary methods, it is difficult to assess the true empirical or theoretical advantages of the proposed approach.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Harutyunyan, Hrayr, et al. \"Information-theoretic generalization bounds for black-box learning algorithms.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 24670-24682. \\\n[2] Hellström, Fredrik, and Giuseppe Durisi. \"A new family of generalization bounds using samplewise evaluated CMI.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): \\\n[3] Dong, Yuxin, et al. \"Towards generalization beyond pointwise learning: A unified information-theoretic perspective.\" Forty-first International Conference on Machine Learning. 2024. \\\n[4] Wang, Ziqiao, and Yongyi Mao. \"Generalization bounds via conditional $ f $-information.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 37 (2024): 52159-52188. \\\n[5] Wang, Ziqiao, and Yongyi Mao. \"Sample-conditioned hypothesis stability sharpens information-theoretic generalization bounds.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2023): 49513-49541."}, "questions": {"value": "See section above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "a0rDULIYpX", "forum": "m3BJUh0h8J", "replyto": "m3BJUh0h8J", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24118/Reviewer_t6Vc"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24118/Reviewer_t6Vc"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24118/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761823412960, "cdate": 1761823412960, "tmdate": 1762942943459, "mdate": 1762942943459, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a new distribution- and algorithm-dependent complexity measure and uses it to derive several generalization bounds.

This is a valuable contribution, particularly the novel variance-based bound derived at $\\alpha=2$. I am curious how your stability measure (in the $\\alpha=2$) relates to a different, recently proposed variance-based condition for learnability. This recent work (Proposition 5.2 in the 2024 paper by Gastpar et al.) has shown that an algorithm is “$l_2$-estimable” (meaning that there exists a tight bound (in terms of L2 error for its population risk) if and only if the conditional variance of its *population loss*, given the sample, is small (i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[var(L_{\\mathcal{D}}(A(S))|S)] \\le \\epsilon$). Your measure focuses on the variance of the algorithm's output probability over different samples $S$, while this other work focuses on the variance of the *outcome* (the true loss) over different distributions $\\mathcal{D}$ that could have generated $S$. Could you comment on the relationship, if any, between these two distinct but related variance-based notions of stability? I believe that situating your work in relation to this alternative perspective on variance could further strengthen your paper's contribution.\n- What is the missing reference in l. 881?\n\n\n\n========================================================================\n\nReferences:\n\nGastpar, M., Nachum, I., Shafer, J., & Weinberger, T..
