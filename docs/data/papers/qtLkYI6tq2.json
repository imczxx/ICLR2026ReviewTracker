However, current vision-based solutions are limited by the inherent constraints of optical sensors, while radio-frequency (RF) approaches, which can reveal intrinsic material properties, have received growing attention. Despite this progress, RF-based material identification remains hindered by the lack of large-scale public datasets and the limited benchmarking of learning-based approaches. In this work, we present RF-MatID, the first open-source, large-scale, wide-band, and perturbation-aware RF dataset for fine-grained material identification. RF-MatID includes 16 fine-grained categories grouped into 5 superclasses, spanning a broad frequency range from 4 to 43.5 GHz, and comprises 142k samples in both frequency- and time-domain representations. The dataset systematically incorporates real-world perturbations, including variations in incidence angle and stand-off distance. We further establish a multi-setting, multi-protocol benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models, assessing both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness under cross-angle and cross-distance shifts. The 5 frequency-allocation protocols enable systematic frequency- and region-level analysis, thereby facilitating real-world deployment. RF-MatID aims to enable reproducible research, accelerate algorithmic advancement, foster cross-domain robustness, and support the development of real-world application in RF-based material identification.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Material identification", "Radio frequency (RF) sensing", "Dataset", "Benchmarking"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3446120724d457c4c51ff28361ed5a1dd9269353.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ffe6dba27e95c1c7469f3d75fa30d59120514f7e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce a new RF-sensing based benchmark called RF-MatID for material identification. This benchmark is large in its scale across the frequency range from 4 to 43.5 GHz and the number of samples in the time/frequency domains. \nThe dataset contains 5 superclasses (brick, glass, synthetic materials, woods, and stones) and 16 fine-grained material categories for different variants of the superclasses. Each sample is collected at varying distances (200–2000 mm) and incidence angles (0–10°) to simulate real-world perturbations. The authors benchmark nine models popular in vision, language, and time-series domains across multiple settings, protocols, and divisions. The results have high in-domain accuracy around 99% and analyze robustness to cross-angle and cross-distance shifts.

This limitation substantially weakens the claimed motivation of supporting “autonomous systems” and confines the dataset’s applicability to laboratory-scale studies.\n- The introduced perturbations are restricted to geometric variations (distance and angle) within a highly controlled indoor environment. The absence of electromagnetic interference, multipath reflections, or environmental factors (e.g., humidity, surface roughness variability) prevents the dataset from reflecting realistic RF conditions. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, the overall contribution remains narrower than claimed.\n- The inclusion of both frequency- and time-domain data provides limited additional value, as the time-domain samples are directly computed via inverse FFT. This dual-domain representation described in the paper does not really introduce new empirical diversity but rather duplicates information that practitioners could easily derive themselves. The dataset nominally contains 142k samples; however, only 71k represent unique physical measurements. But the dual-domain counting somewhat inflates the dataset’s reported scale, and it is therefore concerning whether the reported dataset size is artificially inflated by redundancy and the contribution is overclaiming.\n- The benchmark focuses solely on material classification. The benchmark, therefore, provides limited insight into the broader applicability of RF sensing for real-world material-based applications.\n- Most of the models evaluated are vision, language, and time-series based. The baseline encodes some frequency information. However, there are many works on RF-sensing models, but they are not evaluated.\n- From Figure 2, many material samples appear visually and structurally similar, suggesting a high intra-class correlation. The dataset lacks evidence of variability in properties such as texture, thickness, or surface roughness, making it unclear whether the reported generalization extends to real-world materials beyond those collected in the lab.\n- **Minor:**\n    - The use of the term “mod” for both *modality* and *mode* is confusing and should be clarified in the benchmark descriptions to avoid misinterpretation."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see my weakness for most of the concerns. Some questions for authors to discuss are:\n- Can the authors justify the dataset’s relevance to long-range sensing tasks such as autonomous driving or outdoor perception given that the sensing range is very close-distance\n- Since the frequency-domain data can be easily transformed into the time-domain via FFT, what new information does the time-domain dataset provide that cannot be derived from the frequency data?\n- Are the perturbations (distance and angle) annotated per sample, and are these metadata available in the dataset? Are there more textual annotations that we could use to give LLM the capabilities to describe the material?\n- The paper reports high accuracy (>99%) across models, could this indicate potential overfitting due to low intra-class diversity or lack of environmental variability? And given the already high performance on the proposed benchmark, is the task sufficiently challenging to drive future methodological improvement?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "VJRr0kMee5", "forum": "qtLkYI6tq2", "replyto": "qtLkYI6tq2", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9536/Reviewer_QnNM"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9536/Reviewer_QnNM"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9536/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761526129103, "cdate": 1761526129103, "tmdate": 1762921100370, "mdate": 1762921100370, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a large-scale dataset and benchmark (RF-MatID) for radio-frequency–based material identification.\nThe dataset spans 16 material types across 5 superclasses.\nIt includes realistic perturbations such as varying angles and distances to test robustness.\nThe authors further establish multiple benchmark protocols to evaluate state-of-the-art models under both standard and distribution-shift conditions.\nThe work aims to standardize evaluation and accelerate progress in RF-based material recognition for real-world applications."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- This work addresses a current gap in RF-based material sensing by providing a new dataset and benchmark focused on material identification.\n- The dataset is relatively large, covers a wide frequency range, and incorporates variations in acquisition conditions.\n- The dataset includes of both time- and frequency-domain representations, along with several evaluation protocols targeting both in-distribution performance and robustness to angle and distance shifts.\n- The authors also benchmark several state-of-the-art deep learning models across these protocols, establishing initial baselines for comparison and facilitating future reproducible work in this area."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- More discussion on the dataset's limitations, potential biases, and cost or practicality of data collection would help contextualize the scope and applicability of the benchmark.\n- While the dataset is extensive, the paper would benefit from further clarification on the real-world representativeness of the collection setup and whether the acquisition hardware and environments generalize beyond the authors' configuration.\n- The evaluation focuses primarily on standard deep learning baselines, and it is unclear how classical RF signal-processing methods or hybrid approaches would perform under the same protocols.\n- Although perturbations in angle and distance are included, other sources of real-world variability are not explored in depth."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5pI9Ev0ECw", "forum": "qtLkYI6tq2", "replyto": "qtLkYI6tq2", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9536/Reviewer_FgEZ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9536/Reviewer_FgEZ"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9536/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761926204672, "cdate": 1761926204672, "tmdate": 1762921099663, "mdate": 1762921099663, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Focusing on material identification, this work indicates that there lacks a large-scale datasets with real materials labeled by frequency signals.
