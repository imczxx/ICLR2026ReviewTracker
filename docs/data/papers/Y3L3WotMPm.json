This makes them unreliable in dynamic settings where stability and consistency are critical. To better evaluate these properties, we emphasize two indicators: task success rate as a measure of overall effectiveness, and consistency metrics such as Pass$^k$ to capture reliability across multiple trials. To address the limitations of existing approaches, we propose MemOrb, a lightweight and plug-and-play verbal reinforcement memory layer that distills multi-turn interactions into compact strategy reflections. These reflections are stored in a shared memory bank and retrieved to guide decision-making, without requiring any fine-tuning. Experiments show that MemOrb significantly improves both success rate and stability, achieving up to a 63 percentage-point gain in multi-turn success rate and delivering more consistent performance across repeated trials. Our results demonstrate that structured reflection is a powerful mechanism for enhancing long-term reliability of frozen LLM agents in customer service scenarios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["MemOrb", "Reflection", "Self-migration", "Suitable for e-commerce evaluation benchmarks", "Continuously improving SR"], "primary_area": "infrastructure, software libraries, hardware, systems, etc.", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b8d46d5d5f2a228d49e2737a60386475f6c7d1c1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a system for \"policy-reflection distillation\" for customer service.

They have core memory which is the summarization and extracted infomation, they also use `SQLite` or `PostGreSQL` as the storage, while the paper only says \"Key-Value\" in the column Storage. Also in MemGPT they do have the ability to rewrite the memory. In their codebase there is a function called `core_memory_replace` and `core_memory_rewrite`. If your \"ReWrite\" is talking about rewriting the query, then the table is even more incorrect. MemGPT has agentic search which definitely has the ability to rewrite the query. \n\n2. **Limited Novelty:** Basically the paper is proposing that we can (1) save the raw trajectories; (2) do some self-reflection after each trajectory; (3) retrieve relevant trajectories. The novelty and design remains trivial and sounds like a simple pipeline every company would easily think of during the applications. In the experiments, there are only 130 tasks in total which makes the evaluation results highly unstable and unconvincing. \n\n3. **Limited Evaluation Datasets:** If the method is simple I would expect this method to have much more powerful performance across various tasks such as Long-Horizon Agent Tasks like TAC[1], Mind2Web[2], SWE-Bench-Pro[3], etc, instead of only showing the performance on a not-so-popular Ecom-bench. This is a research paper, not a technical report in the Industry. \n\n4. **Limited Baselines:** This paper compared with **zero** memory-related baselines. Even though they mentioned in the introduction about the limitations of existing memory-augmented methods, the limitations of long-context methods, they compared with none of them in the experiments. \n\n5. **Missing Citations**: Many recent papers about agent memory systems are not cited [4,5,6,7,8,9] (there should be much more than these such as Agent Workflow Memory, Mem-p, ...). Also in Line 152, this paper mentioned that \"MemOrb offers a lightweight, plug-and-play solution that improves the performance of LLM-based agents without the need for frequent model updates or **large-scale retraining,**\" However they did not mention any related works about the memory methods that require \"large-scale retraining\" (some representative works are MemoryLLM[10], M+[11]).
