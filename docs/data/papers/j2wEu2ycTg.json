Accordingly, the convergence proof of PLMC is devided into two parts: convergence analysis of LMC and **trajectory-gap quantification between LMC and PLMC**.  The main theoretical novelty lies in the latter, where the authors construct a refined coupling between the Brownian motions driving the two dynamics, enabling a tight control of their deviation. Combining this with existing convergence results for overdamped LMC ([1]) and underdamped LMC ([2]), sharper bounds in terms of the accuracy dependency are proved: $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2/3})$ for overdamped PLMC and $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1/3})$ for underdamped PLMC.  \n\n[1] Alain Durmus, Szymon Majewski, and Bła˙ zej Miasojedow.
