We tackle this challenge with the ACTS (Adaptive Control for Test-time Scaling) framework, which leverages a novel ``termination signal'', the rich probabilities a model assigns to control tokens like End-of-Sequence. By framing generation as an optimal stopping problem, ACTS uses this signal to dynamically decide when to terminate. Experiments demonstrate that our policies significantly outperform baselines, reducing token usage on conversational tasks by 35\\% while boosting mathematical reasoning accuracy by 13.3\\% on AIME and 9.8\\% on Math 500 through more efficient thinking, which is achieved simply by changing the token-sampling process. ACTS thus enables a new class of signal-driven, principled control over LLM generation, paving the way for more efficient and adaptable model inference.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Inference Time Scaling", "Efficient Inference", "Decoding Strategies"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9752308e7f9ac919d3638b8af6e75aade8ab13cd.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Adaptive Control Token Sampling (ACTS), a framework that dynamically regulates the reasoning length of LLMs at test time using the sub-argmax probabilities of control tokens (e.g., EOS, EOT).

Experiments do show their effectiveness over benchmarks where these phenomena are observed."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. I must put into question the contribution of the paper, as it appears to me overclaimed. The main idea is three-fold: when underthinking is a problem, make the model think longer by saying \"wait\"; when overthinking is a problem, cut the model short once it has had several opportunities to end its thinking; self-critique, which is a rather self-contained method. The rest of the paper deals with engineering these approaches. However, there is a lack of central theme around these methods. It feels as if the authors tried these methods out, saw some performance improvements, and attempted to put them under the same framework, while they really should be treated as separate engineering tricks and studied individually. The most interesting method by far is the self-critique framework, with an intuitive explanation of effecient tree search for LLM problem solving, but it is only studied superficially through performance gains, without any attempts and theoretical analysis or a closer look into its mechanisms. \n\n2. The mitigation of underthinking and overthinking are restricted to reasoning and instruction following tasks, respectively. This is a problem here because the methods appear to target these two problems separately and only within their respective applications, putting into question the generalizability of the proposed methods. \n\n3. The general presentation of the method was not intuitive to me. I think the paper tried to go from a general framework to a more specific implementation, where Section 3 establishes the ACTS framework, and Section 4 specfies it into proposed methods. This overcomplicated the narrative because Section 3 taken out of context is rather confusing, for example \"forcing the emission of the appropriate control token\" is too general on Line 151. \n\n4. Section 4 has numerous writing problems that also overcomplicates things. First, the titled paragraphs are not individual policies, but a progression of different scattered ideas. Among the actual methods used in Section 6.2 / 6.3, Accumulated / Last-interval / N-Spike, only one is explained in the main text. Next, many concepts are mentioned but not discussed adequately, such as $N_{patience}$ mentioned without definition on Line 178 (minor issue), the unspecified directive for critic self-evalution through Lines 185-192, an unfinished sentence on Line 203 (also I would caution comparing LLM thinking procedure to humans unless it's highly relevant), unspecified \"opportune\" moment on Line 205, etc. Algorithm 1 is also not really needed in main text as a straightforward textual explanation makes it clear enough for me."}, "questions": {"value": "Q1. Most importantly, I think the narrative of the paper needs to be revised. Targeting my weakness 1 and 2, can you clarify what main methods are used in the paper and how they fall under the same framework? Just to be clear I'm not asking for a simple restatement of contributions, but a more structured discussion of the methods' relations, synergies, etc. \n\nQ2. Can you also clarify what the requirements are before applying your methods? Specifically, beyond the tested benchmarks, do we need to know if the model is underthinking or overthinking as a priori, and what other metrics need to be assessed if any? \n\nQ3. For Section 6.1, are all the plots obtained with a single prompt? For Figure 2, did you do a cutoff at 0.0001, if so why did you choose this cutoff and what's the largest observed value, and if not why does the probability reach this value and not beyond so frequently? For Figure 3, can you explain why the spikes become much sparser after a while? Did the model rollout collapse in a way so as to never stop thinking? \n\nQ4. What are \"Accumulated\" and \"Last-Interval\" methods in Figures 5 and 6? May be related to Q1. \n\nQ5. For Figure 6, since we're dealing with underthinking, I assume everytime the model terminates prematurely, a \"Wait\" token is appended to keep it thinking. In this context what does N-spike refer to? Why is there a distinction between different amount of \"Wait\" tokens? Or is it \"whichever comes first\"? \n\nQ6. For Section 7, the main table sees accuracy increase over baseline as well as token count increase. In fact, the Avg. Token Count column is marked wrongly in terms of best performance. Shouldn't this be an application of mitigating underthinking instead of overthinking, so both accuracy and token count increases over baseline?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "TA4eAa1r2T", "forum": "GXbTHRBSA4", "replyto": "GXbTHRBSA4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11345/Reviewer_emb8"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11345/Reviewer_emb8"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11345/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761989245848, "cdate": 1761989245848, "tmdate": 1762922479618, "mdate": 1762922479618, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Current language models often operate in \"thinking\" mode, allocating a fixed budget to reasoning.
