Creators, in turn, adapt their content to align with users’ preferences and enhance their popularity. At the same time, users’ preferences evolve under the influence of both suggested content from the recommender system and content shared within their social circles. This feedback loop generates a complex interplay between users, creators, and recommender algorithms, which is the key cause of filter bubbles and opinion polarization. We develop a social network-aware recommender system that explicitly accounts for this users-creators feedback interaction and strategically exploits the topology of the user's own social network to promote diversification. Our approach highlights how accounting and exploiting user's social network in the recommender system design is crucial to mediate filter bubbles effects while balancing content diversity with personalization. Provably,  opinion clustering is positively correlated with the influence of recommended content on user opinions.  Ultimately, the proposed approach shows the power of socially-aware recommender systems in combating opinion polarization and clusterization phenomena.", "tldr": "recommender system design aware about the dynamical feedback interaction between users and creators to mitigate opinion polarization", "keywords": ["opinion dynamics", "recommender systems", "model predictive control", "dynamical systems", "networked systems"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9de02ffb116e5af671045fa6cc385a6381f35522.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a model to analyze the opinions of users and content creators in a social network, where their interactions are mediated by a recommender system.

As one example, at the end of the introduction, the following sentence is particularly difficult for me to understand: “We argue that, being opinion polarization a collective phenomenon, in order for the RS to mitigate such undesired effect, enhancing content diversification is not enough without taking the social network into account.”\n\nThe network size considered (N = 600 users) is fairly small, and the initial topology is randomly generated.

In the experiments, the paper shows that a recommender system optimized for engagement increases clustering.\n\nFor a social media platform to adopt an alternative that reduces opinion clusterization, I would guess that one would have to demonstrate a recommender system with both high engagement and low clustering, which may be infeasible.

Theorem 1 claims that \"increasing the influence of A reduces the influence of B\". Here, A and B are matrices describing social and recommender effects, but the paper never defines what \"influence\" means in a quantitative sense.  Although the notation suggests that A and B affect users’ steady-state opinions, the authors do not provide a scalar metric (e.g., a norm, spectral quantity, or sensitivity measure) that maps these matrices to real-valued influences. As a result, the statement “increase of A decreases B” is ambiguous and cannot be rigorously evaluated. The theorem would benefit from a precise mathematical formulation of “influence” and clear assumptions under which this complementarity holds.\n\n(W2) **Key proofs didn't consider the steady-state of dynamics**.  The proofs of Lemma 1, Corollary 1, and Lemma 2 analyze user-creator interactions without explicitly accounting for the steady-state of the dynamic system.  Since both users and creators evolve under feedback loops and social influence (the Friedkin-Johnsen model), the asymptotic behavior (i.e., equilibrium or stability conditions) is critical to determining long-term clusterization outcomes. However, the proofs in Appendix E appear to rely on instantaneous or static relationships rather than steady-state analysis of the full dynamics.  Without establishing convergence properties or equilibrium characterizations, these results may not generalize to the long-run behavior claimed in the paper.\n\n\n\nAnother concern: \n\n(W3) The proposed \"socially-aware recommender\" recommends contents that are close to the average of the neighbors of a user.
