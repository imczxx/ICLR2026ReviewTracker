While watermark removal attacks have been extensively studied, the threat of watermark forgery, where benign images are maliciously modified to appear watermarked, remains underexplored, especially in the no-box setting. In this work, we introduce WForge, a no-box and query-free forgery attack that reframes forgery as the inverse of removal. Our key insight is that residual perturbations from removal attacks approximate watermark signals and can be repurposed to forge watermarks. Concretely, we train a forger network to learn the pattern of residuals and apply it to unwatermarked images, making them falsely detected as watermarked. We evaluate WForge across three datasets and four state-of-the-art watermarking methods, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms existing forgery baselines. Our results further reveal a critical vulnerability: the existence of a successful removal attack implies the feasibility of forgery for the same watermarking method.", "tldr": "In this work, we introduce WForge, a no-box, query-free forgery attack on image watermarks.", "keywords": ["Image Watermark", "Watermark Forgery", "Watermark Removal", "Imge Generative Model"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5ba3e749df869a75c32bac17fbddc64a3d4dddbf.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes WForge, a no-box, query-free image watermark forgery method that conceptualizes forgery as the inverse of watermark removal.

Some watermarking techniques used to be forged are outdated, particularly the content-dependent methods, which were developed 5 years ago (e.g., StegaStamp (CVPR 2020) and RivaGAN (arXiv 2019)). It remains uncertain whether the proposed method can effectively counter modern post-processing content-dependent watermarks, such as TrustMark (ICCV 2025) and VINE (ICLR 2025). To ensure a more comprehensive evaluation, experiments involving at least VINE should be included in the experiences. (p.s., I totally understand this may be a lot to run, but some small but convincing experiments would really help. I will consider significantly raising the score if more supportive data about the latest effectiveness can be provided.\n\n2. Potential Concerns about Removal Methods: Since the forger is trained on residuals from a specific remover, its generalization to unseen watermarking-removal pairs may be overstated (e.g., weakness 1 supplementary experiment fails). Besides, the proposed method relies significantly on the availability of effective watermark removal attacks (e.g., VAE-based removers) to generate training residuals. However, if removal is weak or unavailable for certain watermarks, WForge's performance could degrade significantly. \n\n3.
