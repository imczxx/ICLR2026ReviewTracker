Existing methods typically employ either iterative best-response updates, which converge only to Nash Equilibria (NE) that may be far from the global optimum, or simultaneous learning with centralized critics, which lack convergence guarantees to the optimal joint policy without strong assumptions on \ndecomposable value functions.\nWe introduce the Agent-Chained Belief MDP (AC-BMDP), which reformulates MARL as a serialized decision process where agents act sequentially while maintaining beliefs over actions taken by preceding agents. This enables the definition of agent-specific value functions that are naturally chained together. Building on this framework, we propose Agent-Chained Policy Iteration (ACPI) and prove that it converges to the globally optimal joint policy.\nWe further develop this framework into a practical actor–critic algorithm, Agent-Chained Policy Optimization (ACPO). On standard benchmarks, ACPO consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, with the performance advantage growing significantly as the number of agents increases.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "Centralized Training Decentralized Execution"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/538d9e8f01b6c4cf4c9309b70a5e9cd487e95d59.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This works introduces a paradigm for centralised training of actor critic algorithms in multi-agent settings which allows agent-specific value functions to incorporate beliefs over the actions taken by other agents.

The authors must be transparent about whether this choice was due to implementation difficulties or a lack of performance generalisation.\n2. Limited baselines - the authors compare to MAPPO (general MARL AC), HAPPO and HATRPO (BR MARL AC) and QMIX in smacv2. Why were value based methods and more actor critic methods not compared against in these benchmarks? There are existing implementations of VDN, MADDPG, COMIX, and other standard MARL algorithms for the benchmarks provided - if no relevant BR baselines are available, it is at least necessary to understand how ACPO with PPO compares to common MARL baselines. 3. The computational comparison in Figure 5 might be a little unfair, as the BR methods dominate the plot - it is hard to notice that for the 12-hard scenario, ACPO takes seemingly 3-4 times as much as MAPPO to solve the task, despite not reaching a similar multiplier in performance. \n4.
