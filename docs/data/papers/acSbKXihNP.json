However, we find that state-of-the-art models struggle to predict even a simple long-period sine wave, despite ample training data. One reason is that existing benchmarks underrepresent the non-stationary characteristics prevalent in real-world time series, leading to misleading evaluations. Moreover, standard stationarization methods inherently introduce substantial information loss during the stationarization process. To investigate this, we introduce \\textit{controlled} datasets that expose information loss incurred by standard z-normalization-based stationarization methods, widely used in TSF models. To address this limitation, we propose Hipeen, a hierarchical periodic stationarization method that achieves stationarization through representing the value into multiple periodic components, minimizing information loss. Hipeen, with a linear backbone, successfully forecasts highly non-stationary signals—controlled datasets and large-scale stock datasets—substantially outperforming current SOTA models (6 stationarization methods and 8 baselines), while maintaining strong performance on conventional benchmarks. Our results highlight the importance of preserving critical information during stationarization and provide a new approach for robust TSF in non-stationary environments. All code and models will be released in the final version.", "tldr": "Demonstrating that time series forecasting models employing normalization-based stationarization (ReVIN) face fundamental limitations on non-stationary data, a novel stationarization method is proposed to overcome them.", "keywords": ["Time series", "Stationarization", "Non-stationarity", "Forecasting", "Long-range dependency"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/61be2a81707c805cc8e9ba217b9abca12fee8b76.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper indicates that many state-of-the-art forecasting models still fail to predict even a simple long-period sine wave, largely because existing datasets underrepresent the non-stationary characteristics commonly found in real-world time series—leading to misleading forecasting.

This argument requires further justification. For example, methods like RevIN restore both the mean and standard deviation after normalization, which effectively recover much of the original information. The paper should clarify in what specific sense such information is “discarded” and why Hippen preserves it better.\n\n  - The mechanism by which the proposed transformation retains gradients and absolute values, and how this process alleviates the impact of non-stationarity, needs a clearer intuitive explanation. Currently, the experimental evidence is convincing, but the theoretical or conceptual reasoning behind the improvement is underdeveloped.\n\n  - What does the hierarchical periodicity metioned in line 255 refer to? And why the cosine distance loss function help to account for it?\n\n- It is recommended to include more investigation experiments:\n  - In Appendix C.2.2, the ensemble mechanism with $E=16$ is mentioned. It would be informative to analyze the effect of different ensemble sizes $E$ on performance, to assess the robustness and scalability of the approach.\n\n  - It would also be valuable to investigate whether Hippen can serve as a model-agnostic plugin, similar to RevIN, that can enhance the performance of various backbone forecasting models."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the weaknesses part."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "lyR6k8XrbB", "forum": "acSbKXihNP", "replyto": "acSbKXihNP", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19908/Reviewer_fNqm"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19908/Reviewer_fNqm"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19908/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761809362763, "cdate": 1761809362763, "tmdate": 1762932066348, "mdate": 1762932066348, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper points out that current time series forecasting models struggle to predict even simple periodic functions such as sine waves.
