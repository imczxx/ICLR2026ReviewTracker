The exponential growth of scientific publications, datasets, and multimodal resources makes manual enrichment highly impractical, creating the need for automated or semi-automated approaches. In this work, we propose a framework that leverages multimodal large language models and retrieval-augmented generation to support ontology enrichment. Our method systematically extracts semantic knowledge units, aligns them with existing ontological structures, and generates interlinked triples, thereby enhancing both the coverage and the expressivity of the ontology. This framework addresses the knowledge acquisition bottleneck by enabling scalable integration of heterogeneous resources and fostering cross-domain semantic interoperability. To illustrate its effectiveness, we apply the framework to the domain of 4D printing, a rapidly evolving field at the intersection of materials science, manufacturing, and design. By incorporating knowledge about materials, properties, stimuli interactions, process parameters, and design strategies, the framework enriches a domain-specific ontology and supports innovation in the development of programmable and multifunctional structures.", "tldr": "Scalable Ontology Enrichment via Multimodal Large Language Models and Symbolic Reasoning Integrating Scientific Articles, Datasets, and Knowledge Graphs", "keywords": ["Ontology enrichment", "Multimodal large language model", "Retrieval-augmented generation", "Knowledge graph", "4D printing"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/80f8c56e81db622709c1ab6dfa6259fdc9debb3d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper employs LLM and RAG to populate an ontology from a given set of keywords describing a domain, 4D prinitng in this case."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "S1.

The paper evaluates the proposed framework in isolation without comparing against existing ontology learning methods. The paper cites Phrase2Onto, OntoGPT, and other LLM-based ontology extension approaches but provides no quantitative comparison. Without baselines, it is impossible to assess whether the performance (Graph BERTScore F1 = 0.7) represents an improvement over simpler alternatives or state-of-the-art methods.\n2. The proposed framework consists of multiple components RAG retrieval, LLaVA fine-tuning, multimodal fusion, and multi-stage validation. However, the paper provides no ablation study showing the contribution of each component. The appendix only compares \"fine-tuning alone\" versus \"fine-tuning + one-shot,\" which doesn't isolate the contributions of RAG, multimodal inputs, or individual validation criteria.\n3. The paper claims the framework is \"fully domain-agnostic\", yet validation is performed exclusively on 4D printing. This contradicts the generalization claim and is insufficient to demonstrate transferability. \n4. The paper relies on a single metric (Graph BERTScore F1 = 0.7) mentioned briefly in the main text with details relegated to the appendix. This is insufficient for validating the core contribution.\n5. Essential technical details are missing: the size of the fine-tuning dataset for LLaVA, threshold values for domain relevance, semantic coherence, and similarity-based filtering, and computational requirements for the system.\n6. All figures are labeled \"adapted from (Bougzime et al., 2025b)\", a paper that is also under review.

The paper claims value from retrieval, images and fine-tuning, but does not quantify each component’s marginal contribution.\n4. Domain generality is asserted but not shown. Results are limited to one domain. \n5. Reported scale for instances and classes lacks quality controls. No sampling audits, curator checks or constraint violation summaries are provided, so growth may include duplicates or noise.\n6. The role of images is not sufficiently analyzed.

No released code, prompts, model checkpoints or ontology dumps, and limited reporting on compute cost and runtime make it hard to verify claims or adopt the method.\n8.
