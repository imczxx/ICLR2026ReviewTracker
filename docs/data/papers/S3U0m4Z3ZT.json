We hypothesize this gap stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address. By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge about reasoning action–state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding, knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["GUI Knowledge Bench", "Computer use agent evaluaton"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7ec4e857e5e78c8e3a6ab173d5ed99fa12258520.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates why large vision–language models still struggle with automated GUI tasks despite recent advances. The authors hypothesize that missing core GUI knowledge in current VLMs is a key factor behind their performance gap compared to humans. To address this, the paper makes several notable contributions. First, it defines three dimensions of GUI knowledge based on common failure patterns: (1) interface perception, (2) interaction prediction, and (3) instruction understanding. Using these categories, the authors introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a comprehensive benchmark composed of multiple-choice and yes/no questions derived from over 40,000 GUI screenshots and 400 execution traces across six platforms and 292 applications. This benchmark systematically evaluates what GUI-relevant knowledge is encoded in VLMs prior to any fine-tuning on task-specific data. The paper’s experiments show that while current VLMs can often recognize basic widget functions, they struggle with perceiving system state, predicting interaction outcomes, and verifying task completion. Importantly, the authors demonstrate a close link between performance on the knowledge benchmark and real GUI task success: models with more encoded GUI knowledge perform better on actual GUI automation tasks, and providing missing knowledge (e.g. in the form of operation plans) significantly improves task execution success. Overall, the paper’s contributions include a novel benchmark dataset for GUI knowledge, an analysis revealing specific knowledge gaps in state-of-the-art VLMs, and empirical evidence that addressing these knowledge gaps can improve GUI task automation."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper tackles a crucial and timely problem in multimodal AI - why VLM-driven GUI agents often fail in real scenarios. The authors clearly motivate that beyond reasoning and planning, knowledge of GUI specifics is missing in current models.\n2. The introduction of a large-scale benchmark with 3483 knowledge-centric questions across 6 operating systems and 292 applications is a significant contribution.\n3. The paper’s breakdown of GUI knowledge into three dimensions – interface perception, interaction prediction, and instruction understanding – is well-grounded in observed failure modes and prior literature.\n4. The authors evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art models, including both closed-source and open-source models. The benchmarking results are detailed per knowledge category and sub-task, allowing for nuanced comparisons. This extensive comparison lends credibility to the findings.\n5. The results yield clear, actionable insights.\n6. A significant strength is the additional experiment bridging the benchmark to real task execution."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. While the paper states that the 3,483 questions were produced via automated generation plus manual annotation, it provides few details on this process. It’s not fully clear how questions and answers were generated or verified for correctness and difficulty.\n2. Focus on base VLMs without fine-tuning. The benchmark specifically tests models “prior to downstream training” – i.e., base VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning. This isolates inherent knowledge but also means models are out-of-the-box, not specialized for UI understanding.\n3. Evaluation of knowledge integration methods is limited. The paper’s solution implications mainly suggest selecting better base models or augmenting them with knowledge. While it demonstrates that adding operation plans helps one model, it stops short of exploring other ways to inject GUI knowledge (for instance, using the benchmark itself as additional training data or using retrieval during inference). A deeper discussion on concrete strategies (beyond the brief mention of retrieval augmentation) would have been useful to translate the findings into actionable guidance for building improved agents."}, "questions": {"value": "1. How were the 3483 knowledge questions constructed and validated? The paper mentions a mix of automated generation and manual annotation, but clarification is needed on the process. For example, did you use templates to generate questions from execution trajectories, and what steps ensured that the questions have unambiguous correct answers and appropriate difficulty?\n2. The OSWorld case study is great evidence of knowledge helping in one setting. Did you observe (or do you anticipate) a strong correlation between a model’s score on GUI Knowledge Bench and its success rate on various downstream GUI tasks (beyond OSWorld)? For example, if Model A scores 10% higher on the benchmark than Model B, is A consistently better when fine-tuned or evaluated on full task benchmarks?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "o1DsrLj3oT", "forum": "S3U0m4Z3ZT", "replyto": "S3U0m4Z3ZT", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15811/Reviewer_Qai1"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15811/Reviewer_Qai1"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15811/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761820286511, "cdate": 1761820286511, "tmdate": 1762926041854, "mdate": 1762926041854, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces GUI Knowledge Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates vision-language models (VLMs) on GUI-specific knowledge across three dimensions: interface perception, interaction prediction, and instruction understanding.

There is a contradiction in the paper's terminology. The authors claim to test 'base VLMs,' but the models listed are clearly instruction-tuned, optimized, and/or RLHF'd (e.g., 'GPT-5-Chat').
