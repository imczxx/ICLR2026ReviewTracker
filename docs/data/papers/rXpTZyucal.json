However, previous methods that extend reasoning with single-query search steps struggle to scale to complex tasks demanding broad document exploration. Meanwhile, approaches that generate multiple independent queries simultaneously may limit deeper, sequential reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose HybridDeepSearcher that dynamically integrates parallel and sequential search strategies to enable effective search scaling. To support training, we introduce HDS-QA, a novel dataset that seamlessly integrates broad parallel search with sequential search reasoning, providing answer trajectories in the form of reasoning-query-retrieval loops with parallel sub-queries. Across all five benchmarks, our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, improving F1 scores by +15.9 on FanOutQA and +11.5 on a subset of BrowseComp. Further analysis reveals that HybridDeepSearcher effectively scales performance with additional test-time search resources and demonstrates robustness on questions requiring more evidence, achieving higher evidence coverage. We include the code in the supplementary materials and will release the dataset and code publicly.", "tldr": "We propose HybridDeepSearcher, a scalable search agent that dynamically integrates parallel and sequential strategies,trained on HDS-QA,a novel hybrid-hop dataset with supervised trajectories.", "keywords": ["Multi-hop QA", "RAG", "Reasoning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a02e5aa5438040295ce9c85440540c74fdd36eff.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/611ff9e96a8cfcefdc6c99767ac263c513b1b191.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focuses on multi-turn search agents.

The paper collects trajectories using Qwen3-32B and fine-tunes Qwen3-8B via SFT. However, given that competitive baselines (Search-R1, RAG-R1) employ reinforcement learning for training, the absence of an RL-trained version limits understanding of the effectiveness of the method.\n2. **Computational Cost and Fairness Concerns**. The use of Qwen3-32B for document summarization adds significant computational overhead without clear justification. Why not use retrieval results directly? More critically, this creates an unfair comparison with RAG-R1, the strongest baseline, which operates without a summarization module. The added computational budget makes it difficult to isolate the true benefits of the proposed approach.\n3. **Dataset Construction Validity**. Based on the dataset generation process (Section 3.1) and the prompts in the appendix, the Qwen3-32B receives a bunch of extracted information and constructs the question in Step 3. Since there are no constraints, we can not determine if a generated question is really a parallel question. Furthermore, for hybrid questions structured as A|B->C (where A and B are parallel subquestions and C depends on their answers), the pipeline does not prevent information leakage. Agents may obtain sub-answers from a single branch without genuinely solving the parallel components. This raises concerns about whether the dataset truly improves parallel search capabilities or merely teaches pattern matching.\n4. **Incomplete Qualitative Analysis**. The qualitative case studies (Appendix) lack comparisons with RAG-R1, the most competitive multi-query baseline, making it difficult to assess the specific advantages of HybridDeepSearcher over existing parallel query methods."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **Formatting and Technical Errors**. The manuscript contains multiple formatting issues that affect readability: incorrect citation format at Line 048, improper vspace usage at Line 443, layout inconsistencies on Page 15, and reference errors in Appendix D.

Using \"+Qwen2.5-7b\" here is confusing.\n3. **Parallel Query Generation Patterns**. Could the authors clarify the parallel query generation behavior observed across different case studies? In Tables 4 and 10 (MuSiQue and FRAMES examples), the first search turn generates queries that appear to rephrase the original question with minor variations, while Table 7 (BrowseComp example) produces genuinely diverse parallel queries. Since these use the same model and prompts, what factors determine when the model generates reformulations versus diverse parallel queries? Understanding this would help assess whether the model has learned systematic parallel search strategies or if the behavior is primarily question-dependent."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "WnzrdoVFRG", "forum": "rXpTZyucal", "replyto": "rXpTZyucal", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15801/Reviewer_RKvi"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15801/Reviewer_RKvi"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15801/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761629219292, "cdate": 1761629219292, "tmdate": 1762926033260, "mdate": 1762926033260, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a dataset and a training method that teaches the model to perform parallel search in addition to the common sequential search.

Did the author benchmarked the variance and show what is the CI of this evaluation and how significant is the current gap between different models?\n3. Could the author compare their models with baselines that are trained on synthetic data designed for sequential search, such as WebExplorer-8B and ASearcher-8B to show the benefit of parallel search?\n4.

Could the author train the model for sequential search on the same training questions and ablate the effect?
