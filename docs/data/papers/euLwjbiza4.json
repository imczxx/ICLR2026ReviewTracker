We demonstrate that for such algorithms the computations relying on matrix inversion are iterations dependent, namely inversion of large matrices at the k-th iteration can be performed using $k\\times k$ matrix inversion or, for greater stability, by inverting only the lower part of a Cholesky decomposition. This improves the computational complexity of such algorithms.

I feel much of the space is wasted in prior work's exposition which limits the authors ability to include empirical results. Furthermore, there is only one empirical comparison. I think this is vastly insufficient. For a method that is claiming to achieve an empirical advantage, I feel this is insufficient. Other issues with writing like grammar, and incorrect links remain. \n\n- The inverse operation assumes that the matrix is low-rank. Now one can clearly study low-rankness and approximation error due to that e Woodbury identity. However this is never studied in this paper.

However this work presents only two plots in Figure 1 as only empirical comparison. It studies condition number and runtime of synthetic matrices vs the weight multiplier $c$, where $c = O(n^{2/3})$, the role of which is never really explained well. It would have been very helpful if clear discussion about variables were presented, or the methods were studied on real world scenarios. I understand that the compute power available to author is limited, but I also note that dual core i5 with 8GB of RAM can handle a wide variety of matrix inverses. \n\n- Given the plethora of randomized and deterministic matrix sparsifiers, one would imagine a comparison to those algorithms is required for a better exposition."}, "questions": {"value": "Please address the issues mentioned in the weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "kydPstxUjC", "forum": "euLwjbiza4", "replyto": "euLwjbiza4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21628/Reviewer_uyH5"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21628/Reviewer_uyH5"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21628/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761963822637, "cdate": 1761963822637, "tmdate": 1762941859696, "mdate": 1762941859696, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies the problem of improving computational complexity of a widely used spectral sparsification algorithm [BSS09].
