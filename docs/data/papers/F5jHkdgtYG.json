Stability analysis for selective SSMs is an interesting topic."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Most theoretic results presented in this paper are well-established in the control literature. For example, the first contribution Thm. 3.1 is the classic Lyapunov theorem for exponential stability, which can be found in most standard nonlinear control textbooks. Furthermore, passivity theory for nonlinear, linear parameter-varying (LPV), and switched (or jump) systems have been extensively studied over the past three decades. Many similar theoretic results can be found in those major control journals and conferences by searching the keywords such as \"passivity\", \"LPV\", and \"linear switched systems\", etc. \n\n2. Passivity is a restricted stability analysis framework due to the specific choice of supply rates. It is useful when the underlying dynamics arise from physical systems with particular choices of input-output pair. For example, mechanical systems are naturely passive when the input is force and the output is velocity. However, even such systems are not passive if the output is position. Since SSMs are abstract dynamical system learned from data, passivity theory will lead to conservative results.  For instance, if an SSM is passive (i.e., satisfying the parametric LMI in Eq. (11)), then there is a strict structural constraint $B(t,x)Q(t)=C(t,x)$. In other words, the off-diagonal terms of (11) has to be zero; otherwise, $L(t,x)\\preceq 0$ cannot be guaranteed from Schur's lemma. In practice, such a constraint is rarely enforced or even considered in SSMs.\n\n3. In most control and machine learning applications, the hidden states and input–output variables reside in some real space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Therefore, the generalization to complex space $\\mathbb{C}^n$ appears unnecessary and lacks clear motivation.\n \n4. The experimental section is relatively weak and does not provide sufficient empirical support for the theoretical claims. Is there any pre-trained SSM satisfying the passivity condition? Or is there any benefit (e.g., generalization, robustness, training stability) by enforcing passivity on SSMs?"}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "dHF7OeHryZ", "forum": "F5jHkdgtYG", "replyto": "F5jHkdgtYG", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13823/Reviewer_K6Mh"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13823/Reviewer_K6Mh"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13823/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761276300368, "cdate": 1761276300368, "tmdate": 1762924348298, "mdate": 1762924348298, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a control-theoretic framework for analyzing the stability and regularity of modern Selective State-Space Models (SSMs).
