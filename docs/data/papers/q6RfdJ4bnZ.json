In this work, we present a cascaded AI system that integrates a deep neural network with a large language model to generate and simulate both routine and edge-case traffic scenarios.

By combining real-world traffic data with synthetically generated scenes, the approach enhances travel efficiency and minimizes wait times.

The introduction extensively surveys existing traffic simulators (e.g., SUMO, CARLA) and signal control methods (rule-based, RL, LLM-based), but fails to clearly define the specific problem the paper aims to solve or the unique challenge it addresses. The stated contributions read more like a list of components than a coherent research narrative.  \n4. The core methodology, using prompts to drive an LLM to generate SUMO-compatible XML/Python code for scenarios and signal plans, is essentially a code-generation task. While LLM-based code generation is well-studied, the paper neither demonstrates a significant technical advance over existing approaches nor includes comparisons with relevant baselines in this space.  \n5.
