We introduce \\textbf{FlashEdit}, a novel framework designed to enable high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key innovations: (1) a \\textbf{One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE)} pipeline that bypasses costly iterative processes; (2) a \\textbf{Background Shield (BG-Shield)} technique that guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only within the edit region; and (3) a \\textbf{Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)} mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\\times$ speedup compared to prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Image Editing"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
