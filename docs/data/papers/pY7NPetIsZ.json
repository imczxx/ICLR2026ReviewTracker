However, how CoT produces correct answers through stepwise reasoning—and why it often makes mistakes—remains poorly understood, as the causality between reasoning steps is often difficult to quantify. This limitation raises the open question: Is it necessary to inject causality into CoT reasoning? In this paper, we formalize the CoT as a structural causal model, representing the reasoning process as a causal graph to complete the mathematical modeling. On this basis, we develop a step-level causal correction algorithm, Causalizing Chain-of-Thought (CauCoT), which identifies causally erroneous steps in CoT (i.e., incorrect or unintelligible steps) based on the defined CoT Average Causal Effect, and iteratively updates them until all steps are causally correct—a state we define as relaxed causal correctness. Given the lack of datasets for evaluating the impact of causality on CoT reasoning, we release the Causal Reasoning Benchmark (CRBench), the first benchmark targeting causal errors in CoT, which comprises both causally labeled real CoT reasoning error and newly generated CoT with injected causal errors. Experimental results on LLMs demonstrate that CauCoT can efficiently correct causal errors in CoT and improve the understandability of reasoning. We inject causality into CoT reasoning from mathematical, algorithmic, dataset-driven, and empirical levels, thereby providing strong evidence for the necessity of causality in achieving correct and interpretable stepwise reasoning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Structural causal  model", "Chain-of-Thought", "Causal modeling"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/50949bebbbdfcb8f82f0f33a651d7edc6c68fd13.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b74dbe92ac7a12c488f20adea4436b88bf455311.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper explores whether explicit causal modeling is necessary for improving reasoning correctness and interpretability in large language models (LLMs).

Questionable link between causality and reasoning correctness\n    The paper assumes a strong correlation between causal structure and reasoning correctness — that is, explicitly revealing causal dependencies can enhance logical validity. However, this assumption lacks both theoretical justification and empirical evidence. In many reasoning tasks, the so-called 'causal relations' between steps may be merely epiphenomenal rather than truly constitutive: CoT reasoning steps can form a valid sequence through statistical or semantic coherence without reflecting genuine causal dependence. Without formal proofs or ablation studies verifying the correlation between 'causal correctness' and factual or logical correctness, this central claim risks circular reasoning — assuming that correctness derives from causality, while causality itself is defined in terms of correctness.\n    The proposed metric CACE relies on two scoring functions, Sans and Slog, which measure causal contribution through textual similarity and logical consistency rather than genuine counterfactual causal inference. As a result, the so-called 'causal effect' likely reflects only surface-level alignment among reasoning steps, rather than true intervention-based causal dependence.\n\n2. Overlap with LLM’s intrinsic mechanisms\n    The paper treats 'explicit causal modeling' as an external mechanism added to the reasoning process of LLMs, but overlooks that transformer-based large language models already possess intrinsic causal reasoning capabilities through attention mechanisms and token dependency structures. In Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, each step is generated conditioned on the previous ones — a process that essentially forms a directed information flow. Although not identical to a Structural Causal Model (SCM), it serves a similar functional role. Therefore, explicitly imposing a causal structure may merely duplicate the dependency patterns that the model has already learned internally.\n    Prior research, such as DeCoT, has shown that enhancing causal significance or consistency between reasoning steps can be achieved through representation regularization or consistency loss, without constructing an explicit symbolic causal graph. This paper fails to demonstrate that its SCM-based formalization provides any unique advantage beyond the inherent dependency mechanisms already present in LLMs. To substantiate the central claim that 'injecting causality is necessary', the authors should show that:\n    (a) the LLM’s implicit dependency graph substantially differs from the SCM-derived causal graph; and\n    (b) enforcing the latter effectively closes a measurable reasoning performance gap.\n    However, the paper provides neither analysis. Without such comparison, the contribution appears to be more of a causal rephrasing of existing CoT dependencies rather than a genuinely new mechanism.\n\n3. Coverage of experimental results\n   The authors claim that CauCoT improves reasoning correctness and interpretability across various LLMs; however, the experiments are conducted only on open-source small to mid-sized models such as LLaMA and Qwen, without including the latest high-performance models like GPT-4/4o, Gemini-2.5, or Claude-3. Therefore, the generality of the proposed algorithm for stronger models remains unproven. It is recommended that the authors include comparative experiments or qualitative analyses on these frontier models.\n\n   \n4. Unclear Expression\n    The description of Table 2 is inconsistent: the text states that Columns 2–8 are zero-shot baselines and that the last two columns correspond to 'fine-tuned' CauCoT results, yet the authors also mention highlighting 'the top three zero-shot results per block,' where CauCoT entries are color-marked as well."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
