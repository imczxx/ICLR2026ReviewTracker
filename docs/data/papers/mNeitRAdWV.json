However, models with TIR often exhibit suboptimal behaviors, including insufficient tool calls, excessive tool calls, and overthinking after receiving tool call results. How to empower LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately, while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open challenge.\nIn this paper, we first analyze the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from the perspective of information entropy. We find that when tool call results are provided, the information entropy of subsequent reasoning content will show a clear trend of change, and the overall information entropy of the reasoning chain will vary depending on the number of tool calls. Based on these observations, we propose Tool-Light, a framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately. Our framework consists of dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For dataset construction, we use the trained model for continuous self-evolved sampling, integrating two methods: vanilla sampling and entropy-guided sampling. At the same time, during the sampling process, we design strict criteria for selecting positive-negative pairs. For the training process, we introduce a two-stage method, which includes a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Self-Evolved Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\nTest results on 10 datasets reveal the effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of the model in completing TIR tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["reasoning model", "tool-integrated reasoning", "self-evolved training", "information entropy"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/275b8e64728d86f45f706b384e5ec71bc66171de.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7fdea3dd565314fb16a32d7a6c975995a0dbf8b2.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies the Tool-Integrated Reasoning for LLMs, and proposes a new framework namely Tool-Light to resolve the problem of excessive tool calls during the reasoning.

Building on this, it proposes Tool-Light, a two-stage pipeline: (1) SFT to establish a reasonable tool-using policy, then (2) self-evolved DPO using curated preference pairs to favor accurate, tool-efficient traces. In inference, it adds entropy-guided branching that expands alternatives at high-uncertainty steps while keeping compute controlled. Experiments span math and knowledge-intensive QA with web search and a code interpreter, reporting accuracy alongside two bespoke metrics—Efficiency (tool economy) and Necessity (using tools when needed). Results show competitive or better accuracy with fewer tool calls and shorter outputs compared to strong baselines (e.g., Tool-Star, Search-R1), plus initial ablations on sampling knobs.

The pre-experiment omits decoding settings. No temperature, logit scaling, or sampling vs. greedy are reported. These choices change entropy levels and trends. Please specify the exact decoding config used to measure entropy and justify it. You say the entropy study spans “multiple QA datasets,” but the figure does not list them. It’s also unclear whether the same model/datasets are used later to train Tool-Light. Please enumerate the datasets in Figure 1 and clarify any reuse. For the method, entropy decides branching at top-k steps and uses top-i prefix averages. The values of k and i and their stability are not reported.\n\n(2) Missing ablations. Table 2 varies loop count and a few sampling knobs only. Missing: (i) no-entropy (vanilla) baseline, (ii) entropy-only,  (iii) β sensitivity in DPO, (iv) reference-policy choice, and (v) branch-width sensitivity.\n\n(3) “Multi-tool” over-claim. Most experiments use only two tools (web search + code interpreter), and several evaluations appear to be single-tool setups. There’s no test on unseen tool types or cross-tool composition tasks. As a result, the paper does not yet support broad “multi-tool generalization” claims.\n\n**Suggestions**\n\n(1) Control for length. Lower entropy often comes with shorter or more templated outputs. Your own results show Tool-Light reduces sequence length (Fig. 4). The same factor could explain both “lower entropy” and “fewer tool calls.” Please report entropy at fixed token positions or use length-normalized entropy.\n\n(2) Link entropy to correctness. “Low-entropy chains use fewer tool calls” may reflect early commitment, not better answers. Please test whether entropy predicts correctness. Report AUROC for path-level mean or area-under-entropy, controlling for tool-call count.\n\n(3) Stress test with noisy tools. Overthinking and underuse show up when tools are imperfect. Add controlled corruptions: vary retrieval precision/recall, inject code stderr/noise. Show how Tool-Light adapts tool frequency and preserves accuracy vs. Tool-Star/Search-R1. This directly probes the “analysis paralysis” claim."}, "questions": {"value": "(1) Entropy dips after tool calls.\nCould the “drop before the next tool call” be driven by inserting long, deterministic tool outputs (i.e., context length/format effects) rather than better reasoning? What happens if you replace tool results with semantically equivalent, length-matched paraphrases? Does the pattern remain?\n\n(2) Scope to multi-tool.\nDo the pre-experiment findings hold in true multi-tool settings, not just single-tool or search-heavy cases?
