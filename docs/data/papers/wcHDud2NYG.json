Previous R1-style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning and code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their advantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal data type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in complex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain vision-language model with reinforcement fine-tuning to enable complex chart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic data synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning data covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of reasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training strategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and Chart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims to decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable subtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for improving the reasoning capacity of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilizes the typical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft reward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity in the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks and a self-built chart reasoning dataset (\\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental results show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain methods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\\emph{e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-3.5}).", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Chart Understanding and Reasoning", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a91a70c00eb1d9b664c1b5aa233d35ea56926cd5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/73915548e45c34646daa94ea1274dad8746e8e3f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes ChartRQA, a large-scale dataset for complex chart reasoning in the chart domain, and Chart-R1, a corresponding two-stage training framework.

Then, finetune the same model (qwen2.5 vl) on these newly constructed datasets and compare the results.\n\n\n* The proposed dataset generation approach “programmatic data synthesis” is not novel.
