With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.", "tldr": "This paper introduces Symplectic Phase Space GAN, a measurement agnostic framework that is able to predict accurate motion and generate physically consistent video of dynamical systems while discovering symmetries without a priori knowledge.", "keywords": ["Physics-Guided Machine Learning", "Dynamics and Control", "Symmetry Discovery"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7b085f299e3e5b7f5357eb35133b280c23923521.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The author proposes a novel framework to integrate HNN to sturcture the latent space for physically plausible trajectory generation and video generation."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper is well-written.

The later serves as a minimal theoretical framework for single-well ($\\mu < 0$) to double-well ($\\mu > 0$) transitions often seen in symmetry-breaking theory. It would be interesting to examine whether the proposed model, when trained solely in the pre-bifurcation regime (possibly along with other systems), can predict post-bifurcation behavior.\n\n- The evidence for “correct DOF” is largely t-SNE pictures. t-SNE is not an intrinsic-dimension estimator; its geometry is view-dependent.

HGAN is based on HNN and GANs, and introduces the same cyclic-coordinate loss terms as described in this paper (Equation 4 in their paper). While compared to in experiments, I cannot see HGAN discussed in related work.\n - The paper would substantially improve with a discussion highlighting the differences between both methodologies, and further addressing these points with ablation experiments on the improvements.\n\n**Clarity and presentation issues**\n\n- Equations (4-6) have typos. Please revise.\n- Section 4 needs to be improved in terms of clarity. In its current stage it is a bit confusing.\n  -  For example, it starts by introducing a function f, then it introduces a regularisation term, and it goes back to the function f. I would introduce the regularisation term after defining the final GAN loss.\n  - \\xi as an argument of the function is explained in Line 202, yet \\xi appears first in line 189.\n  - If the motion sample has a specific distribution, please indicate it where you define the motion sample.\n  - Section 4 might benefit by explaining the overall idea of SPS-GAN together by referencing the elements in Figure 1.\n  - Figure 1 and Figure 2 could be grouped together as one.\n- Some referenced figures are not aligned in text, making explanations with figures difficult to follow (e.g., when describing results from Figure 3, 4, or 5).\n\n**Experiments section might need revision**\n- The MSE results compute grountruth vs predicted trajectory. What is the length of this rollout? What is the MSE in terms of different rollout lengths? An interesting advantage to observe for a Hamiltonian system would be to test if it can generate large rollouts which are plausible. \n- For videos, it would be interesting to report results for long/short rollouts and compare.\n- Line 305: “Furthermore, the generated trajectory has energy drift within 2.5% of the ground truth conserved energy” what does this imply?\n- The predicted trajectories only compare to HNN from 2019. Would it be possible to try other more recent baselines? e.g. HALO or HGN mentioned in related work, HGAN, or a non-hamiltonian continuous-time sequence model (latent ODE).\n- Line 307: “We further evaluate SPS-GAN on generating all five systems simultaneously, with explicit system labels and physical parameters used as the conditioning inputs”. Can you provide details of this setup in the main text? Does this mean you provide the model auxiliary labels to distinguish samples from different datasets, and each label activates different \\xi’s? It is not clear from this explanation.\n- Line 313: “A core contribution of SPS-GAN is the ability to identify symmetries by minimising the dimension of the latent motion space.” The words “latent motion space” have not been used previously and could cause confusion to what they refer to. If they refer to the dimensionality of q, accompany it with the corresponding notation.\n- The T-SNE plot to show that the intrinsic dimensionality of the learned systems corresponds to the degrees of freedom is not very intuitive. A quantitative approach to determine intrinsic dimensionality would substantially improve the explanation. In the figure, I cannot see any differences between a and c, yet the authors interpret a has 1 dimension, and c has 2 dimensions.\n- How do we select \\lambda_{cyclic} in practice? Ablation experiments on how to select \\lambda_{cyclic} should be provided.\n\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe system-specific binary mask requires domain knowledge, which limits applicability to real-world data.\n\n\n[1] Allen-Blanchette, Christine. \"Hamiltonian gan.\" 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference.
