Currently, diffusion models have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high‑quality data priors.  However, learning the 3D data distribution with diffusion models in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the diffusion model on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter‑slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the $z$‑axis, which introduces sensitive hyper‑parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter‑Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages inter‑slice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps.  Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug‑and‑play and can be dropped into any 2D‑trained diffusion‑based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter‑slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high‑fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

The main strength of this work lies in its ability to mitigate inter-slice inconsistency—a major challenge in 3D medical inverse problems—without introducing additional priors or complex  modifications. Since the method only modifies the noise structure and introduces no new hyperparameters, it is highly practical and easy to integrate into existing 3D medical reconstruction pipelines.\n2. Experiments across multiple imaging modalities and tasks provide strong evidence that the proposed method can effectively replace the widely used total variation (TV) prior.\n3. The comparison with batch-consistent sampling (BCS) clearly demonstrates the limitations of BCS, specifically the copying artifacts it introduces, and shows that the proposed approach effectively resolves these issues."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The novelty of the proposed method is somewhat limited because similar structural noise techniques have been explored in video diffusion models for enforcing temporal consistency and reducing flickering artifacts (e.g., [1,2,3]). For instance, [1] also samples noise with inter-frame correlations via noise interpolation. To clearly distinguish the contribution, it is necessary to directly compare the proposed method with these noise prior approaches in the same manner as the comparison against BCS.\n2. The interpolated noise is only used during the re-noising steps. Thus, when using deterministic DDIM sampling ($\\eta=0$), where pure noise is not used, the method cannot be applied. If $\\eta=0$ is rarely used in inverse problems due to degraded performance, the authors should provide supporting evidence or references. Additionally, since the proposed method depends directly on the degree of stochasticity ($\\eta$), an analysis of how $\\eta$ influences reconstruction quality is required.\n3. BCS applies its procedure to the initial noise $x_T$. It seems natural to also apply the interpolated correlated noise to the $x_T$ in the proposed method. The authors should clarify why this was not done.\n4. The angle (distance) between the two anchor noise vectors is randomly determined. If there exists an optimal anchor spacing for a given target volume, performance variance may increase. An ablation analyzing reconstruction quality with respect to anchor angle is needed.\n5. **Minor:** The authors attribute the copying artifacts in medical volumes to domain differences from videos, but this claim lacks supporting evidence. Since prior BCS work does not show temporal-slice artifacts in video, the absence of such artifacts is not demonstrated. If the authors wish to maintain the domain-difference argument, they should show that BCS does *not* produce similar artifacts in video inverse problems; otherwise, the proposed method may be better positioned as a domain-genera**l** solution. Of course, evaluating video inverse problems may be beyond the scope of this paper — this is only a suggested clarification and does not affect the overall contribution.\n6. **Minor:** Line 114: “A is invertible” appears to be a typo; presumably it should be **non-invertible**.\n\n[1] Ge, Songwei, et al. \"Preserve your own correlation: A noise prior for video diffusion models.\" *ICCV*. 2023.\n\n[2] Wu, Tianxing, et al. \"Freeinit: Bridging initialization gap in video diffusion models.\" *ECCV.* 2024.\n\n[3] Chang, Pascal, et al. \"How i warped your noise: a temporally-correlated noise prior for diffusion models.\" ICLR (2024)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. While the method shows that it can replace the widely used TV prior, it would be informative to see how it compares with 3D priors such as TQDM. It is okay to the proposed method does not outperform them.\n2. Implicit slice-wise regularization via noise correlation may underperform explicit regularizers (e.g., TV) under severe degradation where large portions of information must be reconstructed. Does the method maintain performance under such challenging forward models?\n3. Since the proposed approach seems orthogonal to explicit volumetric priors such as 3D TV, can the two be combined for further performance improvement?\n4.
