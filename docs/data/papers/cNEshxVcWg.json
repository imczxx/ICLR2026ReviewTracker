Existing approaches often compromise on robustness, imperceptibility, or scalability, with many introducing semantic drift that weakens provenance guarantees. To address this, we introduce \\emph{NullGuard}, a training-free, plug-and-play watermarking framework that embeds cryptographically keyed signals in the null-space of pretrained diffusion Jacobians, using user-specific rotations to define imperceptible directions. A lightweight Gauss–Newton pivot refinement, constrained by a perceptual mask, perturbs only watermark-relevant components while preserving global semantics, and a likelihood-ratio test detects watermarks without DDIM inversion, achieving up to 99\\% detection accuracy under attacks such as cropping, blurring, and JPEG compression, with PSNR $\\ge$ 45 dB. Extensive evaluations on MS-COCO and DiffusionDB demonstrate that NullGuard surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in robustness, invisibility, and semantic alignment, offering a scalable foundation for provenance-aware diffusion governance.

The proposed method appears to achieve strong empirical results, and the evaluation follows standard benchmarks, including robustness to various common attacks."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The most significant issue with this paper lies in its writing quality and presentation, which severely hinders comprehension of both the technical method and its motivation. The clarity, structure, and detail of the method section are insufficient to support a confident understanding or reproduction of the proposed framework. Many core terms are undefined, motivations are vague or missing, and technical procedures are explained in a way that is too abstract or obscure.\n\nFirst, there are persistent formatting and grammatical issues throughout the paper. The citation style is inconsistent with standard formatting, section and subsection headings are not numbered or inconsistently styled (e.g., Line 240), and numerous sentences are difficult to parse due to typos or awkward phrasing—for instance, Line 345’s \"within,\" and Line 481’s \"Once in To\". Acronyms are introduced without definition, and paragraph transitions are often abrupt. These issues alone detract from the professional presentation expected at this level.\n\nMore importantly, the methodology section lacks a clear and logical narrative structure. A strong methods section should begin by providing a high-level overview of the pipeline: how the watermark is generated, how it is embedded, and how it is detected. Each of these stages should then be broken down into smaller components, with clear explanations of what each step is doing, why it is necessary, and how it contributes to the overall goal.\n\nTaking “Key-to-Secret Rotation” as an example (Line 192), the reader is suddenly introduced to a “high-entropy matrix” without any prior definition or intuition. Why is the key K expanded into such a matrix? What is the purpose of performing a QR decomposition, and what is the significance of the resulting matrix belonging to the SO(m) group? What does “membership in SO(m)” even mean in this context? These are not rhetorical questions—they are necessary clarifications the paper does not provide. This lack of grounding occurs repeatedly throughout the method section. Each component (including the Null Space Embedder and the Decision-based Verifier) is introduced as if the reader is already familiar with the mathematical background and the reasoning behind each design choice, yet the necessary preliminaries and intuitions are entirely missing. The result is that the framework feels like a sequence of obscure technical operations without a clearly communicated purpose or justification.\n\nFurthermore, the experimental section fails to analyze the method in a meaningful way. While the setup and baseline results are similar to those in the ZoDiac paper—an acceptable starting point—the paper does not offer any in-depth ablation, parameter sensitivity, or justification for why this proposed method works better. For a paper introducing multiple new modules, one would expect to see ablation experiments showing the relative contribution of each, or at the very least, tuning analyses of any unique hyperparameters. Yet the experiments simply report improvements and repeat the phrase “consistently outperform” without delving into why that might be the case. As a result, the experimental section serves more as a scoreboard than a validation of the proposed design.\n\nTo be clear, if the method section had been written clearly and the components had been strongly motivated, the lack of ablation might be excusable. But in the current form, where the methodology is opaque and underspecified, the lack of experimental introspection compounds the difficulty in evaluating the actual merit of the method."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the weakness part."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "PNC9oRozHc", "forum": "cNEshxVcWg", "replyto": "cNEshxVcWg", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25099/Reviewer_LeHZ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25099/Reviewer_LeHZ"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25099/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760485187795, "cdate": 1760485187795, "tmdate": 1762943324566, "mdate": 1762943324566, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "QVTNR0kjHm", "forum": "cNEshxVcWg", "replyto": "cNEshxVcWg", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25099/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25099/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763016560040, "cdate": 1763016560040, "tmdate": 1763016560040, "mdate": 1763016560040, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an invisible watermarking technique named NullGuard, designed using the T2I-Diffusion model.

In this area's common sense, an extremely small perturbation (to achieve very high PSNR) usually reduce robustness under strong attacks. If the watermark signal is encoded in a perturbation that is as small as this paper, then achieving high WDR under multiple attacks implies an unusually strong resistance to the pertubations.
