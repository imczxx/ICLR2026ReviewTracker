However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process.

This would show if mirage infusion and reduction also improve performance in such crystals.\n- Conceptually, with the addition of mirage atoms, the distribution shifts from the original training distribution (and potentially changes the symmetry within the crystal). Does the model have to learn two symmetries simultaneously? Is there a study on the distribution of space groups before and after mirage infusion, along with the generated crystals before and after reduction?\n- It would be great to add more discussion on the benefits of your method compared to the first subgroup of methods (under models that change the number of atoms) to highlight the importance of the proposed method in developing models that can change the number of atoms during inference. Furthermore, the result tables lack these baselines, which are more relevant for comparison with MiAD.\n- The mirage infusion and reduction are implemented only with DiffCSP. Results with additional models that require no special modification (e.g., as mentioned, FlowMM, CrystalFlow, and MatterGen) will demonstrate the method's adaptability and whether performance improvements are agnostic to the underlying model.\n- What is the quantitative estimate of the increase in training and inference budget (time, compute, memory) with the mirage atoms (since it is mentioned that the model incurs higher computational costs)?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "qo1NvGyItY", "forum": "ZfkGDs976D", "replyto": "ZfkGDs976D", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11771/Reviewer_ixHC"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11771/Reviewer_ixHC"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11771/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761564425120, "cdate": 1761564425120, "tmdate": 1762922796203, "mdate": 1762922796203, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, the authors address a key limitation in crystal material generation, where most existing diffusion-based models are constrained to a fixed number of atoms during the generation process. To overcome this, they propose MiAD (Mirage Atom Diffusion), a novel generative framework that extends DiffCSP by allowing the number of atoms to vary dynamically as the crystal structure evolves. The central idea, called “mirage infusion”, introduces a special placeholder atom type (type 0), referred to as a mirage atom, which can either appear or disappear during generation. This mechanism effectively enables the model to add or remove atoms adaptively, thereby expanding the diversity and flexibility of generated structures.

As noted in the paper, the authors mask the mirage atom from the loss computation for the fractional coordinates, which they found to beneficial for material generation.

All the baseline models sample according to the empirical distribution of the dataset (maximum 20 atoms), while your approach samples up to 25 atoms due to the mirage atoms approach. A potentially a more fair comparison might involve using the empirical distribution generated by your model for the fixed-size baselines (Figure 4 you are presenting in Appendix). Related to the metrics computation, did you exclude generated samples that contain more than 20 atoms in the case of MP-20? Are these generated crystals automatically counted as novel in the evaluation? Since the fixed-size models are limited to the empirical distribution of MP-20, they cannot generate crystals with more than 20 atoms and therefore cannot outperform the proposed method.\n- In the Appendix, Table 5 mentions that you attempt to position the mirage atoms at the geometric center of the real atoms.
