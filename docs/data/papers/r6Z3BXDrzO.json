The ideal goal is *Retrain Equivalence*--behavior identical to a model trained from scratch on only the retained data. This goal was formulated for models trained on i.i.d. data batches, but modern pipelines often involve multi-stage training, with each stage having a distinct data distribution and objective. Examples include LLM fine-tuning for alignment, reasoning ability, etc. Our study shows via theory and experiments that this shift to multi-stage training introduces a fundamental barrier for machine unlearning. The theory indicates that the outcome of local unlearning—methods that only use gradients computed on the forget set—is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is influenced by the *order* of its training stages during learning, making it impossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain Equivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM post-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B–14B) with gradient ascent, NPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms. Models fine-tuned via different orderings of identical training stages diverge in behavior during unlearning, with the degradation in GSM8K accuracy after unlearning varying by over 20\\% across paths. We also observe that some learning paths consistently produce models that unlearn slowly. During unlearning, whether the probability mass gets squeezed into paraphrasing or alternative concepts is also path-dependent. These results consistently show that Retrain Equivalence is an ill-posed target for local unlearning algorithms, so long as the target models are trained in stages. In situations where access to models' training histories is hard, the current work calls for rethinking the definition and desiderata of machine unlearning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Language Models", "Machine Unlearning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/165a0fd5f336778aaab41091b73f6cf5436e2517.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper considers the difficulty of unlearning with “local” algorithm, i.e., those that only use the model weights and the forget set. They conduct experiments on LLMs and note the ordering of the training data can make such unlearning algorithms significantly less effective , and provide some theory in the case of linear regression. They conclude that further work is needed in formulating this type of unlearning.\n\nThe authors seem unaware of past work which had already shown this formulation for unlearning is ill-defined; a dataset without the forget set can give the same model as training with the dataset (with some probability over the training orderings), e.g., Thudi., et al [1]. Note at the time “approximate unlearning” only really consisted of “local” unlearning algorithms. This led to further research into forgeability, and analysis of the closely related notion of per-instance privacy. It also has been one of the primary reasons for stronger algorithmic definitions of unlearning (which use the training algorithm and retain dataset) and disclosures when using weaker definitions, e.g., see the ToFU benchmark [2].\n\nIn the context of this literature, this paper makes further observations on the nature and prevalence of forgeability. However, this paper does contribute to the existence of this phenomenon, which was already proved in general for mini-batch SGD training algorithms [1] using an even stronger metric (i.e., the model weights are the same which implies predictions are the same).

I think with such changes to the presentation this paper can be valuable to the literature on unlearning, and will be happy to reconsider the score. However, the paper misses the mark right now given it lacks context with existing results.\n\nSuggestions: \n\n1) While the phenomenon that unlearning is dependent on training trajectory is known in various contexts (which can lead to it being ill-defined), it seems a concrete contribution of this paper is that it measures this dependence (often called forging) for LLM fine-tuning. I suggest the authors no longer claim to discover the former, and instead discuss past work on this phenomenon and more broadly unlearning difficulty. They can then just focus on their contribution to measuring this dependence in LLM fine-tuning, which is already mentioned throughout the paper (but often after claiming the former).\n\n\n2) Given this, the description of the contribution of the theoretical result could be rephrased to emphasize that it quantifies how specific orderings diverge with continual “local” unlearning; the exponential divergence seems novel to the unlearning (difficulty) literature, and is already what is described in the theorem. One just needs to rephrase the summary of this result (in the context of past results) in the introduction and elsewhere in the paper.\n\n3) Similarly the empirical section seems to be correct on its own, and just how these results are interpreted in the context of past results needs to be made clearer. For example, as far as I know the observation about the recency phenomenon seems novel, and to me is something worthy of a paper; one just needs to not claim to be the first to observe that machine unlearning depends on data ordering, and instead only make the more fine-grained claims of what dependencies were specifically observed."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "baTw6F0Kx7", "forum": "r6Z3BXDrzO", "replyto": "r6Z3BXDrzO", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23027/Reviewer_S5jh"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23027/Reviewer_S5jh"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23027/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761750087014, "cdate": 1761750087014, "tmdate": 1762942483545, "mdate": 1762942483545, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper aims to study the effect of data order in training pipeline that is later being unlearned could have significant impact on how unlearning might have effect.

In practice, two models trained on the same data but with different random seeds can yield noticeably different predictions, especially on out-of-distribution inputs, yet should still be regarded as equivalent from a statistical or functional standpoint. Therefore, RE as defined in this paper captures only pointwise similarity rather than distributional or behavioral equivalence. Extending RE to a distribution-level notion, such as expected loss or output distribution similarity under the retain data distribution, would make the theoretical conclusions more general and more aligned with standard unlearning objectives.\n* Section 4.3 appears to overstate the evidence for “path-dependent superficial forgetting”. The claim of a newly identified phenomenon is supported by only 40 prompts for each dataset (C, U, and R), i.e., 120 samples total, in a largely qualitative setup, which is insufficient to draw reliable or generalizable conclusions about superficial vs. deep forgetting. While the observation is interesting as an illustrative example, it does not yet constitute empirical evidence of a new phenomenon. \n* The paper defines local unlearning as using only the gradient of the forget set, thereby excluding many practical algorithms that employ lightweight retain-based regularization or contrastive objectives (e.g., Gradient Difference, DPO). This narrow definition simplifies the theoretical treatment but makes the conclusions less representative of real-world unlearning methods.
