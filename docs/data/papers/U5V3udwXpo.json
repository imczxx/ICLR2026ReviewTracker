A fundamental challenge in observational data is that while we need to infer outcome differences under alternative treatments, we can only observe each individual's outcome under a single treatment.  Existing approaches address this limitation either by training with inferred pseudo-outcomes or by creating matched instance pairs. However, these methods overlook post-treatment variables that not only directly influence outcomes but are also affected by exogenous noise. This oversight prevents existing methods from fully capturing outcome variability, resulting in increased variance in counterfactual predictions. In this paper, we introduce PIPCFR, a novel approach that incorporates post-treatment variables through a teacher-student architecture to improve pseudo-outcome imputation. We analyze the challenges inherent in utilizing post-treatment variables and establish a novel theoretical bound for ITE risk that explicitly connects post-treatment variables to ITE estimation accuracy. Unlike existing methods that ignore these variables or impose restrictive assumptions, PIPCFR learns effective representations that preserve informative components while mitigating bias. Empirical evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that PIPCFR achieves significantly lower ITE errors compared to existing methods.", "tldr": "We propose a novel approach that incorporates post-treatment variables through a teacher-student architecture to improve pseudo-outcome imputation.", "keywords": ["causal inference", "individual treatment effects", "post-treatment variables"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0752c0da3f1c5e2b81c3008cc86fdb65f0121fa5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4b70cff2f084c01586c3e0a70e3ca8898480a252.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, authors have proposed an interesting and a novel framework for individualised treatment effect (ITE) estimation under binary treatment setting that extracts information from the post-treatment variables for predicting and reducing the variance for counterfactual outcomes without introducing bias due to their usage.

To achieve this objective, they propose a teacher-student architecture where the teacher utilises context x as well as post-treatment variables s to predict pseudo-counterfactuals while student utilises those conterfactual pseudo outcomes to predict outcomes using only context x.

The paper proposes a novel framework for ITE estimation that enables existing ITE learners to extract information from the post-treatment variables to reduce variance in the counterfactual predictions. This is very useful when there is high exogenous noise and complex temporal dependencies that influence the mechanism of treatment to impact outcomes. So, this is the first work to consider this and develop a framework to address this problem. The framework introduces a teacher-student architecture, which complements the existing learners as it can be combined with them and hence makes it a significant contribution. I really liked Example 1, which shows the feasibility of the idea through a structural equation model.\n\n2. The paper provides a theoretical proof for the proposed framework and connects the ITE risk to the post-treatment variables and estimation accuracy (not verified).\n\n3. The paper also provides sufficient empirical analysis, comparing the proposed framework to the existing ITE learners across synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. They study the influence of exogenous noise to prove the efficacy of the proposed method, and they also demonstrate how the proposed framework complements the existing ITE learners, which leads to significant improvements in the estimation accuracy of the baselines.\n\n4.

This is not easy to follow the key point of the paper, which was about how we can use the post-treatment variables while avoiding bias associated with them. While overall, it is clear that they used teacher-student architecture where the teacher utilises post-treatment variables to generate counterfactual outcomes to be used by the student model, it is not clear how they avoided the post-treatment bias. The paper defines the proposed method by mixing a lot of mathematics and explanations, which make it hard to understand what is happening. The paper defines many mathematical notations spread across two sections (preliminary and methodology), which are difficult to remember and thus impact the readability. The authors must define the big picture of the paper at one place, helping the reader understand how this interesting idea is implemented, and then should be followed by theorems and other results. Instead of telling the big picture first and then going deep into mathematics for problem formulation and deriving proofs, they started with mathematics and forced the reader to understand through the mathematics, e.g., the methodology section starts by defining a loss term. \n\nThey defined many loss terms but they didn't define the complete loss function at one place or provide a discussion about their contributions. This further makes the idea difficult to follow. \n\nThe diagram of the method comes at the end of the methodology section. It should come first, as that would help the reader to understand quickly. They also did not provide any algorithm to understand the training process.\n\nI think, the methodology section should be rewritten where they should add one subsection at the beginning to highlight the idea at high level, and the contents of the section should be reorganised for ease of reading. They should define complete loss function at one place and add explanations how different components contribute to the picture. The diagram of the framework should also be moved to the beginning of the section, and adding an algorithm for the training can further add value to improve readability"}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "BnAWPHRr6C", "forum": "U5V3udwXpo", "replyto": "U5V3udwXpo", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9319/Reviewer_zswb"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9319/Reviewer_zswb"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9319/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760722253857, "cdate": 1760722253857, "tmdate": 1762920955926, "mdate": 1762920955926, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "PIPCFR estimates individual treatment effects by using a teacher-student framework: the teacher model constructs a debiased representation of post-treatment variables to impute counterfactual pseudo-outcomes, and the student model learns from the pseudo-labels using a proposed PIP loss.
