Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs. dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering while consistently outperforming existing methods across static, view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable universal primitive for radiance field rendering.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Radiance Field", "Splatting"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2eeb8147f7d3afce2dd93fe6b454fbaa69aa30fa.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f76b113563b5def373bcce0dc7c6f15dcf318298.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "**Universal Beta Splatting (UBS)** targets the fragmentation in splatting pipelines, where geometry, view dependence, and dynamics are handled by separate components.

As a result, understanding the contribution of UBS as a unified N-D generalization requires first reconstructing DBS’s basics. I recommend adding a focused preliminaries section that (i) recaps the Beta kernel definition and its bounded support; (ii) derives the mapping from Beta parameters to per-primitive opacity and radiance/color; and (iii) clarifies what is re-used vs. newly introduced in UBS (especially around conditional slicing and the removal of SH).

A deeper theoretical justification of why Beta kernels are fundamentally better suited for radiance modeling than Gaussians would improve clarity. Second, the empirical evaluation could be more comprehensive: ablations isolating the effects of Beta modulation, conditional slicing, and spatial-orthogonal Cholesky parameterization are limited.
