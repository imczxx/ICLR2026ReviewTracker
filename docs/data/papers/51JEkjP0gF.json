Our unified approach captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs. dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering while consistently outperforming existing methods across static, view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable universal primitive for radiance field rendering.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Radiance Field", "Splatting"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7bcc6cb728c494f4bdb662dc85aa25fc374e8882.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f76b113563b5def373bcce0dc7c6f15dcf318298.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "**Universal Beta Splatting (UBS)** targets the fragmentation in splatting pipelines, where geometry, view dependence, and dynamics are handled by separate components.

We have carefully addressed all concerns with substantial additional experiments, theoretical justifications, and clarifications as detailed below.\n\n---\n\n## Key Revisions and Additions\n\n### 1. Enhanced Theoretical Foundation (Addresses: 5UF1, zazd)\nWe added **Appendix section \"Spatial-Orthogonal Cholesky Parameterization\"** with complete derivation of Eq. 8 (originally Eq. 6) including design motivations, skew-symmetric rotation parameterization, and mathematical properties (PSD guarantee, spatial interpretability, cross-correlations, N-D generalization, efficiency). **Table 10** validates six rotation strategies—our 1st-order Taylor achieves best PSNR (25.54 dB) with fastest training (1h). This complements the existing **\"Theoretical Foundation and Analysis\"** section covering Gaussian limitations and Beta kernel properties.\n\n### 2. Expanded Related Work and State-of-the-Art Comparison (Addresses: 4uqJ, bWeR)\n\nWe expanded **Alternative Kernel Designs** paragraph with comprehensive coverage of reviewer-suggested methods: TNT-GS, Quadratic-GS, 3D-HGS, DisC-GS, DRKS, Textured Gaussians, Triangle Splatting, etc. \n**Key distinction:** These methods improve 3D spatial kernels but remain confined to 3D without unified N-D representation jointly modeling spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions.\n\n**More Benchmark Comparisons (Appendix A):** A quantitative comparison table of UBS-6D against 13 methods on Mip-NeRF360 and NeRF Synthetic; Another quantitative comparison table of UBS-7D against state-of-the-art kernel-based methods on\nthe real-world dynamic N3V dataset. \n\n### 3. Comprehensive Experimental Validation (Addresses: 4uqJ, bWeR, 5UF1)\n\n**Efficiency Analysis (Appendix B):** Primitive counts, model sizes, FPS, and training times across all datasets. Key findings: 43-47% memory reduction, 31-69% faster training, 41-75% decrease in number of parameters per primitive.\n\n### 4. Improved Paper Accessibility (Addresses: bWeR)\nEnhanced Preliminaries (Section 3) with explicit density function definitions bridging 3DGS → DBS → UBS for self-contained presentation.\n\n### 5. Training Stability Analysis (Addresses: 5UF1, zazd)\nBeta parameters initialize to $b_i = 0$ (Gaussian approximation) for stable starting point. Consistent convergence across 38 scenes (5 datasets). Training progression shows UBS-7D has minimal peak degradation (−0.01 dB) vs. 4DGS (−1.28 dB) and 7DGS (−0.14 dB), confirming superior stability.\n\n### 6. Backward Compatibility & Interpretability (Addresses: zazd, 5UF1)\n**Compatibility:** UBS approximates Gaussian behavior; renders through standard 3DGS rasterizer. **Interpretability:** Temporal Beta parameter correlation with motion on D-NeRF scenes (Spearman ρ = 0.48-0.80) validates that learned parameters provide semantically meaningful representations without supervision.\n\n---\n\n## Common Themes Across Reviews\n\n**Novelty and Technical Contributions:** UBS introduces three fundamental innovations—(1) Unified N-D anisotropic Beta primitives with per-dimension shape control, (2) Spatial-orthogonal Cholesky parameterization, (3) Beta-modulated conditional slicing with product-form opacity gate. These enable 41-73% parameter reduction and up to +8.27 dB PSNR improvement.\n\n**Experimental Completeness:** We added more SOTA comparisons in Appendix A, efficiency metrics (Tables 8-9) in Appendix B, and per-primitive parameter analysis (Table 7). \n\n**Theoretical Foundation:** Appendix section C and D provides Spatial-Orthogonal Cholesky derivation, rotation strategy validation (Table 10), Gaussian limitation analysis, and Beta kernel properties.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Core Contributions\n\nUBS makes substantial contributions: \n\n(1) **Unified N-D Anisotropic Beta kernel framework** with per-dimension shape control; \n\n(2) **Novel innovations** (Spatial-orthogonal Cholesky, Beta-modulated conditional slicing, and Beta-gated product-form opacity); \n\n(3) **SOTA results** (highest PSNR on 3 benchmarks, +8.27 dB improvement); \n\n(4) **Superior efficiency** (31-69% faster training, 43-47% memory reduction, 41-73% parameter reduction); \n\n(5) **Comprehensive validation** (SOTA method comparisons, demonstrated stability). These establish Beta kernels as practical universal primitives.\n\n---\n\nWe believe these revisions address all concerns and demonstrate that UBS represents a significant advance in radiance field rendering.
