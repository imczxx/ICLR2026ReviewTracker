While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise, they typically require ample labeled data (both normal and anomalous) to distinguish anomalous nodes from normal ones. In practice, however, only a small subset of anomalies are labeled, leaving most nodes unlabeled, a scenario known as positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. This, combined with the oversmoothing tendency of GNNs, leads to a strong bias toward predicting most nodes as normal, thus severely limiting detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose WAVEN-PULL: WAVElet-based ANomaly detection in dynamic graphs via Positive-Unlabeled Learning. WAVEN-PULL features: (1) dynamic graph encoder that combines Beta-Wavelet Graph Convolution and temporal attention to capture multi-scale spectral patterns and the temporal evolution of node behaviors, thereby effectively capturing anomalous signals in dynamic graphs and mitigating oversmoothing; (2) PU-aware alignment module that corrects prediction bias by aligning the anomaly ratio of unlabeled predictions with class priors, which can be theoretically shown to yield an unbiased risk estimator with temporal stability under exponential moving average (EMA); and (3) anomaly probability estimation module that maps node embeddings to probabilities, ensuring consistency with risk minimization principles and enabling robust end-to-end detection even with scarce labels. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that WAVEN-PULL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving absolute AUC improvements of 6.15%, 22.81%, and 4.74% on Wikipedia, Reddit, and Bit-Alpha, respectively.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Anomaly detection", "dynamic graphs", "positive-unlabeled learning"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e8b831dcbae5c8c23a2706b5813f2c15a299b44e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the problem of anomaly detection in dynamic graphs, focusing on the challenging and practical Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning setting where only a small number of positive (anomalous) labels are available.

Limited Methodological Novelty: The paper's core methodology appears to be a novel combination of existing components rather than a fundamental methodological advance. The use of wavelet-based GNNs to counter the low-pass filtering effect for anomaly detection is a well-established concept in static graphs (as cited by the authors ). The primary architectural contribution is the application of this static encoder to graph snapshots, followed by a standard node-level temporal attention mechanism. While the appendix provides justification for why this combination is theoretically sound, the architectural design itself remains incremental.\n\n2. Weak Conceptual Integration: The paper does not convincingly articulate a deep, synergistic link between its two main technical components. The theoretical analysis argues that the temporal attention module preserves the spectral contrast captured by the wavelet encoder (Theorem B.5), but it fails to establish why a wavelet-based encoder is uniquely suited for or enhanced by the PU-aware learning objective. The framework currently reads as two effective but separate solutions addressing two separate problems (oversmoothing and PU bias), rather than a deeply integrated system where the components mutually amplify one another's benefits.\n\n3. Insufficient Baseline Comparisons: The experimental evaluation is not comprehensive enough to establish state-of-the-art performance for a top-tier conference. The paper also lacks comparisons against several recent and powerful dynamic graph GNN architectures (e.g., PINT, DyGFormer, SILD) that are essential for contextualizing the performance of a new dynamic graph model. The ablation study for the PU-aware loss (-LDA in Figure 3)  only compares against a naive binary cross-entropy baseline, which is known to perform poorly in PU settings. A more rigorous evaluation would compare the proposed alignment loss against other established PU-learning losses (e.g., nnPU) while holding the wavelet-based graph encoder fixed.\n\n\n4. The paper states that experiments were repeated five times , but the main tables (Table 1 and 2) report only average performance. Reporting standard deviations is critical for assessing the stability of the method and the statistical significance of its improvements.\n\n5. The evaluation is conducted on datasets with a maximum of ~11,000 nodes.

The proposed method, while effective, appears to be an assemblage of pre-existing techniques rather than a foundational innovation. The core architectural components—Beta-Wavelet Graph Convolution for countering oversmoothing in anomaly detection and node-level temporal attention—are directly adapted from prior work. The contribution thus lies in the novel application and integration of these known elements to the dynamic PU setting, which constitutes an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary step.\n2.  The paper presents two distinct solutions for two distinct problems (spectral signal loss and PU learning bias) but fails to weave them into a unified theoretical story. The justification provided is one of non-interference (i.e., the temporal module does not degrade the spatial module's spectral features) rather than true synergy (e.g., proving the PU objective is uniquely suited for wavelet-derived representations). This leaves the impression of a modular system where components are combined effectively but without a deep, unifying principle.\n3.  The experimental validation is not sufficiently broad to claim state-of-the-art status.\n    * The set of comparators is missing several high-impact, recent models in dynamic graph learning that would be necessary for a comprehensive benchmark.\n    * The analysis of the PU learning module is not fully isolated. Its superiority is only demonstrated in the ablation study against a weak baseline (treating all unlabeled data as negative), rather than being rigorously compared to other principled PU learning objectives (e.g., nnPU) within the same architectural backbone.\n4.  The empirical results lack statistical robustness. While the authors state that experiments were repeated five times, the results are presented as point estimates without standard deviations, making it impossible to assess the stability of the model or the statistical significance of the reported gains.\n5.   The evaluation is confined to relatively small-scale graphs (the largest having ~11,000 nodes).
