The paper is thus unconvincing on this point.\n- 4000 is a relatively small dataset size in the era of deep learning.  It is not sufficiently justified why this is chosen.\n- The data are 2D-only.  Again, the real world is 3D, so it does not seem very useful to have a dataset of mere 2D configurations.\n- I also don't think tandem airfoils occur in isolation in the real world.  For instance, they should be attached to cars or airplanes.  A dataset of real-world objects that happen to have tandem airfoils, would likely be more useful.\n- The paper appears to use a very niche discretization, DID, as opposed to the various FDM, FEM, FVM, or other discretizations that have been popular in CFD for many decades.  This may limit the usefulness of the analysis in the paper, although the tandem-foil geometries could still be used by other researchers (though that is a pretty trivial contribution).\n- Regarding DID and the benchmarks, the high error rates of 0.5-8% would generally not be considered acceptable by CFD researchers.  Classical CFD solvers can get errors down to e.g. machine precision of like 1e-15.  That being said, other methods like PINNs also produce results with high errors.  But there is no comparison of this method to other AI-based methods to justify its performance - perhaps other PINN or similar NN-based methods would do worse, and it's just the size of the dataset that's the constraint.  There are no such comparisons in the paper, though.\n- It is not clear that a method like DID is really practical for CFD when it becomes so much more computationally difficult with each object added to a simulation, when compared to typical one-way solid-fluid coupling algorithms that can handle hundreds of thousands of solids just about as quickly as one."}, "questions": {"value": "None"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Iv7svHuxx0", "forum": "4Z0P4Nbosn", "replyto": "4Z0P4Nbosn", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14913/Reviewer_CkWJ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14913/Reviewer_CkWJ"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14913/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761190087348, "cdate": 1761190087348, "tmdate": 1762925258799, "mdate": 1762925258799, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "TandemFoilSet introduces nine 2D CFD datasets (five tandem-airfoil and four single-airfoil counterparts; 8,104 total cases, 4,152 tandem) spanning cruise, takeoff (ground effect), and race-car regimes across wide ranges of NACA parameters, Reynolds number, Angle of Attack, stagger, gap, and height.

(See questions for concrete paths.)\n\n*Geometry encoding design space*: DID/SV are well motivated, but the paper could better situate them versus (un)signed distance fields (SDF/UDF), level-set encodings, or constructive solid geometry (CSG) fusion; especially since combining distance fields is a natural operation when moving from single to tandem geometries."}, "questions": {"value": "I enjoyed reading this paper and how it could encourage the CFD community to adopt more AI tools. Some of these suggestions are (understandably) difficult to execute on a short rebuttable period, but I provide them for the authors to consider for the future. The critical questions I highlight in bold below: \n\n*Distance-field representations (DIR) via SDF/UDF*: You extend DID to multi-object via a clever, fast combination. Have you considered using an (un)signed distance function as the core DIR, leveraging CAD/CSG-style Boolean merges (min/max, smooth-min) to combine primitives and airfoils? SDFs provide smooth gradients, exact surface normals, and robust interpolation; they could be directionally integrated post-hoc (compute DID on top of SDF), or used directly as multi-channel inputs (distance, normal, curvature). This might (i) simplify multi-body composition, (ii) reduce DID compute, and (iii) improve generalization to arbitrary multi-component layouts. Any reason an SDF-centric pipeline wouldn’t fit your smooth-combining and residual-training framework?\n\n**Transformers on meshes / hybrid models:** Your results champion GNNs; however, many recent surrogate winners are transformer-flavored. Anyway to extend your results? Two concrete suggestions would be to try (a) global tokens atop MGN/IVE (attention across far-field neighbors or via landmark nodes) to better capture long-range tandem wake interactions, (b) Fourier/Transformer hybrids (global spectral mixing for long-range interactions, GNN for local inductive bias). This aligns with the multi-NN approach you already have. \n\n*Time-dependent extension*: Everything here is steady. How would you extend TandemFoilSet to unsteady flows (URANS/LES) and time-dependent learning? \n\n**Generalization beyond airfoils / shape systems** You include some non-NACA profiles and race-car ground-effect cases. Could the dataset (maybe in the future) be extended to include bluff-body to stress fundamentally different separation physics? Can you report on how the approach generalizes to configurations (shape, distances, offsets) that are not in the distribution?\n\n**Compute/latency budgeting**: Residual training with freestream and combined-field estimates is appealing because the estimates are cheap. Could you publish wall-time and memory profiles for (a) baseline, (b) pretrain-only, (c) residual-only, and (d) full pipeline so others can match/compare your cost–accuracy tradeoffs?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "dHVfVaemM7", "forum": "4Z0P4Nbosn", "replyto": "4Z0P4Nbosn", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14913/Reviewer_HGdM"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14913/Reviewer_HGdM"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14913/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761903280142, "cdate": 1761903280142, "tmdate": 1762925258449, "mdate": 1762925258449, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces TandemFoilSet, a benchmark dataset for tandem airfoils, comprising five distinct configurations and paired single airfoil cases.
