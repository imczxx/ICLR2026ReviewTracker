While large-scale in vitro drug response data from cancer cell lines exist, predicting patient drug responses remains challenging due to genomic distribution shifts and the scarcity of clinical response data. Existing transfer learning methods primarily align global genomic features between cell lines and patients. However, they often ignore two critical aspects. First, drug response depends on specific drug substructures and genomic pathways. Second, drug response mechanisms differ in vitro and in vivo settings due to factors such as the immune system and tumor microenvironment. To address these limitations, we propose DeepSADR, a novel deep transfer learning framework for enhanced drug response prediction based on subsequence interaction and adaptive readout. In particular, DeepSADR models drug responses as interpretable bipartite interaction graphs between drug substructures and enriched genomic pathways. Subsequently, a supervised graph autoencoder was designed to capture latent interactions between drugs and gene subsequences within these interaction graphs. In addition, DeepSADR treats the drug response process as a transferable domain. A Set Transformer-based adaptive readout (AR) function learns domain-invariant response representations, enabling effective knowledge transfer from abundant cell line data to scarce patient data. Extensive experiments on clinical patient cohorts demonstrate that DeepSADR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and ablation experiments have validated the effectiveness of each module.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["adaptive readout; subsequence interaction;drug response;cancer patient"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c9825fc5d2611a0b09ae5aea92c0bbd8c84ec087.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6a35200d47d883fb3e6bbc25390a571d796851bc.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces DeepSADR, a deep transfer learning framework designed to improve drug response prediction for clinical patients. The core idea is to decompose drugs and genomes into subsequences (substructures and functional pathways, respectively), model their interactions in a graph, and use an adaptive readout mechanism for knowledge transfer. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepSADR achieves performance improvements. However, the approach is essentially a combination of existing components, and the training framework itself is not new. In addition, the method relies heavily on predefined prior knowledge (such as fixed functional pathways and drug-specific thresholds), which limits its generalizability."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The paper states that \"we assigned the genes to 13 functional pathways\", but it is unclear how this assignment is performed and why these 13 fixed pathways are predefined. For patients with different diseases, should the pathways be redefined? Since each patient’s pathway profile can differ, these fixed and limited pathways may hinder the model’s generalizability. Moreover, such a strong prior assumption may fail to capture disease-specific biological processes or drug-specific mechanisms, especially across different cancer types.\n\n2. The paper does not clearly describe the data split strategy. Were the baseline models retrained by the authors? Some reported results differ from those in prior literature. For example, WISER reports an AUC of 0.868 for CODE-AE on Fluorouracil, which is inconsistent with the results shown in Table 1.\n\n3. The model appears highly sensitive to threshold parameters $t$, with different thresholds set for each drug. This indicates that the model requires fine-grained hyperparameter tuning for each individual drug. In practice, this is a major limitation as it requires sufficient labeled data for each new drug to determine the optimal threshold, which contradicts the established goal of addressing the scarcity of clinical data.\n\n4. In the ablation study, removing either the AR or SN module leads to a significant performance drop. This suggests that using only one of these modules appears to be ineffective, whereas combining them yields considerable performance gains. This is unusual, and further experiments are needed to elucidate the interactions between these modules.\n\n5. The interpretability validation is insufficient. The interaction heatmap for Temozolomide is shown without deeper analysis of the underlying biological mechanisms, leaving the reader uncertain about the biological relevance of the findings.\n\n6.
