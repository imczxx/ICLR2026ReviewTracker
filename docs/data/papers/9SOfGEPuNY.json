In this paradigm, agents are initially trained on fixed datasets and subsequently refined through limited online interaction. However, this transition exposes a fundamental challenge: the misestimation of state-action values associated with out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, inherited from the offline phase. Such misestimations can severely destabilize online adaptation, leading to suboptimal policy behavior. To address this, we propose an algorithm-agnostic method that regularizes the Q-function prior to fine-tuning by injecting structured noise into dataset actions. This process explicitly bounds Q-value estimates across the entire action space, not just in-distribution actions, mitigating both overestimation and underestimation. We introduce a tunable parameter that governs the degree of conservatism and optimism within the Q-value bounds during the online fine-tuning phase. Extensive empirical evaluations on standard O2O RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method yields substantial improvements over strong baselines, both in terms of stability and final performance. These results underscore the importance of principled Q-function initialization and offer a practical path toward more robust reinforcement learning under distributional shift.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Offline-to-online RL", "Q-learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7bf6157235d24916218724d7c69e89d300d0a8d9.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new method, BOTO, for offline-to-online (O2O) reinforcement learning.

The core contribution is a regularization approach that injects structured noise into dataset actions during Q-learning prior to online fine-tuning. The authors formalize their approach through the α-Noisy Action MDP (α-NAMDP) framework, showing that their method corresponds to Q-learning in a modified MDP with a tunable bias parameter α that controls the degree of conservatism versus optimism in Q-value estimates. The method consists of three stages: (1) offline pre-training using standard offline RL algorithms, (2) BOTO training that optimizes the Q-function using action noise injection with a warmup dataset, and (3) online fine-tuning using standard online RL algorithms. Empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks (Antmaze, Kitchen, and Adroit domains) demonstrate that BOTO outperforms strong baselines including WSRL, CalQL, RLPD, CQL, and IQL by mitigating both underestimation and overestimation issues during the online fine-tuning phase."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "Principled theoretical framework:\nThe paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis by introducing the α-NAMDP formulation with two key theorems: Theorem 1 establishes equivalence between minimizing the proposed objective and Q-learning in the α-NAMDP, while Theorem 2 derives provable bounds on Q-values across the entire action space, including out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. This theoretical grounding distinguishes the work from heuristic approaches and provides formal guarantees on the boundedness of learned Q-functions.\n\nClear problem motivation and analysis: \nThe paper systematically analyzes the failure modes of Q-value misestimation in O2O RL, distinguishing between global underestimation, local underestimation, and overestimation scenarios. Figure 1 effectively illustrates these failure modes, and the discussion clearly articulates why existing methods suffer during online fine-tuning. This thorough problem characterization strengthens the motivation for the proposed solution.\n\nAlgorithm-agnostic design:\nBOTO is designed to work with any offline RL algorithm, which is demonstrated empirically through experiments combining BOTO with both CalQL and CQL as base methods. Table 1 shows consistent improvements regardless of the underlying offline algorithm, highlighting the generality and practical applicability of the approach. This flexibility is valuable for practitioners who may have existing offline RL pipelines.\n\nComprehensive experimental evaluation:\nThe empirical evaluation covers six benchmark tasks across multiple domains (Antmaze, Kitchen, Adroit) and compares against five strong baselines. The results consistently demonstrate that BOTO achieves faster adaptation and higher final performance, particularly in mitigating the \"unlearning\" phenomenon that causes performance drops at the onset of fine-tuning. The inclusion of standard error bars across five random seeds strengthens the reliability of the results.\n\nEffective visualization of the bounding mechanism:\nFigure 2 provides compelling visual evidence of how BOTO produces bounded Q-values across the action space compared to baseline methods (CQL, CalQL, IQL), clearly showing how different α values modulate the degree of conservatism and optimism. Figure 3 further validates the theoretical bounds derived in Theorem 2 against empirical results in a controlled bandit setting."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Limited novelty over prior work. The paper builds heavily on Oh & Lee (2025), extending the Noisy Action MDP to α-NAMDP by introducing a tunable parameter α. While this generalization provides useful control over bias, the core mechanism of action noise injection for Q-value bounding is not novel. The incremental nature of the contribution relative to the base NAMDP framework should be more explicitly acknowledged, and the paper would benefit from a more detailed comparison highlighting what specific advantages the α parameter provides beyond the original formulation.\n\nHyperparameter sensitivity not thoroughly addressed. The paper acknowledges that \"selecting an appropriate value for the bias controller may require tuning for specific environments\", but provides insufficient guidance on how to set α in practice. Table 2 shows that optimal α values vary substantially across tasks (ranging from -1.0 to 1.0), yet the paper lacks principled strategies for hyperparameter selection. The discretization interval of 0.1 across the range [-1, 1] requires evaluating 21 different values, which could be computationally expensive. A sensitivity analysis or adaptive selection method would strengthen the practical applicability.\n\nInsufficient ablation studies. The paper lacks important ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components. Specifically: (1) What is the individual contribution of the warmup phase versus the BOTO training objective? (2) How sensitive is performance to the warmup dataset size (Dwarmup)? (3) What is the impact of different noise distributions beyond the hybrid noise distribution adopted from Oh & Lee (2025)? (4) How does the BOTO training duration affect results? While Table 2 provides some hyperparameter values, systematic ablation studies would clarify which design choices are critical.\n\nLimited theoretical insights on α selection. While Theorems 1 and 2 characterize the learned Q-function under α-NAMDP, they do not provide guidance on how to choose α for a given task. The bounds in Theorem 2 depend on the reward function and value function, but it's unclear how these quantities can be estimated a priori to inform α selection. Developing a theoretical connection between task characteristics (e.g., sparsity of rewards, dataset quality) and optimal α values would significantly enhance the practical utility of the framework.\n\nMissing comparisons with recent methods. While the paper compares against several strong baselines, it omits comparisons with other recent O2O RL methods that also address Q-value estimation issues, such as SO2 (Zhang et al., 2024; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.07685) which uses perturbed value updates, or ENOTO (Zhao et al., 2024; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06871) which employs Q-ensembles. Including these comparisons would better position BOTO within the current landscape of O2O RL research."}, "questions": {"value": "Q1: How should α be selected in practice? Could the authors provide more principled guidance or an adaptive method for selecting α? For instance, could α be estimated based on properties of the offline dataset (e.g., coverage, quality, diversity) or initial Q-value statistics?\n\nQ2: How does BOTO perform on suboptimal or mixed-quality datasets? All experiments use standard D4RL datasets. How does BOTO behave when the offline dataset is of very poor quality or contains multi-modal behavior policies? Does the method provide robustness advantages in these more challenging scenarios?\n\nQ3: Why does BOTO use the offline dataset in addition to warmup data during BOTO training? The paper constructs DBOTO = D_offline ∪ D_warmup, but it's unclear why the offline dataset is retained during the BOTO training phase. What would happen if BOTO training used only D_warmup? Does this design choice relate to preventing distributional shift or maintaining coverage?\n\nQ4: Can the bounds in Theorem 2 be tightened? The bounds depend on the infimum and supremum over the support of the dataset distribution. In practice, are these bounds tight, or is there significant slack? Could empirical analysis on the benchmark tasks characterize how tight the bounds are in practice?\n\nQ5: How does BOTO compare to ensemble-based methods? Methods like ENOTO use Q-ensembles to address similar issues in O2O RL.
