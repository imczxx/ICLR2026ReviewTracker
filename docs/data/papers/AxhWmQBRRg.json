The RG, ARG, and OG algorithms require fewer complex calculations, i.e., on the gradients and projections per iteration. We prove that a convergence rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ and $O(1/T)$ can be reached by the RG and ARG algorithms with bounded action sets for convergent perturbed monotone games, respectively, if the sequence of time-varying games converges to the limit fast enough, without additional assumptions like strong monotonicity, and such a result matches and improves the existing results on similar algorithms requiring calculations on two gradients with different actions. Besides, a surprising result is also shown that the standard OG algorithm in time-varying games behaves dramatically differently from its variant and other similar algorithms: the standard OG algorithm converges in any sequences of time-varying monotone $L$-smooth games with a common Nash equilibrium, including some periodic games, while at the same time, its variant with a slight difference diverges exponentially even in periodic games.

The proofs are quite difficult to follow even with the proof sketches in the main body. Below I list some concerns, additional issues are listed in the questions section. \n\n**BAP** assumption\nThe paper uses the BAP assumption to quantify sufficient convergence in perturbed games. However, I've noticed that the assumption includes $\\mathcal{Z}$ is bounded meanwhile this is not used in other works such as Feng et al 2023. Furthermore, it is unclear what is meant by $\\max \\|G_t\\|$ is this supposed to mean $\\max_{z \\in \\mathcal{z}}\\|G_t(z)\\|$? I also cannot see this max in Feng et al 2023 nore in the cited works for the BAP condition. Finally, at several points in the paper the following claim is made:\n\n> Assumption 1 (BAP) implies $\\max\\|G_t\\| = O(\\frac{1}{t})$\n\nThis is used in line 1206 in Theorem 2 and line 1604 in Theorem 4. I do not see how the BAP summability assumption ($\\sum_{t}\\max\\|G_t\\| < \\infty$) implies a rate on the last term in the series, in general I think we need more information on the convergence rate.\n\n**BAP** assumption in Section 4.2\nOn top of the BAP assumption Theorem 4 assume the stronger condition $\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty t^2\\|G_t\\|< +\\infty$ but there is no discussion why we need this stronger assumption in the ARG case. Intuition or identifying technical challenges on why this case merits a stronger assumption would be helpful to understand the result in the broader context of the paper and existing work.\n\n**Bounded action sets**\nAll the convergence results (except maybe OG) require bounded action sets yet the divergence negative periodic game results are in the unbounded setting. Discussion on why bounded sets are necessary would be helpful especially when existing works such as Feng et al 2023 do not assume a bounded domain. How would the periodic results change if we were to assume a bounded domain? Additionally, the convergence proofs seem to heavily depend on the bounded domain whereas existing works do not need it, a discussion on this difference and potential limitations of the analysis could be helpful.\n\n**Missing steps and typos** There are quite a few missing steps and typos in the proofs.

However, its definition and motivation are confusing. Theorem 5 states it is created by modifying Line 5 of Algorithm 3 to use $F_{t+1}$ instead of $F_t$. Algorithm 3 (OG) uses $F_t$ to compute both $z_{t+1/2}$ (Line 4) and $z_{t+1}$ (Line 5). The modification $z_{t+1} = z_{t+1/2} + \\eta F_{t+1}(z_{t-1/2}) - \\eta F_{t+1}(z_{t+1/2})$ (based on and Algorithm 3) appears to require oracle access to the gradient function $F_{t+1}$ at time $t$.
