Yet, current game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets to adapt pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present Orak, a benchmark for training and evaluating LLM agents across 12 popular video games spanning all major genres. Using a plug-and-play interface built on Model Context Protocol (MCP), Orak supports systematic and reproducible studies of agentic modules in varied game scenarios. We further release a fine-tuning dataset of expert LLM gameplay trajectories spanning multiple genres, turning general LLMs into effective game agents. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, including game leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and in-depth analyses of input modality, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects, establishing a foundation towards versatile gaming agents.

The LLM field is currently flooded with a large number of fixed datasets, yet claiming to be “agentic” is clearly insufficient. ORAK covers a wide range of game genres, including action, adventure, role-playing, simulation, strategy, and puzzle games. This breadth ensures a holistic evaluation of LLM capabilities, from logical reasoning to spatial understanding and long-term planning. The use of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to integrate LLMs with game environments and agentic modules is a significant contribution. This modular approach enables plug-and-play experimentation and facilitates systematic studies of LLM behaviors in diverse scenarios. The release of expert gameplay trajectories across multiple genres is a valuable resource for the community. The dataset encapsulates meta-knowledge and demonstrates how fine-tuning can enhance LLM performance in both gaming and non-gaming tasks. The paper provides extensive experimental results, comparing proprietary and open-source LLMs across tasks and modalities. The insights into the effects of fine-tuning, visual inputs, and agentic strategies are particularly compelling.\n\nI strongly recommend acceptance of this paper. It makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM evaluation and training, offering a robust benchmark that bridges the gap between academic research and real-world applications. The paper is well-written, methodologically sound, and forward-looking, providing a solid foundation for future work in gaming AI and general-purpose LLMs. I particularly appreciate the authors' attention to detail in designing ORAK and their commitment to open science through the release of datasets and tools.\n\nThis work is not only timely but also highly impactful, and I believe it will become a key reference for researchers in the field."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "This paper still has some minor flaws, and I hope the authors will pay attention to the following issues.\n\n1.

This outcome is likely an artifact of the experimental design, where highly structured and pre-processed text provides a cleaner, more direct signal than raw visual data for current VLMs. A more accurate conclusion would be that under this specific setup, the models fail to extract sufficient value from visual inputs to overcome the noise, rather than a general indictment of visual modalities for gaming agents.\n\n\nQuestionable Design Choices in Benchmark and Data Generation:\n\n- The selection of games appears to be driven more by the availability of existing APIs or emulators (e.g., Mineflayer for Minecraft, PyBoy for Pokémon Red) rather than a principled selection of titles that would best probe the frontiers of AI capabilities. The benchmark lacks modern, complex 3D games that pose severe challenges in perception from raw pixels, physics-based interaction, and complex spatial reasoning.\n\n- The fine-tuning dataset is generated by an 'expert' LLM (GPT-4o), which fundamentally caps the potential performance of any fine-tuned model at the level of the teacher model. This methodology prevents the discovery of novel strategies that might surpass the teacher's capabilities and introduces the teacher's inherent biases and failure modes into the student models.\n\n- By selecting only the highest-scoring trajectories for the fine-tuning dataset, the authors introduce a strong survivorship bias. The models learn from 'perfect' or near-perfect executions ('sunny day' scenarios) but are not exposed to data on how to recover from mistakes, adapt to unexpected situations, or turn a losing game around. This is a critical omission for developing robust agents that can handle the stochasticity and adversity inherent in complex games."}, "questions": {"value": "The paper positions Orak as a foundational benchmark that pushes the boundaries of agent evaluation. However, the tasks often seem simplified through pre-processed states and high-level APIs, which might not establish a clear differentiation from prior work.\n\nCould the authors elaborate on the unique challenges Orak presents compared to existing agent benchmarks? The current results do not seem to establish a clear differentiation, as the main conclusions are largely echoes of findings from other domains.\nWhat specific agent capabilities are uniquely tested in Orak that are not adequately covered by prior benchmarks? A more compelling case could be made by showcasing a task where top-performing agents from other domains systematically fail due to a game-specific challenge that Orak is specifically designed to evaluate. For instance, is there a scenario that rigorously tests an agent's ability to reason under partial observability from raw signals, a core challenge in many games?\n\nI'm willing to increase my score if the author can answer my question."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "LRQIYlv7Ha", "forum": "H1ncX6O6Yh", "replyto": "H1ncX6O6Yh", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15134/Reviewer_Cdp1"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15134/Reviewer_Cdp1"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15134/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761980317235, "cdate": 1761980317235, "tmdate": 1762925450334, "mdate": 1762925450334, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Orak, a benchmark and dataset for evaluating foundation models in dynamic digital games scenarios.

Mostly regarding analysis of the results and the rationale for some of its design aspects.\n\nThe manuscript claims \"in-depth analyses of input modality, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects\", but falls a bit short of this challenging goal. It does provide some interesting insights, but doesn't really go deep into either of the 3 areas. Having said that, the platform itself is already of great value and can be used as a strong base for further evaluation and analysis. Toning down such claims still leaves the rest of Orak as solid work.\n \nRegarding input modalities, Orak emphasizes pre-extraction of game state information and textual representation of such data. This both; i) greatly reduces the challenges of observation/state/world understanding and already bias results to text; and ii) muddles the analysis of providing different modalities later which then also needs to deal with potential conflicts in different modalities and in some models seemingly having preference for specific modalities. Also known issues previously discussed in the literature.\n\nThe presented ablation for agentic modules is interesting as a high-level overview, but its results as presented are not well discussed and don't show significant insights. The analysis here could go much more in-depth in future work.  \n\nThe LLM finetuning experiment and resutls are not in-depth and only take a quick look at 1 foundation model in 2 small sizes, where the benefits of SFT with any data would already provide the most benefit. The paper would benefit from a more detailed analysis of dataset quality and what/how it actually contributes during training, as well as any possible insights into data scalling.\n\nHowever, the main limitation of Orak as a platform is the lack of functionality to properly evaluate grounding of actions, as each game action space has been manualy defined differently and already mapped to high-level functions that heavily abstract and simplify the problem. Though, the platform could be easily modified to offer a full pixel-to-keyboard/mouse-commands interface that fully exposes complexity and allow uses to benchmark at different levels."}, "questions": {"value": "I don't think the games industry itself is the main beneficiary of such benchmarking effort.

Why? I'd argue that understanding of visual observations is exactly the most important area where games can help as benchmark for foudnaiton model capabilties.\n\nIn the Arena setting results, why exactly was Starcraft evaluated with one less model than Street Fighter? \n\nAlso, critically, do you have any insights on why Minitron-8B performs so much better than in full results?
