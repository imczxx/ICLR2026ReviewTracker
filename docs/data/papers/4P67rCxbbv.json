We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence. Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants with various scales demonstrate that SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SEAFormer is the first neural method to solve 1,000+ node RWVRPs effectively, while also achieving superior performance on classic VRPs, making it a versatile solution for both research benchmarks and real-world applications.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Vehicle Routing Problem", "Real-world contraints", "Optimization"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/870d97eafe0c0d1f1862f4d0826e06d581a2d23b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/735b8deab521bf71f12af07b6a101089333175d3.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces SEAFormer, a scalable and edge-aware transformer designed for real-world vehicle routing problems (RWVRPs).

However, the authors do not discuss the boundary condition where R *M > n, in which case O(nRM) would not hold. A rigorous theoretical analysis is encouraged.\n\n2. Insufficient Analytical Justification: The paper lacks rigorous analytical evidence to explain the source of its strong empirical performance. It remains unclear whether the \"scalability\" arises purely from the O(n) complexity of CPA or from a stabilizing interaction between CPA and the EAM. Consequently, the originality of the contribution is difficult to evaluate, as the authors do not convincingly demonstrate why their domain-specific “polar clustering” is essential, or whether comparable gains could be achieved using a generic O(n) sparse attention mechanism.\n\n3. In the Related Work section, the author discusses the limitations of existing studies, but does not clearly explain how the proposed method addresses or overcomes these limitations.\n\n4.

The definition of “real-world VRP” is broad, and it is unclear what specific challenges are being addressed. Although variants like VRPTW and EVRPCS are mentioned, the paper lacks a clear explanation of why existing methods cannot be extended to these variants. The motivations behind CPA and the edge-aware module are more engineering-oriented, with little exploration of the underlying theoretical mechanisms.\n2. The CPA approach lacks clear innovation when compared to existing local attention or sparse attention mechanisms. The paper should clarify how CPA offers distinct advantages over these existing approaches.\n3. The paper does not sufficiently distinguish its contributions from previous work that modifies attention mechanisms with distance (such as [1-5]). A clearer explanation of how SEAFormer differs would strengthen the novelty claim.\n4. The statement “SEAFormer is the first unified approach to address this comprehensive range of real-world routing constraints at scales within a single architecture” seems exaggerated, as there are other works that have addressed real-world VRPs, and it is unclear what makes this method the “first”.\n5. The deterministic multi-round partitioning and boundary smoothing in CPA seem empirical, without solid theoretical justification or quantitative analysis on the trade-off between complexity and performance.\n6. The edge embedding module only works for certain edges (depot-customer), raising concerns about potential information loss across the full graph. The paper should explore whether this limitation affects overall solution quality.\n7. Some RWVRP variants, like EVRPCS and VRPRS, are compared with a limited number of learning-based methods. In addition, stronger baseline traditional algorithms, such as HGS, are not considered in many variants.\n8. There is no in-depth comparison with existing methods on model parameters, training time, or inference time, which are critical for real-world applications.\n9.
