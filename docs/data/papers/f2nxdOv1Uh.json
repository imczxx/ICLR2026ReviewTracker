While end-to-end autonomous driving technologies have advanced substantially, generating safe and diverse multimodal trajectories poses a persistent hurdle. In recent years, diffusion-based methods have demonstrated remarkable potential across image generation, robotics, and autonomous driving—with trajectory generation approaches based on diffusion models also emerging. However, balancing real-time performance and reconstruction accuracy remains an unresolved issue. To address these limitations, we propose MTG-RPD, an innovative trajectory generation method that integrates rule-based prior knowledge. The approach first generates trajectory anchor points via rule-based prior clustering, then leverages a conditional diffusion model to transform an anchored Gaussian distribution into a multimodal trajectory distribution under scene information guidance. Notably, the diffusion model is specifically designed to facilitate agent-agent and agent-environment interactions. On the planning-based NAVSIM dataset, MTG-RPD achieved a PDMS of 88.5 when evaluated using the ResNet-34 backbone network.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["End-to-end Autonomous Driving", "Trajectory Planning"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/61d146f51dedad9b2baeef9a0b61e84d98a457fe.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper aims to design a diffusion-based framework for autonomous driving trajectory predictions to generate multimodal trajectories and improve trajectory planning by integrating rule-based prior knowledge.

It is better to give a definition to what the anchored Gaussian distributions and anchor sampling refer to. They are not common terminologies to me until I went through DiffusionDrive paper. \n2. Authors claim that they design a diffusion model that supports interactions between agents and between agents and the environment. I do not quite see the novelty from this. This is a standard conditional diffusion step and it has been done in DiffusionDrive too. That is how the backbone of this proposed method is borrowed from DiffusionDrive. The only difference thing I can spot is the sparse deformable attention, and this is from deformable DETR [1], which is not cited by the paper. \n3. For the rule-based prior trajectory anchor generation, the paper only briefly talks about before doing k-mean clustering, they rebalance the dataset spatially by downsampling the significance of trajectories from higher-frequented regions and elevating the lower-frequented regions. No detail is given about how to perform this and the time cost. No drawback is discussed about the rebalance: this might lead to distribution shift between anchors and real driving data and the real patterns might be overrepresented. It could also result in a misalignment between training and test-time distribution as you will not be able to rebalance the test-time distribution.\n4. Samples that show the proposed method are very limited. Even though the table 1 reports the results from the other methods, but the visualizations are only on DiffusionDrive to compare.\n\n[1] Zhu X, Su W, Lu L, Li B, Wang X, Dai J.

In figure 4 the third column, which shows the results from MTG-RPD, from my understanding, the orange linked dots as planned trajectories for different scenarios show very different behaviours compared to the ground truth represented by green linked dots. The vehicle in the first scene is going straight and appears going off-road, which is supposed to take a proper right turn. Same happens in the other two scenes, where the planned trajectories are not aligned with lanes. In my view, the results might be a bit better than DiffusionDrive, but it is not realistic enough to show MTG-RPD really works.\n2. any discussions about the issues resulted from rebalance from the weaknesses I mentioned?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "2QEAfYgmki", "forum": "f2nxdOv1Uh", "replyto": "f2nxdOv1Uh", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9429/Reviewer_Ka77"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9429/Reviewer_Ka77"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9429/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761808359970, "cdate": 1761808359970, "tmdate": 1762921027930, "mdate": 1762921027930, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MTG-RPD, an innovative trajectory generation method that integrates rule-based prior knowledge for end-to-end autonoumous driving."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.
