Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is widely used for visual explanations in computer vision, but improving its interpretability remains an open research area. In this work, we introduce MI-Grad-CAM, a novel post-hoc visual explanation method that provides clearer, causally-driven insights into how CNNs reach their conclusions by prioritizing causality over mere correlation. MI-Grad-CAM generates class-specific visualizations by weighting feature maps based on normalized mutual information between the input image and feature maps, combined with gradient information of the predicted class with respect to these feature maps. This approach strengthens the causal link between explanations and model predictions, supported by counterfactual analysis to verify causality. We also propose the Harmonized Confidence Index (HCI), a new evaluation metric to measure explanation effectiveness.

The abstract states \"Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is widely used for visual explanations in computer vision, but improving its interpretability remains an open research area.\".\nHowever:\n* CAM-based methods have known fundamental limitations: \"CAM-Based Methods Can See through Walls\" (Taimeskhanov et al., 2024).\n* CAM-based methods aren't considered SOTA. For instance, in \"CLEVR-XAI: A benchmark dataset for the ground truth evaluation of neural network explanations\" (Arras et al., 2021), Grad-CAM is the worst XAI method among those evaluated.\n* Also for ViTs, better methods exist: \"Transformer Interpretability Beyond Attention Visualization\" (Chefer et al., 2021)\\\nTherefore, the significance of improving an already-limited method family is questionable.\n2. The paper claims to produce \"causal\" explanations but provides insufficient theoretical justification. MI alone is a statistical dependency measure, not a causal measure. Counterfactual analysis (Section 4.6) shows sensitivity to perturbations, but this demonstrates correlation with input changes, not causality in the causal inference sense. References to do-calculus (Definition 2) seem a bit random and are not properly connected to the proposed method. In my opinion it is \"more informative\" or \"input-grounded\" rather than \"causal\".\n3. In Section 2.4 you write \"The activation $A_{l-1}^k$ captures all relevant information from the input $X$ needed to determine $A_l^k$.\" But it doesn't hold for, for instance, resnet architecture which uses skip connections?\n4. Appendix A.1's \"proof\" is more intuitive argument than rigorous mathematics.\n5. Converting RGB to grayscale loses color information that may be discriminative. In Appendix A.8.5 you provide few examples and claim \"negligible degradation,\" but there are no quantitative results provided to support this.\n6. MI Implementation is not described (see Questions).\n7. Cherry-picking concern - Visual examples appear favorable to the proposed method. An analysis and examples of failure cases are missing.\n8. Main experiment uses only 2000 ImageNet samples. Broader evaluation on diverse datasets (other natural images, medical imaging, etc.) would strengthen claims.\n\nMinor issues:\n1. In Algorithm 1. line 13. $A_l^k$ is probably used in a form before transformations from line 5 and 6, but the notation is the same as in these lines, which may be a little confusing.\n2. In Figure 1. last activation map $A_l^k$ is different before mutual information (top part) and within MI calculations (bottom right part). Shouldn't they be the same?"}, "questions": {"value": "1. How exactly do you define causality in your context? Can you provide a formal connection between MI (a statistical dependency measure) and causal inference frameworks? This is central to your claims.\n2. Section 2.4 claims conditional independence in CNNs, but skip connections in ResNet and concatenations in DenseNet explicitly violate this assumption. How does this affect your theoretical justification?\n3. Your work is lacking limitations section. Please include it.\n4. In the code you use sklearn.metrics.mutual_info_score. Isn't it designed for categorical data? How do you handle continuous activation values? If binning is used, what is the binning strategy, number of bins, and sensitivity to this choice?\nCan you provide an ablation study on these parameters?\nWhy not use continuous MI estimators (e.g., KDE-based, neural estimators)?\n5. Can you provide quantitative results (AD/AI/HCI scores) comparing: current approach (grayscale) and no grayscaling (compute MI between 3-channel input and feature maps while replicating channels)?\n6. How does MI-Grad-CAM compare to more recent XAI methods beyond CAM variants?

The authors are encouraged to report metrics related to these dimensions as well. The Quantus toolkit (JMLR 2023) provides a comprehensive suite of such metrics and could be used for this purpose. Additionally, the authors are encouraged to evaluate their method on the FunnyBirds benchmark (Hesse et al., CVPR 2023), which includes ground-truth part-level annotations and is designed to test explanatory power beyond saliency heatmaps. Moreover, the paper only compares against CAM-based methods, which limits its scope. There is no evaluation against other major families of explanation methods, including erturbation-based methods e.g., Extremal Perturbations (Fong et al., ICCV 2019), path integration methods: e.g., IG, surrogate models: e.g., LIME, gradient-free methods: e.g., RISE. Also no comparison against traditional SHAP based moehods, and no comparison against explantaion methods designed fro transformer architectures such as T-ATTR/GAE (Chefer et al. ICCV 2021), and missing comparison against more recent methods (latest method is score-CAM) such as IIA (ICCV 2023) and AttnLRP (ICML 2024). Also, the paper does not explore recent convolutional architectures such as ConvNeXt, which could provide insight into the method's applicability to SOTA CNN models. The evaluation for transformer-based models is limited as well. Beyond the single architecture (ViT-B), no additional transformer variants are tested. \n\n-  The reviewer could not find insertion/deletion metric results reported for ViT. Why were these metrics reported only for CNNs? This omission raises concerns about the completeness and fairness of the evaluation. If MI-GRAD-CAM is claimed to be architecture-agnostic, it is essential to assess it under the same evaluation criteria across both CNNs and transformers.\n\n- AD/AI/HCI rely on thresholding and sample-level aggregates on a 2k ImageNet subset. Without CIs or threshold sweeps, itis  unclear whether improvements are statistically robust. \n\nMinor:\n\n- It would be helpful to include a dedicated related work section that clearly contrasts and contextualizes the proposed method against other prominent explainability approaches, particularly those mentioned in the first weakness bullet (e.g., perturbation-based, path integration, surrogate-based, and gradient-free methods). This would not only improve the positioning of the work within the broader XAI landscape, but also clarify its novelty, contributions, and limitations relative to existing techniques. Specifically, the authors are encouraged to compare their method to approaches from other families (beyond CAM-based methods) in terms of computational complexity and runtime, both of which are critical for assessing the practical utility and scalability of explainability techniques.\n\n- Deployment often requires fast explanations. being slower than Grad-CAM/++ and Eigen-CAM limits practical adoption, even if faster than Score-CAM."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the weaknesses section.
