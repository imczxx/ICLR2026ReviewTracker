The authors explicitly state they are \"not actually\" implementing any of these theories rigorously, suggesting design-by-analogy rather than derivation from first principles and it also raises the question of why these frameworks are invoked at all.\n\n- I found the collaborative movie adaptation analogy in Section 3 unhelpful and it made the technical content hard to parse. My understanding is that the proposed FERN model consists of two components:\n   - **Encoder:** Despite being framed as \"adapted ANF,\" this is simply a bidirectional coupling network that iteratively refines x and z ~ N(0,I) as follows: For i = 1…5: $z \\leftarrow s^*(x) \\odot z + t(x)$, $x \\leftarrow s^*(z) \\odot x + t(z)$. This mapping lacks the fundamental properties of normalizing flows and I don't see any clear benefit from the ANF framing. \n  - **Ellipsoidal Transport:** The prediction is computed as: $y^* = U(z) K \\Lambda (z) K^T U(z)^T y_0 + t(z)$, where $y_0 ~ N(0,I)$. This is a structured linear transformation of Gaussian noise, conditioned on z. The optimal transport framing does not provide any meaningful insight since there is no transport problem being solved, no source/target distributions, and no transport cost. The Brenier theorem citation is irrelevant since this is supervised learning with MSE loss, not measure transportation. The SPSD structure merely constrains the linear map's form but doesn't make it an OT map.\n\n  In summary, FERN essentially learns a nonlinear mapping from input x to parameters of an affine transformation applied to Gaussian noise, trained with standard MSE loss. The extensive discussion of ellipsoids, optimal transport, and Koopman theory obscures rather than illuminates this simple architecture. The actual contribution appears to be the specific parameterization choices that is shown to work well empirically on chaotic systems, not any deep connection to the invoked mathematical frameworks. \n\n- I was unable to find a formal definition of local conditional geometry and it was not clear to me if the ellipsoids refer to conditional distributions or prediction sets or second-moment approximations.\n\n- The paper does not include a conclusions section and ends abruptly with the numerical studies. \n\n- The results for chaotic systems are impressive. However, the discussion of results needs more depth. For instance, it was not clear what happens beyond a few Lyapunov times where pointwise prediction is theoretically impossible."}, "questions": {"value": "- Please formally define what \"local conditional geometry” means in the context of this work.\n- Section 3.2 provides a W2 bound; however, here deterministic predictions are being made and not distribution matching.
