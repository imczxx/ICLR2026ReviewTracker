To address this challenge, we introduce Fleming-R1, a model designed for verifiable medical reasoning through three complementary innovations. First, our Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third, we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple accuracy optimization. We release Fleming-R1 publicly to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI, enabling safer deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["LLMs", "Reinforcement Learning", "Medical Reasoning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/93eaf53318d804a23dbac3430d8d23caa08d2a66.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduced Fleming-R1, a model post-trained for medical reasoning.

Any manual verification by medical experts/practitioners?  \nW2: Can you give a real example in your synthesized questions to show that it actually asks for a diagnosis given symptoms and lab results (the example in Lines 223 to 226)?  \nW3: Generating medical QA based on masked subgraphs is more like an enhanced way to memorize medical knowledge, instead of boosting the reasoning capability as described in Line 222 [see results in Physics of Language Models: Part 3.1, Knowledge Storage and Extraction].  \nW4: In Line 233, the filtering is based on whether GPT-4 can answer the question across five trials. However, even if an SOTA model answers the question correctly, it does not necessarily mean that this label is correct. It could be that the SOTA model is wrong.  \nW5: The first half of Section 3.3 is merely an application of the existing GRPO algorithm. It is more precise to frame it as a preliminary.  \nW6: In the second phase of the RL curriculum learning in Section 3.3, if the model repeatedly fails on some questions during RL training, it usually means that the model lacks the relevant knowledge during its pretraining. I doubt if repeated RL training on these failed questions, even with more rollouts, can actually help. Can you provide some examples to show that this setup actually works?  \nW7: There are not enough details on the training setup, e.g., learning rate, optimizer, size of training data at each stage, compute budget, etc.  \nW8: Since one of the key motivations described in the introduction is that we need not only a correct answer but also correct reasoning paths for medical tasks, can you provide any evaluation (including manual verification by medical practitioners/experts) on the correctness of the reasoning paths generated by Fleming-R1?

For example, how are the graph masked for the synthetic data generation? Is there an algorithm to decide what to mask and is there a constant masking ratio? How do you use LLM to classify the questions into Easy, Moderate, and Difficult? For the training, how did you refine the training distribution iteratively?\n3. *Limitation on problem setup*: The model was trained intensively on question answering problem, which may make the model specialized on QA but lose general capabilities.  It would be interesting if the authors can demonstrate that the model can still be used as general-purposes model that can be used for non-QA medical problems.

The contributions here seem confined to minor refinements, such as long-tail data augmentation via Wikipedia graphs, lacking transformative innovation.\n- Reward Design Risks: While GRPO is effective, the rewards focus solely on correctness and format, potentially leading to superficial reasoning or reward hacking, which is underexplored compared to multi-objective approaches in similar papers. Considering that the medical domain has a much lower tolerance for errors in chain-of-thought reasoning, this limitation becomes even more critical.\n- Lack of Fine-Grained Ablations for Individual Components: Although the paper highlights the importance of long-tail knowledge in the medical domain and introduces a knowledge-graph-based approach (RODS) for synthesizing such data, it lacks detailed ablation studies to demonstrate the specific contribution of this component. For instance, experiments on benchmarks that emphasize long-tail characteristics, accompanied by in-depth data analysis, or well-designed ablations isolating RODS’s synthesis strategies, would more convincingly validate its effectiveness.
