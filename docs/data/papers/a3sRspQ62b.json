Not clear to me if we do not just trade-off low for high frequency components.\n- Theoretic standpoint on spectral bias: Even though diffusion and in my opinion also flow matching models favour low and high frequency features at different \"timepoints\", it does not necessarily imply a problem. In fact, this can actually help the modelling of the different features, arguably a reason why they perform very well on many tasks. Note for example that within the modelling of complex systems there exist a lot of models which also explicitly separate those levels in hierarchical models. \n- Further, the theoretic results are limited in generality. Theorem 4.1 is intuitive and essentially follows from assuming a power-law spectrum for x̂_0(ω) and that diffusion noise variance is frequency-independent. The novelty of this theorem is limited: the argument is not surprising and relies on strong assumptions (power law PSD) that may not hold uniformly across datasets.

As the authors have chosen to resubmit this paper with only marginal changes (by pdfdiff analysis) I permit myself to recycle my old review. I apologise if this causes minor inconsistencies. But it seems inadequate to me that a paper that despite the work that previous referees have put into their reviews, essentially nothing has changed.\n\nThe authors propose an architecture for learning turbulent flow with data generated from numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation as given by some examples picked from The Well and PDEbench. The authors here combine flow matching as a generative model with their architecture for the underlying neural network. The two key components are described as follows. On the one hand there is one branch that is based on the differential attention formalism proposed in [12]. In this branch there is a modeled separation of of low and high frequencies, called attention 1 and 2. The information from these branches is then added and weighted with a parameter. On the other hand, there is a fourier mixing branch network which has FNO-like layers where there is one weight transformation for all modes which is scaled up with some polynomial of the (norm of) the wave vector. Both streams are added up with a learnable, adaptive weighting. In their theoretical analysis, the authors claim there is a fundamental problem for diffusion architectures to reproduce small spatial details of fluid configurations. To substantiate this claim, the authors analyze the signal to noise ratio of the spatial image over the time of noising in the forward direction of a diffusion process. As the applied noise is 'spatially white' all modes are hit by noise in Fourier space of the same size. The authors then assume that the initial conditions fulfill a power law decay in frequency space, which is reasonable for turbulent flow. The signal to noise ratio for each mode can now be computed explicitly and it is shown that the suppressed - higher - spatial modes get a high signal to noise ration earlier. The authors propose, that their flow matching based approach with the one branch that can resolve high frequencies better due to the upscaling of weight sensitivity with the mode vector. While this is not supported with a theoretical analysis, the authors offer three empirical studies for the compressible Navier Stokes equation with different mach numbers. The main evaluation is on initial conditions from the training data set, while the generalization to unseen initial data is a separate study for different values of the viscosity. In their evaluation based on residuals (MSE) and the maximum error, the authors find in almost all cases an reduced MSE compared to various baselines. The authors also provide an ablation study on the effectiveness of their single modules."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "+ The paper suggests a new architecture for flow matching (FM) based generation of solutions to the Navier Stokes equation\n    + The numerical evaluation gives visually decent results and the comparison with a large number of other operator learning frameworks shows mostly superior results.\n    + The code will be released in the case of acceptance making the results reproducible"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "My main criticism against the paper is the way it is prepared. It absolutely lacks precision and puts wordy descriptions in the place of clear scientific arguments supported by facts. To give some examples: There are words like \"external representation space\" in the section 3.3 where the meaning is never explained, in the context of physics the authors speak about \"semantically meaningful [...] features\" or the \"common mode signal\" which's Wikipaedia definition is clearly (completely) out of context, finally calling the rot operator spatial differential is unnecessarily complicated. I believe that this paper has a considerable and respectable technical core (see strengths). It is a pity that the preparation is so poor.\n    Not unrelated, Theorem 1 and the supporting lemmas does not really contribute to the understanding why the model proposed by the authors should be more effective that a diffusion based generative model. The authors argue that in the diffusion noising, high frequencies modes are noised faster (if one accepts the spectral power law for the initial conditions). But that of course does not imply that these modes will be badely reconstructed during generation, but just that the backward process generates them last, which is just as it supposed to be. To make a theoretical problem out of this in my eyes is unfounded. The mathematical argument itself (not the interpretation) is ok and is based on standard arguments of the Itô calculus. The mathematical originality of this part is low.\n    The notation in the theoretical part and Appendix F is very hard to follow. The authors should concisely define the spatial Fourier transform with which they work at least in the appendix and explain their discretization to FFT. Lemmas 1-3 are standard and stuff from stochastic analysis and should rather be in the appendix.\n    In the evaluation, a residual based analysis in a chaotic setting over longer time spans makes little sense. It would be good if this evaluation could be complemented by comparing statistical flow features like power spectra of spatial and temporal correlations, which would be a good additional to the motivation of the paper.\n    The most general version of PDE in the preliminary part is unnecessary, the explanation of the flow matching approach is largely incomprehensible and in many details inaccurate."}, "questions": {"value": "* Figure 3 to me is very confusing.

Where do you see a serious problem in following this route?\n* Why the generalization over initial conditions is not more in the focus? This is the real application case.
