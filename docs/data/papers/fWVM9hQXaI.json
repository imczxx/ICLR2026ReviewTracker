The method integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with domain adversarial training to learn both direct and spillover effects without relying on a predefined exposure mapping.

HINet addresses this challenge by learning balanced, treatment-invariant node representations that mitigate such bias.

For instance, the adversarial training framework is not clearly defined or formalized, and the notion of covariate shift in networks is not explicitly characterized. The relationship between network homophily and covariate shift also requires further mathematical clarification to support the proposed intuition.\n\n- The algorithmic presentation omits some important implementation details. In particular, the paper does not clearly describe how representation balancing is adapted to the network structure, how the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) contributes to maximizing representational capacity, or how the model is trained and optimized in practice.\n\n- The paper provides no theoretical analysis to support the empirical findings. Given that the method builds on counterfactual representation learning, it would be valuable to theoretically justify how balanced representations improve generalization in networked settings. Furthermore, since the exposure mapping is assumed to exist and is learned from data, the paper should discuss whether the mapping can be consistently or accurately identified, and how misspecification might introduce bias in treatment effect estimation."}, "questions": {"value": "### Extra Questions on Experiments\n\n- In the ablation study, removing the balancing component (setting $\\alpha = 0$) occasionally results in slightly worse performance, but not consistently across datasets.

Could the authors provide additional intuition or visual evidence illustrating how homophilous connections influence estimation error in practice?\n\n- It would also be informative to assess how HINet performs under different network structures. Specifically, how does the model behave when the graph becomes extremely sparse or dense?

More discussions regarding this could improve the motivation.\n\n3. The results in Tables 5 and 11 are questionable. GCN usually achieves promising performance in node classification.

It would be better to analyze the statistical properties of the proposed method, such as the convergence, consistency, or unbiasedness, which are helpful to verify the advantage from a theoretical perspective.\n\n6.
