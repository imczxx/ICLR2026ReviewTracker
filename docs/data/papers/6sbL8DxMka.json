Comorbidity is believed to arise from genetic mutations functionally connected through protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within the human interactome. Unraveling these intricate PPI networks is essential for understanding disease progression and addressing the challenges posed by comorbid conditions. In this study, we propose a novel Gated Graph Attention Network (GGAT) framework tailored for disease comorbidity prediction by addressing issues that hinder the existing methods via three key aspects: (1) applying attention over local neighbors rather than global pairwise attention among all protein nodes, enabling more biologically meaningful aggregation; (2) incorporating a gating mechanism to adaptively regulate information flow and enhance representation learning for comorbidity prediction; and (3) introducing a multichannel fusion strategy that integrates connectivity based and disease association based embeddings, both of which have been shown to be important for disease comorbidity prediction. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that GGAT significantly outperforms the Transformer baselines across all metrics (AUROC, AUPRC, accuracy, and MCC), with the multichannel gated fusion variant achieving the best overall performance. These findings highlight the importance of integrating complementary biological features through graph structure and indicate that the proposed GGAT provides a generalizable graph learning framework applicable beyond disease comorbidity prediction.", "tldr": "We propose Gated Graph Attention Networks with multichannel fusion to integrate connectivity and disease association information in protein interaction networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in disease comorbidity prediction.", "keywords": ["Multichannel fusion", "Gating mechanisms", "Graph attention networks", "Graph neural networks", "Disease comorbidity", "Human interactome", "Protein–protein interaction networks"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/452fcb464feca40c2605c853d70dd4d787d0c679.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a gated graph attention network (GGAT)  that predicts disease comorbidity using human protein-protein interaction graphs. GGAT utilize GAT layers to define attention based neighbor information aggragation.

Each protein has 2 types of initial embeddings, one connectivity embedding resulting from Node2vec with randomwalk on PPI network and one disease-association embedding resulting from Label2vec. The model combines these 2 embeddings with 2 different fusion model:EmbedFusion for early fusion, where it merges them into one embedding then they run GGAT or GatedFusion for late fusion, where it runs a GGAT for each type (in parallel)  then use a learned gate to fuse them into one embedding. To predict the comorbidity for a disease pair, the model gets the proteins linked to each one of the diseases and produce a disease-pair embedding using adaptive pooling, which is passed to a MLP classifier to output the probability of the 2 diseases being comorbid.

PPI interaction itself is a quite sparse, context dependent, and undirected network that fails to capture the complete etiological landscape.\n2) Comorbidity arises from multilayer determinant features like genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, metabolic, immune, environmental stress and clinical. Apart from that longitudinal EHR data combined with pathway, regulatory, and phenotypic networks are crucial to incorporate with cohort specific PPI data.\n3) The rationale of the proposed work is so naive as the incompleteness in PPI and over-represented well studied disease-associated proteins only give bias to the outcomes.\n4) Relying on a Gated mechanism to “let-in” the most crucial features from the past information risks encoding temporal and modality bias: as the learned attention may overweight that are plentiful in the training graph, i.e., typically PPI topology and disease-associations while ignoring the heterogeneous context specific determinants of comorbidity (e.g., age, sex, medication, immune-state etc.).\n5) As comorbidity is multi-causal and context dependent, so attention restricted to PPI and its well known disease association can yield spuriously high edge weights for well-studied protein-disease associations. To mitigate these, the authors should introduce multi-channel fusion on heterogeneous modalities explicitly, limit the attention to reflect recency context and causal plausibility.\n6) The learned gate over multiple modality can well decide the crucial information to let in the model. That lacks the proposed work.\n7) Node2vec embedding with protein-disease association mostly encodes PPI topology and disease-wise co-occurrence, thereby overemphasizing the popular hubs and homophily while ignoring context, directionality, clinical, and environmental stressors - an approach is too naive for the mechanistic complexity of disease comorbidity. Hence, making such embeddings too naive to predict comorbidity beyond superficial network co-localization.\n8) The proposed work appears to equate comorbidity “robustness” with relative-risk weighted links between disease pairs. However, RR is a marginal, prevalence dependent association that (i) is even confounded by multi-dimensional factors like age, sex, treatments etc. (ii) is also vulnerable to Berkson’s bias, Simpson’s paradox, (iii) it lacks directionality and temporality (onset order lag), and (iv) unstable across hospitals, period, and sub-populations. Using RR as the sole input network risks mistaking exposure patterns for biology and overstates pair “robustness” without causal adjustment or tune-to-event modeling."}, "questions": {"value": "1) Disease comorbidity prediction is a well studied problem, which is not only associated with genetic mutations and only PPI information never able to give insight to address the fact too.

But the authors are quite naive into their literature survey. The literature survey should be expanded.\n\n4) Under sec. 3.1 how the authors design the attention pooling on which information perspectives? \n\n5) How the \"simple node2vec random path\" and \"protein-disease\" association set can give most effective information in embedding learning, as it only provides PPI based topological and disease stratified protein information, which quite naive to define the complex trait of comorbid diseases?\n\n6) from line 233-244, how do the authors think of letting entry be the most important feature to incorporate from the past information using the GATED approach ? As, there is plausible bias present in their embeddings to get learned from past (only) protein topological sequences and disease associations, as comorbidity depends on multiple heterogeneous factors.\n\n7) In line 285. what are the different biological signals?\n\n8) node2vec treats graph as a homogeneous one, hence it captures the PPI-based node-node connectivity information only, which is never a confirmatory way to give insights about novel comorbid diseases.\n\n9) In line 319. how do the authors explain the reliability and robustness of the complementary information?\n\n10) How do authors define the disease-disease pair robustness with relative risk scores only?\n\n11) Heterogeneous biological signals can never be accumulated from PPI and disease association information only.
