The paper claims (L414–415) to be “the first architecture capable of jointly generating both circuit topologies and device features.”\nThis is an overclaim, as prior work such as DiffCkt and CktGen [1] has already demonstrated a diffusion-based framework for joint topology-sizing generation.\nIt seems that the key difference of this work compared to CktGen is that CktGen is a variational autoencoder (VAE) model, while CircuitFlow is based on flow matching.\nSection 5.2 does not compare against such state-of-the-art methods, which weakens the experimental credibility and makes it difficult to assess the claimed advantage of the proposed model. \n\n[1] CktGen: Specification-Conditioned Analog Circuit Generation, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00995\n\n\n2. In Section 5.2, the sizing experiment is underspecified. The training objective maximizes the log-likelihood of device sizes (i.e., matches the dataset distribution), which does not imply performance optimization (gain/pm/ugf) unless the dataset distribution is itself optimal. Evaluation only compares against “data values” and uses a t-SNE plot without defining baseline sampling ranges or reporting quantitative metrics (e.g., validity rate, pass rate with thresholds, Wasserstein/MMD distance, or confidence intervals).\nThe claim that generated sizes serve as strong BO/GA initialization points is not supported by controlled downstream experiments.\n\n3. Lack of sufficient evidence in the transistor-level experiment. Although Section 5.3 is described as “transistor-level topology generation,” the experiment does not include device sizing, despite the paper’s end-to-end claim.\nThe reported metrics (V.U.N., validity similarity, uniqueness, novelty, etc.) primarily measure structural diversity and do not demonstrate the functional quality of the generated circuits after sizing or simulation. Thus, the results cannot substantiate the practical utility of the generated designs.\n\n4. Across all experiments, the generation process is not conditioned on circuit performance or design specifications.\nFor analog front-end design, this significantly limits real-world relevance; generating structurally valid circuits does not imply generating high-quality, spec-satisfying circuits. \nThe absence of performance-driven evaluation weakens the overall contribution and restricts the framework’s applicability to practical analog design tasks.\n\n5.

The only new mechanism claimed is the per-dimension time scheduling. This looks like an incremental extension of the standard factorized noise assumption, not a fundamentally new objective, and it is currently oversold.\n\n(2) **No ablation for the claimed contribution.**\nThere is no experiment showing that per-dimension time scheduling actually matters. We need a direct comparison against:\n\n(A) single global time for all dimensions,\n\n(B) per-modality time (one for topology, one for sizing),\n\n(C) the proposed per-dimension time (one per node/edge/parameter).\n\n\n(3) **Architecture underspecified:** \nThe paper does not clearly explain how the model enforces circuit legality:\n\n(3.1) how illegal device types / pin assignments are prevented,\n\n(3.2) how symmetric structures (current mirrors, differential pairs) are handled,\n\n(3.3) how the second-stage pin assignment module works at inference.\n\nThese constraints are central to analog design and must be described mathematically to make the work reproducible.\n\n(4) **No design-yield / success rate.**\nAnalog design is a constrained optimization problem, not just “generate something simulatable.” The paper does not report the core metric an analog designer cares about: if you sample N times (e.g. 5–10), what fraction of generated circuits are (i) topologically valid, (ii) fully sized, and (iii) satisfy all required specs (gain, bandwidth/UGBW, phase margin, power) with no post hoc tuning?\nWithout this “yield,” it’s unclear if the method is actually designing usable circuits or just producing plausible sketches.\n\n(5) **Baselines are weak.**\nApart from CktGNN, most baselines are generic generative models or author-modified references not built for analog circuit synthesis. This makes the reported gains less convincing. The paper does not compare against realistic circuit design pipelines such as:\n\ntopology generation + RL/BO/SPICE sizing loops,\n\nretrieval + constraint-guided GNN repair,\n\nLLM-generated SPICE + filtering.\nClaiming state of the art without these comparisons is premature.

These should be cited and, where possible, used as baselines.\n\n(7) **Metrics are poorly defined**:\n“Validity,” “uniqueness,” “novelty,” and “max node count” are reported but not rigorously defined or tied to actual analog design criteria. It’s unclear:\nwhether “validity” means “SPICE runs,” or “meets spec,”\nhow “uniqueness” handles isomorphic netlists,\nwhat level of change counts as “novel,”\nwhat “max node count” means in terms of real design complexity.\nAs written, these look like generic graph-generation metrics, not design quality metrics."}, "questions": {"value": "Refer to weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "2klVVqZj3W", "forum": "Za1lSj86XG", "replyto": "Za1lSj86XG", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17818/Reviewer_YrVy"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17818/Reviewer_YrVy"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17818/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761991230433, "cdate": 1761991230433, "tmdate": 1762927656683, "mdate": 1762927656683, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
