Existing remedies often yield infeasible scaling factors or conflicting update directions, resulting in degraded performance. In this paper, we show that training PINNs requires jointly considering feasible scaling factors and a non-conflict direction. Through a geometric analysis of per-loss gradients, we define the $\\textit{harmonized cone}$ as the intersection of their primal and dual cones, which characterizes directions that are simultaneously feasible and non-conflicting. Building on this, we propose $HARMONIC$ (HARMONIzed Cone gradient descent), a training procedure that computes updates within the harmonized cone by leveraging the Double Description method to aggregate extreme rays. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees in nonconvex settings and prove the existence of a nontrivial harmonized cone. Across standard PDE benchmarks, $HARMONIC$ generally outperforms state-of-the-art methods while ensuring feasible and non-conflict updates.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Physics-Informed Neural Networks", "Multi-loss Optimization", "Gradient Conflict Resolution", "Feasible Directions", "Nonconvex Convergence"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9d2ec8d876f12aec491933c2862f18bf97090ab8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4c63cd9aac9884924d54878740a32976006bfc5c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focuses on improving training physics-informed neural networks (PINN).

The explanation of the proposed algorithm is insufficient. The paper does not clearly describe how the Double Description method computes the rays of the Harmonized Cone, and it lacks references or related works that would help readers understand this process. It also remains unclear whether the Double Description method can always compute the rays exactly or if there are cases where approximation or numerical instability may occur. Furthermore, it would be helpful to explicitly include the Double Description step in the pseudocode to clarify how it is integrated into the overall algorithm.\n\n\n2. The experiments presented in the paper were conducted on relatively simple benchmark problems. It would strengthen the work to evaluate HARMONIC on more challenging PDE benchmarks where PINNs are known to struggle, such as the Navier–Stokes or Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equations (see [1]). Demonstrating that HARMONIC can improve PINN performance in such difficult cases would provide stronger evidence of the algorithm’s effectiveness. Furthermore, it is important to analyze whether HARMONIC remains effective when combined with various PINN variants (for example, [2], [3]), as this would highlight its robustness and general applicability.\n\n3. The example in Figure 1 is not sufficiently convincing in demonstrating the advantage of HARMONIC, as several compared algorithms such as CAGrad and Aligned-MTL also show convergence to the Pareto front. To better highlight the unique characteristics and advantages of HARMONIC, it would be more appropriate to include an example where other algorithms fail to converge while HARMONIC succeeds. Such a case would more clearly illustrate the distinctive behavior and strength of the proposed method.\n\n4. The paper proposes a new optimizer and compares it with several existing methods, but it seems that the learning rate was fixed at 1e-3 for all experiments. Since different optimizers often require different optimal learning rates, it would be fairer to compare them after tuning the learning rate individually for each optimizer.\n\n[1] Wang, S., Sankaran, S., & Perdikaris, P.

HARMONIC appears to be applicable not only to PINNs but also to other domains with multiple losses (for example, multi-task learning). Have you applied HARMONIC to such fields or conducted preliminary experiments beyond PINNs? (This question will not affect my rating since I understand that the rebuttal period is short.)\n\n2. According to the experimental results provided in the Appendix, there are several benchmarks (e.g., Burgers, PInv, Poisson2d-CG) where HARMONIC does not outperform other competitors. In these cases, algorithms that do not satisfy the feasibility or non-conflict properties sometimes achieve better performance. Could you explain the limitations of HARMONIC and under what conditions such results are likely to occur?\n\n3. In my understanding, HARMONIC appears to be a generalized version of DCGD, since DCGD also satisfies the characteristics listed in Table 1 but only for the two-loss setting. Therefore, as in the experiments of ConFIG [1], it would be valuable to include two-loss scenarios to clarify this relationship. More importantly, demonstrating the advantages of HARMONIC when extending to three or more losses, beyond the simple separation of the PINN loss into PDE residual and other term, would provide stronger evidence for the algorithm’s contribution.\n\n[1] Liu, Q., Chu, M., & Thuerey, N.

While the proposed harmonized cone integrates both feasibility and conflict-avoidance constraints, the paper does not provide sufficient empirical or theoretical analysis isolating the specific contribution of the infeasibility component.\n\n- (Computational cost) The experiments in this paper appear to focus primarily on cases with three or more loss terms.
