Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a spatial-masked cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diffusion Models", "Video Generation", "Human Animation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/000d4e407423a9069b197a06760c567d66454c93.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4bdbd42606abec1ec6d9059738a3bcf92a9c7c56.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "FantasyPortrait is a diffusion transformer framework for single- and multi-character portrait animation.

Sound methodological design: The combination of implicit expression representation and masked cross-attention is well-motivated and effectively mitigates identity leakage and inter-character interference during multi-subject animation.\n4. Clear ablation justification: The ablation study convincingly demonstrates why expression-augmented learning (EAL) is selectively applied only to non-rigid motion components (lip and emotion), showing clear empirical evidence that full augmentation brings little gain for rigid motions.\n5.

Methodology description is overly concise: Several critical modules—such as the expression-augmented encoder and masked attention pipeline—are only briefly introduced.

Unclear training details for learnable tokens: The paper introduces learnable tokens in the expression-augmented encoder, but their initialization, dimensionality, and optimization objectives are not described. This limits reproducibility and interpretability.\n3. Missing comparison with underlying components: Since the model is based on the Wan architecture and utilizes PD-FGC for implicit keypoint extraction, comparisons with these base methods are necessary to clearly separate FantasyPortrait’s contribution from prior foundations.\n4. Limited demonstration of fine-grained expression control: Although the paper claims “fine-grained emotion synthesis,” the qualitative results lack close-up analyses or visualizations that clearly demonstrate per-region control (e.g., subtle lip or eyebrow motion).\n5. Minor technical issue in reporting: In Table 3, the “Speed” unit should be seconds per frame (s/frame) rather than frames per second (frame/s), as the current interpretation conflicts with the numerical scale.\n6. Incomplete dataset release and demonstration: The paper mentions that the Multi-Expr dataset is curated, but the supplementary materials do not include visual samples or clear information about dataset accessibility, licensing, and annotation structure.\n7. Missing emotional diversity evaluation: The experiments mainly focus on overall motion and expression accuracy but lack systematic analysis across different emotion categories (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger). Quantitative emotion classification or perceptual user studies would strengthen the claim of emotional expressiveness.\n8.

In Eq.4, 𝑀⊙(QK^T) zeros out cross-region logits through the mask 𝑀, the subsequent softmax operation normalizes across all tokens, meaning each attention weight can still be indirectly influenced by the presence of others, leading to potential cross-region coupling. Moreover, the trilinear interpolation used to project pixel-level masks into latent space creates soft edges (values between 0–1), which further undermines the claim of achieving strict spatial isolation.\n2. The overall pipeline shows limited originality—its key component, Masked Cross-Attention, closely resembles mechanisms used in HunyuanVideo-Avatar, while the expression encoder is pretrained from PD-FGC paper.\n3. The method assumes that 3D VAE latent features are spatially aligned with the input video pixels—how robust is this assumption under large head motion or occlusion?\n4.

Furthermore, what occurs when faces overlap or partially occlude each other in multi-person scenes?\n5.

The method explicitly employs a \"pretrained implicit expression extractor​\" from Wang et al. (2023a) to derive all core motion features (e_lip​, e_eye​, e_head​, e_emo​). The paper's sole algorithmic addition, the \"Expression-Augmented Learning (EAL)\" module, with an expression-augmented encoder, only refines two of inherited features. The ablation study in Table 2 shows removing EAL has no effect on head pose (APD) or eye motion (MAE). Control over these rigid dynamics is fully inherited from the work of Wang et al. (2023a). HunyuanPortrait (Xu et al. 2025) also utilize implicit represention to describe expression and disentangle appearance and motion.\n\n\n- The second key claim, a masked cross-attention mechanism, is an application of a well-established technique in generative models. The problem of \"feature interference\" or \"attribute entanglement\" in multi-subject generation is widely known. Consequently, using spatial masks to guide or constrain attention layers is a common solution, as documented in prior works, including but not limited to CustomVideo (arXiv: 2401.09962), arXiv: 2505.02823, MS-Diffusion (Wang et al. 2024b) and arXiv: 2505.05101.
