Limited Novelty and Broader Contribution: Dataset papers are increasingly common in machine learning, particularly in remote sensing and geospatial domains. EarthScape, while tailored to SG mapping, does not introduce particularly unique elements—its multimodal fusion of imagery, DEMs, and derivatives echoes existing RS benchmarks, and the focus on surface morphology is not sufficiently differentiated from prior works on landslides or land cover. The \"living resource\" claim lacks specifics on expansion plans, and the dataset's U.S.-centric nature limits its global representativeness, potentially reducing its appeal as a general benchmark for multimodal learning or domain adaptation.\n\n2. Scope and Scale Concerns: The dataset appears constrained in geographic diversity, relying on site-specific SG maps that may not capture global variability in geologic processes. Class imbalance and long-tail issues are mentioned but not quantified in detail, which is a missed opportunity to highlight uniqueness. Additionally, the processing pipeline, while reproducible, relies on standard tools, and the choice of 256x256 patches at fixed scales may not adequately address multi-resolution challenges in real-world RS tasks.\n\n3. Baseline Experiments and Evaluation: The baselines seem preliminary, focusing on standard architectures without exploring state-of-the-art multimodal models (e.g., CLIP variants, Perceiver IO, or recent geospatial transformers like GeoCLIP). Results emphasize terrain predictiveness but lack ablation on modality contributions or comparisons to non-ML methods (e.g., traditional GIS-based mapping). Cross-region generalization is identified as a challenge, but without metrics like domain shift quantification (e.g., MMD or adversarial scores), it's unclear how EarthScape advances beyond existing datasets. Moreover, no discussion of computational efficiency or scalability for large-scale deployment.\n\n4.
