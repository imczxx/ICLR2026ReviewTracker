While it is possible to convert to the H representation, it is computationally expensive and therefore the authors dedicate a seperate algorithm for this instance. This method first maps points from the polytope to unique barycentric coordinates on a simplex using maximum entropy coordinates (mec). It then applies an isometric log-ratio (ilr) transform to map these coordinates to a K-dimensional Euclidean space, where a standard Euclidean CNF is trained.\n\nThe authors evaluate these methods on synthetic mixture-of-Gaussian distributions constrained to 4D and 20D polytopes, comparing their performance against a baseline Euclidean CNF."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper presents an interesting and potentially valuable framework for a specific problem domain where generative modeling on polytopes is the main focus, such as certain classes of optimization problems.

This ensures that log-likelihoods remain well-defined, allowing the framework to be compatible with standard normalizing flow training and evaluation, even if it is not strictly necessary for flow matching."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The paper is broadly unclear for a general machine learning audience. It assumes significant expertise in polytope geometry and its associated algebra. Critical concepts, such as the H-representation (Equations 1-4), \"John polytope,\" \"maximum entropy coordinates,\" and \"Aitchison geometry\", are introduced with little to no explanation, making the paper difficult to follow for non-experts. These foundational concepts need to be introduced more comprehensively.\n\nBeyond the transformations to the unit ball and Euclidean space (whose originality is not fully clarified), the core generative modeling methods are applications of existing techniques (Flow Matching, normalizing flows). The primary contribution appears to be the careful composition of these transformations and the tracking of their Jacobians, which is mainly relevant for log-likelihood evaluation, but may not be critical for the training of the CNF models (like Flow Matching) themselves."}, "questions": {"value": "The paper fails to make a strong case for the real-world importance of generative modeling on polytopes.

Only two examples from a simple mixture of Gaussians model are used. I would hope to see an evaluation on data, for example, from a metabolic simulator. Similar to what I said in the strengths, I think the methods or experiments section could use a table that highlights the tradeoffs of the various flows that were evaluated. I find it strange that the euclidean flow performs just as well as the other flows and wonder if that combined with rejection sampling is sufficient, obviating the need for Riemannian or ball flows. Additionally, the authors had to derive manual jacobians for the transforms which limits the scalability of the proposed flows.\n\nHere are other standalone critiques:\n-  typo in lines 293-294 and line 359"}, "questions": {"value": "I included some questions in the weaknesses and add more standalone questions here:\n- Flows are normalized by construction, so they shouldn't need to be divided by a normalizing ocnstant... and also how are they getting that normalizing constant?\n- Why not include the boundary of the ball in Riemannian flow matching? That seems sensible unless there's a technical challenge? I think it's because of the maximum entropy coordinates but I'm not completely sure.\n-  What are the consequences for choosing MEC to find barycentric coordinates? I'm assuming there are other formulations. Kind of like how they could've used the Fisher-Rao metric, which would be interesting to know why they chose Aitchison over Fisher-Rao very briefly.\n- Looks like their model isn't really handling the edges as well as the MCMC sampler in Figure 3. Why is that and how can it be addressed?\n- They mention BOED but it isn't well-motivated here and is missing a reference to the seminal Lindley paper.\n- Why not perform simulation based inference with these flows? It seems as though that would be helpful experiments to evaluate their method. They could compare the different efficiencies of the different flow models in 1) creating posterior distributions and 2) evaluating calibration of the posteriors. Their method doesn't seem to be too far off and I think that would _greatly_ improve confidence in the method. In that case, I would feel more confident in their method and the tradeoffs of different flows from those evaluations."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "nQita3tiqg", "forum": "BPMSh1gYnR", "replyto": "BPMSh1gYnR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4725/Reviewer_hZ5o"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4725/Reviewer_hZ5o"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4725/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761949367439, "cdate": 1761949367439, "tmdate": 1762917534968, "mdate": 1762917534968, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors demonstrate differentiable mappings from a convex polytope to a unit ball (for both H and V representations) which allow for the application of both normalising flow and flow matching models to model distributions on the unit ball which is much more stable and easier than learning a flow on the convex polytope directly.
