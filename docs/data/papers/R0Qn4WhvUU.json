Existing methods typically operate in a single domain—either time or frequency—limiting their ability to capture diverse anomalies across both global and local patterns. To address this, we propose **Dyn-ConvNet**, a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that systematically integrates time- and frequency-domain representations by combining the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for long-range periodic feature extraction with the Wavelet Transform for local and transient anomaly detection. These complementary features are fused through a deep convolutional backbone enhanced with gating mechanisms and residual connections, enabling adaptive learning and robust detection across different scales and anomaly types. Experiments on five popular multivariate time series benchmark datasets show that Dyn-ConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with even larger gains in complex anomaly scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-domain feature integration in enhancing both the performance and generalization capability of multivariate time series anomaly detection.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Time Series Anomaly Detection", "Multivariate Time Series", "Time–Frequency Representation", "Deep Learning", "Hybrid Neural Network"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8aca5749e17732782b40b901739f056246dd47f9.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/56199b256617233d1e143a4b6b685c467c0f4b61.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a novel hybrid deep learning architecture Dyn-ConvNet for time series anomaly detection that unifies time- and frequency-domain representations.

While Dyn-ConvNet presents a well-structured hybrid framework, its core idea of combining time- and frequency-domain representations is not entirely novel. Recent works such as TFMAE [1] and TFAD [2] have already explored similar hybrid paradigms that integrate temporal and spectral features for anomaly detection. Although the paper introduces a gating fusion mechanism, this component alone may not represent a sufficiently groundbreaking methodological advance to justify the claim of being “the first systematic integration” of time–frequency features. As such, the incremental novelty of the approach is a key limitation.\n\nW2. The experimental evaluation, while extensive, omits several recent and highly competitive baselines in time series anomaly detection, such as DADA [3] and DCdetector [4]. Without including these baselines, the paper’s empirical comparisons risk overstating the performance advantage of the proposed model.\n\nW3. Although the paper provides quantitative results and ablation studies, it lacks qualitative case studies or visual analyses demonstrating how Dyn-ConvNet handles different anomaly types (e.g., point, contextual, and collective anomalies).\n\nW4.

First, the results do not show consistent improvements. Second, the integration of the time and frequency domains in these two components lacks significant contribution, as existing works have already explored joint representation learning or anomaly detection in the time-frequency domain.\n\n- The terminology used is not entirely accurate. The authors refer to the Wavelet Transform, but they actually use multi-scale convolution. This is misleading since the authors are not employing the standard wavelet transform from signal processing. Additionally, when the convolution kernel size equals the length of the input sequence, it effectively becomes equivalent to global Fourier features. Therefore, the necessity of merging these two branches requires further discussion, such as identifying what types of anomalies each branch helps address. I did not find any in-depth analysis on this in the experiment part.\n\n- Moreover, the wavelet transform you mentioned is also a method for frequency modeling, right? From this perspective, the emphasis on \"time-frequency\" in the title is not rigorous.\n\n- The review of related works is insufficient. The comparison methods mainly focus on time series prediction models, such as DLinear and Transformer variants, lacking a thorough discussion of various anomaly detection works. Specifically, the authors state in the abstract that “Existing methods typically operate in a single domain—either time or frequency.” This is unreasonable, as there is actually a substantial amount of work that utilizes time-frequency fusion or multi-scale analysis methods for time series anomaly detection.\n\n- Figure 3 suggests that the model's sensitivity is dependent on specific tuning operations.\n\n- The gating mechanism simply concatenates the representations from the two branches and employs a linear projection for gating selection.

Inconsistent Empirical Support for the Core Premise: The paper's primary hypothesis is that the integration of time and frequency domains is key to its superior performance. However, the ablation study (Table 2) does not consistently support this conclusion.\nWhen comparing the \"No-FFT\" variant (time-domain only) to the \"No-Gating\" variant (a simple hybrid concatenation), the \"No-FFT\" model achieves a significantly higher F1-score on SMAP (0.8358 vs. 0.6869) and also performs better on SWaT and MSL.\nThis result on a majority (3 out of 5) of the datasets strongly suggests that the Fourier stream is not always complementary and, in many cases, may actually be detrimental to performance . This finding undermines the central justification for the proposed hybrid architecture.\n\n2. The role of the adaptive gating mechanism becomes unclear . Given that the FFT stream appears to harm performance on several datasets, the \"Full Model's\" high scores might be achieved simply by the gate learning to suppress or ignore the FFT input on those datasets. If this is the case, the model is effectively a complex, gated CNN, and the hybrid-domain premise adds unnecessary complexity.

How do the authors reconcile this fact with the paper's central thesis that integrating time and frequency domains is the key to improved performance ?\n\n2.
