This multifaceted nature reveals a gap between traditional social science and contemporary computational approaches: the former offers rich conceptual accounts but limited computational models, while the latter often relies on static objectives or purely data-driven criteria that overlook the subjective and communicative nature of fairness. We address this gap through a computational framework and two resource-allocation scenarios in which large language model (LLM)–based cognitive agents operate with heterogeneous roles, relationships, and moral commitments. The framework supports agent reflection and negotiation via explicit, language-based feedback, enabling the study of norm evolution and consensus formation of fairness in multi-agent social systems. Using standard objective metrics from resource allocation, we demonstrate that our approach captures key complexities of fairness, such as ambiguity, procedural justice, and subjective satisfaction—while remaining quantitatively evaluable. This work also offers actionable insights for designing tractable AI systems that can navigate evolving social norms in dynamic, multi-stakeholder environments.", "tldr": "Modeling Fairness Dynamics by Simulating Moral-Based Multi-Agent Resource Allocation", "keywords": ["fairness", "multi-agent simulation", "consensus", "llm-based agents", "morality"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e3d3998e355391572ce60aa112a0a851034c85f1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies fairness as a dynamic, negotiated construct using a text-based multi-agent simulation with LLM “cognitive agents.” Two scenarios are proposed: (1) Negotiated Fairness after group hunting, where an allocator iteratively proposes distributions and receives peer scoring plus reflection; and (2) Fairness Learning with semi-public resources, where allocators observe historical cases, receive recipient scores, face penalties under a threshold, and reflect before the next round. Agents have moral archetypes (Selfish, Kin, Reciprocal, Universal). The paper reports that (i) low first-round scores correlate with larger allocator concessions, (ii) keyword shifts indicate movement from contribution accounting toward survival and group cooperation, (iii) self-interest ratios for selfish agents decline over cycles under scoring and penalty feedback, and (iv) ablations show iterative negotiation and penalties are important for convergence.

As a result, the incremental advantage of the proposed reflection plus scoring loop is not fully quantified.\n- The paper focuses on distributive trends and subjective satisfaction but does not probe tradeoffs among standard ML fairness criteria or causal fairness frames. Even within economic fair division, only a contribution baseline is used; other baselines (e.g., MNW, EF1, proportionality) are not contrasted in outcomes and acceptance.

The authors claim they are introducing a \"computational framework\" , but the experiments only use a single model (OpenAI's GPT-4o) and a specific set of agent prompts. How can this be a general framework? The results (e.g., selfish agents becoming more group-focused ) might just be an artifact of this one LLM or the specific prompts. The paper does not show this can generalize to other models or scenarios. Also there is a Missing Connection to Human Fairness -- The paper's introduction is all about fairness as a human social construct. But the paper completely fails to connect the agent simulations back to humans? More specifically, there is no human baseline. How do we know these agents behave like people?\nThere are no human evaluators. How do we know the agents' final \"fair\" allocations are actually seen as fair by real people?\nWithout this connection, the paper cannot support its claims of \"captur[ing] key complexities of fairness\" or offering \"human-like subjective satisfaction\".\n\n- My second worry comes from the lack of baselines: the paper has no concrete baselines. The related work mentions classic fairness concepts from economics like inequity aversion and Nash welfare, but the experiments never compare against them. How does this complex LLM agent simulation compare to a simpler behavioral model from economics?\n\n- I am also confused by the innovation in this paper. The \"method\" is an agent-based simulation that calls an LLM API and uses prompts for reflection. This is not a new learning algorithm.\n\n- And I am not a fan for big claims. The paper claims to capture complex ideas like \"ambiguity, procedural justice, and subjective satisfaction\". But it's not clear how the experiments show this. The metrics used are just HP allocation amounts, scores from other agents, and keyword frequency in text. This seems too simple to make claims about deep concepts like \"procedural justice\" or \"fairness\" in general. The economic literature, for instance, provides precise, testable definitions (e.g., envy-freeness, equity, or inequity aversion), can the authors specify which ones they are referring to?"}, "questions": {"value": "- What is the human baseline?

It is unclear what types of moral reasoning non-allocator agents have, and how they are set up to score proposed allocations. In the negotiated fairness game, the non-allocator agents are differentiated by the contribution distributions: for a given allocation, does an agent score higher if the agent believes its given portion fairly awards the contribution, and lower vice versa? In the fairness learning game, the non-allocator agents have different roles: how does these role-specific perspectives apply in scoring allocation and providing justification? I would expect these non-allocator agents’ views to potentially impact fairness dynamics, for example, if all these agents are all strongly selfish, social interaction and reflection may not lead to fairness norm shift as they would always give low scores to allocations unfavorable to themselves.  \n\n2.\tUnclear practical relevance of learning from pure LLM-based simulation: The paper studies a full LLM-based framework and uses only LLM agents to draw conclusions about fairness dynamics and fairness perception evolution. It is unclear whether and how these findings can apply in practice? A more general question is, what are possible use cases of the proposed framework? If the framework is intended to illustrate the complex dynamics of fairness perception and moral reasoning in human decision process, a key assumption to justify is the validity of using LLM agent behaviors as proxy of human behaviors.  \n\n3.\tSome result interpretations appear inconsistent with figures: In Section 4.2, line 295-296 states that “As shown in Fig. 2 (a), for most moral types (kin, reciprocal, universal), in the final stage, the HP distribution presents a more balanced pattern compared to the first stage.” It is not immediately clear why this statement is true: what metric is used to evaluate the degree of balance? \n\nAlso, in Section 4.2, line 306 mentions the decreased emphasis on “Contribution” in thinking text: in Figure 2(b), ‘Contribution’ is only shown as a keyword for ‘Kin-Focused’ and ‘Universal’. \n\nThen line 347-350 compares first and second scores in Figure 3 and states that agents with relatively low first-round scores tend to see an increase in allocation ratio in the second round, and have “second scores (square markers) higher than the first”. Agent 2 (green bars) and agent 5 (red bars) in Figure 3(a) appear to be opposite to this statement. \n\nIn Section 4.3, line 369-371 discusses that “From Fig. 4 (a), average scores and total allocated HP rise with experimental cycles”, but some results are not exactly showing this trend, such as orange bars and blue bars in Figure 4(a). \n\n4.\tMinor: in Figure 3, the differences between deep colors and transparent colors are difficult to read and understand."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see my questions listed in weaknesses.
