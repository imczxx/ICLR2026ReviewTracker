To examine this gap, we introduce a unified Physics Evaluator that measures four main aspects: contact, stability, geometric priors, and deployability, which are further decomposed into nine sub-constraints, establishing the first benchmark to measure physical consistency. Based on this evaluator, our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods remain largely physics-unaware. To overcome this limitation, we further propose a framework that integrates feedback from the Physics Evaluator into both training and inference, enhancing the physical plausibility of generated scenes. Specifically, we propose PhyMix, which is composed of two complementary components: (i) implicit alignment via Scene-GRPO, a critic-free group-relative policy optimization that leverages the Physics Evaluator as a preference signal and biases sampling towards physically feasible layouts, and (ii) explicit refinement via a plug-and-play Test-Time Optimizer (TTO) that uses differentiable evaluator signals to correct residual violations during generation. Overall, our method unifies evaluation, reward shaping, and inference-time correction, producing 3D indoor scenes that are both visually faithful and physically plausible. Extensive evaluations on synthetic dataset confirm state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and physical plausibility, and extensive qualitative examples on stylized and real-world images further showcase the method’s robustness.", "tldr": "PhyMix couples a Physics Evaluator with Scene-GRPO and test-time optimization to produce physically consistent single-image 3D indoor scenes.", "keywords": ["3D Scene Generation", "Indoor Scene Synthesis", "Physics-Aware Optimization"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a08871c55f476dfd4fca9f88ae466e84b0ec4927.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a so-called physics evaluator for evaluating the quality of image-example based indoor scene synthesis.

The paper would benefit from a clearer explanation of why these four aspects are chosen, how they interact, and whether they comprehensively cover all major physical inconsistencies.\n\n• Although the reported results show improvement in physical realism, the experiments are primarily limited to 3D-FRONT, with only a few scene variations. There is no cross-domain validation (e.g., cluttered indoor scenes) or analysis on unseen object categories. Furthermore, ablation on each sub-metric of the Physics Evaluator is missing, leaving it unclear which aspects contribute most to the gains.\n\n• The proposed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an interesting critic-free RL approach, but its advantages over standard algorithms such as PPO [Schulman et al., 2017] or AWR [Peng et al., 2019] are not sufficiently quantified. It would strengthen the claim if the authors could compare sample efficiency, stability, or convergence behavior to existing RL baselines.\n\n• Several parts (e.g., Section 3.1 on scene representation, Equation definitions of the Physics Evaluator) are written only in prose without explicit symbols or equations, which weakens reproducibility.

Based on these suggestions, we have made substantial updates to the manuscript. All revised text is highlighted in yellow in the updated PDF, and additional experiments have been added in the Appendix. Below we summarize all major changes.\n\n---\n\n***1. Expanded discussion of RL-based and physics-guided methods (Section 2)***\n\nSection 2 has been extended to clarify the relationship between our method and prior RL-based or physics-guided optimization approaches. We describe why traditional multi-step RL formulations (e.g., PPO-style rollouts or value-based optimization) do not align naturally with single-step 3D layout generation, and how Scene-GRPO provides a more stable and tailored groupwise preference optimization setting for our problem. Additional references and contextual discussion have been added.\n\n***2. Added comparison with real physical simulation (Section 3.2)***\n\nA new discussion explains how differentiable rigid-body simulators are used in previous work and clarifies their limitations: high computational cost, focus on temporal dynamics, and inability to account for non-differentiable static constraints such as geometric priors or reachability. This analysis supports the design and advantages of our unified evaluator.\n\n***3. Clarified metric design and simplified definitions (Section 3.3)***\n\nSection 3.3 has been rewritten for clarity. We describe the four metric categories (geometric priors, contact, stability, deployability) in a logical progression, provide intuitive explanations, and keep the full mathematical definitions to Appendix A.\n\n***4. Improved table formatting***\n\nAll tables have been updated for consistency and clarity. Best-performing values are shown using color blocks.\n\n***5. Added extensive new experiments in the Appendix G***\n\nWe added a substantial set of new experiments to complement the main results. Appendix G includes: (i) extended visual comparisons with existing models across synthetic renders, real photographs, and stylized inputs; (ii) a validation study comparing our Physics Evaluator against a Taichi-based rigid-body simulator, demonstrating strong consistency on collision, grounding, and stability assessments; (iii) a computational efficiency analysis contrasting our inference cost with both baseline methods and full physics simulation; (iv) a detailed failure case analysis illustrating limitations on deformable objects and challenging real-world geometries; and (v) a downstream navigation experiment showing that higher reachability scores translate directly into better robot path-planning success rates. These additions provide a more comprehensive and transparent view of our method’s performance.\n\n***6. Relocated and expanded ablation studies***\n\nWe moved the full ablation section from the Appendix into the main text to improve visibility and coherence. The relocated section presents the effects of Scene-GRPO, Test-Time Optimization, removal of physics-energy components, and variations in group size.\n\n***7. Additional explanation of hyperparameter settings***\n\nTo avoid ambiguity noted by reviewers, we added a clear explanation of all hyperparameter settings in Appendix F.2. We also clarified which hyperparameters were fixed across all backbones. The main text now points directly to these details to ensure full reproducibility.\n\n***8. Clarification of dataset sources and avoidance of ambiguity***\n\nThe updated text avoids potential ambiguity regarding the dataset's source.\n\n---\n\nWe thank all reviewers once again for their thoughtful and detailed feedback. The manuscript has been significantly improved in clarity, completeness, and technical rigor, and we are happy to provide additional clarification if needed."}}, "id": "VJitGwNp0h", "forum": "RK6j9cwSK4", "replyto": "RK6j9cwSK4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission968/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission968/Authors"], "number": 10, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission968/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763324678795, "cdate": 1763324678795, "tmdate": 1763324678795, "mdate": 1763324678795, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
