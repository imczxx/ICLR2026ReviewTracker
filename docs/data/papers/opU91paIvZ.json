However, these CoT traces\nare often not truly monitorable. They can be unfaithful, hiding the real reasons for\nan answer, or verbose, making it difficult to monitor. It is difficult to fix this with\nstandard reinforcement learning based fine-tuning since models only get feedback\non their final answer, not on intermediate reasoning steps. To bypass this prob-\nlem, we formulate the CoT monitorability as a constraint optimization problem\nand propose a new pipeline to solve that problem. We leverage existing instruct\nmodels as efficient priors to transform current CoT traces into high-quality ones\nthat satisfy monitorability constraints, ensuring faithfulness and conciseness. We\nthen use our newly generated dataset to teach the base model how to reason prop-\nerly through standard supervised fine-tuning.

This paper works on a pretty valuable and interesting direction: monitorability in reasoning models. It is important because we need a faithful reasoning model which outputs trustworthy CoT.

The empirical results are quite strong. It improves the faithfulness by 10% and reduces the length by 60%, although the performance drops a bit (4%)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The proposed prior-guided distillation method heavily relies on an external prior model (e.g., Qwen-7B Instruct) to generate “monitorable” reasoning traces. This suggests that the observed improvement may stem from the prior model’s inductive bias, rather than the generalizability of the proposed framework itself.\n2. The faithfulness evaluation depends on judgments made by the llm-as-a-judge approach, lacking objective annotation or inter-rater reliability verification.\n3. The authors define monitorability as consisting of faithfulness and conciseness, but do not provide a unified quantitative formulation for this concept.\n4. At line 171, the authors used 950 as a threshold to judge the conciseness. I wonder why 950? \n5. The experimental design could be improved by introducing more datasets. Testing on MATH500/GSK8K and MMLUPro is not sufficient. Existing models are powerful on more complex tasks like AIME, LiveCodeBench.
