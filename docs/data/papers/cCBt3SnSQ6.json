While various calibration methods have been proposed, only a few addresses the challenge of calibrating Multi-Label Classification(MLC) tasks. Multi-label classification is essential in real-world applications, as most objects or instances naturally belong to multiple categories, and the associated labels often exhibit strong interdependencies. A key difficulty in calibrating MLC models lies in effectively considering the information of label interdependencies. Existing methods that attempt to model the  label interdependencies often lack rigorous statistical justification or they consider the labels are independent or lacks being strictly proper - a property which induces calibrated predicted probabilities upon minimization. In this work, we introduce a novel loss function, \\emph{Correlated Multi-Label Loss (CMLL)}, that explicitly captures label interdependencies while satisfying the properties of a strictly proper loss. Our method leverages pairwise label correlations to incorporate dependency information into the training process and is proven to be Fisher consistent. Extensive experiments on three publicly available benchmark multi-label datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our proposed method significantly reduces calibration error while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Calibration", "Strictly Proper Loss", "Multi-Label Classification", "Label Dependency", "CMLL Loss"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1fed066b68705c26a9391b46fd1510c63948aa33.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Correlated Multi-Label Loss (CMLL), a novel loss function designed to improve the calibration of deep neural networks in multi-label classification (MLC) tasks.

To fix this, the paper introduces a new loss function called Correlated Multi-Label Loss (CMLL), including a regularization term penalizes the difference between the model's predicted label correlations and the ground-truth label correlations.

A PSR must be uniquely minimized when the prediction $\\hat{\\rho}$ equals the true probability $\\rho$. However, CMLL is a weighted trade-off between the BCE loss (a PSR) and a new correlation term. It is possible that a model will sacrifice perfect calibration (increasing the BCE loss) to better match the in-batch label correlations (decreasing the new term). This means the minimum of the CMLL loss is no longer guaranteed to be at the point of perfect calibration in particle. Since the proposed correlation term is calculated in-batch, the loss for any single sample dependent on the other samples present in its batch. This formulation contradicts the standard definition of a PSR, which is based on the expectation $E_{x,y}[L(h(x), y)]$. Also it makes the training gradient highly sensitive to batch composition and sampling noise. \n\nThe $\\lambda$ is the most important part of the proposed method, as it controls the trade-off between calibration and the regularization term.
