Existing LLM-based agent systems have great potential to simulate these activities, yet they still face three challenges to understand the dynamics at the enterprise scale in terms of structure, strategy, and operation. This motivates us to propose TaskWeave, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework that aims to imitate complex enterprise dynamics. Inspired by theories in the fields of control and business management, our TaskWeave operates at three levels: strategic (executives, e.g. generating phase plans), tactical (coordination, e.g. scheduling resource allocation), and operational (task execution, e.g. leveraging multiple tools), simulating modern enterprise dynamics in an end-to-end manner. Our TaskWeave instantiates an IT company to simulate year-long operations, demonstrating diverse enterprise dynamics. Experiments, including human evaluations, show that it improves performance with less real-world overhead, while also generating internal data as a downstream task and enabling interactions with external contexts.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["multi-agent systems;enterprise dynamics;behaviour simulation;large language models;"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e64d0bfeaada960f03dbce12838a5a18c630ad0d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces TaskWeave, a multi-agent framework designed to simulate enterprise dynamics by orchestrating LLM-based agents across three interconnected layers: strategic planning, tactical delegation, and operational execution.

At the tactical level, agents switch between orchestrating and executing roles to break down goals, delegate tasks, and align efforts. At the operational level, agents use structured memory and tools to access historical data, resolve task dependencies, and support context-based reasoning and traceable outputs."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Examples would be helpful to clarify these concepts.\n\n2. Additionally, the paper lacks explanations for certain variables.

Though TaskWeave imitates the enterprise dynamics, the underlying multi-agent framework involves heavy human engineering and prompt designs for characterizing the role of each agent. The high dependence of human prompt engineering and the lack of automation for imitating enterprise dynamics can strongly limit the generalization of the framework for customization. \n\n2. In Table 1, the evaluation is conducted over a single-agent baseline. However, there are many prior LLM-based MAS frameworks (as listed in Table 6, e.g. AutoGen, MetaGPT) that can be customized into enterprise imitation, which was ignored in the main experiments. In addition, the human evaluation is conducted over a very small group of people with only 4 domain experts, which may expose bias in the evaluation. Some metrics are ill-defined: for instance, the 4:4:2 distribution between Tech, Mkt, Strat is overfitted to a special style of enterprise structure, which makes the KL divergence study misleading.\n\n3.  To the best of my understanding, this framework will be useful when it is evaluated against a real-world enterprise example with the history of the growth and the internal decision-making. However, the main study conducted in this work only involves a year-long simulation of a single company without grounding with real-world dynamics. \n\n4.
