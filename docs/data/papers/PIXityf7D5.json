In particular, we tackle a challenging version of this task, where we learn from presence-only data in a community-sourced dataset, model a large number of species simultaneously, and do not use any additional environmental information. Previous work has used neural implicit representations to construct models that achieve promising results. However, implicit representations often generate predictions of limited spatial precision. We attribute this limitation to their inherently global formulation and inability to effectively capture local feature variations. This issue is especially pronounced with presence-only data and a large number of species. To address this, we propose a hybrid embedding scheme that combines both implicit and explicit embeddings. Specifically, the explicit embedding is implemented with a multiresolution hashgrid, enabling our models to better capture local information. Experiments demonstrate that our results exceed other works by a large margin on various standard benchmarks, and that the hybrid representation is better than both purely implicit and explicit ones. Qualitative visualizations and comprehensive ablation studies reveal that our hybrid representation successfully addresses the two main challenges.

The explicit location encoding is not new. It was proposed a long time ago [1]. Its drawbacks have been studied in many previous studies [1, 2, 3]. There is an MAUP (Modifiable Areal Unit Problem). Which resolution level should the explicit location encoder store the learnable parameters? If the resolution is very small, the number of learnable parameters is very large and leads to overfitting. The cell without any training samples will not be trained. If the resolution is very large, the same smoothness problem will arise. The authors need to perform an ablation study on the picked resolution and report both the model performance as well as the number of learnable parameters.\n\n2. The \"low signal frequency\" problem of implicit location encoders has been solved by recent multi-scale location encoders such as Space2Vec [1], Sphere2Vec [2], and SRNet [3]. The FCNet is an old model, and the state-of-the-art. Please compare with the recent location encoders [1,2,3].\n\n3. There will be a map projection distortion problem when treating the lat/lon as 2D Euclidean coordinates. As shown by [2] and [3], this can significantly impact the model performance. This problem will be much worse for explicit location encoders such as grid cells in different latitudes correspond to different areas. \n\n4. Moreover, for two points with longitude -179 and 179. They are very close on the Earth's surface, but treating lat/lon as 2D Euclidean coordinates makes them very far in the modeling space. I suggest using Google's S2 grid for the multiresolution grid instead of the current naive one.\n\n4. There are too many technical problems in this paper. The authors seem not to be familiar with the existing literature and techniques, such as spatial index, location encoder, map projection, etc. \n\n5. This hybrid location representation learning has been used in many tasks such as image synthesis [5] and satellite image super-resolution [6].

My main issue with this paper lies in its justification: (1) the argument is that implicit representations lead to parameters being shared across different locations (like between the Amazon and the Sahara). This is indeed the main advantage of such representations, since similar locations (in terms of species composition) will tend to share a similar representation; (2) a second argument is that implicit representations are unable to capture high frequency spatial patterns. Although it is true that they may lead to oversmoothness, this depends on the choice of location encodings and model size (as Table 3 suggests). After all, the explicit model can be obtained by feeding the implicit one with one-hot location encodings, meaning that the explicit model is a particular case of the implicit one.\n2. The proposed approach for combining the two representations (by concatenating and varying the dimensionality of each) is unclear. According to Eq. (4) and the explanations around it, it seems like the implicit dimension $F_i$ and $M$ are kept constant, while $L$ is modified. According to line 242, $L$ may stand for both layers and levels, but it doesn’t show up in the sentence before Eq. (4). Are those levels related to the hashgrid scales? Since $F=F_i+L\\times M$, for implicitness $F_i / F$ to be close to one, $L$ would have to be very large, I imagine leading to a very heavy hashgrid representation. Why not decreasing $F_i$ instead? What is the value of $L$ for the purely explicit model?\n3. In Table 4, I assume the explicit model is the same as in the other experiments and the implicit one is substituted by an MLP that takes environmental variables as input (would be nice to clarify this). For reference, it would be important to add here also the explicitness 0 and 1 models (so the env MLP and the explicit model, which would be the same one as in the other table).\n4. If I got it well, the Implicit line in Fig 8 should correspond to Fig 5 in the SINR paper. However, there are some surprising differences. Although capping at 100 seems to produce very similar results to SINR, capping at 10 seems to result in substantially worse performance (50 vs 60 MAP) than in the original paper. Similarly, capping at 1000 seems to always benefit from increasing the number of species in the original paper, but not in the present manuscript. I understand there’s quite a bit of stochasticity in the process (such as in the choice of the added species), but then it would be important to run these experiments multiple times with different random seeds."}, "questions": {"value": "Each question relates to the corresponding weakness.\n1. Related to weakness 1, my intuition is that the advantage of the proposed model is that it allows to efficiently increase the number of model parameters. After all, the implicit model tends to the hybrid model performance when its capacity is increased (Table 3). Could the authors explore this by comparing their approach with the implicit model in terms of performance vs number of parameters? I would find this to be a much more convincing argument than the current one.\n2. I would like to see a clarified notation of the method, since that would allow me to ensure I have understood what the authors have done.\n3. Could the authors provide the results for explicitness 0 and 1?\n4. I understand that the time is short, but maybe the authors could provide a standard deviation for some of the cases (like in cap 10 with the fewest. species and cap 1000 with the most species)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "xrWav3Dzyz", "forum": "PIXityf7D5", "replyto": "PIXityf7D5", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4260/Reviewer_3nVh"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4260/Reviewer_3nVh"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4260/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761580559744, "cdate": 1761580559744, "tmdate": 1762917261529, "mdate": 1762917261529, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose to use an hybrid spatial representation approach for species distribution modeling (SDM).

Some specific examples:\n    - L37: Which models are you referring to here?\n    - L50-53: This does not reflect the conclusions of Cole et al. (2023) and is inaccurate. High-quality data remain essential for obtaining precise SDMs. For instance, the GeoPlant dataset (Picek et al. (2024)) shows that presence–absence data are key to achieving top performance. What does “considerable accuracy” mean in this context? Models using environmental variables perform significantly better, consistent with ecological theory and SDM principles.\n    - L67: This statement lacks supporting references. Moreover, its validity depends on the specific type of neural network, as some architectures address this issue.\n    - L96: The claim that the state of the art is the FCNet architecture contradicts Russwurm et al. (2024), who show that SIREN networks tend to perform better. This incorrect statement is repeated at L172.\n- [W1.2] The decision to omit environmental variables throughout the paper is conceptually flawed in my opinion. SDMs fundamentally rely on environmental variables because they capture the ecological drivers of species presence. Geographic coordinates can help model spatial autocorrelation not explained by environmental factors, but removing the latter simply weakens the model without clear justification. Specific points:\n    - L75: Environmental data are not notoriously difficult to obtain or clean. Widely used datasets such as WorldClim are easy to access and substantially improve performance compared to location-only models.\n    - L118: Selecting appropriate environmental variables does require domain expertise, but this is precisely because they are essential, not merely “helpful.”\n- [W1.3] As a result, the paper’s motivation and claimed contributions remain unclear and unconvincing:\n    - I do not see a real-world scenario where a location-only model would be preferable to one that incorporates relevant environmental variables. Even those used in Cole et al. (2023) (e.g., WorldClim and elevation) are insufficient to capture species distributions adequately. Recent work, such as Picek et al. (2024) with GeoPlant, confirms that richer, higher-resolution variables are essential. Consequently, experiments like those in Table 4, which include environmental variables, should be the base setup throughout the paper.\n    - The proposed hybrid approach has already been explored in spatial modeling tasks, so its novelty lies only in its inappropriate application to SDMs. Comparisons with existing methods that integrate multi-scale information, such as the ones used in Russwurm et al. (2024), are largely missing. SIREN only appears in Table 5 and without Spherical Harmonics. It is also unclear how well these baselines were fine-tuned relative to the proposed approach (see [W2]).\n    - In the abstract, two “main challenges” are mentioned — what exactly are they? The introduction lists challenges in bold, but the paper does not propose any new methodological solutions to address them, apart from the artificial challenge created by removing environmental data. The pipeline of Cole et al. (2023) appears to be reused almost entirely.\n    - Based on the code, the only substantial change seems to be the use of the NeRF Studio implementation for explicit embeddings, which is not cited in Section 3.3. The lack of references there makes it unclear which parts of the method are original.\n\n[W2] Nothing is said about hyperparameters, except at L353, where it is mentioned that “the reported results are under the best learning rate settings for each respective model.” Does this mean that hyperparameters were tuned on the test set? What about the other baselines, such as SIREN or the Fourier representation? Were these models fine-tuned as well to ensure a fair comparison?\n\n[W3] Overall, the paper is not always clear, contains typos, and presents additional limitations such as:\n\n- Figure 3 and its caption are not particularly clear. For example, the features are not “calculated”; they are learned, stored and then retrieved from the hashtable, correct?\n- L188: I think this statement should be clarified or developed, as it is not obvious what the issue is. For me, parameters can be associated to multiple areas; it’s mainly a matter of how the embedding space is divided. Adding a reference could help.\n- Typos: L149 – missing space; L174 – missing space; L366 – missing “of.”\n- What does the asterisk in Table 2 refer to?\n- The maps of Figure 10 are poorly informative: they appear almost random and do not reflect realistic species distributions. This likely stems from the arbitrary hybrid representation that excludes environmental variables. The analysis of these maps is also vague and inaccurate. For instance, why would the “obviously unnatural L-shaped border in southwestern France” be an artifact? Environmental conditions in southwestern France differ from those in the rest of the country, so differences in predictions are expected. Moreover, to help readers interpret these maps properly, you should include observed occurrences or expert range maps for comparison.\n\nPicek, L., Botella, C., Servajean, M., Leblanc, C., Palard, R., Larcher, T., ... & Joly, A.
