Prior analyses of DDPMs have been focused on the exponential Euler discretization, showing guarantees that generally depend at least linearly on the dimension or initial Fisher information. Inspired by works in log-concave sampling (Shen & Lee, 2019), we analyze an integrator -- the denoising diffusion randomized midpoint method (DDRaM) -- that leverages an additional randomized midpoint to better approximate the SDE. Using a recently-developed analytic framework called the \"shifted composition rule\", we show that this algorithm enjoys favorable discretization properties under appropriate smoothness assumptions, with sublinear $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations needed to ensure convergence. This is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM sampling --- prior works which obtained such bounds worked instead with ODE-based sampling and had to make modifications to the sampler which deviate from how they are used in practice.

Actually, it should be termed as sampling diffusion with stochastic samplers, or SDE. This is because DDPM is only a special case of score-based diffusion when taking the limit in the length of time steps. However, the denoising diffusion model introduced in this paper is more related to the score-based SDE, instead of the original DDPM paper.\n\n(3) The argument regarding why we approximate some distribution $\\pi_{approx}$ is not convincing. The readers compare it with $\\pi_{\\delta}$ with early stopping. However, this is because when $\\delta$ is small, $\\pi_{\\delta}$ is at least close to $\\pi_0$ in $W_2$ distance. To make your argument reasonable, at least some similar $W_2$ guarantee should be provided. In contrast, in the main text, how it is defined is never specified. When I check the proof (Lemma 6), I find that this distribution even depends on the transition kernel of $P_{alg}$. As a result, the kind of guarantee is very unusual. And the comparison with prior works under this metric is unfair.\n\n(4) The paper misses a closely related work [2] when introducing the analysis of DDIM.\n\n---\n\n[1] Nearly d-linear Convergence Bounds For Diffusion Models Via Stochastic Localization Benton et al., 2024 ICLR\n\n[2] Unified Convergence Analysis for Score-Based Diffusion Models with Deterministic Samplers ICLR"}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "CumYb6HpxL", "forum": "h9kXyRWZGQ", "replyto": "h9kXyRWZGQ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23133/Reviewer_wzAK"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23133/Reviewer_wzAK"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23133/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761781986272, "cdate": 1761781986272, "tmdate": 1762942525457, "mdate": 1762942525457, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents an important theoretical result for SDE-based diffusion samplers (like DDPMs).
