Model Hijacking with the Fewest Samples", "abstract": "Transfer learning is devised to leverage knowledge from pre-trained models to solve new tasks with limited data and computational resources. Meanwhile, dataset distillation emerges to synthesize a compact dataset that preserves critical information from the original large dataset. Therefore, a combination of transfer learning and dataset distillation offers promising performance in evaluations. However, a non-negligible security threat remains undiscovered in transfer learning using synthetic datasets generated by dataset distillation methods, where an adversary can perform model hijacking attack with $\\textit{only a few poisoned samples}$ in the synthetic dataset. To reveal this threat, we propose $\\textbf{Osmosis Distillation (OD)}$ attack, a novel model hijacking strategy that targets deep learning models using the fewest samples. The adversary aims to stealthily incorporate a hijacking task into the target model, forcing it to perform malicious functions without alerting the victim. OD attack focuses on efficiency and stealthiness by using the fewest synthetic samples to complete the attack. To achieve this, we devise the transporter that employs a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture. The Transporter generates osmosis samples by optimizing visual and semantic losses to ensure that the hijacking task is difficult to detect. The osmosis samples are then distilled into a synthetic set using our specifically designed key patch selection, label reconstruction, and training trajectory matching, ensuring that the synthetic samples retain the properties of the osmosis samples. The model trained on the synthetic dataset can perform the original and hijacking tasks seamlessly. Comprehensive evaluations on various datasets demonstrate that the OD attack attains high attack success rates in hidden tasks while preserving high model utility in original tasks. Furthermore, the synthetic dataset enables model hijacking across diverse model architectures, allowing model hijacking in transfer learning with considerable attack performance and model utility. We argue that awareness of using third-party synthetic datasets in transfer learning must be raised.", "tldr": "To reveal threats in tranfer learning using dataset distillation, we propose OD attack that uses the fewest samples to launch model hijacking attack.", "keywords": ["Model Hijacking Attack", "Dataset Distillation", "Cybersecurity and Privacy"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/674f2666737642030fa6a3df9585196ace060011.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces OD (Osmosis Distillation) attack, which embeds an additional “hijacking” task into the victim model while preserving original-task utility.

The manuscript does not clearly bridge the gap between “model contains a hidden classification ability” and “this constitutes a practical, exploitable real-world threat.” As a result, the severity of the threat in practice remains speculative. Specifically:\n   * The paper argues stealthiness because the original task utility remains high, but leaves open how an attacker benefits operationally from a model that silently encodes a second task (e.g., remote extraction, covert telemetry, or third-party abuse)\n   * Experiments are conducted on common small vision benchmarks (CIFAR/MNIST/SVHN/Tiny-ImageNet). While these validate feasibility, they do not demonstrate the attack at scales or task modalities where legal/ethical harm would actually occur. \n\n2.  The OD formulation and experiments assume that the hijacking task shares the same (or mappable) output space as the source task, raising two concerns:\n   * The attack is primarily demonstrated for same-type tasks (classification → classification) and requires an explicit mapping between source and hijack labels. The paper does not experimentally or analytically evaluate the difficulty of cross-task attacks (e.g., classification → object detection, regression tasks), where output dimensionality or semantics differ. The extent to which OD generalizes across heterogeneous task types (and architectures) is therefore unclear.\n   *  When the hijacking label space is larger than the source label space, the paper does not provide a principled mapping or capacity analysis, which leaves open whether OD is practical for richer hijacking tasks.\n\nIn general, without a clearer exploitation narrative or a demonstration on a more realistic downstream task, I consider this work an interesting proof-of-concept rather than evidence of an immediate, practical security crisis. And the application limitations reduce the generality of the claims.
