We address this limitation by enforcing physical validity as a strict constraint during both training and inference with a unified module. At its core is a differentiable projection that maps the provisional atom coordinates from the diffusion model to the nearest physically valid configuration. This projection is achieved using a Gauss-Seidel scheme, which exploits the locality and sparsity of the constraints to ensure stable and fast convergence at scale. By implicit differentiation to obtain gradients, our module integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks for end-to-end finetuning. With our Gauss-Seidel projection module in place, two denoising steps are sufficient to produce biomolecular complexes that are both physically valid and structurally accurate. Across six benchmarks, our $2$-step model achieves the same structural accuracy as state-of-the-art $200$-step diffusion baselines, delivering ${\\sim}10\\times$ wall-clock speedups while guaranteeing physical validity.", "tldr": "We introduce a differentiable Gauss-Seidel projection module that allows generative models to produce physically valid and highly accurate biomolecular structures in just two steps, achieving a 10x speedup over state-of-the-art baselines.", "keywords": ["Biomolecular Interaction Modeling", "Physical Validity"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/11bc0025251f24ea4d05b3a6a130bb6aca2fb1a6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the physical validity challenge in generative modeling for protein structures.

It would be beneficial to discuss the relationship between proposed method with reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning approaches for diffusion models (e.g., DPOK, DRaFT). Compared to inference time guidance methods, they also involve fine-tuning to optimizing the reward. I’m curious about how the fine-tuning cost of RL compares to that of your iterative optimization algorithm.\n3. How is the scalability of your method? Since your method involves enforcing constraints on all substructures, as the complexity or size of the system grows, does the method remain computationally feasible during training and inference?\n4. Alphafold3 is an important baseline in this domain and is suggested to be included in experiment section for a more complete comparison.

Thank you for citing our work and for pushing forward on the important issue of physical validity in structure prediction.  \n\nI noticed in Table 1 that Protenix and other base models without steering have relatively low physical validity scores. For example, the physical validity of AlphaFold3 on the PoseBusters dataset is reported as 0.45, which is far below the numbers in their original paper and somewhat surprising to me.  \n\nTo better understand your evaluation, could you clarify which implementation you used to compute the physical validity metrics in your protocol?  In particular, if you used the code from the *boltz* repository, there is a subtle point regarding the tetrahedral chirality metric that might be worth double-checking. As far as we can tell, when computing chiral atom violations, that code directly uses the chirality annotations from the CCD mol and relies on a fixed atom ordering. For groups like `CO[P@@](=O)([O-])O[P@](=O)(O)OC` (for example in CCD_NAP), Protenix and some other base models treat the `(=O)` and `(O)` atoms as permutable. If the evaluation matches atoms only by name in such cases, this can overestimate the true number of chirality violations.  \n\nThank you for your time and for any clarification you can provide.

According to the Protenix technical report, as well as anecdotal user feedback, its performance at 200 steps (e.g., in terms of DockQ and validity metrics) is reportedly not as low as presented in this paper. I recommand the authors to either provide the detailed configuration (config) files used for their Protenix experiments or, preferably, release the raw prediction files generated by their baseline models to ensure a fair and reproducible comparison.\n- Regarding the Protenix mini tech report, the original authors claim that 'increasing the ODE sampling steps to 10 effectively mitigates this issue (clash)'. Given this, the comparison in Table 1 might be suboptimal. I strongly suggest that the authors re-evaluate the baseline using 10 ODE steps in Table 1, as this seems to be the recommended setting for mitigating structural clashes.\n- The paper states that GS projection achieves good physical constraint effects within just 2 steps. This raises a question: why did the authors not experiment with applying the projection for more steps? Furthermore, the results in Table 1 indicate that sampling for 2 steps with constraints still underperforms the original 'boltz2' baseline. The comparison is incomplete. The authors should also include experiments comparing their method against baselines like 'boltz2' when restricted to a similar small step budget (e.g., 10 steps) for structure prediction.\n- Although the 2-step process is much faster overall, the paper could provide more details on the computational cost (time and memory, forward and backward) of the Gauss-Seidel projection module itself, especially as the system (complex) size grows larger.
