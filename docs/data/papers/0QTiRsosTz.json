It is not quite clear to me how this is achieved with the proposed approach and conducted experiments. Prior approaches which argued for this [1,2] argue for viewing SDEs as differentiable mathematical objects that can incorporate neural networks. This enables developing models that are domain-informed or comparing white, grey, and black box models. The proposed approach and experiments focus on black box neural SDEs, and tasks that are not based on science/engineering applications.\n\nSecond, the authors argue that the proposed approach enables simulation-free training for generative modeling of sequence data. They argue that existing approaches either require expensive SDE simulation during training or modern bridge-based approaches applied on sequential data can be expensive due to uninformative priors or don't respect true temporal progression. While these statements are fundamentally true, there are several methods over the last 2 years that aim to address these problems and show superior performance on modeling sequential data[3,4,5,6], while already incorporating partial observability, external covariates, and long-range dependencies.

I believe that training an SDE by treating consecutive samples from an Euler–Maruyama (EM) discretization and performing (quasi-)maximum likelihood estimation is a long-established idea. For instance, a very similar approach was described as early as 1995 [1].\n\nMoreover, the authors do not discuss more recent literature such as Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM) [2], which proposes a very similar simulation-free training method for Neural SDEs (they even have a similar separate optimisation of the diffusion coefficient), or the more general SDE Matching [3] and ARCTA [4], which enable simulation-free training of non-Markovian processes.\n\nThe second major issue is the limited applicability. As the authors admit, their method only works with Markov processes. However, they also rely on EM discretization, which means it only allows training with relatively dense observations. This limitation is particularly unfortunate, since it seems that it could be relatively easily mitigated by conditioning on the last K observations and constructing interpolations between consecutive observations (as done in TFM).\n\nMinor:\n- Figure 1 is never cited in the text.\n\n[1] Pedersen, Asger Roer. \"Consistency and asymptotic normality of an approximate maximum likelihood estimator for discretely observed diffusion processes.\" Bernoulli (1995): 257–279.\n\n[2] Zhang, Xi Nicole, et al. \"Trajectory flow matching with applications to clinical time series modelling.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 37 (2024): 107198–107224.\n\n[3] Bartosh et al. \"SDE Matching: Scalable and Simulation-Free Training of Latent Stochastic Differential Equations.\" The 43rd International Conference on Machine Learning (2025).\n\n[4] Course, K. and Nair, P. \"Amortized reparametrization: efficient and scalable variational inference for latent SDEs.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36 (2023)."}, "questions": {"value": "- Please address the Weaknesses section above.\n- Could you comment on Equation 14?
