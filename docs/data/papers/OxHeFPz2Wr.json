From a machine learning perspective, the core novelty of RNAGenScape lies in employing a diffusion-inspired denoising objective to train a manifold projector that maps perturbed latent points back onto the learned data manifold. The use of latent-space optimization and interpolation for property control is, however, well established in the VAE and normalizing flow literature. That being said, the novelty should not be a great concern if the experimental results are convincing enough.\n\n2. The overall optimization framework fundamentally depends on the fidelity of the organized autoencoder (OAE) and the quality of its learned latent manifold. If the OAE fails to capture the true biological manifold of viable mRNA sequences, the downstream optimization may generate invalid or functionally implausible sequences, potentially performing worse than simple sequence-space methods such as MCMC.\n\n3. The current formulation performs optimization guided by gradients from a property predictor P that is co-trained with the OAE. Consequently, optimizing for different biological properties requires retraining the entire model, which is computationally inefficient. Moreover, the framework currently supports only single-property (scalar) optimization. Extending it to multi-objective or conditional optimization (e.g., jointly improving translation efficiency, stability, and immunogenicity) would substantially broaden its applicability and realism in practical mRNA design tasks.\n\n4. No wet-lab validation is presented to confirm the real-world biological functionality of the optimized sequences. The evaluation relies solely on a separate property prediction oracle. yet the training procedure, data sources, and potential overlap with the main model remain insufficiently detailed.

What is the detailed protocol used to perform property optimization for the different baselines? For example, in the case of Sequence-space MCMC, is the oracle property predictor employed to evaluate proposals? I encourage the authors to include these details in the appendix for reproducibility. In addition, please clarify how the stopping criterion is determined for each optimization method, whether a fixed number of steps, convergence threshold, or early-stopping rule is used.\n\n2. While RNAGenScape preserves manifold fidelity across multiple datasets (Table 2), it would also be informative to report the edit distance between optimized sequences and their corresponding original sequences. This would help quantify how much modification occurs during optimization and how conservative or aggressive the updates are.\n\n3. Sequence-space MCMC can serve as a strong baseline when the proposal distribution is well designed. It is therefore intriguing that RNAGenScape outperforms MCMC by such a large margin, especially in terms of success rate.

Section 2, the preliminaries, is excessively long and covers several foundational concepts. This space could have been used more effectively for more important results. A more concise summary would improve the paper's focus.\n2. Lack of Direct Evaluation for the Manifold Projector. The manifold projector is a central contribution of this work, yet its performance is only assessed indirectly through its impact on the final optimization results. The paper lacks a direct, quantitative evaluation of the projector's quality. It is unclear how accurately the projector approximates the true data manifold. This is a critical omission, as the entire claim of maintaining \"biological plausibility\" rests on the projector's effectiveness. Without this, it is difficult to disentangle the performance of the projector from that of the OAE and the Langevin dynamics.\n3. Insufficient Justification for Sequence Interpolation. The paper frames sequence interpolation as a key feature, but its practical utility is not well established. The authors claim it facilitates \"the exploration of intermediate variants\", but they do not demonstrate how these intermediate sequences provide concrete biological insights or inform the design process in a way that endpoint optimization does not. A more compelling use case is needed to elevate this from a technical demonstration to a significant contribution.\n4. Missing Comparison with mRNA Sequence Foundation Models. The baselines overlook the recent paradigm of large-scale pre-trained foundation models for mRNA sequences (e.g., Uni-RNA). These models capture rich, transferable representations of sequence grammar and function. It is essential to discuss how RNAGenScape compares to or could potentially leverage these models.\n5. Critical Omission of Oracle Model Validation. The entire evaluation framework relies on a separately trained P_oracle model to score the generated sequences. However, the paper provides no information about this oracle's predictive accuracy on a held-out test set (e.g., Spearman correlation). If the oracle is inaccurate or shares the same biases as the OAE's internal predictor, the reported optimization improvements could be misleading artifacts of the model exploiting the oracle's flaws. This methodological gap is a major concern that undermines the trustworthiness of the results.\n6. Potentially Biased Latent Space Distance Metric. The \"Manifold Fidelity\" metric is defined as the L2 distance in the latent space of the oracle's encoder. While using a separate model is a reasonable choice, this metric is still dependent on a learned representation. It does not guarantee that sequences that are close in this latent space are necessarily similar in terms of biological structure or function. Supplementing this with a representation-independent metric like edit distance would make the fidelity analysis more robust."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Oracle Model.

For instance, what is its reconstruction error on a held-out set of latent codes z corrupted by varying levels of noise?\n3. Interpolation Utility.
