However, scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i) partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based strategy that balances visible Gaussians—a strong proxy for computational load—across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and selective densification, to further reduce training cost.\nEvaluations on large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves up to $2\\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Neural Rendering", "Novel View Synthesis", "Large-Scale Scene", "3D Gaussian Splatting"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/48d0dab88bdb6033a6eb7b6aab182784d53543db.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "LoBE-GS tackles challenges like load imbalance and inefficiencies in coarse-to-fine pipelines by introducing a depth-aware partitioning method, optimization to balance computational load, and lightweight techniques such as visibility cropping and selective densification.

Discussion on how sensitive the method is to the quality of this coarse prior would be valuable, as suboptimal coarse models could degrade the partitioning accuracy.\n- The method involves multiple implementation-specific optimizations (Warp kernels, GP-based BO).
