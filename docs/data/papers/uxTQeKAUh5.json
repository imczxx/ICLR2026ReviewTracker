Current diffusion-based techniques typically enforce skeletal consistency by encoding structural priors into network architectures. Although effective in promoting plausible kinematics, this approach provides only indirect control over the generative process and often fails to guarantee strict physical constraint satisfaction. In this work, we propose a structure-aligned and joint-aware diffusion framework that enforces physical constraints by embedding skeletal topology and joint-specific dynamics directly into the diffusion process. Specifically, our framework consists of two key modules, the Joint-Adaptive Noise Generator and the Structure-Aligned Constraint Enforcer. The former component, Joint-Adaptive Noise Generator, infers joint-specific dynamics and injects\nheterogeneous, instance-aware noise per joint and sample to capture spatial variability and enhance motion diversity. The latter component, Structure-Aligned Constraint Enforcer, encodes skeletal topology by modeling joint connectivity and bone lengths from historical motions, and it constrains each denoising step to preserve anatomical consistency. Through their synergistic operation, these modules grant KinemaDiff direct control over physical realism and motion diversity, addressing the common limitations of indirect structural priors and uniform noise application. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, attributable to tailoring the diffusion process through structural alignment and joint-adaptive noise modeling.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Human Motion Prediction"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/58e89c863a0d617e9e078d9baed937014665dcd4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a method to address stochastic human motion prediction, particularly by integrating anatomical consistency into the generative diffusion process.

Conventional methods often suffer from anatomical inconsistencies and ignore heterogeneous joint dynamics. KinemaDiff addresses this by integrating two core modules directly into the diffusion process: (1) a Joint-Adaptive Noise Generator, which learns to inject instance-aware, heterogeneous noise for each joint based on its specific dynamics and motion history, and (2) a Structure-Aligned Constraint Enforcer, which preserves anatomical consistency by embedding skeletal topology (i.e., bone lengths) as an alignment loss during the denoising process. Experiments on the Human3.6M and AMASS datasets demonstrate that KinemaDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in prediction accuracy (ADE/FDE) and realism (FID/CMD)."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper's primary strength lies in its fundamental adaptation of the diffusion process itself, rather than merely modifying the denoiser's network architecture. It embeds kinematic and anatomical priors directly into the noising and denoising steps.\n\nThe Joint-Adaptive Noise Generator is a significant innovation. Moving beyond uniform or static anisotropic noise, this module learns a noise schedule conditioned on both the joint index and its specific motion history. This is more physically grounded, as different joints (e.g., wrist vs. hip) and different motions (e.g., walking vs. jumping) inherently have different degrees of freedom and stochasticity.\n\nThe Structure-Aligned Constraint Enforcer directly tackles a major failure mode of generative models, physical implausibility (e.g., stretching bones). By defining an explicit alignment loss based on bone lengths from observed motion, the model is strongly guided to produce anatomically consistent skeletons.\n\nThe method achieves state-of-the-art results on two standard benchmarks (Human3.6M and AMASS). The improvements in accuracy metrics (ADE/FDE) and, most notably, realism metrics (FID/CMD) are substantial, validating the effectiveness of the proposed components.\n\nThe ablation in Table 3 clearly demonstrates the contribution of each module. The Structure-Aligned module (\"Align\") provides the most significant boost in accuracy (ADE/FDE) and realism (FID), while the Joint-Adaptive Noise (\"J-Noise\") further improves these metrics, confirming their synergistic value."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The name \"Structure-Aligned Constraint Enforcer\" is a misnomer. The method described is a soft constraint or regularizer implemented via a loss function. It \"encourages\" anatomical consistency during training but does not \"enforce\" it, meaning it does not mathematically guarantee that the final output will be physically plausible.\n\nThe alignment loss is defined as the discrepancy between the average bone length over the observed history and the average bone length over the entire predicted future sequence. This is a very weak constraint. It allows for physically impossible motions (e.g., a bone shrinking in one frame and stretching in another) as long as the average length over the sequence is correct. A true physical constraint would require bone lengths to be (nearly) constant at every predicted frame.\n\nSection 3.5 is confusing. It states, \"at each timestep, after the initial encoder, we apply the same operation on $y_0$ to ensure that the human skeleton structure remains consistent\". This implies the alignment loss is applied at every step $t$ of the denoising process. However, the overall loss function and the definition of the alignment loss based on the final prediction suggest it is only applied at the end of the training step. This ambiguity is critical for reproducibility.\n\nThe results (e.g., Table 1) show that while KinemaDiff excels in accuracy and realism, its diversity score (APD) is lower than several baselines. While this is a common trade-off, the paper could benefit from a deeper discussion on whether this is a fundamental consequence of enforcing stricter physical realism or a limitation of the current noise generation module."}, "questions": {"value": "Regarding the \"Constraint Enforcer\": Did you experiment with a stronger, frame-wise alignment loss? For example, penalizing the L1 or L2 deviation from the observed bone length at each predicted future frame $f \\in [1, F]$, rather than just penalizing the deviation of the sequence-level average? If so, how did this impact training stability and the final metrics?\n\nCould you please clarify the exact mechanism described in Section 3.5? Is the alignment loss computed and backpropagated at every denoising timestep $t$ during training? Or is it only applied once to the final prediction $\\hat{y}_0$, as suggested by Equation 12?\n\nFor the Joint-Adaptive Noise Generator, the function $f_{\\theta}$ maps the joint index $j$ and its full history $x_j^{(1:H)}$ to a scaling factor $s_j$. Given that the paper describes this as \"a few linear layers\", how is the variable-length temporal history $x_j^{(1:H)}$ aggregated into a fixed-size vector to be processed by these layers?\n\nThe results show a trade-off between realism/accuracy and diversity (APD). In your view, is this lower diversity a necessary consequence of enforcing strict anatomical constraints (i.e., the model correctly \"prunes\" unrealistic but diverse motions), or do you see potential in the Joint-Adaptive Noise module to further enhance diversity while maintaining the high level of realism?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "plN7jy8mZ9", "forum": "uxTQeKAUh5", "replyto": "uxTQeKAUh5", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18282/Reviewer_grBA"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18282/Reviewer_grBA"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18282/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761927653717, "cdate": 1761927653717, "tmdate": 1762928003157, "mdate": 1762928003157, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents KinemaDiff, a diffusion-based framework for stochastic human motion prediction.
