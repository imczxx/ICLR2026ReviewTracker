Unlike general symbolic regression methods, which seek a single static closed-form expression that may diverge outside the training data or fail to form a valid expression, VISE operates as a hybrid numerical integrator that combines the interpretability of symbolic expressions with the structure-preservation of variational methods. The symbolic expressions serve as adaptive approximation functions with fixed forms whose parameters \nare dynamically updated through discrete Euler-Lagrange equations at each time step. VISE maintains interpretability and inherits the symplectic structure of Hamiltonian systems. Compared to conventional numerical integrators, VISE allows for larger time steps and fewer degrees of freedom, making it potentially suitable for high-dimensional, time-dependent problems where traditional solvers are computationally prohibitive. By leveraging the strengths of both symbolic regression and variational integrators, VISE offers a promising approach for efficiently and accurately solving complex time-dependent systems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Structure Preserving", "ordinary differential equations", "symbolic expression"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4b7469aff6d371f349465010da37380cef5800bd.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents VISE, a method that replaces the trial functions of a Galerkin Variational Integrator with symbolic expressions $q$ on each interval $[t_n, t_{n+1}]$.

While these are both well established techniques, considering a symbolic expression as adaptive basis that is updated via the Euler-Lagrange equations is novel combination of symbolic AI and geometric integration. \n\n- Symbolic regression approaches discover a global expression with fixed parameters, but VISE treats symbolic expressions as local approximation functions with parameters that evolve with the time intervals. This addresses the limitation of symbolic regression for long time evolution of dynamical systems. \n\n- The mathematical derivations are accessible and well presented except for some minor typos in mathematical notation. \n\n- VISE has the potential to include domain knowledge about system behaviour through the symbolic regression design which might be powerful for specific applications."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- VISE guarantees symplecticity because it considers a discrete variational principle via the DEL equations. However they do not discuss the conditions under which this holds. This holds assuming that the DEL system is solved to tolerance (requirement 1) and no correction, constraint or other action is performed outside the variational framework after the DEL solve (requirement 2). It is not shown if the first requirement holds. \n\n- Moreover, there is no momentum preservation statement shown and the energy preservation is questionable as in Table 4 of the Henon-Heiles experiments the Hamiltonian error reaches very high values. \n\n- There is no automatic selection of the symbolic expression, as the authors claim that they manually chose a symbolic expression with good accuracy (line 266) which doesn’t support the claim for an automated data-driven process. Also, it is not transparent what that statement means, they might tried a bunch of the discovered functions and picked the one that works. \n\n- For the harmonic oscillator example the initial symbolic expression is essentially the analytical solution form, which means that comparing  with a Galerkin VI is fundamentally unfair, because it encodes domain knowledge. It would me fair to consider a spectral Galerkin with a sin basis function to make it fair. \n\n- On the Henon-Heiles example the VISE method presents very large errors both in trajectories and Hamiltonian while Galerkin VI is shows machine precision accuracy. This results contradict the superiority statement. \n\n- The authors provide no analysis of the overall computational cost of VISE. \n\n- There is no comparison to other methods such as Hamiltonian Neural Networks (Greydanus 2019), Lagrangian Neural Networks (Cranmer 2020), SympNets (Jin 2020) and no consideration of higher dimensional benchmarks such as coupled oscillators. The authors only consider conservative Hamiltonian systems. \n\n- Maybe I am mistaken but VISE is a Galerkin VI with a different basis. I believe that this should be made clearer as it is directly related to the novelty. \n\n- The authors claim that VISE is suitable for high dimensional problems but evidence is not provided to support this."}, "questions": {"value": "- If the authors run VISE with 10 different seeds and choose the three best performing basis functions to evolve and report the errors.

It seems to me that the SR has a major bottleneck for coupled and high dimensional problems.\n\n- Why does VISE show that high errors for Henon-Heiles? \n\n- How reliable is the solver? What is the Newton Solver failure rate across all examples? The authors refer to convergence issues of the nonlinear solver but no systematic analysis is performed.

Also, the comparisons focus only on classical variational integrators and implicit midpoint methods and comparisons with other SciML approaches (e.g., PINNs, neural operators) are missing\n\nOn the methodological side, the pretraining step for symbolic expressions is not sufficiently clarified. The paper defers heavily to external work and manually selects symbolic forms judged to have “good balance” between accuracy and complexity. This manual choice introduces potential selection bias, especially in cases where closed-form solutions are already known (e.g., harmonic oscillator). A more systematic or automated strategy for expression selection would strengthen the approach and its reproducibility.\n\nWhile mathematically rigorous, the derivations of the discrete Euler–Lagrange updates are dense and may be challenging for a broader ICLR audience. Providing additional intuition, simplifications, or worked examples would make the method more approachable.\n\nFinally, there are some minor issues of polish and precision. For example, line 173 contains a typo (“derivation” instead of “deviation”), and the “Pretraining the Symbolic Expressions” section would benefit from a self-contained explanation rather than relying on external references.
