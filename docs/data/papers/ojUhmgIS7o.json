However, task routing in MAS remains a critical performance bottleneck, especially in dynamic and resource-constrained environments. Existing LLM-based routing approaches often suffer from limited transparency, static allocation strategies, and insufficient system state awareness. To address these challenges, we propose AMRO: Ant colony inspired Multi-agent Routing Optimization. AMRO models agent interactions as a function-based directed graph, utilizing a pheromone-driven node update mechanism and an adaptive pheromone decay strategy to achieve real-time perception and response to environmental changes, thereby continuously optimizing routing assignments. This approach significantly enhances routing efficiency and overall system performance, while the pheromone-guided path selection offers strong interpretability for the routing process. We conduct extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets. The results show that AMRO achieves an average improvement of 1.97\\% in pass@1 accuracy over the baseline and demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness under high concurrency. These findings indicate that AMRO provides an efficient and interpretable solution to the routing problem in LLM-based MAS.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models，Multi-Agent"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/15fa417f81c51dc517d32950026ccb7a657aca49.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tackles the routing bottleneck in LLM-based multi-agent systems, highlighting issues of low transparency, static allocation, and limited system awareness.

The modeling and workflow of the proposed method are not clearly introduced in the main text, leading to confusion. For example, the definition of “layer” only appears in the caption of Figure 2 and is not elaborated upon in the main text. This may easily mislead readers into thinking that the “layers” refer to the central parts of Figure 2—LLM Type, Method Type, and Role Type—which resembles the architecture of MasRouter.\n\n2. The algorithm appears insufficient in customizing the MAS framework at the task- and query-granularity levels. AMRO yields a framework that is globally optimal for the entire training set. However, when the task types in the test set differ significantly from those in the training set (e.g., switching from code generation to mathematical reasoning), the previously optimized framework may no longer be applicable.\n\n3. Furthermore, tasks of different difficulty levels within the same dataset might benefit from different frameworks (e.g., simpler structures for easier questions to reduce overhead and latency). AMRO seems unable to perceive such differences at the query level or to perform customized, query-specific framework adaptation.\n\n4. The paper defines the function Ability(Model) (in Section 3.2.2, around source line 257) but never explains how the specific Ability value for each model is actually calculated.\n\n5.
