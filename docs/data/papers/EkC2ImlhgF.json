Unlike CT and MRI, ultrasound imaging is highly operator dependent, with significant variations across different anatomical regions. Therefore, the ultrasound domain has a significant need for a comprehensive understanding of general ultrasound imaging. To address this, we introduce Dolphin, the first multimodal large language model for ultrasound understanding, including chat and reasoning version. We curate a training dataset with over 2,000,000 instruction–response pairs, integrating domain-specific knowledge in the field of ultrasound, including textbooks, specific clinical guidelines, and public ultrasound datasets, along with synthetic samples and general-domain corpora. Meanwhile, we established the Dolphin Ultrasound Data Protocol to standardize various types of ultrasound data, ensuring consistency, interoperability, and quality across the dataset. While most multimodal medical models do not emphasize medical reasoning capabilities, ultrasound understanding demands strong comprehension and reasoning abilities due to the inherent complexity and variability of ultrasound data. However, real-world ultrasound reasoning data is scarce and difficult to collect, which limits the development of models with advanced understanding. To address this, We propose a three-stage training strategy using easily accessible ultrasound {question-answering} data and synthetic deep-reasoning general-domain data, combining post-training, instruction tuning, and Ultrasound Answer Reward Preference Optimization (UARPO) based reinforcement learning to progressively improve reasoning. On the U2-Bench benchmark across eight clinical ultrasound tasks, Dolphin establishes a new state-of-the-art with a U2-score of 0.5835. Our experiments show that, with reasoning data from other domains, Dolphin exhibits robust reasoning capabilities on complex ultrasound tasks. Moreover, Dolphin achieves higher diagnostic accuracy in deep reasoning mode than in standard mode, indicating that generalized reasoning skills can be effectively transferred to specialized medical domains.", "tldr": "We introduce Dolphin series, the first general-purpose ultrasound multimodal foundation model.

The pipeline uses GPT-4 semantic screening, another LLM for response checks, and a brief mention of medical expert validation, yet the paper does not report who the experts are, how many experts participated, what specialties they represent, what rubric or thresholds were used, or any inter-rater agreement. This makes it hard for peers to reproduce, audit bias, or estimate error rates. Given ultrasound’s dependence on subtle imaging cues like artifacts and view selection, reliance on general LLM judges without detailed safeguards raises the risk that flawed pairs enter the data at scale.\n\n\n2. The set of medical baselines in Table 1 is narrow. The medical-specific block lists MiniGPT-Med and MedDr, while several commonly cited medical models are absent. As a result, the state-of-the-art claim on U2-Bench rests on a comparison that omits strong medical references, which weakens the strength of the claim for the medical VLM landscape.\n\n3. Table 1 lists only MiniGPT-Med and MedDr in the Medical-Specific Open-Source Models block, while widely used medical baselines such as LLaVA-Med and Huatuo-O1 are missing (e.g., I think LLaVA-Med can achieve more than 60% acc on VQA-Rad). Instead, it places LLaVA-1.5-13B under general open-source models, not the medical variant. As a result, the comparison set is narrow and likely weaker, which makes it difficult to judge whether the reported gains truly represent state-of-the-art performance in the medical VLM landscape.\n\n4.
