Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations, persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation. Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g., achieving a hallucination  reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR. Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B, Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions, our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and practical plug-and-play applicability.

Similarly, CHAIR evaluates only 500 MSCOCO images with limited ground-truth information. These benchmarks lack diversity and rigor.

Methods such as PerturboLLaVA [a] and RLAIF-V [b] should be added. \n3. The paper fails to clarify the dimensional matching and semantic alignment of the original image embedding (positive anchor) and the reconstructed image embedding. For example, given visual content differences between the original and reconstructed images (e.g., the latter contains hallucinated objects), it remains unaddressed whether their embeddings—generated via the same image encoder and projection head—reside in the same semantic space.

The paper omits a highly relevant prior work, ConVis (Park et al., 2025), which also employs reconstructed images from hallucinated captions to generate negative anchors and performs training-free contrastive decoding. The overlap in both motivation and method design raises concerns about the novelty of the proposed approach. The authors should include ConVis as a key reference and conduct comparative experiments to clearly differentiate their contribution.\n\n* Dependence on the quality of the image generation model. Since the proposed method relies heavily on the T2I model, its performance may vary depending on the model’s alignment and reconstruction quality. If the generated image introduces irrelevant visual cues, the contrastive signal may fail to reduce hallucination effectively. Moreover, the current experiments appear to use a single image generation, which could be influenced by stochastic variation. Running the T2I process multiple times and reporting averaged results would strengthen the reliability of the findings.\n\n* To further validate the effectiveness of the reconstructed image as a negative anchor, it would be beneficial to evaluate the method on additional benchmarks beyond CHAIR and POPE — for example, PhD (Liu et al., 2025) for counter-commonsense reasoning or another benchmark that assesses general performance besides MME.\n\nMinor: The paper inconsistently uses the terms LVLM and MLLM.
