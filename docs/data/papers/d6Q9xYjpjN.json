Default configurations are often suboptimal for specific problem instances, and traditional automated tuning methods either provide generic ``one-size-fits-all'' solutions or demand significant domain expertise. This paper introduces \\textbf{GRIMIP}, which stands for \\textbf{\\underline{G}}eneral \\textbf{\\underline{R}}easoning for \\textbf{\\underline{I}}nstance-specific \\textbf{\\underline{MIP}} configuration, a novel hybrid intelligence framework that synergistically integrates the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the sample-efficient search of Bayesian Optimization (BO). A key innovation is that while a pure LLM approach is insufficient for BO’s exploration–exploitation trade-off, GRIMIP enables the LLM to function as a complete probabilistic surrogate by jointly predicting performance mean and its uncertainty (standard deviation), a capability that is essential for the Bayesian Optimization exploration–exploitation trade-off. Unlike conventional surrogates such as Gaussian Processes or small neural networks, our LLM-based estimator integrates reasoning about instance-specific structure and uncertainty into a single prompt without additional training, achieving both higher flexibility and lower engineering overhead. The framework leverages an LLM to interpret high-level, instance-specific problem descriptions and generate an initial portfolio of hyperparameter configurations. By tailoring these configurations to individual instances and offering a generalizable approach capable of handling diverse parameter sets, GRIMIP provides a more effective and versatile optimization strategy than traditional methods, enabling adaptive, context-aware parameter recommendations for any given MIP instance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Mixed Integer Programming", "Combinatorial Optimization", "Bayesian Optimization", "Large Language Models"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
