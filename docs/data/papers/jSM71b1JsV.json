Data-driven battery fault diagnosis algorithms, built on real-world operational data, are critical methods for reducing safety risks. However, existing battery datasets have limitations such as insufficient scale, coarse-grained labels, and lack of coverage of real-world operating conditions, which seriously restrict the development of data-driven fault diagnosis algorithms. To address these issues, this paper introduces a large-scale benchmark dataset named \\textbf{CH-BatteryGen}, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first EV battery system fault diagnosis dataset based on real-world operating conditions. This dataset integrates real on-board operation data with mechanism-constrained generative modeling technology, balancing authenticity and scalability. It covers two mainstream battery chemistries, namely nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) lithium batteries and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, and involves charging, discharging, and operation data of 1000 electric vehicles. It provides four fault labels (normal, self-discharge, high-resistance, low-capacity) and three severity level annotations, supporting two benchmark tasks: fault classification and fault grading. Through systematic validation using traditional machine learning methods (random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM)) and deep learning models (long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN)), the results show that the CNN model performs best in the fault classification task, achieving an F1-score of 0.9280 in the LFP discharging scenario; in the fault grading task, the F1-score reaches 0.8813. The CH-BatteryGen dataset has been open-sourced, aiming to provide a standardized evaluation platform for battery fault diagnosis algorithms, promote research development in this field, and contribute to the transformation of sustainable transportation systems.", "tldr": "CH-BatteryGen, the first large-scale real-world EV battery fault dataset, enables classification and severity grading.", "keywords": ["Lithium-ion batteries", "Fault diagnosis", "Benchmark dataset", "Generative modeling", "Time series analysis"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a89989a9208ab7d5d3970b2c542895b0b871fb64.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, a new benchmark (real-calibrated, synthetically generated) for battery fault diagnosis is presented.

The inclusion of both LFP and NCM chemistries, along with data from both charging and discharging conditions, enhances the dataset’s relevance to real-world electric vehicle operations.\n\n- The paper clearly defines two tasks: fault classification and severity grading. These tasks are evaluated using standard metrics such as F1 score, recall, and accuracy, supported by confusion matrices that facilitate interpretability. The addition of a grading task represents a meaningful advancement beyond traditional binary fault detection.\n\n- The data generation process combines AI-generated current profiles with physics-constrained voltage modeling, using an RC model for LFP and a DCWT-based mapping for NCM. This approach balances scalability with domain fidelity by incorporating electrochemical structure into the synthetic data.\n\n- The empirical study includes a range of classical and deep learning methods, from random forests and SVMs to LSTMs and a CNN-based architecture with CBAM attention. The comparison provides a useful baseline for future work, and the CNN’s performance, particularly under discharging conditions, offers practically valuable insights"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- While the reported voltage deviation under 10 mV is promising, more comprehensive tests are missing. These include distribution-level comparisons, condition-dependent realism (e.g., by temperature or state of charge), and consistency across sensor modalities. No validation is performed using real-world fault labels, which weakens claims of external validity.\n\n- There is ambiguity regarding dataset scale and class balance. The claim of 1,000 EVs conflicts with the small global label counts reported (e.g., 400, 30, 30, 40), and it is unclear whether these refer to subsets, chemistries, or scenarios. This uncertainty affects class imbalance, grading reliability, and the credibility of performance metrics.\n\n- The current data split risks train-test leakage. If segments from the same vehicle appear in both sets, this could inflate results. A vehicle-level split should be provided alongside the current file-based split, and metrics should be reported for both.\n\n- The experimental protocol would benefit from stronger validation strategies. Given the dataset's moderate scale, leave-one-vehicle-out cross-validation would provide a more robust assessment of generalization across vehicles and chemistries.\n\n- The cross-domain transfer analysis is underdeveloped. Although the paper suggests cross-chemistry and cross-mode degradation, no explicit train-on-A/test-on-B experiments or confidence intervals are presented. Such comparisons are essential to support generalization claims.\n\n- Baselines do not reflect the current state of the art. Recent time-series models such as transformers or state-space models are absent, despite their known performance advantages in noisy, long-horizon data. Their inclusion could affect conclusions about modality and architecture choices.\n\n- The definition of severity levels lacks operational grounding. Although threshold formulas are provided, the paper does not fully explain how they are calibrated, normalized per battery pack, or made robust to sensor noise and cell variability.\n\n- Details on dataset release and ethical considerations are incomplete. Although the dataset is described as open-source, no repository URL or license is provided in the paper. There is also no discussion of data provenance, real versus synthetic composition, consent, or privacy protections for vehicle identifiers."}, "questions": {"value": "- The reported total of “1000 EVs × 20 segments” appears inconsistent with the global label counts (400, 30, 30, 40). Are these figures per scenario, per chemistry, or based on labeled subsets? Clarifying this would help assess class imbalance and distribution, considering per-task, per-chemistry breakdowns along with severity distributions.\n\n- For single-file experiments, was the data split by vehicle to prevent leakage? If not, re-running experiments with vehicle-level grouping and reporting the resulting changes in performance would be interesting.\n\n- To support claims of cross-chemistry and cross-mode degradation, explicit train-on-LFP/test-on-NCM (and vice versa), as well as charging-to-discharging transfer experiments may be included. Report macro-F1 scores along with confidence intervals.\n\n- Realism validation. Beyond the reported ≤10 mV voltage deviation, can you provide distributional comparisons between real and generated data, such as MMD or spectral distance? Fault-conditioned precision-recall curves stratified by temperature and SOC would further support realism claims.\n\n- How are the R/R95 and Q/Q95 thresholds computed? Are they defined globally or on a per-vehicle or per-chemistry basis? An ablation under simulated sensor noise or inter-cell variability would help assess their robustness.\n\n- Could you clarify the rationale for excluding recent time-series models such as transformers or state-space architectures? Including such baselines, as well as non-image-based temporal models, would help evaluate whether the CNN-based voltage image approach is optimal.\n\n- Real BMS data often include sensor noise, dropout events, and timestamp misalignments.
