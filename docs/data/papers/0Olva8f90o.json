This enables conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning.

The authors state that the NCS method approximates the measurement score through the linear combination of Gaussian noise vectors. Can similar effects be achieved via approximation methods such as Hermite polynomials? After all, Hermite polynomials are the optimal basis functions for Gaussian-related processes.\n3. The authors state that the NCS method can be integrated into sampling strategies such as DDPM. Is NCS incompatible with DDIM out of inverse problems, a more commonly used deterministic sampling method? Can it be extended to Rectified flow in video generation models?\n4. In the description of Figure 1, the authors state that NCS embeds the measurement score into the optimal noise within an ellipsoidal subspace, which is defined by the span of the noise codebook. I confuse that is this definition related to the one in Equation (10)? Why is the noise obtained from a simple weighted sum explained using the concept of an ellipsoidal subspace?\n5. When the authors explain the advantages of NCS, they highlight a key feature: it adheres to conditional constraints while ensuring generation stability.

The review template seems to be missing some elements, such as line numbers and the header stating “Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026.” The former, in particular, would have made it easier to reference specific parts of the text when providing comments.\n2. NCS primarily reparameterizes the noise term in existing diffusion posterior sampling methods, offering little conceptual or theoretical advancement. The “closed-form” derivation is a straightforward application of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, and the claimed improvements over prior approaches are minimal. Overall, the contribution feels incremental rather than a substantive methodological innovation.\n3. The paper claims that the constructed noise combination remains Gaussian if the combination weights are independent of the noise codebook. However, in the proposed method, the weights $𝛾_i$ are computed from the inner products between the codebook vectors and the measurement score, creating explicit statistical dependence between $𝛾_i$ and $ε_i$.

Methods like DPS and MPGD are reasonable baselines but outdated, as many faster samplers now exist (e.g., ΠGDM, DDNM, DiffPIR, MGPS) that achieve strong performance within 50-100 NFEs.

This unifying viewpoint could be valuable for researchers seeking a more cohesive understanding of guidance mechanisms in diffusion models. Also, across multiple datasets and problem types, the NCS variants perform as well as or slightly better than their corresponding baselines, especially when the number of diffusion steps is small. This consistency suggests that the approach is robust and stable in practice. More importantly, the method requires no extra training and introduces negligible additional computational cost.

No quantitative measure or theoretical justification is provided for why embedding the conditional information into the noise term, as opposed to the mean term, should improve results.
