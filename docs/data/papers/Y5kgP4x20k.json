Although various studies have improved prefill stage performance by\nexploiting sparsity structure, sparsity can still be further increased with structure\nrefinements.\nIn this work, we propose an approximate on-line decomposition of the attention\nmatrix which is able to dynamically identify additional sparsity. The attention\nmatrix is decomposed into three components: a slash component, a vertical com-\nponent, and a horizontal component. Each component requires only linear space,\nthereby enabling more efficient processing compared to the full attention matrix.\nThe decomposition is computed from query and key tokens using a linear-time\nalgorithm. The statistical properties of the decomposition allow generation of the\nmask by merely selecting elements that exceed a threshold. The threshold itself\ncan be chosen to limit the difference with regular dense attention or to respect a\ncertain time-budget.\nWe demonstrate that this technique can be directly applied – without requiring\nretraining – to networks employing standard dense attention mechanisms (MHA,\nGQA) and RoPE. We show that precision is maintained across the ∞Bench and\nPG-19 benchmarks for LLAMA-3-8B-INSTRUCT-1048K. Furthermore, we ob-\nserve substantial increases in sparsity and corresponding speedup compared to\nprevious methods.

Additionally, the evaluation is restricted to a single model scale (Llama-3-8B-Instruct), leaving questions about generality and scalability unanswered.\n\nThe contribution over prior work, particularly MInference, is also somewhat incremental. The slash and vertical components largely replicate existing ideas, and while the horizontal factor is novel, its necessity and impact are not convincingly demonstrated. The absence of ablation studies isolating this term makes it difficult to assess how much it contributes to performance or sparsity improvements.\n\nFinally, the paper's results on ∞Bench reveal inconsistent behavior, especially in retrieval-heavy tasks, where the method underperforms compared to prior approaches.
