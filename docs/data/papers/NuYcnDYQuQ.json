This assumption does not hold in open-world settings, where noisy or mismatched inputs are common. Under such conditions, existing attribution methods tend to overfit and generate forced explanations, compromising the reliability and trustworthiness of interpretability results. To address this issue, we observe that a well-balanced trade-off between the compression and prediction terms in the information bottleneck objective can mitigate overfitting. Based on this insight, we propose an attribution framework that leverages an adaptive information bottleneck optimization objective. Our method dynamically adjusts the bottleneck constraints without assuming reliable cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on large-scale image-text datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing attribution methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative interpretability, providing more robust and trustworthy explanations while relaxing the requirement for aligned image-text pairs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Interpretability", "Information Bottleneck", "Multi-Modal Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f903e5b772f37c88c438f15328380508958f2921.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an Adaptive Information Bottleneck (AdaIB), which reformulates the classic IB objective to use sample-dependent weights, $f(X,Y)$ and $g(f)$, for the sufficiency and compression terms, respectively.

The primary theory (Sec 4.3, e.g., Theorem 3 assumes $g$ is a non-increasing *function of* $f$.\n    (ii).  The actual implementation (Sec 5.2) *decouples* these: $f$ is a fixed L2 distance, and $g$ is an independently parameterized MLP.\n    (iii).  While Appendices B.5 and B.6 *mention* this decoupled case, the main theoretical justifications presented in the paper (Sec 4.3) are based on the non-decoupled version. It is unclear if the guarantees from Sec 4.3, which rely on the $g(f)$ relationship, apply to the implemented model.\n3.  Proposition 2 (\"No Gratuitous Leakage\") and its proof seem to be a trivial consequence of the objective function's definition. It merely states that for a fixed sufficiency $I(Z;Y)$, the term $-g(f) \\cdot I(Z;X)$ will, by definition, prefer a smaller $I(Z;X)$ (since $g(f)>0$).

The text defines large f(X,Y) as high relevance (emphasizing sufficiency), but the experiments state “for f we choose the L2 distance by default,” where larger distance means lower relevance. This inverts the intended semantics unless an explicit inversion/monotone mapping is applied. The paper should either use similarity / inverse-distance (as later proposed) or clarify the transformation used in §5.2. \n3. Theory in §4.1–4.3 assumes g is non-increasing in f, but §4.4 later decouples fθ(X,Y) and gϕ(X,Y) (both learnable). Without restoring a monotonicity constraint or proving new conditions, several theorems no longer directly apply. The paper claims properties “continue to hold,” but this needs a precise statement of assumptions and a proof sketch in the main text.\n4. Eq. (13) proposes 𝑔(𝑓)=1/(𝑓+𝜖𝑔), which indeed yields strong compression when 𝑓→0. But combined with the distance-as-𝑓 choice in §5.2, this makes compression weaker for larger distances, contradicting the intended “compress more when relevance is low.” The paper should reconcile Eq. (13) with the actual 𝑓 used.\n5. All results appear to use CLIP ViT-B/32; adding other backbones (e.g., RN50, ViT-L) would test robustness. \n6.

The implementation of f and g is unclear. \n- What's the range of g? In definition 1, $g(f(X,Y)) \\in (0,\\inf)$. In sec 5.2, g is an MLP with relu (is relu added in the middle layers or after the last layer of mlp as in line 314?), which also doesn't have an upper bound.  However, in Figure 4, g seems to be bounded by [0,1].\n- Is g learned for every sample? It seems that the authors use definition 2 in implementation, discarding the constraint that g is a nonincreasing function on f. If g is learned for each sample, as f(x,y) is a constant given x and y, we can keep maximizing the objective by pushing g(x,y) to 0.\n- It's unclear why f is chosen to be a fixed function while g is a learnable function. The experiments have tested different fixed function choices for f and different architectures for g, but don't explain this core design.\n- If f is intended to reflect the relevance between x and y, shouldn't f be inverse L2 instead of L2?\n2. The authors state they prioritize I(Z;Y) for highly relevant image-text pairs, using L2 distance to determine this relevance. However, this metric is problematic for complex captions. A caption might list many objects present in the image alongside some that are not,  resulting in a higher L2 distance (and thus low \"relevance\"). In this scenario, all present objects should be highlighted, but the current implementation will encourage compression. Many visualizations presented in this paper have shown this over-compression. For example, in the \"dog running down a snow covered hill\" example (fifth row of figure 7), AdaIB highlights \"dog\" and \"snow\" \"hill\" in the text but only highlights the \"dog\" in the image.
