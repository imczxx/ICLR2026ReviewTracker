The recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) method, RobustLight, represents a significant step towards practical application, yet it still exhibits critical limitations. These include poor generalization to new city environments, high inference latency that hinders real-time adaptation, and insufficient robustness for industrial-grade deployment, particularly against noisy or damaged sensor data. To overcome these obstacles, we propose RobustLight++, a novel meta-diffusion framework. We establish a theoretical connection between Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) and Reptile meta-learning, creating a powerful approach for robust and inference timeliness TSC. Extensive experiments on real-world TSC datasets demonstrate that RobustLight++ sets a new SoTA. It reduces inference latency by over 91.9\\% compared to its predecessor and improves performance by 7.41\\% to 52.13\\% even under severe sensor damage, proving its industrial-grade reliability. By bridging the gap between research and practical deployment, RobustLight++ paves the way for scalable and efficient real-time traffic optimization across diverse urban landscapes.

Both letter '$t$' and letter '$i$' are used to denote the diffusion step in lines 221-228 and Section 4.2.2. Meanwhile, letter '$t$' denotes the physical timestep of the simulation, and letter '$i$' denotes the task id in Section 4.2.1 as well. **Clearer Clarification should be provided in the paper.**\n\n**[Q2] Inconsistency between theory and practical algorithm**\n\nFrom my perspective, there are two contributions provided in the paper - the theoretical connection and RobustLight++ algorithm. Although the theoretical connection between the DDIM sampling process and the Reptile meta-learning is built in the paper, I didn't see any consistency between the theoretical connection and RobustLight++ algorithm. In other words, **what is the relationship between the DDIM update rule in Equation 5 and the practical meta-learning process in Equation 8?**\n\n**[Q3] Poor description of the training process**\n\nTo my understanding, the diffusion learner training process is consistent with the training process of DSI agent in RobustLight [2]. But it seems like there is no description of this training process in the paper. For readers' better understanding, **additional description of the diffusion learner training process should be included.**\n\n**[Q4] Weak contribution on inference speed**\n\nIn this paper, the inference efficiency is emphasized in multiple sections. But actually, **both DiffLight [1] and RobustLight [2] have adopted or discussed DDIM to accelerate the inference speed in the field of TSC.** Additionally, DDIM has been a common algorithm to accelerate the inference speed of diffusion models.\n\n**[Q5] Limited transfer experiments**\n\nThe key contribution of this paper is to provide a meta-diffusion framework for cross-city traffic signal control. But only a few transfer experiments are provided in the paper. **Multiple transfer study results of RobustLight++ should be provided as the main experiments, including different types of noise (same as the setting in Table 1) and mask (same as the setting in Table 2) in multiple datasets.** Only in this way, can the necessity of the meta-learning framework be proven. There are some examples, including Table 5 in MetaVIM [3] and Table 2 in X-Light [4].\n\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n**[1]** Chen, H., Jiang, Y., Guo, S., Mao, X., Lin, Y., & Wan, H. (2024).
