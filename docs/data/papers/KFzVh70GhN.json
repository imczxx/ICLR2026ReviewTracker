While the paper performs extensive testing on well-established multi-image benchmarks like MMIU, MuirBench, and MIRB, the results remain largely confined to these curated datasets. These benchmarks are useful, but they may not represent the full range of challenges present in real-world multimodal tasks. Real-world images often come with more noise, more complex interactions between images, and varied content that may require a different approach to attention allocation. For instance, highly dynamic images (e.g., images involving fast-moving objects or complex scenes) or images with low resolution might not behave the same way as those in the current benchmarks. Additionally, considering adversarially trained datasets such as the GTSRB dataset [1] is also an option.\n2. One of the strengths of AR is its post-training application, but the computational complexity of the technique remains unclear. The paper does not discuss the scalability of AR, especially in the context of large models or very large datasets. As LMMs continue to grow in size (think of models with billions of parameters), the overhead introduced by manipulating attention matrices post-training could become significant.\n3. While the paper shows that AR improves multi-image understanding, it doesn’t provide a comprehensive ablation study. The authors mention DINO-grounded CLIP score/Masking & Unmasking visual tokens, but they do not break down the impact of each individual component on model performance. Is the core improvement due to DINO-grounded CLIP score, or masking attention sinks & unmasking cross-image links? Given that AR is a post-training edit, understanding which component has the most significant effect would give future researchers a clearer path for improvement.\n4. The paper’s method, AR, focuses on the manipulation of attention weights based on a grounded patch relevance score. While this appears to be effective for the benchmarks, it raises concerns about overfitting the model to certain types of images. Specifically, the reliance on CLIP-based grounding may make the model too dependent on image content that aligns with the predefined semantic concepts of CLIP. When the images do not fit well into these predefined concepts, or when the grounded relevance does not accurately represent task-relevant information, AR's performance will drop.\n\n[1] Stallkamp, J., Schlipsing, M., Salmen, J., & Igel, C.

In practical applications like surveillance or social media analysis, the model will often have to process images that may be blurry, low-resolution, or distorted. Would AR still be effective in such cases, or does the technique rely too heavily on high-quality, well-structured images for successful attention manipulation?\n2. One of the key benefits of the AR method is that it does not require retraining the model. However, what impact does this post-processing step have on real-time performance? In applications where speed is crucial, such as autonomous driving or real-time video analysis, could the time spent remasking attention and recalculating attention scores become a bottleneck?\n3. The current results show that AR improves multi-image accuracy and reduces recency bias. However, over the long term, does it cause any catastrophic forgetting of previously learned behaviors when the model encounters unseen data distributions [2]? \n\n[2] Yang, J., Wang, P., Zou, D., Zhou, Z., Ding, K., Peng, W., ... & Liu, Z.
