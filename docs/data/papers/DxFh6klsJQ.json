We interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target, we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit pathways according to the learned currents.

What's the interpretation of $R_{\\ell,\\ell+1}(x_\\ell,x_{\\ell+1})$? I understood that $\\ell$ is an index for layers, hence is $x_\\ell$ a single node or all the nodes in a layer? In equation 11, what do you mean for $x_\\ell = x_{\\ell+1}$?\n\n3. In equation 12, did you interpret the potential $\\phi$ as a probability distribution? Are you exploiting the law of total probability? In that case, I would expected some integrals, since potentials are continuous. Which is the rationale of the equation?\n\n4. The proposed electrical interpretation of optimal transport leaves me somewhat unconvinced for two main reasons:\n- Defining, in probabilistic terms, the connection of a node $x$ with its nodes in $fan_{out}$ implies that its mass (or current intensity) would be transferred to only one of the output nodes. However, the physics of electrical circuits aligns more naturally with a fuzzy logic interpretation, since in reality the current would split and flow toward all output nodes.\n- The statement \\textit{``Remark 3.4 (Transport plan independence). Potential $\\phi_\\ell(x_\\ell)$ is independent from $\\pi(x_0, x_L)$''} does not correspond well to the physical behavior of electrical circuits. I admit, however, that since it's not clear to me the meaning of $x_0$ and $x_L$, it's difficult to discuss about it.\nCould you better explain your intuition?\n\n5. In equation 14 the ground truth is provided by a Monte Carlo method. May you better explain how to build a suitable network to address optimal transportation problems? May you also explain which is the benefit of your model since in any case there is the need of another estimation approach?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "BexgVX76Yd", "forum": "DxFh6klsJQ", "replyto": "DxFh6klsJQ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9754/Reviewer_biis"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9754/Reviewer_biis"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9754/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761986885926, "cdate": 1761986885926, "tmdate": 1762921247647, "mdate": 1762921247647, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Electric Current Discrete Data Generation (ECD2G), a novel generative modeling framework for discrete data inspired by electrical circuit theory.
