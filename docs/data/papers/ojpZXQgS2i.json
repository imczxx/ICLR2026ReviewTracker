While existing approaches suffer from either prohibitive communication overhead or poor coordination quality, LCA introduces a three-layer alignment mechanism that captures global objectives, shared session states, and individual agent observations, enabling emergent coordination behaviors. Through comprehensive experiments on 25 diverse web automation tasks, we demonstrate that LCA achieves 97.8\\% task success rate with 4.21$\\times$ speedup over sequential processing. Our theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees with $O(n \\log n)$ communication complexity and identifies a critical phase transition at alignment threshold $\\tau = 0.65$, which we validate empirically through extensive ablation studies. Statistical validation across 1000 runs confirms significant improvements over 18 baseline systems ($p < 0.001$), with large effect sizes (Cohen's $d > 0.8$) for key comparisons. The framework demonstrates practical utility through production deployment, processing 10,000+ pages daily within reasonable resource constraints. Our work establishes that lightweight hierarchical coordination, rather than complex communication protocols or massive parallelization, provides the optimal balance between efficiency and quality for multi-agent web automation. The identification of universal phase transition behavior in coordination systems provides theoretical insights applicable to broader multi-agent coordination challenges.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["multi-agent systems", "contextual alignment", "coordination theory", "distributed systems", "hierarchical alignment", "lateral alignment"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0a86f5e5a26246476361ffc7fd63e0ba1e31a1f6.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/34abddb578d9739b326cec8f3e184d4cb6e59434.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper “Layered Contextual Alignment: Multi-Agent Coordination for Web Automation through Hierarchical Preference Learning” proposes a hierarchical coordination framework for multi-agent web automation.

The figure appears to be AI-generated, which does not meet ICLR’s expected presentation standards.\n\nQ4: The abstract claims the system operates “without explicit communication,” yet the shared context layer clearly functions as a communication medium between agents. Could you reconcile this apparent conceptual contradiction?\n\nQ5: The paper omits a citation for LangGraph and lacks engagement with recent research in multi-agent reinforcement learning — particularly in areas such as MARL stability and emergent communication. Could the authors expand on these related works?\n\nQ6: Could you clarify which metric was used to compute the reported Cohen’s d = 6.39?\nIf the effect size was calculated based solely on Time (s), why were other key performance metrics (e.g., Success Rate and Quality) excluded from the effect size analysis?\nMoreover, a Cohen’s d of 6.39 is extraordinarily large and highly unusual — please elaborate on how this value was obtained.\n\nQ7: Why did you construct your own benchmark for evaluation instead of using established public environments such as WebArena or GAIA? Using standard benchmarks would enhance comparability and credibility.\n\nQ8: The paper claims production-level deployment but provides no quantitative report of deployment costs, computational load, or token usage.
