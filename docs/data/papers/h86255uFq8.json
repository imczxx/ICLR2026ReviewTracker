We introduce Attri-SSC-VAE, a novel framework that extends Structured Sparse Coding Variational Autoencoders (SSC-VAEs) with attribute regularization and multi-attribute mapping. Our approach leverages sparse coding to discretize image representations into a dictionary of latent components while preserving generative flexibility through a VAE encoder–decoder structure. To enhance interpretability, we impose attribute regularization on the coding coefficients, explicitly associating dictionary elements with meaningful clinical attributes. Furthermore, a multi-attribute mapping mechanism enables disentanglement across attributes, ensuring that variations in specific coding coefficients correspond to consistent and explainable changes in image features. This property allows for controlled image editing, where manipulating the coefficients associated with target attributes results in semantically aligned modifications in generated images. Experiments on medical imaging datasets demonstrate that Attri-SSC-VAE not only achieves competitive reconstruction and generation performance but also provides interpretable, attribute-aware representations that improve trustworthiness and practical utility in clinical applications.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Structured Sparse Coding", "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)", "Attribute Regularization", "Interpretable Representation Learning", "Controllable Generation", "Explainable Medical Imaging"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b8044818cdb3b5939523d39b6864fd6cb5e46687.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents ATTRI-SSC-VAE, a VAE architecture that learns sparse codes for interpretable attributes in medical images, and shows that fine-grained image generation is achievable by controlling and manipulating the attributes during generative procedure.The proposed method is evaluated extensively on a real-life medical dataset of cardiac MRI, demonstrating consistently improved performance over baselines.

There are mismatch between text and figures, for example, in Figure 1, there is _manipulation phase_ that is undefined elsewhere, and there is _attribute regularization_ and _representation construction_ in the main forward pass, but the loss function (Eqn (2)) only contains encoder and decoder, are those parts of decoder? Could the author provide pseudo codes for better understanding of the procedure?\n3. In Figure 3, I find it difficult to see the difference on generated images, and they all look visually very similar. Could authors elaborate on how to read the red highlight (circles and diagonal lines)? In addition, are there any quantitative measures to justify the claims? Like how much does _LV volume_ increases?\n4. In line 150, what are C and C’ corresponding to?\n5. Please define the acronyms (various metrics) when first-time using it. \n6. Please see weakness number 2. Has the generated images validated on downstream tasks like classification and retrieval?\n7. In general, medical image generation is hard to validate due to hallucinations, and it can generate images that look real but not really compatible with human anatomy, so automatic metrics might not be enough. Are the generated images being evaluated by a physician and deemed authentic?

All results are on EMIDEC only. No cross-center generalization, no OOD or robustness tests, and no 3D volume experiments (despite a 3D encoder/decoder notation). This limits claims about clinical reliability and portability.\n3. Apart from Attri-VAE/variants and MMD in a small table, there’s no comparison to discrete models (VQ-VAE/VQ-VAE-2/VQ-GAN) or recent concept/CBM approaches adapted to medical images.
