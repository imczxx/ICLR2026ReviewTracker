Analyzing this data requires models sensitive to both large-scale anatomical structures and fine-grained textural details. While traditional handcrafted radiomics features often miss subtle multi-scale relationships, standard 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) learn data-driven filters without explicit mechanisms to disentangle structural and textural information. This entanglement can limit model interpretability and robustness. We propose SCOPE-MIA, a 3D framework driven by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that explicitly decomposes learned features into distinct anatomical and textural components. By embedding tailored PDE constraints - such as structure-enhancing diffusion for anatomy and detail-preserving flows for texture - into a modern 3D CNN architecture, we promote the learning of robust, scale-explicit, and disentangled representations. Our system processes volumetric data in tractable subvolumes for efficient training, while a sliding window approach during inference recovers the full 3D context. We present a unified mathematical treatment connecting PDE theory to our dual-pathway architectural design and discuss the advantages of this decomposition for clinical applications. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the clinical gold-standard radiomics pipeline in challenging cancer imaging tasks, showing its potential to advance tumor characterization and biomarker discovery.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Medical Image Analysis", "Partial Differential Equations", "Deep Learning", "3D Convolutional Neural Networks", "Radiomics"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/90733247ec9fd802d9d40af8d8bcd4bd8b122a6e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces SCOPE-MIA, a novel framework for the analysis of 3D medical images.\nCore contributions:\n1.

Novel and Well-Motivated Conceptual Foundation: The core idea of embedding tailored Partial Differential Equation (PDE) constraints to explicitly disentangle anatomical and textural features within a deep learning framework is highly innovative. It provides a principled inductive bias that directly addresses the feature entanglement problem in standard CNNs.\n2.  Rigorous and Clinically Relevant Benchmarking: The choice of the IBSI-compliant PyRadiomics pipeline as the primary benchmark is a significant strength. Demonstrating clear superiority over this established clinical gold-standard is a more impactful and meaningful validation than comparisons against other deep learning models alone, as it directly bridges the gap between advanced research and clinical practice.\n3.  Comprehensive Experimental Validation: The framework is thoroughly evaluated across a wide range of conditions, including multiple public datasets (NSCLC, TCGA, BCBM), imaging modalities (CT, MRI), and clinically critical endpoints (e.g., EGFR status, survival, age, cancer stage). This demonstrates the generalizability and robustness of the proposed method.\n4.  In-Depth Analysis and Ablation: The paper goes beyond simple performance reporting. The inclusion of a detailed ablation study (Table 1) convincingly demonstrates the contribution of each proposed component (e.g., entropy adaptation, attention guidance).

Insufficient Comparison to Deep Learning Baselines: The paper lacks direct and fair performance comparisons against state-of-the-art 3D deep learning models (e.g., plain 3D ResNet, ConvNeXt, or Vision Transformers). The primary benchmark against PyRadiomics alone makes it difficult to discern whether the performance gains stem from the novel PDE components or merely from the use of a powerful 3D CNN backbone.\n2.  Vagueness in Methodological Details: Several critical implementation details of the proposed \"PDE Blocks\" remain unclear. Key aspects, such as which PDE parameters (e.g., diffusion coefficients) are fixed versus learnable, and the precise mechanism for splitting features into anatomical and textual streams (predefined or adaptive), are not sufficiently specified, hindering reproducibility.\n3.  Inadequate Evidence for Feature Disentanglement: The central claim of achieving disentangled anatomical and textural features is not robustly supported. The evidence relies heavily on qualitative activation maps and speculative descriptions of the latent space, lacking quantitative metrics (e.g., mutual information) or direct experiments (e.g., latent space manipulation) to rigorously demonstrate the independence and semantic purity of the two feature streams.\n4.  Incomplete Justification for Computational Overhead: While the paper acknowledges the computational overhead introduced by the PDE modules, it does not sufficiently justify this cost. There is no efficiency-versus-performance trade-off analysis to demonstrate that the performance gain is indeed superior to simply using a larger standard model under a similar computational budget."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The motivation is that existing 3D CNNs learn entangled structural and textural features, mixing smooth anatomical shapes and high-frequency textures within the same feature maps, which can reduce interpretability and robustness. To address this, SCOPE-MIA explicitly decomposes the latent feature space into two complementary streams:\n- An anatomical stream governed by a structure-enhancing diffusion PDE that smooths low-frequency components (large-scale organ and lesion structures).\n- A textural stream governed by a detail-preserving PDE that retains or amplifies high-frequency information (fine tissue textures)."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Limited interpretability on the z embeddings\n- Although the latest representations is decomposed into 2 different representations and these 2 representations are further transformed with the mathematical theory, it is difficult to ensure that the representations is corresponding to either textual or anatomical.

Too many loss functions are controlling the model convergence, leading to a hard time for me to determine why the output is better. It will be great if you can show more visualizations about the embedding distributions, instead of looking into the Grad-CAM, because the Grad-CAM only provides information that how the model's gradient flow through.\n\n2. Weird definition on anatomical and textural details\n- What is the difference between anatomical and textural? Normally we will separate contrast and texture features, learning it independently. Can you clarify more on this?\n\n3. The core novelty of this paper\n- After reading the whole paper, although the core innovation is to adaptive mathematical inductive bias into the latent representation, in fact, the core idea should be proposed a better representations for downstream tasks.
