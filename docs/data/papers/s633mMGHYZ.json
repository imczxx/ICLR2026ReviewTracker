Nevertheless, there is a lack of a comprehensive and standardized benchmark for evaluating the robustness of models against these spurious correlations. To address this crucial issue, we present MPS (Multi - Perspective Benchmark For Assessing Spurious Correlations in Text Classification). To construct this benchmark, we collect eight widely used text classification datasets and introduce five categories of spurious correlations for each of them, producing 40 variants of datasets for comprehensively evaluating spurious correlations in diverse settings.We then extensively evaluate various text classification models and state-of-the-art anti-spurious correlation methods on this benchmark, which uncovers the vulnerabilities of these models and methods to diverse spurious correlations. A follow-up comparative analysis on this benchmark is performed to assess the performance of these anti-spurious correlation methods and humans in diverse settings.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["NLP; Spurious Correlations; Benchmark"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/92881fef663020323fd02d3a75fe472035c1190d.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/39d3a4f93df94a01d3045d9745a5488f7450905e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a multi-perspective benchmark for systematically evaluating how text classifiers rely on spurious correlations, covering five types of spurious cues -- sentence-level, core-word, negation-based, question-based, and word-frequency biases -- across eight popular NLP datasets.

While we will provide point-by-point responses to each reviewer separately, we would first like to clarify several key aspects that may not have been sufficiently articulated in the initial version of the paper. These points are elaborated in detail below.\n\n1.In the first round of experiments, we evaluated several anti-spurious-correlation loss functions using BERT and Qwen as backbones. However, for the Qwen backbone, measurements were only conducted for the NFL loss function family and downsampling. In this revision, we have expanded the benchmark by incorporating DFR and LLR loss functions to ensure a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, we have completed the measurements for the Qwen backbone across these methods, with the exception of JTT, which is not compatible with the Qwen architecture.\n\n2.Our benchmark employs a novel evaluation framework for assessing spurious correlations. The definition of W-ACC (Worst-group Accuracy) was initially presented in the appendix of the first-round submission, where its heavily symbolic notation may have caused some ambiguity. This version rectifies that issue. It is important to note that our implementation of worst-group accuracy is not the conventional one; rather, it represents an optimized version of the metric. The detailed definition can be found in Appendix A.4 of the paper.Since our variant constitutes an optimization that remains fundamentally grounded in the group-based framework, we continue to refer to it as W-ACC.\n\n3.For the evaluation of standard pre-trained models on the benchmark, while the results for SCS-type spurious correlations are presented in the main text, the experimental outcomes for the remaining four types of spurious correlations are provided in the appendix. It should be noted that the color intensity in the table cells is designed to be interpreted through vertical comparison."}}, "id": "rPysQf4wmG", "forum": "s633mMGHYZ", "replyto": "s633mMGHYZ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7442/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7442/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7442/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763129887631, "cdate": 1763129887631, "tmdate": 1763129887631, "mdate": 1763129887631, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces MPS, a benchmark built from 8 text classification datasets to evaluate model robustness under five spurious correlation types, namely SCS, CCS, NBS, QBS, and WFS.
