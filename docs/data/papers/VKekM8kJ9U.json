However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed malicious behaviors using trigger patterns in the training data. These triggers remain dormant during normal usage, but, when activated, can cause targeted misclassifications. In this work, we investigate the internal behavior of backdoored pre-trained encoder-based language models, focusing on the consistent shift in attention and gradient attribution when processing poisoned inputs; where the trigger token dominates both attention and gradient signals, overriding the surrounding context. We propose an inference-time defense that constructs anomaly scores by combining token-level attention and gradient information. Extensive experiments on text classification tasks across diverse backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces attack success rates compared to existing baselines. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability-driven analysis of the scoring mechanism, shedding light on trigger localization and the robustness of the proposed defense.", "tldr": "An Explainable Defense via Gradient-Attention Anomaly Scoring for Pre-trained Language Models", "keywords": ["Backdoor Defense", "Anomaly Detection", "Gradient-Based Attribution", "Attention Mechanisms", "Explainability", "Pre-trained Language Models"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/70a257cb67749b51b0ac092293c06c9c17f8cc79.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/769d087fcb4dc6438b6ede451760f9e0ca319aa2.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces X-GRAAD, a novel inference-time defense framework for detecting and mitigating backdoor attacks in pre-trained language models (PLMs). The method's core idea is that backdoor trigger tokens, when activated, abnormally dominate the model's attention and gradient attribution signals simultaneously. The proposed method operationalizes this insight by combining these two signals to assess the anomaly score of each token. It identifies malicious inputs by searching for a single \"peak\" token with an exceptionally high score. If such a token is found, it is neutralized via a noise injection mechanism before the model generates its final prediction. The authors demonstrate experimentally that this method effectively reduces Attack Success Rates (ASR) while maintaining high Clean Accuracy (CACC).

Combining these two distinct attribution modalities for anomaly detection is a strong starting point.\n2. **Interpretability.** The method not only provides a defense but also offers interpretability via attribution scores (as shown in Figures 2 and 5), helping to localize and understand the behavior of backdoor triggers, which is a valuable feature.\n3. **High Practicality (Efficiency and Simplicity).** As an inference-time defense, X-GRAAD requires no model retraining or fine-tuning. Its computational overhead is far lower than many existing model purification methods as shown in Table 4. This efficiency, combined with its implementation simplicity (relying on standard attribution tools), makes the method highly practical for real-world deployment and reproducibility."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Narrow and Simplistic Threat Model.** The paper's primary weakness is that its strong performance claims are based on an evaluation against a very narrow and simplistic threat model. The experiments (Sec 5.1) almost exclusively use triggers that are short, non-semantic, rare words (e.g., cf, mb). These triggers are statistical outliers by design and are \"easy\" targets for any attribution-based anomaly detector. The evaluation completely omits more advanced, stealthy attacks such as semantic triggers (synonyms), syntactic triggers, or longer phrasal triggers, making it hard to assess the method's generalizability.\n2. **Potential Design Limitations and Vulnerability to Adaptive Attacks.** The defense mechanism's design presents potential limitations. Its reliance on the max operator (Eq. 8) to find a single peak score appears vulnerable to \"distributed triggers\"—a plausible adaptive attack where an adversary uses multiple tokens, each with a low, non-anomalous score, to activate the backdoor. Furthermore, the generality of the character-level \"noise injection\" (Sec 4.2.2) is unclear. While suited for the simple tokens tested, it may be less effective or could potentially risk CACC against semantic triggers (e.g., changing \"price\" to \"pride\").\n3. **Misleading \"Robustness\" Analysis.** The paper fails to test its robustness against these obvious adaptive attacks. Section 5.2.3 is mislabeled as a \"Robustness Analysis\" when it is merely a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis (for the detection threshold $\\tau$). A true robustness evaluation would have tested the defense against an attacker aware of its max-based design, using the very \"distributed trigger\" attack mentioned above. The absence of this analysis is a significant gap.\n4. **Limited Methodological Novelty.** While the idea of combining attention and gradients is smart, the method itself is a relatively straightforward heuristic. The components used (attention maps and input gradients) are standard interpretability techniques, and their combination (a simple product) lacks significant methodological innovation."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The paper's positive results are based on triggers that are easily isolated (short, rare words), which aligns perfectly with the max operator-based detection (Eq. 8). How would X-GRAAD perform against \"distributed triggers\" where the backdoor is activated by multiple tokens (e.g., a phrase) that each contribute a small, non-anomalous score?\n2. Following Q1, have the authors evaluated X-GRAAD against more stealthy triggers that are part of the natural language distribution, such as semantic triggers (e.g., a specific synonym replacing a common word) or syntactic triggers (e.g., a specific sentence structure)?\n3. The robustness analysis in Sec 5.2.3 is a hyperparameter sensitivity test. Could the authors provide a more formal adversarial robustness analysis? Specifically, can they comment on how X-GRAAD would fare against an adaptive attacker who is aware of the max-based design and explicitly crafts a distributed trigger to bypass it?\n4. Regarding the \"noise injection\" (Sec 4.2.2): What is its impact in two failure-case scenarios? (a) If the trigger is a semantic word, how is it neutralized? (b) If the model falsely identifies a critical, clean token (e.g., \"price\") as a trigger and corrupts it (e.g., to \"pride\"), what is the measured impact on Clean Accuracy (CACC)?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "aUfZ6VnJEY", "forum": "VKekM8kJ9U", "replyto": "VKekM8kJ9U", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13098/Reviewer_X2fK"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13098/Reviewer_X2fK"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13098/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761748276323, "cdate": 1761748276323, "tmdate": 1762923823837, "mdate": 1762923823837, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies backdoor detection for LLM embeddings and proposes a framework to identify whether an embedding model is Trojaned based on contrastive probing and embedding-space consistency tests.

The trigger neutralization mechanism (random character-level perturbation) is relatively naive. While the results show it works, it feels less sophisticated than the detection mechanism.\n2.

The detection threshold (e.g., 95th percentile of clean validation scores) is tuned manually and dataset-dependently.
