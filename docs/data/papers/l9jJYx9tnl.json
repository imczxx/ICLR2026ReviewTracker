Poly-FEVER extends FEVER, Climate-FEVER, and SciFact to 77,973 labeled claims across 11 languages—English, Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, Bengali, Japanese, Korean, Tamil, Thai, Georgian, and Amharic—curated to preserve logical equivalence across scripts and morphologies and to focus on verifiable Supported/Refuted cases. We augment each claim with topic metadata derived from a 22-topic LDA model to enable topic-aware evaluation. Claims are translated using Google Cloud Translation and validated with GEMBA scores averaging~90 across languages, supporting high semantic fidelity. Using Poly-FEVER, we benchmark ChatGPT-3.5, LLaMA‑2 (7B/13B/70B), and LLaMA‑3.1‑8B under language-wise, general, and classification prompt families, and study self-detection via rephrasing. We further probe resource imbalance by correlating accuracy with automated web presence (Google hit counts) and test retrieval-augmented generation via DPR over Wikipedia. Results show pronounced cross-lingual disparities: high-resource languages (e.g., English, Chinese) achieve the strongest accuracy, while lower-resource languages (e.g., Amharic, Tamil) lag; accuracy correlates with web presence. Topic structuring consistently benefits lower-resource settings, and RAG provides selective gains (notably in Arabic and Amharic), but can conflict with strong internal priors in high-resource languages.

The motivation is important and interesting for multilingual researchers looking at how hallucination changes across languages. The dataset could be of use for future researchers.\n\nS2. The exploration of how topics relate to claim verification is scientifically interesting and novel to the best of my knowledge."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "W1. Some of the results in the main result (5.3) stand out for being substantially below random chance (50%), suggesting that some of the LLMs may be biased towards one of the two labels. E.g. 19.47% and 26.34%by LLaMA-2 70B. That these performances are so low on a binary classification task suggests something went wrong with the evaluation. \n\nW2. I am not convinced it is valid to cast document-conditioned verification tasks into a documentless hallucination detection task, especially SciFact. Scientific claims, especially those in that dataset, are ambiguous by nature and require grounding context to be evaluatable. Removing the context makes the task nearly impossible for many statements.\n\nW3. From Figure 4 it is claimed that \"models possibly favoring languages that dominate web content, affecting their accuracy in languages with less online presence.\" However, while English (the original source language) is very high and the lowest-presence language, Tamil, is very low, the rest of the results do not back up this claim; Japanese has the second highest overall accuracy despite havinga lower search count than Tamil, the lowest-performing language. Further analysis of this figure, including regression analysis to verify the trend, would be beneficial, though I would suggest removing the result because it does not support the hypothesis.\n\nW4. The analysis of topic-wise performance in L426-434 is speculative and not backed up by evidence or citations. Claims like \"absence of universal standards in evaluating greatness in sports or the arts further complicates claim verification\" and \"Topics such as Politics, Sports, Film/Television, and Warfare History prove challenging across languages due to their subjective nature, where personal biases and interpretations can obscure the distinction between fact and opinion\" should be worded carefully to not be interpreted as scientific findings of the study. \n\nW5. Similarly, L.443 \"topic structuring provides additional contextual grounding, which helps compensate for weaker internal representations in lower-resource languages.\" and L 445 \"[For Tamil] indicating that explicit topic awareness does not always align with the model’s existing representations or may interfere with its learned knowledge.\" -- I do not think that the presented results support either of these claims, the former of which is not consistent across all topics and languages. There is no evidence of whether low performance on the benchmark correlates with weaker internal representations, since there is no investigation of the internal representations or what it would mean to \"align\" with them.  \n\nW6. Table 3 is hard to interpret; the caption seems to suggest it is about translating back from the source language into English (the claim's original language) and then measuring factuality, but the text (L441 to 449) talks about LDA topic structuring \n\nW7. I am not convinced that some of the ablation studies provide scientific value. \n\t* Specifically, Section 5.2, the study of temperature, does not make sense to me for a binary classification task. Raising temperature effectively just adds random noise to the prediction by adding to the probability of the less-likely output. In nearly every row of Table 7, you can see that raising temperature just brings wherever the performance was at temperature 0.1 closer to chance 50%). Rows that were below 50% increase and those that were above decrease.\n\nW8. Manual auditing of the translations that produced the dataset seems necessary but limited. Paragraph L.228-232 describes that the authors are \"fluent in multiple languages\" and reviewed selected claims from multiple translators, but no details about how many claims, how many annotators per claim, etc are provided. It is also hard to understand a GEMBA score of ~90 in the context of building a dataset; how do we know that an average of 10% worse than perfect translations is sufficient to ensure dataset quality? How long was the tail of this score distribution? Why not throw out the translations that scored below some (high) threshold? \n\nW9. Figure 2 is dense, hard to understand, and doing too much. It seems to illustrate all the case studies at once but ultimately does not help to understand the paper (The caption also does not explain what the figure is meant to be; is it an overview of the case studies? )"}, "questions": {"value": "Q1. What LLM(s) were used for tables 3 and 4? Was it evaluated over the entire 77.9K * 11 claim dataset? What explains the massive improvement on Arabic and Amharic just by adding topic labels? This is a counterintuitive finding that merits understanding better. \n\nQ2. Some pieces of language are hard to understand, e.g. \"All results are illustrative and reproducible but not tuned.\" -- what does \"illustrative\" mean? \n\nQ3. Paragraph 316-320 is confusing and doesn't seem relevant to the question of web search hit counts. Why do we need to \"simulate varied internet user environments?\"  \n\nQ4.
