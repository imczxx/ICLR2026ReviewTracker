Parallel Tempering (PT) enhances MCMC's sample efficiency through annealing and parallel computation, propagating samples from tractable reference distributions to intractable targets via state swapping across interpolating distributions. The effectiveness of PT is limited by the often minimal overlap between adjacent distributions in challenging problems, which requires increasing the computational resources to compensate. We introduce a framework that accelerates PT by leveraging neural samplers---including normalising flows, diffusion models, and controlled diffusions---to reduce the required overlap. Our approach utilises neural samplers in parallel, circumventing the computational burden of neural samplers while preserving the asymptotic consistency of classical PT. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically on a variety of multimodal sampling problems that our method improves sample quality, reduces the computational cost compared to classical PT, and enables efficient free energy/normalising constant estimation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["MCMC", "Parallel Tempering", "Diffusion", "Generative Models", "Neural Samplers", "Normalising Flows"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ce22fdc552161a355718df0390eac1a1667cfd55.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This manuscript proposes a framework for the application of neural sampling methods to augment Parallel Tempering (PT) based MCMC.

The presentation based on the Jarzynski framework makes it difficult to follow. A formulation directly grounded in the Metropolis–Hastings framework, with clearly defined target distribution and proposal kernel (see [1]), would greatly improve readability and conceptual clarity.\n* The novelty is rather limited. The deterministic case has already been covered in [2] (as acknowledged by the authors), while the stochastic variant represents only a modest generalization of prior work on AIS [3,4] and SMC methods [5], against which no comparisons are provided.\n* The proposed method does not address one of the core limitation of PT in multi-modal settings : mode switching. It is well known that along tempering paths, probability mass tends to shift abruptly between distinct high-probability regions [5,6], severely hindering mixing and performance in both PT and SMC. Even with accelerated swaps in NF-APT or CMCD-APT, the transition kernels remain local refinements (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) and cannot overcome this issue. Similarly, Diff-APT is affected because its learned marginal distributions rely on score matching, which is known to be mode-blind [7,8,9], causing the learned path to exhibit mode switching as well. Consequently, the method provides limited benefit in genuinely multi-modal settings. This issue becomes more pronounced in higher dimensions (likely explaining the use of a \"perfect\" path in Section 6.2). It would be informative to report results with a learned path. While increasing $K$ and reducing $N$ might partially mitigate this, it does not fundamentally resolve the scalability issue.\n* The evaluation is quite narrow. The round-trip rate is the primary quantitative metric used (except for Fig. 3, which reports free-energy differences, and Figs. 4 and 6–7, which are purely qualitative). This metric alone may obscure important behaviors such as mode switching and limits meaningful comparison to standard PT. The justification for this metric relies solely on [10], which claims PT outperforms neural samplers. Moreover, the only non-PT baseline compared is CMCD, which is known to perform poorly [10,11,12].\n* The target-informed parametrization (L1400) is known to substantially restrict the expressivity of the energy-based model [13] and to introduce significant computational overhead [10], further reducing the appeal of this approach.\n\n[1] Syed, S., Bouchard-Côté, A., Deligiannidis, G., & Doucet, A.

(2022) suggest that these methods \"incur a bias\" similar to the previously mentioned approaches. This interpretation is incorrect. The earlier works (except iDEM) perform variational inference to learn a generative model without data, where the bias arises from optimization and model misspecification. In contrast, the three cited works embedded the models within Monte Carlo schemes - such as IS, AIS, or MCMC - which, in the infinite-particle/chain length limit, correct the bias of the learned model. Their residual bias is purely statistical. Grouping these methods together is therefore misleading.\n* The training procedures are described very vaguely. What are the exact loss functions used, and how are they implemented in practice? How many times is the adaptation loop repeated (i.e., how many optimizations of the data-based loss are performed) ?\n* Could you visualize the learned diffusion potentials path over time for a simple mixture of two one-dimensional Gaussian distributions?\n* Comparisons with standard AIS, SMC, PT (under an equivalent computational budget, including training), and other multimodal samplers (potentially ML-enhanced) on target-specific metrics would be highly informative.\n* For Diff-APT, could you first train an unconstrained energy-based model and then learn an auxiliary function analogous to $r_{\\theta}$ a posteriori? This might help avoid the expressivity constraints imposed by the current formulation.\n* For Diff-APT, why not use the target score matching loss [A], similar to what PDDS employs [B] ?\n* What mechanisms prevent the adaptive procedure from suffering from mode collapse, particularly given the mode-switching phenomenon? This concern is especially relevant since the loss functions include (at least partially) a reverse KL term.\n* According to Appendix D, only a single HMC step is performed for the local exploration move, which seems unrealistically low. Could you provide an ablation study on the swap frequency, i.e., the number of interleaved local steps between swaps?\n* The ManyWell-32 experiment in Appendix E.1 claims to demonstrate recovery of mode weights, yet no quantitative metrics are reported. Why not use the benchmark from [C], which is specifically designed to evaluate this capability?\n* How are the chains initialized in PT/APT?\n* The total number of MCMC steps (50k or 100k) is extremely large. Combined with the adaptive training loop, this implies a substantial computational cost. Could you (i) report actual wall-clock runtimes on a specific hardware setup and (ii) provide an ablation on the total number of MCMC steps?\n* In Fig. 4, how do you explain the large performance gap between Diffusion and Diff-APT? If Diffusion is trained using samples from Diff-APT, this discrepancy seems counterintuitive.\n* For ALDP, how are the chains initialized, and how do you sample from the $T = 1200K$ reference distribution?\n* For ALDP, is the energy parametrization (L1400) rotation-invariant? Additionally, how do you ensure that both the transition kernels and the energy function are defined in the center-of-mass (CoM) space, i.e., the mass-centered coordinate system?\n\n[A] Valentin De Bortoli, Michael Hutchinson, Peter Wirnsberger, & Arnaud Doucet.
