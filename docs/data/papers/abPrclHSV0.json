Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. \nWe find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images.

The study is empirically grounded on translation pairs from OPUS Books and image-caption pairs from Flickr30k, comparing representations from DeepSeek-V3 (a large mixture-of-experts model) with those from LLaMA-3.1-8B, as well as from DinoV2 and image-GPT.\n\nThis paper presents a clearly structured and methodologically consistent investigation of semantic structure in large models.

The topic is timely and of broad relevance to the community, particularly as interpretability and quantitative understanding of large models become increasingly central. In particular, the paper is motivated by a fundamental and well-posed question: where, how, and to what extent semantic information is encoded within and across model modalities.\n\n2. The analysis confirms and consolidates several important intuitions about semantic structure in large models, including the presence of mid-to-late semantic layers, asymmetries in token dependencies, and layerwise cross-modal alignment."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The paper’s central question is ambitious, but the empirical evidence is too limited to support it.\nThe work aims to explain where and how semantic information is encoded across models and modalities, yet the experiments cover only two language models (DeepSeek-V3 (MoE, 671B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B (dense, 8B)) and a single multimodal dataset (Flickr30k). Without intermediate scales, architecture controls, or broader datasets, the conclusions about model size, semantic bands, and cross-modal generality remain under-supported and potentially confounded.\n\n2. The definition of “semantic information” is overly tied to a single metric (II) and representation choice. The operationalization of II relies on binarized activations and small-k neighbor overlap, which may neglect richer structural information such as real-valued distances or rank-order consistency. Although the supplemental material includes one real-valued comparison, the overall analysis lacks rigorous metric ablation or validation using rank-sensitive alternatives such as NDCG or Kendall’s tau. Overall the choice can be acceptable, but it needs side-by-side validation to acknowledge the method’s limits. \n\n3. Several findings largely reiterate existing observations, and the related work review is insufficiently comprehensive.\nPrior research has already shown that mid-to-late layers encode more transferable and semantically structured features, that larger models exhibit stronger long-range token dependencies, and that cross-modal alignment often emerges at specific intermediate layers. While applying the II metric as a probe for information content is novel and conceptually interesting, the overall advancement over these established insights remains limited. Moreover, the discussion of related work does not sufficiently situate the paper within this literature, making it difficult to assess the true scope of novelty. A more thorough review and positioning of prior probing and representation studies would help clarify the paper’s contribution."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

This feels unclear if it would hold for encoder only or multimodal generative systems. This type of restricted generality is one of the weaker parts of the work. \n\nWhile a variety of models are tested, most comparisons are only between two model scales eg 8b vs 671b which would limit conclusions about scaling trends or arch dependence. \n\nOne last minor note is with presentation, the paper is occasionally heavy on technical detail without enough intuitive interpretation of figures or implications."}, "questions": {"value": "Could the authors further elaborate on why II was chosen over more standard representational similarity measures like CKA, cvcca, etc.? II seems to provide an asymmetric view, which is helpful, but would be helpful to know if the location of the ‘semantic layer’ would be the same under a symmetric similarity measure. ie do the layers with minimal II also correspond to peaks in mutual similarity index? Clarifying this would also help cement or strengthen that these layers are truly special, and not simply an artifact of the particular metric. This would also provide additional interpretability of the absolute II values.\nA followup is, how precisely is the semantic region defined? Is it by a threshold or by visual inspection of II minima? Could there be the possibility of multiple disjoint semantic pockets?\nIt is not clear whether these effects generalize to encoder-only or non-autoregressive models like BERT, XLM.
