Many PH based schemes in graph learning employ inclusion-based filtration mechanisms that trace a sequence of subgraphs of increasing size, maintaining bookkeeping information about the evolution (e.g., in terms of birth and death of components). We offer a novel perspective that goes beyond this inclusion paradigm. Specifically, we introduce topological descriptors for graphs, simplices, and cells that interleave a sequence of inclusions with a sequence of contractions and related families parametrized by two functions. The resulting descriptors on the extended sequence are provably more expressive than many existing PH methods with suitable stability conditions. Empirical results substantiate the merits of the proposed approach.", "tldr": "We provide an interleaving of inclusions and contractions to discuss persistence for graphs, simplices, and cells.", "keywords": ["Graph neural networks", "topological neural networks", "persistent homology"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/892c476098ef22d16bcdd26010f1734b166ae5b9.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f760bf97dc4ccaca9f18149bae98fceab9566505.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Hourglass Persistence (HP), a novel topological descriptor that generalizes traditional persistent homology (PH) through alternating inclusion and contraction steps.

While the proposed method combines forward and backward (f,g)(f,g)-FB persistence, the actual contribution of the core idea — the backward filtration itself — remains unclear. Moreover, it is not evident how (f,g)(f,g)-FB persistence fundamentally differs from simply combining features derived from two filtrations. In general, combining multiple heterogeneous features often leads to performance gains, so the improvement shown here may not be specific to the proposed formulation.\n    \n- Although the notion of backward filtration is not identical, similar ideas have been explored in approaches such as Zigzag filtration [1]. The distinction between these existing methods and the proposed one is insufficiently clarified.\n    \n- The combination of two filtrations has also been proposed in prior work [2]. While the meaning differs due to the reversed filtration direction, the proposed combination seems to follow a rather straightforward idea, making it difficult to consider the novelty as significant.\n    \n- Since this conference focuses on machine learning and deep learning, introducing a new idea in persistent homology alone is not sufficient to meet the scope. It is therefore crucial to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in machine learning applications, but the current experimental evidence is not sufficient. In addition, Theorem 1 appears to be merely the authors’ claim and does not constitute a theorem in a rigorous sense. A theorem should be written in a mathematically precise manner that clearly states in what sense the proposed method is effective.\n\n[1] G.
