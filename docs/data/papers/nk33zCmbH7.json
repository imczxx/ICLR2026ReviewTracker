We present **Scale-DiT**, a new diffusion framework that introduces hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear, while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that **Scale-DiT** achieves more than $2\\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \\times 4K$ resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons, **Scale-DiT** delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training. Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Efficient 4K Image Generation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/10d468d392cddf34a3500c6c8c7acdfe71846481.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6ca52cc57789e77485e7fdf3f5c52d47f837a295.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents an efficient framework for ultra-high-resolution image generation.
