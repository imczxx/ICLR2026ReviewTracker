Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a scalable solution for integrating external knowledge into LLMs without additional training, and while it performs well in general domains, its effectiveness is limited in medical settings that demand high terminological precision and factual consistency. To address this, we propose a medical-domain-oriented RAG framework, IBGraphRAG, which integrates medical knowledge graphs with two key technical innovations: (1) Medical Semantic Consistency Alignment, which improves entity recognition and linking by enforcing semantic consistency with a structured medical knowledge base; and (2) Information Bottleneck-based Reasoning Path, which prioritizes retaining highly relevant contextual information during knowledge graph retrieval while avoiding irrelevant or superficial paths. Experimental results show that IBGraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple medical question-answering benchmark datasets, effectively improves the specialization and accuracy of the retriever in selecting reasoning paths over the knowledge graph, helping the LLM better identify relevant knowledge for reasoning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["LLM", "Retrieval-Augmented Generation", "Medica"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3cf1878ec50fe84a64b1b0f6d46f29444fdffcda.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The main contribution of this paper is a three-phase knowledge-graph-powered approach for medical question answering / fact verification: 1) use an LLM to extract entities from a user query, then augment with a medical knowledge base (this includes enriching with synonyms and encoding with BioWordVec); 2) information bottleneck over a query graph to find \"reasoning paths\" between a question and answer; 3) an LLM takes as input information retrieved from the knowledge graph to generate a final answer.

It involves training a GNN, an MLP scoring function, and a separate \"parametric variational decoder $r_{\\psi}$\" just to make the IB loss function tractable. This is a massive level of complexity for a retrieval component. I would like to see some complexity and latency analysis for the proposed framework.\n3.
