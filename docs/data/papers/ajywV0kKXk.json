Most existing approaches represent molecules as atom-level\ngraphs; however, individual atoms cannot express stereochemistry, lone pairs,\nconjugation, and other complex features. Fragment-based methods (e.g., principal\nsubgraph or functional group libraries) fail to preserve essential information such\nas chirality, aromatic bond integrity, and ionic states. This work addresses these\nlimitations from two aspects. (i) **OverlapBPE tokenization**. We propose a\nnovel data-driven molecule tokenization method. Unlike existing approaches, our\nmethod allows overlapping fragments, reflecting the inherently fuzzy boundaries\nof small-molecule substructures and, together with enriched chemical information\nat the token level, thereby preserving a more complete chemical context. (ii) **h-\nMINT model**. We develop a hierarchical molecular interaction network capable\nof jointly modeling drug–target interactions at both atom and fragment levels. By\nsupporting fragment overlaps, the model naturally accommodates the many-to-\nmany atom–fragment mappings introduced by the OverlapBPE scheme. Extensive\nevaluation against state-of-the-art methods shows our method improves binding\naffinity prediction by 2-4% Pearson/Spearman correlation on PDBBind and LBA,\nenhances virtual screening by 1-3% in key metrics on DUD-E and LIT-PCBA, and\nachieves the best overall HTS performance on PubChem assays.

The core architecture of the h-MINT model is heavily built upon existing equivariant graph transformers. The paper states that h-MINT follows GET's architecture.
