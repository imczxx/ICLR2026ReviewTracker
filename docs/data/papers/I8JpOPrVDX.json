While discrete flow matching models have recently shown promise for efficient sampling in high‐dimensional sequence spaces, existing approaches address only single objectives or require continuous embeddings that can distort discrete distributions. We present **Multi‐Objective‐Guided Discrete Flow Matching (MOG-DFM)**, a general framework to steer any pretrained discrete‐time flow matching generator toward Pareto‐efficient trade‐offs across multiple scalar objectives. At each sampling step, MOG-DFM computes a hybrid rank‐directional score for candidate transitions and applies an adaptive hypercone filter to enforce consistent multi‐objective progression. We also trained two unconditional discrete flow matching models, **PepDFM** for diverse peptide generation and **EnhancerDFM** for functional enhancer DNA generation, as base generation models for MOG-DFM. We demonstrate MOG‑DFM’s effectiveness in generating peptide binders optimized across five properties (hemolysis, non‑fouling, solubility, half‑life, and binding affinity), and in designing DNA sequences with specific enhancer classes and DNA shapes. In total, MOG-DFM proves to be a powerful tool for multi-property-guided biomolecule sequence design.", "tldr": "MOG-DFM introduces multi-objective guidance for discrete flow matching, steering peptide and DNA sequence generation toward Pareto-efficient trade-offs across competing biological properties.", "keywords": ["multi-objective optimization", "discrete flow matching", "Pareto front", "hypercone filtering", "peptide binders", "enhancer DNA", "controllable generation"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4c32dc043eb5d86699b3134a6cc176a5125b4dd3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes MOG-DFM (Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Flow Matching), a framework to steer pretrained discrete flow matching (DFM) generators toward Pareto-efficient trade-offs over multiple scalar objectives for biological sequence design.

This limits the novelty and methodological contribution of the proposed method. Also, the difference and novelty, especially in comparison to ParetoFlow are not clearly stated.\n- In step 1, the authors randomly select one position on the sequence to update. This is very inefficient, especially when the sequence length is long.\n- In Table 3, MOG-DFM takes a significantly longer time than PepTune+DPLM. Therefore, a naive improvement of PepTune+DPLM under the same computational cost would be generating multiple samples from PepTune+DPLM (to keep the total time the same as MOG-DFM) and utilizing best-of-N on top of these samples. This should offer a fair comparison between PepTune+DPLM and MOG-DFM.\n- The experimental results lack comparison to baseline methods. All the tables and figures, except for table 3, only present the performance of MOG-DFM or its comparison with the pretrained model without any guidance. Even in table 3, only PepTune and other very traditional MOO methods are compared with. The comparison with other reward-guided sampling baselines or RL fine-tuning baselines is missing. Although these guidance-based methods are not designed for Pareto optimization, they can be naively adapted to achieve multi-objective optimization by enforcing certain weights to balance these objectives into a single aggregated objective.
