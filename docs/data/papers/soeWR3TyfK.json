Accurate prediction of extreme MHWs has significant scientific and financial worth. However, existing methods still have certain limitations in forecasting general patterns and extreme events. In this study, to address these issues, based on the physical nature of MHWs, we created a novel hybrid data-driven and numerical MHWs forecast framework Ocean-E2E, which is capable of 40-day accurate MHW forecasting with end-to-end data assimilation. Our framework significantly improves the forecast ability of MHWs by explicitly modeling the effect of oceanic mesoscale advection and air-sea interaction based on a dynamic kernel. Furthermore, Ocean-E2E is capable of end-to-end MHWs forecast and regional high-resolution prediction, allowing our framework to operate completely independently of numerical models while outperforming the current state-of-the-art ocean numerical/AI forecasting-assimilation models. Experimental results show that the proposed framework performs excellently on global-to-regional scales and short-to-long-term forecasts, especially in those most extreme MHWs. Overall, our model provides a framework for forecasting and understanding MHWs and other climate extremes.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["AI4Science"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/10111781f9064518c1188eee5d24195eb9ecf0d5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7590d1fc6700252270c735533e2a48b1a9d42565.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Ocean-E2E, a hybrid model for global and regional forecasting of marine heatwaves (MHWs).

The method extends known hybridization and neural DA approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new architectures or learning principles.\n\n- The model combines many moving parts: four neural submodules (forecast, assimilation, atmosphere, and ocean currents), multiple pretrained components, and nested equations: but provides minimal insight into why this integration leads to improvement. There is little analysis of sensitivity, error propagation, or interpretability of the learned dynamics.\n\n- While multiple datasets and baselines are reported, the analysis is largely quantitative (RMSE/CSI) and lacks physical diagnostics, such as conservation checks, energy spectra, or feature attribution. Results could be inflated by tuning or preprocessing differences; no uncertainty estimates or robustness tests are included.\n\n- The assimilation process uses “Kirsch-guided reparameterization”  but lacks ablation or comparison to established data assimilation networks (e.g., 4DVarNet, EnKF emulators).

More specifically, the two tasks of assimilating observations (to estimate global fields which can be used as initial conditions for simulations) and predicting the time evolution, are addressed by introducing 4 specific neural networks that remplace classical PDE solvers. \n\nThe article is quite well organized to understand the rationales from the physics of formulating then problem in the way the paper is doing it. Using the dynamical equation for the evolution of the sea surface temperature (eq 2 to 6) would solve the problem, but for the initial condition (hence the need of data assimilation) and some missing elements of the models. The proposed NN approach fills these gaps and it makes use of 4 neural networks : to predict the evolution of the atmosphere variables (eq 16) ; to forecast (and model) the evolution of geostrophic velocity (eq 15) ; to model source of heat flux (eq. 13) and to model subgrid and subsurface contribution to adjective transport (eq. 11).\n\nWith all that, forecast using these models to remplace some PDE’s  and a straightforward data assimilation method, allows the authors to have a method to predict the evolution of sea surface temperature anomaly, and possibly detect marine heatwaves.

The presentation seems to be tailored for people from oceanography, more than people from machine learning. The work is on a specific questions of forecasting + data assimilation in numerical oceanographical model, but without any attempt to see what would be general for other dynamical systems.\n\n2. In 2.2, we don’t  know where the equations come from; there isn’t any reference in fact for them. If one does nothing about modeling of sea / atmosphere of the earth, one will not know what geostrophic velocity is. We don’t know if the equation would be the same for the SST as for the SSTA here. In fact, we don’t have a clear definition of what is the anomaly w.r.t. SST ? (in 3.1, it is said that the seasonal cycle has been removed: no consequence of that on the time derivatives ? Also, is it a seasonal cycle per pixel ? or a spatially averaged one ?)\n\n3. A key point appears to be the lack of understanding about what happens under the surface. This appears to be the point fo the GM90 parametrisation and step 1. Would it be possible to know something about subsurface dynamics, or even average profiles ? Also, is actually a marine heatwave only characterize by the SST (or SSTA) ? Nothing from the subsurface temperature ? \n\n4. It is strange to spend most of the presentation to derive the equations in physics (with only scarce references), which will not be really discussed in this community, while elements about the learning parts are only in the appendix. For all the models, one would like to know if some specific choices are important, if a model is better than another, and so on.\n\n\n\n5.

Could it be made stable by modelling better the flows (and damping by hand with a GM velocity  or mitigating the numerical instabilities ? Here, we lack some baseline of pure numerical modelling.
