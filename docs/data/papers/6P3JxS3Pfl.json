This separation is crucial in domains such as biomedicine, where generalization to new treatments, patients, or species requires isolating stable biological signals from context-dependent effects. While several VAE-based extensions aim to achieve this, they often exhibit leakage between latent variables, limiting generalization.\nWe introduce DisCoVR, a variational framework that explicitly separates invariant and condition-specific factors through: (i) a dual-latent architecture, (ii) parallel reconstructions to keep both representations informative, and (iii) a max–min objective that enforces separation without handcrafted priors.\nWe show this objective maximizes data likelihood, promotes disentanglement, and admits a unique equilibrium.\nEmpirically, DisCoVR achieves stronger disentanglement on synthetic data, natural images, and single-cell RNA-seq datasets, establishing it as a principled approach for multi-condition representation learning.", "tldr": "This work proposes a variational framework that disentangles shared and condition-specific factors using a dual-latent architecture and reconstructions, allowing for invariant representation learning.", "keywords": ["Disentangled representation learning", "domain invariance", "variational inference"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f627f7154f9eee53b8190e127ec53bb0e04c4487.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/15dd4b04850025ce23cfccea6e19f29c98207968.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "DisCoVR is a variational framework that separates invariant and condition-specific factors using a dual-latent architecture, parallel reconstructions, and a max–min objective to improve disentanglement and generalization across conditions."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

It can be understood that doing so will require z to be informative, but the informativeness of z should already be encouraged by the reconstruction loss formulated on x from q(z|x). More importantly, it seems that it would create a conflict with the intended disentangling objective between z and w. The validity of this design should be better clarified theoretically/analytically, and ablated experimentally.\n\nThe choice to have the adversarial classifier to work on reconstructed x instead of z also is not well justified. The authors explained that this will “reduce the variance introduced by sampling z from q(z), but the reconstruction of x would also require that sampling before y is applied. Furthermore, the authors stated that the classifier will be optimized separately from the rest of the model: it is not clear if the loss of this classifier actually goes back to optimize the rest of the model (e.g., q(z|x))\n\nOverall, detailed ablation are needed for these key elements of the methods. Especially since some of these seem to be the key differentiators from existing works, e.g., the use of classifier on reconstructed x instead of z seems to be the main difference from CSVAE\n\nExperimental evaluation can be improved in several aspects:\n-\tWhy is disentangling score (I(z;w)) not presented for Table 1\n-\tWhy is standard deviation only reported for some metrics but not others? Are the standard deviation not from multiple runs with random seeds?\n-\tExperimental results are the two natural image datasets are difficult to interpret. Figure 3 in colored MNIST is very difficult to interpret, to assess what are supposed to be condition-invariant z and what are condition-specific w. Similarly for CelebA (as shown in Fig 3), it is not clear why the domain-invariant representation should add an eyeglass to all images (since the presence of an eyeglass is specific to the label 0)."}, "questions": {"value": "-\tBetter clarify the prior coupling for w and z which seem to create conflict for the intended independence between these two latent representations & the main goal of the paper.\n\n-\tThe independence of z and y depends quite significantly on adversarial learning, and hence the classifier. So, the capacity and performance of the classifier is possible to limit it. The choice of having this classifier on reconstructed x instead of z needs to be better elaborated as well as experimentally ablated.\n\n-\tAdd detailed ablation to show which specific added/modified component in the proposed method leads to the most benefit would be good to have.\n\n-\tBetter explain the results (in terms of what are expected condition-invariant vs. -specific representations) for the two natural image datasets.\n\n- The method is explained and experiments are conducted considering single condition (label) with multiple classes (the authors do mention multi-condition in section 2 but based on description multi-condition seem to be multiple classes within a label).

For example, first, the proof of B.1 for the key Proposition 2.1 does not look correct from (17) to (18). In (17), it appears that the -logp(z,w| x, y) is broken down into -logp(w|x, y) - logp(z|w, x, y), so this −logp(w|x, y) cancels the later +logp(w|x, y) in (17). However, why is $E_{q(w | x, y)}$ dropped when there remains a term logp(z|w, x, y) that still includes w inside the expectation? It would only make sense if z and w are independent given x, y, which clearly contradicts the proposed model as the authors claim in lines 88 and 307 that z and w are not independent given x, y.\n\nSecond, while the authors claim that the proposed method aims to reduce reliance on restrictive priors (line 50), why are there still priors needed in Eqns (3) and (4), even though they are class-wise priors? Is there any miscommunication here? Besides, the reasoning from lines 120-123 is not clear. A more detailed analysis and proof are necessary to explain why Eqn (4) is key to constraining z to depend only on x.\n\n(W2) The evaluation of the disentangled representations is weak. First, the authors only select one disentanglement metric, mutual information estimated by MINE. However, MINE estimation is well-known to be unstable [1]. Other popular disentanglement metrics, like MIG and the Factor-VAE one, should also be included for comprehensive evaluations of the disentangled representations. Additionally, the MINE metric is only reported in Table 2, and Table 1 has no disentanglement metrics reported.\n\nSecond, the qualitative results are not convincing. Popular traversal plots of the learned representation are missing in this paper. Also, the CelebA results in Figure 4 look confusing. No evidence clearly supports that z learned the label-invariant representations. Semantically, should z learn “no-glass” features instead of “semi-glass” features here? The authors are encouraged to conduct similar experiments on simple datasets like Color-MNIST, and to clearly demonstrate that using z can reconstruct the same digit types with no effects of colors.\n\n[1] Song, Jiaming, and Stefano Ermon. \"Understanding the limitations of variational mutual information estimators.\" ICLR 2020."}, "questions": {"value": "(Q1) The authors are encouaged to presond to my concerns listed in the Weakness sections.
