We introduce a Latent Back-projection Network (LBN) which learns a latent representation of the imaged volume, enabling re-projecion of micrographs at tilt angles which cannot be experimentally collected. Our model is trained as a masked autoencoder on a large dataset of real Cryo-ET tilt series. This allows the model to learn to realistically impute missing information, with the appropriate physical constraints imposed by our back-projection and re-projection architecture. Through evaluations on real tilt series with excluded tilts, the missing wedge of simulated tilt series, and synthetic augmentation to tomogram reconstruction, LBN demonstrates generative capabilities which overcome limitations of prior approaches. Additionally, LBN is designed as a general model, providing a path toward an easily distributed pre-trained method for missing-wedge correction.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["deep learning", "cryo-em", "cryo-et", "autoencoder", "representation learning"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0d5689269b0a766edbb4027890687fc009ae9a09.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a special network architecture to reconstruct Cryo-ET images and correct for the missing wedge in the measurement setup.

Its broader impact outside the Cryo-ET field is limited, which may reduce the interest for a wider audience.\nThe core approach—based on autoencoders and back-projection—is relatively standard in image reconstruction literature. While the integration into a latent space is novel for Cryo-ET, the overall framework (e.g., ResNet/UNet components) lacks strong innovation compared to recent advances in generative models (e.g., diffusion models or transformers). This limits the perceived novelty and impact.\nThe method description in the main text is brief, with critical implementation details (e.g., network architectures, hyperparameters) relegated to the appendix. This makes it difficult to assess the depth of the contribution.\nThe comparisons are restricted to WBP and IsoNet, overlooking other recent deep learning methods. The results show marginal improvements (e.g., slight FSC gains in Figure 4), which may not justify the complexity of the model. Additionally, the evaluation on simulated data (SHREC) is not sufficiently rigorous—real-world applicability remains uncertain due to the idealized setup.\nThe \"leave-1-out\" experiment for real data (Table 1) may not fully capture the missing wedge problem, as it only omits single tilts rather than continuous angular ranges.
