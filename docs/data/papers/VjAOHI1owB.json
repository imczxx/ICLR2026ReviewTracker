To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new scaling axis—token-indexed parameters—that decouples model capacity from computational cost. We present ReToken and Mixture of ReToken (MoRT), which augment transformer layers with token-specific modulation vectors retrieved from learned embedding tables. These vectors are applied through table lookups and element-wise operations, adding negligible FLOPs compared to the backbone's $O(d^2)$ complexity per token. Across dense and MoE backbones (190M–3B parameters), our method consistently reduces training loss and substantially improves downstream task accuracy while maintaining unchanged inference FLOPs and latency. Our scaling law analysis reveals that MoRT introduces a multiplicative improvement factor to the loss function, fundamentally shifting the quality-compute Pareto frontier, achieving equivalent model quality with 25-30\\% less compute compared to baseline MoE models. These results establish token-indexed parameters as an effective scaling dimension for continued LLM advancement without proportional compute increases.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["LLM", "compute-efficient", "residual modulation", "layer embedding", "MoE", "scaling law"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fb24ee4f8acc9a35e6db404ef195a4595c2ab969.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work introduces training Dense MLP and MoE transformers with (big) lookup tables.

First, the lookup tables introduces a lot of additional parameters.

Therefore, the authors should focus their analysis on the $\\eta$ (Parameter Ratio) and $\\rho$ (Activation Sparsity) components, plot the loss scaling curves under different $\\eta$ and $\\rho$ settings, different model scales, and investigate whether the observed performance gains can be transferred across varying model scales, as these are often more important.\n\nW4: The authors have mentioned that cross-layer residual connections can mitigate the issue of computation bubbles caused by excessive memory access and communication overhead, which frequently arises when scaling up to larger model scales.
