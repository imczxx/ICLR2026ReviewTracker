However, the acquisition of such data is often limited by cost and feasibility. This problem can be tackled by reconstructing high-resolution signals from low-resolution inputs based on specific priors, known as super-resolution. While extensively studied in computer vision, directly transferring image super-resolution techniques to time series is not trivial. To address this challenge at a fundamental level, we propose **S**uper-**R**esolution for **T**ime series (SRT), a novel framework that reconstructs temporal patterns lost in low-resolution inputs via disentangled rectified flow. SRT decomposes the input into trend and seasonal components, aligns them to the target resolution using an implicit neural representation, and leverages a novel cross-resolution attention mechanism to guide the generation of high-resolution details. We further introduce SRT-large, a scaled-up version with extensive pretraining, which enables strong zero-shot super-resolution capability. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that SRT and SRT-large consistently outperform existing methods across multiple scale factors, showing both robust performance and the effectiveness of each component in our architecture.", "tldr": "We propose SRT, a novel disentangled rectified flow framework for time series super-resolution that generates high-resolution details from low-resolution data, achieving state-of-the-art performance across nine benchmarks.", "keywords": ["Time Series Super-Resolution", "Rectified Flow", "Temporal Disentanglement", "Implicit Neural Representations"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f649aac3d9ad7af140cf5212759ff2de52fff908.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/fd586e88954925f5784fc86bd7ae47790b259d3c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This manuscript introduces a framework for time series super-resolution that leverages a decomposition-based approach combined with a rectified flow mechanism.

It is among the first to formally define and tackle the distinct problems of SSR and ASR in time series. The proposed architecture is a creative and non-trivial synthesis of time series decomposition, implicit neural representations, and modern generative models (rectified flow), moving beyond simple adaptations of image-based methods.\n\n- **Significance:** The ability to perform high-fidelity TSSR, especially for the ill-posed ASR task and in a zero-shot setting, is highly significant for many real-world applications where high-resolution data collection is constrained. The proposed benchmark and clear problem definitions provide a solid foundation for future research.\n\n- **Quality and Clarity:** The paper is well-structured and the method is clearly explained. The experimental design is thorough, evaluating on nine diverse datasets and using both point-wise (MSE) and structural (DTW) metrics. The comprehensive ablation studies and component analysis convincingly validate the design choices. The introduction of a large-scale pre-trained model for zero-shot super-resolution is a notable contribution."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **Computational Efficiency:** While the rectified flow enables faster sampling than diffusion models, the paper does not discuss the overall training or inference cost of SRT and SRT-large. The computational burden of the two-stage training (PD and then reverse diffusion) and the large-scale pre-training for SRT-large could be a practical limitation. A comparison of inference time with baselines would be informative.\n\n- **Limitation of Decomposition Priors:** The method heavily relies on the assumption that time series can be effectively disentangled into trend and seasonal components. While this holds for many periodic signals, its performance on time series with irregular, non-stationary, or abrupt transient patterns is less clear and could be a limitation.\n\n- **Baseline Adaptations:** The baselines are primarily adapted from other domains (image SR) or tasks (imputation/generation).
