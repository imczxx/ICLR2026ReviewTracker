To address this challenge, this paper proposes Kalman Policy Fusion (KPF), a novel decision fusion mechanism inspired by the Kalman filter. The core of the KPF mechanism lies in the learning-oriented adaptive weighting and iterative optimization of policy distributions during testing. It dynamically fuses multi-agent policies while minimizing their differences, thus effectively improving generalization and robustness in highly stochastic environments and achieving exceptional performance in dynamic adversarial tasks. Furthermore, this work is the first to empirically and systematically demonstrate that the efficacy of the base models, their distributional characteristics, and their mutual complementarity are the key prerequisites that determine the upper bound of fusion performance. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our mechanism establishes new SOTA benchmarks across four diverse environments, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) and its successor SMACv2, Google Research Football (GRF), and the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE). Notably, within the complex domain of StarCraft II, KPF achieves a perfect 100% win rate on numerous challenging maps. By optimizing policy weights to approximate an unknown optimal policy, our results validate the efficacy of the Kalman-based approach in MARL decision optimization, offering valuable insights for building more robust and efficient multi-agent systems.Our code will be released on GitHub upon acceptance.", "tldr": "We propose a Kalman-inspired fusion framework that dynamically integrates multiple MARL policies to minimize decision uncertainty, achieving SOTA performance that includes a 100% win rate on many of SMAC's most challenging scenarios.", "keywords": ["Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "Policy Fusion", "Kalman Filter", "Online Adaptation", "Uncertainty Estimation", "Ensemble Methods"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dc44d8d5020903e8770ceddf22a47fd0eec567f9.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper propose to enhance the generalization capability of MARL in adversarial competition via Kalman policy fusion.

On one hand, the problem is important and the result is promising. On the other hand, the motivation is not immediately clear to me and the comoparison with related baselines are required.\n\n1. My biggest concern is why Kalman filtering is proposed as a particularly important way of policy fusion. While Bayesian estimation provides a nice framework of making decisions under uncertainties, I wonder why Kalman filtering is selected over learning-based methods, and since in Eqn. 2 the method is using a heuristic metric unrelated to reward to measure the policy weighting, I wonder what is the underlying reason of it to work empirically.\n\n2. This is a theoretical discussion. Technically different policies master different type of tasks. But why a re-weighting of different policies can guarantee performance improvement? For example, in SMAC, if policy A tends to attack upper enemies,  while policy B tends to attack bottom  enemies, then mixing them harms focus fire and is no longer optimal.\n\n3. Since the method highlight generalization performance, the method should also discuss and compare with generalization/transferability in MARL, such as [1]  and [2]. Also, existing literature includes methods like task/role decomposition, which is not well discussed and compared in the paper. Finally, since authors highlight the generalization capability, tasks apart from standard evaluation schemes should be designed to verify the generalization capability.\n\n[1] Cooperative Multi-Agent Transfer Learning with Level-Adaptive Credit Assignment\n\n[2] Decompose a Task into Generalizable Subtasks in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\n4.

While the Kalman analogy is creative, the core of KPF essentially performs a weighted averaging of policy distributions based on covariance heuristics. The “Kalman” aspect functions largely as a metaphorical framing rather than a mathematically rigorous adaptation.\n2. Although the paper claims KPF is optimal in MMSE sense and ensures convergence, this is not formally proven. There are no theorems or convergence proofs beyond inheriting properties from the classical Kalman filter (which assumes linear Gaussian systems — not the case here). Without bounding analyses or stability proofs under nonlinear policy distributions, the theoretical assurances remain speculative.\n3. The analysis focuses on a specific pair of fused models (HAPPO + HATRPO). It remains unclear whether KPF generalizes across heterogeneous architecture types (e.g., combining value-based and policy-based MARL). \n4.

Can KPF tolerate significantly weaker auxiliary models, or does their noise dominate the fusion? The paper currently assumes both base models are “high-quality.”\n6.
