We introduce Q1Fold, a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional network for RNA secondary structure prediction.

This design avoids barren plateaus and is compatible with current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computers. Despite using significantly fewer parameters, Q1Fold achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods. The extracted quantum features also demonstrate superior capability in representing local structural motifs such as hairpins.

The core idea of using a VQC as a convolutional layer is established in prior work, and the classical ResNet backbone is architecturally similar to existing RNA folding networks like sincFold. The work is effectively an \"A+B\" paper (HQC-CNN + RNA ResNet) and does not offer a fundamental new algorithm or theoretical insight into why quantum features should be uniquely suited for this task beyond parameter efficiency.\n\n## Poor Performance on All Fronts:\n\nThe model is not competitive with SOTA.\n\n### Critical Generalization Failure\n\nOn the bpRNA-new dataset, which tests for cross-family generalization, Q1Fold's performance collapses (F1 score of 0.406). It is drastically outperformed by older methods like MXfold2 and even the traditional thermodynamic model RNAfold (both >0.6 F1 score), demonstrating a failure to learn generalizable principles of RNA folding.\n\n### Non-Competitive Test Set Performance\n\nEven on the standard bpRNA-TSO test set, the model's performance (F1 0.635) is not SOTA. It is significantly outperformed by more recent methods like BPfold (F1 ~0.701) and large language models such as Uni-RNA and RiNALMo, which have reported much higher scores on this benchmark.\n\n## Unsubstantiated Efficiency Claims and No Practical Advantage\n\nThe paper claims parameter efficiency but provides no FLOPs or runtime comparison table to support claims of computational efficiency. In fact, the authors admit their simulation is 5-10 times slower than classical models. Without outperforming classical methods on accuracy or demonstrating a computational speedup, the model offers no practical quantum advantage and is, in its current simulated form, strictly worse than existing classical solutions."}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "No ethics concerns identified"}, "rating": {"value": 0}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "SPQRtOEqvN", "forum": "ElRM4Zi91B", "replyto": "ElRM4Zi91B", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10016/Reviewer_D5rG"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10016/Reviewer_D5rG"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10016/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761894946610, "cdate": 1761894946610, "tmdate": 1762921432112, "mdate": 1762921432112, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a quantum computing-based learning framework to tackle the problem of predicting RNA secondary structure from sequence.
