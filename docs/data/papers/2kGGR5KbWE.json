The article focuses on relatively recent, deep-learning based methods and does not attempt to review previous classical efforts. Previous to deep-learning, vessel segmentation methods used vesselness methods [1], many of which were reviewed and evaluated in [2]. Relatively recent projects have contributed to very similar objectives [3].\n\nOverall the paper reads well but some important details are obscured in supplementary material, for example the CFD readiness evaluation is only partly automated. Difficult cases still need to be corrected by hand. This is not clear in the main article. \n\nIt is not absolutely clear what CFD results present in the proposed dataset consist off, and what they are used for. In the paper they are not evaluated, only the amenability of result for CFD computation is. It would be extremely useful to associate the CFD results with some clinical evaluation, e.g is an aneurism dangerous? does it need to be operated on? What are the criteria, etc. Since this is the claimed end result of the proposed pipeline, this would seem essential.\n\nThe vessels segmentation method uses the clDice method which does not offer guarantee of connectivity contrary to what the authors imply. Indeed the skeleton the clDice is the medial axis, computed through the Lantuejoul formula, which does not yield connected voxels. Instead they should use a truly connected skeleton computable by deep-learning layers [4] or the skeleton recall loss [5] which is connected and very fast. Their results would likely improve.\n\n\n\n[1] A.F. Frangi, W.J. Niessen, L.V. Koen, and M.A. Viergever.
