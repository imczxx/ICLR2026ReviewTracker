While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity through the random denoising process.\nIn this work, we propose treating disease dynamics as a velocity field and leveraging Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, our approach captures the intrinsic dynamics of disease, making progression more interpretable.\nHowever, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Autoencoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical severity (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose learning patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitudes increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space.\nTogether, we present ∆-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, ∆-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, establishes a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics.", "tldr": "∆-LFM models disease progression as a velocity field with flow matching, aligning patient trajectories to be continuous, monotonic, and clinically meaningful for interpretable analysis across MRI benchmarks.", "keywords": ["Medical Image Generation", "Longitudinal Analysis", "Flow Matching"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6708c2170bd0a7434f9ef83d00c58d133416a573.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The research team introduces $\\Delta$-LFM for longitudinal MRI modeling that learns patient-specific disease trajectories as continuous latent flows.

The authors mentioned that the proposed method “treats the disease dynamic as a velocity field” when modeling disease progression. As a result, I believe it is expected to compare against ImageFlowNet [1], since the design philosophy is similar. The authors can stay assured that I recognize the novelty of this submission, since there are sufficient distinctions, namely (1) flow matching instead of neural differential equations and (2) the ArcRank alignment.\n\n    b. I am also aware of a recent work [2] that uses flow matching for disease progression in longitudinal images, but comparison against it will be an unreasonable request, because it is too recent (Oct 2025) and the code is not available.\n\n2. For methods that forecasts longitudinal images, one major concern I have is that they tend to overly reconstructing and minimally forecasting. A common shortcoming I observe in this field is the underestimation of changes in the images over time. In this paper, the authors have not sufficiently shown that the proposed method is not simply performing very good reconstruction of the input image. For example, in Table 4 in appendix, the authors showed the forecasting performance degrades as the time horizon increases, but that could also be explained by an alternative hypothesis that the prediction is just a reconstruction of the input. I would like to see how the authors can argue against my concern.\n\n[1] ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Image-Level Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images, ICASSP 2025 Oral.\n\n[2] Longitudinal Flow Matching for Trajectory Modeling, arXiv 2025."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

This loss enforces patient-specific trajectory alignment and temporal ordering. The trajectory alignment is achieved using angle matching of features in the latent space, while the monotonic growth of time features is achieved by temporal ordering (ranking).\n\nAnother contributions is the reformulation of flow matching by extending the sampling strategy from a fixed unit interval to an arbitrary interval. This improves the accuracy and minimizes residual errors, especially with arbitrary time-domain patient samples. \n\nExperimental evaluations over multiple datasets is a strength. \n\nThe close clustering of patient identity as well as diagnosis status helps demonstrate the interpretability of the method.
