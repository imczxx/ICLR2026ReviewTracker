Efficiently solving this problem has implications ranging from pharmaceuticals to organic semiconductors, as crystal packing directly governs the physical and chemical properties of organic solids. In this paper, we introduce $\\textrm{OXtal}$, a large-scale $100\\textrm{M}$ parameter all-atom diffusion model that directly learns the conditional joint distribution over intramolecular conformations and periodic packing. To efficiently scale $\\textrm{OXtal}$, we abandon explicit equivariant architectures imposing inductive bias arising from crystal symmetries in favor of data augmentation strategies. We further propose a novel crystallization-inspired lattice-free training scheme, $\\textit{Stoichiometric Stochastic Shell Sampling}$ ($S^4$), that efficiently captures long-range interactions while sidestepping explicit lattice parametrization---thus enabling more scalable architectural choices at all-atom resolution. Trained on $600 \\text{K}$ experimentally validated crystal structures (including rigid and flexible molecules, co-crystals, and solvates), $\\textrm{OXtal}$ achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements over prior $\\textit{ab-initio}$ ML CSP methods, which remaining orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional quantum-chemical approaches.
