However, compared to the more widely studied MHC-I in computational immunotherapy, the study of MHC-II antigenic epitope poses significantly more challenges due to its complex binding specificity and ambiguous motif patterns. Consequently, existing datasets for MHC-II interactions are  smaller and less standardized than those available for MHC-I. To address these challenges, we present a well-curated dataset derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other public sources. It not only extends and standardizes existing peptide–MHC-II datasets, but also introduces a novel antigen–MHC-II dataset with richer biological context. Leveraging this dataset, we formulate three major machine learning (ML) tasks of peptide binding, peptide presentation, and antigen presentation, which progressively capture the broader biological processes within the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway. We further employ a multi-scale evaluation framework to benchmark our best approach against existing methods, along with comprehensive ablations covering input configurations, model architectures, training strategies, and task formulations. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing computational immunotherapy, providing a foundation for future research in ML guided epitope discovery and predictive modeling of immune responses.", "tldr": "We present a comprehensive dataset on MHC-II antigen presentation to accelerate research in computational immunotherapy.", "keywords": ["MHC-II Epitope Discovery; Multi-scale Antigen Presentation Prediction"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cc38037674588378e0a918ba77b7d6b19ee797f6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a large and standardized human MHC-II dataset encompassing peptide binding affinity, peptide presentation, and a novel antigen-level presentation task with antigen annotations.

The authors should include a diagram of the model architecture to clearly illustrate the framework to readers, including the key components for both peptide-level and antigen-level presentation modeling.

In Tables 3–5, the accuracy metric appears to be biased, as the threshold is fixed at 0.5. In contrast, NetMHCIIpan reports a top-ranked percentile score, which is normalized and therefore may provide a more appropriate decision threshold (top-20% or top-30%) than a fixed 0.5 cutoff.\n\n3. In Table 5, additional comparisons with other peptide-based methods are necessary, especially considering the NetMHCIIpan-4.3 with context information used.\n\n4. The peptide-based prediction appears to use the full-length protein sequence, applying a fixed 9-mer sliding window. In contrast, the antigen-based prediction seems to be conducted on k-length fragments, which reduces the effective search space and may artificially inflate the reported accuracy. \n\n5. In the Method Comparison section, it is unclear whether the other models were retrained on the same dataset or evaluated using their original parameters. If they were not retrained, could this affect the fairness of the comparison? Additional clarification is needed.\n\nMinor \n1. In Table 1, the data statistics are inconsistent with the textual description. For instance, the text mentions 141K BA pairs covering 78 MHC-II molecules, whereas Table 1 reports 136K pairs and 77 MHC-IIs. Please verify and ensure consistency between the text and tables. \n\n2.
