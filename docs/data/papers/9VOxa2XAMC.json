However, deep learning approaches often suffer from limited generalization ability to unseen patients due to inter-patient variability in EEG. While existing studies primarily focus on model architecture design or pre-training strategies to alleviate the problem, the optimization framework for robust cross-patient generalization, especially under the inherently spatiotemporal structure of EEG, remains underexplored. In this work, we propose SpatioTemporal Distributionally Robust Optimization (STDRO), a novel method to improve cross-patient seizure analysis in parallel to existing architectural/pre-training solutions. STDRO constructs and learns structured uncertainty sets that explicitly capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of EEG signals, thereby inducing data-adaptive worst-case distributions for robust optimization and improving cross-patient generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of STDRO as a plug-and-play approach to consistently enhance state-of-the-art seizure detection and classification models across diverse evaluation scenarios. Our work advances robust EEG-based seizure analysis toward practical applications with cross-patient scenarios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multivariate Signals", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy Seizure", "Distributionally robust optimization"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d42214c35ed64e9623124c0c1838c38b9288ebba.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces STDRO, a spatiotemporal distributionally robust optimization framework for cross-patient EEG seizure detection and classification.\n\nThe proposed method enhances existing architectures (DCRNN, GraphS4former, VQ-MTM) with a new optimization objective that learns uncertainty sets capturing EEG spatial correlations and temporal dependencies.

There is no analysis or evidence illustrating how this affects training stability, convergence, or runtime. The added bi-level optimization seems to introduce major complexity for relatively small empirical gains.\n- Objective formulation: The objective remains vague and underspecified. The definition of the stability term and patient grouping strategy appears arbitrary. The learnable matrix Mₜ is poorly explained. Its structure and dimensionality are unclear, and there is no intuition for what it learns or how it interacts with Wₜ.\n- Inconsistent improvements: There is no explanation for the large variability in reported gains (e.g., from +58% to +69% in one setup but only +0–5% in others).\n- Statistical significance: The lack of significance testing is a serious issue. Given the small differences in performance, it’s entirely possible that the improvements are not meaningful. Ablation studies should include multiple seeds or data splits to assess robustness.\n- Splitting protocol: TUSZ has an official split, yet the authors use a 90/10 random split, breaking the standard evaluation protocol and compromising comparability. CHB-MIT lacks a predefined split, so proper cross-validation is expected but not described.\n- Visualization: The covariate-weight figures are illustrative but fail to demonstrate how or why STDRO improves robustness.\n- Presentation: The paper is algebraically overloaded. Core ideas should be kept concise in the main text, with derivations moved to the appendix.\n- Generality: The method is heavily tailored to seizure datasets, suggesting limited transferability to other time-series tasks without further validation.\n- Metrics: The authors only report sample-based metrics (F1, AUROC), while the field is increasingly shifting toward event-based metrics (IoU, IoU@0.5) that better capture the real objective of seizure detection. Reporting F1 for comparison is fine, but including event-level metrics would have provided a more complete picture."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Training behavior: Can you provide more insight into the practical impact of the proposed optimization on training dynamics (compute time, stability, and convergence) compared to standard baselines?\n\n4. Hyperparameter sensitivity: How sensitive are your results to the choice of α and β in Eq. (2)? Some intuition or plots showing their influence would clarify how to tune the method.\n\n5. Interpretability of Mₜ: Could you offer a more intuitive explanation or visualization of what the learnable matrix Mₜ actually learns and how it interacts with the fixed Wₜ during training?\n\n6. Split protocol and reproducibility: For TUSZ, the 90/10 random split deviates from the predefined standard. Or maybe you use it? Could you clarify how you ensured patient disjointness and comparability with prior work?\n\n7.
