Yet leveraging brain recordings to actively guide LM training remains underexplored. Here, we address this question by investigating whether functional MRI recordings can guide LLM training by aligning language representations with brain dynamics. Using over 50 hours of fMRI data from six participants watching Friends, plus 10 hours of held-out movies, we augmented pre-trained and randomly initialized LMs with a brain alignment module and compared multiple training strategies. Our results show three main findings. First, brain-informed fine-tuning consistently outperforms text-only baselines and brain-from-scratch models, with voxel-level gains that scale with both model size (GPT-2 124M, LLaMA-2 7B) and training duration (1–40 hours). These improvements generalize across participants and out-of-sample movies, yielding robust cross-subject and cross-stimulus encoding. Second, a dual-objective loss that balances language modeling with brain alignment surpasses brain-only optimization, producing more stable and generalizable encoders. Finally, brain supervision enriches LM representations with multisensory inductive biases: brain-fine-tuned models outperform unimodal baselines on VL-Commonsense, better capturing perceptual and associative properties (e.g., color, shape, co-occurrence) that text-only training underrepresents. Together, these results establish cortical dynamics as an effective supervisory signal, enabling scalable, generalizable, and brain-aligned LMs that internalize aspects of human-like multimodal representation.", "tldr": "We show that brain-informed training of language models, using dual objectives and scaling across data, models, and subjects, yields robust and generalizable alignment with human brain activity beyond baselines.", "keywords": ["Language models", "fMRI", "Encoding models", "naturalistic stimulus", "Representation Learning", "Multimodal Learning", "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)", "Transfer Learning", "Neuroscience-Informed AI", "Scalability", "Generalizability"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/88e12edfd2a5e85bc41b8134b798939c093b5c2d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates how fMRI recordings can be used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) toward human brain activity.

First some parts of the methods are insufficiently explained:\n- The concepts of brain-fine-tuned, brain-from-scratch, brain-only are not well explained early on in the paper (in the abstract and introduction) and complexify the understanding of the paper. \n- The reasoning behind using an LLM architecture randomly initialised and train it only on brain data is not clear. \n- The input data used (which texts? transcripts? captions?) is not described in the main text. \n- Ridge modelling approach (4.3); is a new ridge model trained for each test subject? how does it impact the generalisation claim?\n\n2. Some of the key hypotheses remain vague.\n- Choice of some of hyperparameters, see next section for more details.\n- The rationale behind training “brain-from-scratch” models is weak; given the data scale, the risk of overfitting is great. \n- Missing or vague methodological justifications (e.g., why voxel-wise linear encoding? why not spatially constrained or surface-based models?.\n- missing some real baseline to compare the performance of the model (simple correlation model between language embedding and brain activation to compare with fine-tuning). \n\n3. The results section is not strong enough to convince about the value of the method and more importantly to support the main claims that are made throughout the paper ( \"substantially improve\", generalisation to new subjects, to new stimuli etc...).\n- Some claims sound conclusive but are only suggestive, such as the generalisability to new stimuli and to new subjects. There are no quantitative metrics supporting the generalisation capabilities of the model to new subject and new stimuli. Only some figure are presented (in the appendix), without colour scale, and without any way of interpreting how good the performance are. \n- Similarly the VL-Commonsense (CoDa) results would benefit from more detailed analysis (which objects are better classified etc.. ), what are the prompts, how differ semantically the answers of the models - as it is now, it is unclear what is actually improved/learned by the model by fine-tuning on brain data (is it the additional training on new input texts that is helping the model or is it the actual prediction task?)\n\n4. The paper would benefit from better evaluation of the performance:\n- Generally I found it very difficult to appreciate the results due to the absence of real baseline. How would perform a simple correlation model between language embeddings and fMRI activations (similar to J. Millet et al 2022 - Toward a realistic model of speech processing in the brain with self-supervised learning)\n- Missing proper quantitative evaluation regarding generalisation performance, maybe some correlation scores per region? auditory, language area etc. Is the correlation score the best metric to assess the generalisation performance? what about stimuli (audio, visual or text) retrieval ? (see Dahan et al 2025 - SIM: Surface-based fMRI Analysis for Inter-Subject Multimodal Decoding from Movie-Watching Experiments)\n- More systematic evaluations than correlation maps (difficult to read).\n\n5. The paper overall needs substantial polishing in writing, structure, and presentation. The writing and figure design need substantial polishing for clarity and readability.\n- Some of the concepts are not really introduced or cited (such as LoRA ).\n- The phrasing is often unclear; several paragraphs (e.g., first in Related Work) would benefit from rewriting.\n- Figure 1, should present the different training schemes more clearly.\n- Legends in figures are not self-explanatory, it is not said what types of maps is shown what is show (Figure 6); Figure 4 lacks clarity."}, "questions": {"value": "- Could you provide more rational of the use of 32 tokens as a context window?\n\n- How are the LoRA layers selected within the model? \n\n- How would you evaluate the risk of overfitting of training a LLM architecture on a relatively small dataset? \n\n- What are the main limitations of the dataset (small N, inter-session variability)? How dependent are results of generalisation and sensory representation on this specific dataset? Have you considered richer benchmarks such as audiovisual captioning or narrative reasoning tasks to validate multimodal grounding?\n\n- In terms of generalisation, what would be the comparative encoding scores when trained/tested directly on Movie10? \n\n- it might be interesting as a lower bound of the experiment, to have the correlation score using a text-only model while finetuning only final layer to predict the brain activity (from text embeddings).\n\n- It is not clear from the text to which training scheme refers the mention to \"brain-only\" ?
