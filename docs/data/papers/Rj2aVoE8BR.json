We establish lower bounds for the minimax learning rate over broad function classes with bounded Kolmogorov entropy in Lebesgue norms. A key novelty of our work is the derivation of lower bounds on the worst-case learning rates under a geometric margin condition---a setting that is almost universally satisfied in practice but remains theoretically challenging. Moreover, our results deal with the noiseless setting, where lower bounds are particularly hard to establish. We apply our general results to classification problems with decision boundaries belonging to several function classes: for Barron-regular functions, Hölder-continuous functions, and convex functions with strong margins, we identify optimal rates close to the fast learning rates of $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ samples.", "tldr": "Novel lower bounds on learning are derived for noise-free classification problems with strong margin conditions", "keywords": ["Neural networks", "binary classification", "learning bounds", "entropy", "margin"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9aa6186bcd065bd501eec9ca4ad52739a79a08b8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
