We address this through the problem of \\emph{community membership hiding} (CMH), which seeks edge modifications that cause a target node to exit its original community, regardless of the detection algorithm employed. Prior work has focused on non-overlapping community detection, where trivial strategies often suffice, but real-world graphs are better modeled by overlapping communities, where such strategies fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formalize and address CMH in this setting. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that learns effective modification policies, including the use of proxy nodes, while preserving graph structure. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, offering a principled tool for privacy-preserving graph modification with overlapping communities.", "tldr": "We propose a reinforcement learning approach with proxy node injection to hide community membership in graphs, tackling the harder overlapping community setting while preserving graph structure", "keywords": ["Graph learning", "Privacy preservation", "Adversarial attacks", "Reinforcement learning", "GNNs", "Social Networks", "Community Hiding", "Overlapping Community Detection", "PPO"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7f1e3bcc4d5009a81ccad624ceb5a356249d2852.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the Community Membership Hiding problem in the challenging, realistic setting of overlapping communities.

The paper's claim to be the \"first to formalize and address CMH under overlapping community detection\" may need to be revisited. The problem of hiding membership in overlapping communities has been explored in prior works [1][2][3].

The current baselines are primarily variations applied within the proposed proxy-injection framework. The comparison should include established, state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for overlapping community hiding.\n\n3. The proposed ODRL method requires repeated queries to a community detection oracle, which can be computationally intensive. The current experiments are conducted on relatively small graphs. To demonstrate practical viability for real-world applications, it would be beneficial to evaluate the method on larger-scale datasets and discuss potential optimization strategies to mitigate the computational overhead.\n\n4.
