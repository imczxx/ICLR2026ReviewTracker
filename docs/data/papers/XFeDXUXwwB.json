To solve this, a two-phase training framework is proposed to disentangle those two components, where the first phase aligns the semantic representation part of the network with a pretrained encoder, and the second phase fits the whole network with a standard diffusion loss and the alignment loss.

The definition of the joint conditional score in Eq (6) is incorrect. In a score matching objective, the target score to be matched should be the score of a probability distribution over $z_t$ rather than $z_0$. Hence, I believe Eq (6) should be $\\nabla\\_{z_t} \\log p(z_t, r|z_0, t)=\\nabla\\_{z_t} \\log p(z_t|z_0, r, t)+\\nabla\\_{z_t} \\log p(r|z_0, t)$.\n2. The generation process defined in Eq (10) is incorrect. According to Eq (11), $\\mathcal{G}\\_{\\theta\\_{R2G}}(r_t, t)$ approximates the conditional generation score. However, in the denoising process of a diffusion model, this score does not directly correspond to a denoised latent $z_{t-\\Delta  t}$. The correct way to obtain $z_{t-\\Delta  t}$ is to solve the reverse SDE of the diffusion process using $\\mathcal{G}\\_{\\theta\\_{R2G}}(r_t, t)$.\n3. The novelty of the proposed method is limited and does not meet the acceptance bar in my opinion. The core techniques in the proposed two-phase training framework (alignment and generation) are directly taken from existing methods in the literature.\n4. Given the incremental nature of the proposed method, it is not sufficient to demonstrate the advantages of the method on the ImageNet image generation task alone. I would expect to see a more compressive empirical evaluation on more complicated tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation, video generation).\n5. The proposed method requires a pretrained encoder for alignment, which may not always be available (e.g., in video generation tasks).\n6.
