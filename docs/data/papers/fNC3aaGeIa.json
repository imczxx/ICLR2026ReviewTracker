For signal reconstruction, it learns a dictionary that holds atomic features, which increases flexibility across signal waveforms and spatio-temporal signal patterns. \nCompared to the state of the art, SpaRTran cuts positioning error by up to 28% and increases top-1 codebook selection accuracy for beamforming by 26%pts.

Also \"dense rotation and diagonal scaling\" in the latest paragraph seems bit out of context and what is the basis set which is generally infinite? Also there are quite many notations such as $a_{i,j}$ and $f_{i,j}$.  Also, they start with \"We treat the incoming signal as a time-dependent function f(t)\", but what is this incoming signal actually is? In radio concept, the incoming signal would perhaps be the received signal $y(t)$, but I would assume that they are not aiming to have a sparse presentations for that. Probable it is the channel, but \"incoming signal\" as quite misleading as channel is needs to be measured indirectly in practice.  (you could just say channel of use notation $h$ instead of $f$). \n- Section 4: \"Our approach employs an encoder that generates a latent representation $z$ and a decoder that reconstructs the input signal  on z\". As the background of the method in this point is still quite fuzzy, I am wondering that how this encoder is meant to be used eventually? \n- Section 4: \"three time steps of the CIR to an input token $e_m$ ...\", does this implicitly assume that the input is always at least three consecutive time steps of CIR?

The problem addressed in this paper is to obtain task-agnostic channel representations useful for downstream tasks by learning to reconstruct sparse representations of the channel vector in the form of a combination of a subset of overdetermined dictionary elements. The authors utilize the fact that a generic multipath channel, modeled with each path's associated complex gain, delay, and phase, can be expressed using only a small subset of an overdetermined set (a dictionary of vectors).

A major limitation of the work is the encoder's awareness of spatial characteristics. The authors try to circumvent that problem by learning those spatial characteristics separately for each task from scratch by using a ResNet with 1D convolutions added on top of the pretrained encoder. However, this requires processing of every pair of tx-rx elements sequentially (i.e., hundreds of forward passes are needed for very large antenna arrays), which renders the solution infeasible for real-time operability, which is one of the most important requirements in the wireless domain.\n\n- Another major limitation of the paper is the weakness in its presentation, which makes the paper difficult to understand and follow for the readers. A small subset of my observations is detailed below as well as my other comments. \n\n- There are some typos in the introduction (and in other sections). In some places, the language is not clear and is difficult to follow. Some of the sentences have vague meanings. There are also frequent punctuation errors. It is perfectly fine to make typos here and there, but this paper contains way too many of them, making the manuscript hard to read and understand. Therefore, the overall presentation is weak. Some examples (numbered from 1 to 12) from the abstract and the first paragraph only: \n\n1) 28 % should be 28%. \n\n2) 26%pts should be 26%. What is pts? Is it short for percentage points?\n\n3) The claim that “pretraining models solely on individual channel measurements makes it system-agnostic and more versatile” is vague. What is an individual channel measurement?\n\n4) “phase-rotates” and “Doppler-shifts” are used as verbs (line 30), which sounds informal. \n\n5) Missing comma at the end of line 30 (between the words influence and minimizing). \n\n6) Missing comma between the words impairment and leading (line 33). \n\n7) “Pattern” should be plural (line 35). \n\n8) “An” should be “a” (line 37). \n\n9) The authors should use parentheses for the reference in line 38. \n\n10) There are some claims in the introduction that need to be corrected or supported in a stronger way. \n\n11) The claim that “in the past CSI was used to equalize channels and that now CSI is being reinterpreted as a spatiotemporal information source” is not very accurate. CSI is still being used for channel equalization in various systems and is still very relevant in that regard. The authors should back up such an atypical claim with references. Also, the authors attribute the reinterpretation of CSI to the rise of deep learning. Yet, CSI’s use for beamforming predates deep learning’s adoption in wireless domain. Even most current deployments rely on classical signal processing, not deep learning. \n\n12) The claim that “in vision, separating class representations is sensible, but CSI measurements vary smoothly across space and thus exhibit subtler relationships” is interesting. Firstly, natural images also exhibit smoothness and structure (i.e., they lie on low-dimensional manifolds). Secondly, what is the relationship between the separability of classes and smoothness? One can separate CSI samples based on class if the samples are given meaningful labels such as the best beam index from a predefined codebook.  \n\n- The related work section presents as a limitation the fact that most papers on SSL and unsupervised learning for wireless borrow methods and techniques from language and image domains. Yet, the proposed solution is based on the Gated SAE framework, developed for interpretability of LLMs. It is not clarified how this work differentiates from the rest in terms of developing a novel method tailored to wireless. \n\n- The related work section does not clearly motivate why this solution is important and how it addresses the limitations of the earlier work developed for the same problem. A more detailed review of the self-supervised learning for wireless domain would be beneficial to show if/how earlier works do not account for the domain-specific characteristics of wireless but simply adopt methods developed purely for image and language. Also, this method uses time domain CIR as the input while most other cited works and baselines use frequency domain channel response. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the authors’ choice of using time domain CIR? Those details and comparisons are missing, leaving the motivation for the design choices and the need for this solution blank.\n\n-  A more detailed analysis of the model behavior (i.e., effect of the complexity of the downstream model, effect of model dimension, number of attention heads, and transformer depth, etc.) and interpretability of the learned features would strengthen this paper. The overall picture here looks like the authors have applied yet another method developed for another domain to wireless, which in the first place is what is criticized by the authors.\n\n-  The lack of spatial understanding introduces a dependency on the expressivity of the downstream model, which is a small ResNet with 1D convolutions here. The authors should analyze the performance under different downstream models as it is part of the design process unlike other baselines where simpler downstream models may be sufficient due to the spatial understanding already embedded in the encoder representations. \n\n- The datasets in this work use a carrier frequency around 3 GHz. However, the characteristics of the channel vary greatly with the carrier frequency. An evaluation on higher frequencies (mmWave frequencies) would strengthen this work."}, "questions": {"value": "- The pretraining and finetuning steps should be included in detail for SpaRTran and baselines. For example, is the same ResNet attached to all the baseline encoders, or you have simply used linear predictors for the other baselines, .... Under which settings have those baselines been implemented, trained, and finetuned?\n\n- SpaRTran encodes the CIR between a pair of transmitting and a receiver element. For a MIMO or a MISO system, this means that we must encode the channel for every pair of elements and then use another network (the authors used a small ResNet with 1D convolutions) to learn the spatial characteristics and dependencies, which are fundamentally important for both of the downstream tasks considered in this work. Other baselines already consider the spatial correlations with a single forward pass, which makes them orders of magnitude more efficient for systems with large antenna arrays. When the antenna arrays are very large, which is the case for modern communications, the proposed method has an important scalability problem. How can this be addressed?\n\n- Why is the work in https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09160 cited as a previous work but not considered as a baseline? It seems to study a similar problem and even has evaluations on the same downstream task on the same dataset. \n\n- How is compressed sensing utilized in this solution? The gated SAE framework, which the authors adopted here, already enforces sparsity, and the authors do not propose a fundamental modification to Gated SAEs. In the original gated SAE paper, the sparsity is not presented as an application of compressed sensing. This paper, on the other hand, uses the same gated SAE method yet frames it as a novel application of CS, being the first CS application to design of unsupervised learning, which may be an overstatement. \n\n- Please also see some of the questions in the Weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "0ubEZjnWBr", "forum": "fNC3aaGeIa", "replyto": "fNC3aaGeIa", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7665/Reviewer_DDDr"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7665/Reviewer_DDDr"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7665/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762488305244, "cdate": 1762488305244, "tmdate": 1762919732312, "mdate": 1762919732312, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an unsupervised pretraining method for wireless channels named SpaRTran.

This part introduces an abstract operator approximation framework with some fairly strong assumptions, but the theorem's symbols are not mapped to the original model, and the connection to the previous sections is not well explained. Moreover, there is no empirical verification of the theoretical results in the learned dictionary. These together make the whole part seem irrelevant to the main paper.\n\n3.
