Since each token can have different influences on different dimensions, applying token-level supervision across multiple dimensions is a potential method to mitigate dimension conflicts. However, the difficulty in obtaining token-level supervision signals across multiple dimensions through annotation has hindered further investigation into supervision methods. In this work, we experimentally validate the impact of dimension conflicts on LLM training and propose a method for applying token-level supervision for multi-dimensional attribute combination training. This method establishes token-level connections between the trained model and attribute models using token sequences generated by the trained model for optimization, and controls the optimization process through entropy-based weight calculation, without requiring any additional token-level annotations or external models.

The paper introduces a token-level supervision scheme that uses self-generated sequences and entropy-based dimension routing ($\\alpha$/$\\beta$) to link an overall model with attribute models, eliminating the need for additional token-level annotations. This approach creatively combines on-policy distillation ideas with multi-objective alignment.\n\n+ Quality: The preliminary experiments effectively motivate the proposed approach by demonstrating that overall-score training fails to integrate single-dimensional advantages. The main experiments evaluate across five diverse benchmarks (TruthfulQA, IFEval, BeHonest, BBH, MMLU-Pro), providing multifaceted assessment. The systematic ablation studies examining $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $|\\alpha|$, and decoding strategies demonstrate scientific rigor. Multi-scale experiments (3B-14B, Appendix A) demonstrate reasonable generalizability, though all use Qwen/Llama families, leaving transferability to other architectures (e.g., Mistral) unexplored.\n\n+ Clarity: The paper is well structured, with a clear outline of the preliminary motivation, method and experiments. It provides an accessible taxonomy of four preference relations and a lucid explanation of why self-generated sequences and entropy are used. Appendix C provides examples of dimensions that illustrate the definitions.\n\n+ Significance: This study provides a quantitative analysis of dimensional conflicts in multi-dimensional LLM alignment. It shows that 30–40% of the samples in the widely used UltraFeedback dataset exhibit such conflicts, which demonstrates the scale of the issue. The proposed method can enhance model performance without requiring additional token-level annotations, addressing the issue of the high costs of previous methods. The study reveals significant differences in optimal hyperparameters across various model families. While the paper does not offer an explanation for this phenomenon, it provides valuable insights for future research. Ablation studies provide empirical evidence for entropy-based weight allocation in LLM optimization."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.\tOnly two model families, Qwen and LLaMA, are explored. The rationale behind the choice of models, training methods and parameter settings should be explained. For example, the optimal value of the hyperparameter $\\alpha$ varies significantly between models: $\\alpha = +10$ for Qwen models and $\\alpha = -10$ for LLaMA models. The paper states that \"it is necessary to determine appropriate directions of dimension selection and weight assignment for different models.\", which implies that hyperparameter settings cannot be transferred between models. Therefore, extensive hyperparameter experiments must be conducted for each new type of model.\n2.\tWhile Appendix B provides some implementation details (learning rates, batch sizes, evaluation frameworks), it does not furnish code or pseudocode, rendering replication challenging. Furthermore, the authors ought to consider providing train/eval scripts, seeds, version pins, compute profile (GPU type, hours), and YAML configs.\n3.\tThe red-highlighted part of Equation 1 \"uses a form similar to the $k^2$-estimator of KL divergence\", yet \"this part cannot theoretically be regarded as an estimate of the KL divergence\". The design lacks a theoretical basis and it is necessary to explain why this formula can achieve the stated objectives. It is suggested that the authors add ablation experiments, gradient analysis, and convergence/stability diagnostics related to forward/reverse KL divergence and top token cross-entropy variants to prove the rationality of the design.\n4.\tThe performance improvement of many metrics is less than 1% (Table 2), and some metrics even show a decline (e.g., BBH metric of the Qwen-OA model: -0.11; MC2 metric of the Llama-FG model: -0.07, BBH metric of the Llama-FG model: -0.02). While the paper emphasizes that \"all rankings improve or stabilize,\" the practical significance of such small gains is unclear.\n5.\tAccording to the description in the method section, all models should be saved during the training process. Specific details regarding memory usage and related conditions during training should be added in the appendix.\n6.\tSubsection 3.2 contains five lengthy Q&A-style paragraphs that could be presented in a table or list. There is no schematic diagram of the workflow method; an intuitive presentation of key information should be included.\n7.\tThe paper cites methods such as AMOPO and gradient-adaptive policy optimization in the references and mentions them in the related work section. However, it does not make any experimental comparisons with these methods, making it difficult to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method. Furthermore, it lacks comparisons with mainstream approaches, and the experimental content should be enriched.\n8.\tTable 6 shows that greedy decoding outperforms sampling decoding in terms of average ranking, but the margin of advantage is extremely small (e.g., for the Llama-FG model: 2.00 vs 2.00). In some individual metrics, sampling decoding is actually superior. The existing evidence is insufficient to support the conclusion that \"greedy decoding should be preferred.\""}, "questions": {"value": "1.\tHow should practitioners determine optimal α and β for new models without extensive grid search?

Can the authors clarify their method's novelty against existing MOO preference alignment frameworks and justify the decision to design this new entropy-based loss rather than adapting an existing MOO approach?\n5.\tCan you visualize which tokens get optimized toward which dimensions? Are there patterns?\n6.\tIn the paper, different parameter settings are used for different LLMs, and only the two major model families, LLaMA and Qwen, are used in the paper. So, can this method be applied to other model series? Is it necessary to conduct a large number of experiments to explore the optimal hyperparameter settings for performance for any different LLM?\n7.\tTable 8 indicates that using the optimal 7B hyperparameters on the 14B model results in performance degradation on some metrics (e.g., RR: -1.64). Does this observation suggest that the hyperparameters must be re-tuned for every model scale, and if so, how does this affect the overall cost-benefit trade-off?\n8.\tGiven the slight performance improvement of the method and the lack of multi-seed runs, I am concerned about statistical significance. Can the authors provide any other evidence of stability to increase confidence that these improvements are reproducible and not noise?\n9.\tThe performance improvement in this study is rather modest. However, it seems necessary to load multiple models simultaneously during training, rather than a single one.

The phrase \"potentially bring its generation probability closer to that of certain attribute models\" reads more as a hoped-for outcome rather than an explanation of how the loss function achieves this.\n\n- Similarly, the third paragraph of Section 3.2 could benefit from additional clarification. While I understand the authors were inspired by Prabhudesai et al. (2025), the connection between their entropy-based RL approach and the use of entropy for weighting in this work could be explained more explicitly. The justification for why entropy (as opposed to other potential weighting signals) is an appropriate choice for this task would strengthen the work.\n\nSome minor stuff:\n- $\\pi$, $t_{<i}$ are not defined.\n- RHS of Eqn (2) is not indexed with $v$.\n- $\\mathbf{1}$ in Equation 3 needs to be defined.\n\nThese notation and explanation issues made it somewhat difficult for me to fully understand the implementation details of the proposed method.
