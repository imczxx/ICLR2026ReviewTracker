Objective signatures from neurl recordings are needed to optimize implantation and programming of antidepressant brain stimulation, and recent advances in machine learning help identify these in noisy patient recordings.\nIn this study, we present a machine learning classifier build from previously reported dense-array scalp EEG taken during active DBS at therapeutic (OnTarget) and non-therapeutic (OffTarget) targets. Using combined emotion self-report and EEG measurements alongside OnTarget stimulation of SCCwm and OffTarget stimulation \\SI{1.5}{\\milli\\meter} away, we trained a \\textit{support vector machine} (SVM) capable of confirming precise stimulation. We demonstrate that the learned model coefficients align with \\textit{engaged tractography} predicted through volume of tissue activated (VTA) modeling, and that these VTA models select for informative streamlines in large-scale Human Connectome Project (HCP) structural connectomes. Our compound model will enable implementation, study, and improvement of adaptive SCCwm-DBS, particularly in TRD, more systematic.

This raises the question of whether the neural signature learned is truly the one associated with the therapeutic effect, or simply a maximal effect. This limits the immediate clinical applicability.\n4.\tLack of cross-validation or independent testing.

Have the authors performed permutation testing to estimate p-values or confidence intervals?\n3. Could the authors provide frequency-band–specific coefficient maps to show whether certain oscillatory bands (e.g., $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ ) dominate discrimination?\n4. The authors note that engagement at 6 mA is above therapeutic values and that a more direct experiment at therapeutic parameters will be done.
