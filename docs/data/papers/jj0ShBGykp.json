Existing GP algorithms commonly rely on gradient-based optimization, which requires the placement objective to be differentiable with respect to cell coordinates. However, timing evaluation---particularly the delay computation---is inherently complex and typically non-differentiable, making it difficult to integrate into gradient-based GP algorithms. To address this challenge, we propose **LiTPlace**, a **L**earn**i**ng-based **T**iming-driven global placement framework, which learns a differentiable surrogate model to predict signal delays for timing-aware gradient-based optimization. To the best of our knowledge, the application of machine learning (ML) in timing-driven GP remains underexplored in previous works. At the core of LiTPlace is a graph neural network (GNN) inspired by the signal propagation in chip circuits, which predicts signal delays based on the netlist graph structure and the placement geometry. To ensure compatibility with gradient-based optimization, we design the GNN architecture so that its output is approximately a linear function of a set of geometric distance statistics, enabling efficient and stable gradient computation with respect to cell coordinates. Experiments on $28$ chip designs from widely used benchmarks demonstrate that LiTPlace significantly improves timing quality, achieving an average improvement of $19.2\\\\%$ in TNS and $7.7\\\\%$ in WNS, which are two key metrics to quantify the chip timing quality.", "tldr": "We propose a learning-based timing-driven global placement method.", "keywords": ["Electronic Design Automation", "Chip Placement", "Timing-Driven Global Placement"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9a2ec9da5856aff9be3b4744019f5944e791f708.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "LiTPlace is proposed in this paper to predict delay with GNN, and is employed to serve as a differentiable surrogate integrated directly into gradient-driven global placement optimization.

What, specifically, distinguishes timing-driven placement from other objectives in the context of ML for placement? Can methods developed for congestion-driven placement be applied to timing-driven placement with modest changes (e.g., adding features or changing the prediction head)? If there are few or no such differences, why introduce a new framework instead of modestly adapting existing methods and applying them to timing-driven optimization?\n\nModel design for timing prediction.
