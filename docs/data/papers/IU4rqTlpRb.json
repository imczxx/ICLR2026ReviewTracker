They formalize and test this on BLUR/TOFU-style setups, diagnose evaluation confounds in prior relearning studies, and propose a simple mitigation, syntactic diversification (paraphrasing forget queries into varied structures before unlearning).

Syntactic diversification (multi-paraphrase forget queries via GPT-4o) reduces template rigidity, balances loss between templates and keywords, delays/attenuates relearning, requires fewer unlearning steps, and improves utility (e.g., Real Authors, World Facts and Retain split).

The authors first use rigorous experimental design to identify confounding variables in the evaluation methods of previous benchmarks and then correct these experiments, finding that the role of topic relevance is overestimated.\n\nTo verify their core hypothesis, the authors construct two relearning datasets: \"topically related but syntactically different\" and \"topically unrelated but syntactically similar.\" Experimental results show that syntactically similar data triggers information retrieval more effectively. The paper further analyzes the underlying mechanism from the perspectives of representation and gradients, revealing that syntactically similar data and the forgetting target are highly aligned within the model, and that the standard forgetting process suppresses \"templates\" rather than \"keywords,\" thus leaving structural \"backdoors.\"\n\nBased on this finding, the paper proposes a simple yet effective solution—syntactic diversification.

There are three sets: unlearning set $D_{forget}$, eval set $D_{target}$, relearn set $D_{relearn}$. Section 5 characterizes the syntactic similarity between $D_{target}$ and $D_{relearn}$, but there are other dimensions: syntactic similarity between $D_{forget}$ and $D_{relearn}$ and syntactic similarity between $D_{forget}$ and $D_{target}$. In the TOFU case, an implicit assumption is $D_{target}$ and $D_{forget}$ high overlaps. Therefore, $D_{relearn}^{syntactic}$ is syntactically different enough from both $D_{target}$ and $D_{forget}$. However, such assumption might not be true for e.g. WMDP, where $D_{forget}$ is pub-med articles and $D_{target}$ are some expert drafted questions, not necessarily about the verbatims in the articles themselves. From the current analysis, what is missing is, **whether the success of relearning is due to syntactic similarity between $D_{target}$ and $D_{relearn}$ or $D_{forget}$ and $D_{relearn}$, or more complex among all three sets**.\n- It is also important to make clear separation between knowledge unlearn (such as wmdp, where $D_{target}$ and $D_{forget}$ can usually be very syntactically different) and verbatim unlearn (such as tofu, where $D_{target}$ and $D_{forget}$ are potentially closer, but also try cases where you paraphrase $D_{target}$ itself) and investigate the above question under both cases.\n- The robust unlearning part is less convincing to me. In practice, designing unlearn set given target set is unfair. The ideology should be a defender build an unlearn set with the purpose of defending against model outputting sensitive information, not against a set of fixed queries. Moreover, one can always rewrite the target set with GPT as well. \n- Figure 8 is also less convincing. For TOFU, the original relearn set is a subset of the unlearn set. Now that if the forget set changes, shouldn't the relearn set also changes? Otherwise, this is not an apple-to-apple comparison as the adversarial in this case has less information."}, "questions": {"value": "- Have the authors explore systematic analysis on knowledge unlearning task such as WMDP?\n- I like this paper and think this paper provides good observations. The most important thing is a clearer and more systematic investigation to the weakness 1 above. That's the major issue I think the authors should address. The defense part in its current form is also not convincing as it is too rough and did not consider stronger adversarial. **I am willing to raise my score if both points have been further explored and explained in the rebuttal.**"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "aWJqWRGmsd", "forum": "IU4rqTlpRb", "replyto": "IU4rqTlpRb", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission369/Reviewer_UHrD"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission369/Reviewer_UHrD"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission369/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762127338036, "cdate": 1762127338036, "tmdate": 1762915504706, "mdate": 1762915504706, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
