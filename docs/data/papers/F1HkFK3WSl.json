While this automation promises benefits, it also raises responsibility as agents begin to make consequential choices on behalf of users.\nPrevious research has largely focused on evaluating agent performance in constrained settings, such as single-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent interactions. In contrast, real-world markets introduce far greater complexity which requires agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large, dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors engage in open-ended dialogues.\nThese stakes and complexity motivate empirical testing of agent behavior in markets before real-world deployment.\nWe investigate {\\em two-sided agentic marketplaces} where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents represent competing businesses,and develop a simulated environment---Magentic Marketplace---where Assistants and Services can safely operate. \nThis enables understanding, \\emph{e.g.}, the utility agents can achieve, any behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, or even how search/discovery mechanisms shape market outcomes.\nOur simulated experiments in Magentic Marketplace show that some frontier models improve market welfare outcomes over non-agentic baselines, but performance degrades as business scale increases. We also find that even the best-performing models remain vulnerable to market manipulation tactics and behavioral biases. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions, informing the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.

It effectively motivates its perspective and provides a well-grounded background for the reader. From an environment design standpoint, I find the paper’s approach particularly valuable: extending beyond the stylized setups commonly found in the literature (such as those focusing solely on negotiation stages) and instead introducing a comprehensive pipeline that integrates multiple types of interactions. Such an approach is essential for understanding how real-world platforms may operate when AI agents act on both sides of the market."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The paper focuses exclusively on consumer welfare, yet the setting is inherently a two-sided market. I would expect to see a corresponding analysis of the welfare of business providers as well. Considering both sides is essential for capturing the full set of economic trade-offs and for understanding how market design choices affect overall economic efficiency.\n\n2. The paper would benefit from providing more practical insights into how specific design choices shape economic outcomes. For example, are there design parameters that could steer the outcome toward outcomes more favorable to consumers or providers? While the discussion around search mechanisms (lexical vs. perfect search) offers a valuable start, there appear to be many additional degrees of freedom worth exploring, such as how agent communication is structured (natural language vs. formal protocols) or how supply and demand dynamics are modeled. The absence of such analysis makes the current exploration feel somewhat limited in scope.\n\n3. The term “information asymmetry” appears several times but is not clearly defined in context. It remains unclear what constitutes the private information, who possesses it, and how its presence affects the resulting economic outcomes. A more precise definition and explicit modeling of these asymmetries would strengthen the conceptual clarity of the paper.\n\n4. Although the authors themselves note in the ethical statement that fairness is a key concern in the context of two-sided market design, the paper does not provide a concrete definition or formal treatment of fairness. I would expect to see a clear definition of what fairness means in this setting, and at least some preliminary analysis of how the proposed mechanisms perform with respect to this criterion.\n\n**Another minor comment:** Some citations seem to specify the incorrect order of authors, for instance:\n\nMoshe Tennenholtz, Eilam Shapira, Omer Madmon, and Roi Reichart -> Eilam Shapira, Omer Madmon, Roi Reichart, and Moshe Tennenholtz (Can llms replace economic choice prediction labs? the case of language-based persuasion games)"}, "questions": {"value": "I do not have any specific questions, but I am willing to hear your thoughts and comments on my concerns."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "qYhw4dafiz", "forum": "F1HkFK3WSl", "replyto": "F1HkFK3WSl", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23939/Reviewer_JBMT"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23939/Reviewer_JBMT"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23939/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761206814254, "cdate": 1761206814254, "tmdate": 1762942865187, "mdate": 1762942865187, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Magentic Marketplace, a large-scale simulation platform where LLM agents act as both consumers and producers in a language-mediated market.
