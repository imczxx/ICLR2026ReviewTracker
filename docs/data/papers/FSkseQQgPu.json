However, accurately modeling RF propagation in electrically large and complex environments remains a long-standing challenge, owing to the intricate interactions between RF signals and surrounding objects (e.g., reflection, diffraction, and scattering). Unlike conventional ray-tracing pipelines that hand-engineer interaction rules, or black-box neural surrogates that do not explicitly model physical structure, we introduce RFSG, a novel framework that integrates neural representations with physics-based RF propagation modeling. Starting with a stochastic representation of objects via random indicator functions, we derive the attenuation coefficient as a functional of the probability distributions of the underlying indicator functions under an exponential transport model. This formulation inherently satisfies key physical constraints such as reciprocity and reversibility. Building on this foundation, we employ object-centric neural representations to capture complex RF–object interactions while preserving the composability of traditional ray tracing. Extensive elevations on real-world testbeds demonstrate that RFSG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art neural baselines in prediction accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer training samples.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Radio Frequency", "Neural Rendering", "Neural Representation", "Stochastic Geometry", "Wireless Channel Modeling"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5c50562a8178e08419c0f3a149c1657ca8c07298.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/2e5467e2a5d7e075179fb831b42e9ecbfb1dbce4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes RFSG (Radio Frequency Stochastic Geometry), a physics-inspired framework that combines stochastic geometry theory with neural ray tracing for RF propagation modeling.

The derivation of exponential transport under stochastic geometry relies on strong assumptions, such as Poisson-distributed object geometry, differentiable occupancy fields, and reciprocal, stationary media, that rarely hold in real RF environments. Real-world propagation involves correlated structures, heterogeneous materials, and frequency-dependent wave effects that violate the independence and smoothness conditions required for exponential attenuation. As a result, the claimed physical guarantees, including reciprocity and reversibility, are theoretically appealing but may not be empirically realizable without substantial simplification. A more rigorous justification or numerical validation of these assumptions would strengthen the theoretical credibility of the framework.\n\n\n- While the framework claims to integrate stochastic geometry theory with neural ray tracing, its implementation only partially reflects this formulation. The exponential transport equations are not directly solved or validated; instead, the method substitutes key quantities such as attenuation and material parameters with generic MLP regressors. This disconnect weakens the claimed physical grounding, as the neural networks effectively absorb unmodeled effects rather than enforcing the derived stochastic relationships. Without explicit constraints or analytical verification that the learned fields satisfy the proposed transport equations, the approach risks behaving as an empirical neural surrogate rather than a true realization of the underlying theory.\n\n\n- The evaluation is narrow and lacks rigor.

Superficial Evaluation and Analysis**\n- While the overall results are promising, I believe the evaluation is lacking. My specific concerns below:\n- **(a) No analysis of learnt field**: A specific benefit of the approach is physical grounding wrt learnt fields over materials, attenuations, vacancy (e.g., see Fig. 1) parameters. However, no such analysis is provided. The paper would benefit tremendously by presenting these results (e.g., similar to Fig. 5 in Miller et al. 2024), since it convinces readers the model does learns non-degenerate solutions.\n- **(b) Ablations**: The paper makes many design choices (e.g., laplacian regularization terms, anisotrophy terms) and an ablation would justify these choices.\n- **(c) Simulated experiments**: While real-world results are helpful, I believe in this particular case, a more through simulated evaluation would make the paper stronger, since in this case one has ground-truth scene parameters that can be compared against the learnt parameters.\n\n**2. Exponential transport model - Justification**\n- The paper leverages findings of stochastic geometry perspectives of Miller et al., CVPR 2024. In their case, which involves computer graphics (optical light transport), the choice of exponential transport model is backed by plenty of literature and findings in computer graphics. However, it is largely unclear why this should hold for RF propagation.\n- Furthermore, since there are specific models and literature on RF propagation through materials (see ITU 2040 \"Effects of building materials and structures on radiowave propagation above about 100 MHz.\"). A discussion on comparing the chosen transport model with standard models would make the paper stronger.\n- Additionally, it is also unclear how the model (specifically the ray tracing (Eq. 365-377)) accounts for more complex phenomenons e.g., scattering, diffraction. \n\n**3. (Minor) Is phase learnt?**\n- It is a bit unclear from the paper whether the phase is learnt. On one hand, formulations appear to indicate this is learnt (e.g., Fig. 2, Eq. 20-21). On the other hand, L478-482 also remarks \"our formulation ... incorporating phase component requires further explication\"."}, "questions": {"value": "My major concern is the lack of additional analysis.
