However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Irregular Multivariate Time Series", "Time Series Forecasting", "Dynamic Graph Neural Networks", "Spatio-Temporal Modeling", "Data-Driven Interaction"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/68b08a1aefe90d3013932ade830b3d25b982f807.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses two fundamental challenges in Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (IMTSF): 1) information distortion caused by data preprocessing like interpolation, and 2) the inability of static interaction structures to capture complex, dynamic dependencies.

Although the exact mechanisms differ (hypergraph vs nearest-neighbor graph), the core idea (treating each observation as a graph node and learning adaptive relational structure in irregular time series) is shared.
