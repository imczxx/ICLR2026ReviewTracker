To address these limitations, we propose SEMoLA, an end-to-end approach that jointly (1) discovers a priori unknown symmetries in the data via learnable data augmentations, and uses them to (2) encode the respective approximate equivariance into arbitrary unconstrained models. Hence, it enables learning equivariant models that do not need prior knowledge about symmetries, offer interpretability, and maintain robustness to distribution shifts. Empirically, we demonstrate the ability of SEMoLA to robustly discover relevant symmetries while achieving high prediction performance across various datasets, encompassing multiple data modalities and underlying symmetry groups.", "tldr": "We define an end-to-end approach for learning soft equivariant models without prior knowledge about the underlying data symmetries, while providing interpretability and robustness to distribution shifts.", "keywords": ["equivariant models", "symmetry discovery", "learnable augmentations"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8e87848328ae50c848b0bdaff2769e1a8ba877b8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose SEMoLA, a method for unsupervised symmetry discovery consisting of two components: 1).

Two out of the three experiments in the main paper consider very simple, synthetic datasets (Rotated MNIST, and N-body dynamics) and the proposed method is outperformed by EMLP + LieGAN on the remaining dataset.

If it is the latter, then I believe the algorithm has access to a nontrivial amount of knowledge about data transformations prior to the learning (specifically, low-dimensionality and factorization structure of the action), and it is unclear whether we have similar amounts of information in practical setups when symmetry is unknown.\n\nW2.
