However, existing methods struggle to simultaneously capture (1) intra-modal dependencies (modality-specific topological information) and (2) inter-modal correlations (structural-functional coupling information), both of which are essential attributes specific to multimodal brain graph fusion. This limitation leads to inadequate brain structural-functional information fusion, ultimately failing to correctly reflect the true brain organization. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel Cross-modal Brain Graph Diffusion (Xdiff) approach. Xdiff presents a dual graph diffusion mechanism with intra- and inter-modal diffusion modules to capture intra-modal dependencies and inter-modal correlations, respectively. During the diffusion processes, we use an energy constraint function to ensure diffusion consistency, thereby enhancing model stability of learning from multimodal brain graphs. Furthermore, we design a prompt-based fusion strategy to flexibly integrate multimodal features for robust fusion. Empirically, Xdiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets for brain disorder detection tasks, with accuracy improvements of 4.6%, 2.5%, and 5.6%, respectively.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["graph learning", "brain networks", "diffusion model", "multimodal fusion"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/311081715cd96afcdf6d6ddbaab2cec41c46adf1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a novel and methodologically sound framework, Xdiff, which makes a valuable contribution to multimodal brain graph analysis.

The paper clearly identifies and addresses a critical gap in multimodal brain graph fusion: the simultaneous capture of intra-modal dependencies and inter-modal correlations. The motivation is compelling and well-grounded in neuroscientific principles.\n\n2. The proposed dual graph diffusion mechanism is a principled and elegant extension of graph diffusion to the multimodal setting. The integration of an energy constraint for stability and a prompt-based fusion (PF) strategy for robustness represents a creative synthesis of ideas from different domains.\n\n3.

The proof of Theorem 1 relies on the assumption that Sk is a stochastic matrix with λmax​(Sk)=1. The manuscript must explicitly state how this property is enforced or maintained throughout the diffusion process during training. If it is not enforced, the convergence guarantee is weakened, and an empirical analysis of the spectral properties of Sk during training should be provided to support the stability claims.\n\n2. The inspiration and theoretical basis for the specific formulation of the energy constraint function (Eq. 5) and its connection to the diffusion process require a more detailed explanation. While Proposition 2 derives the upper bound, the initial design choice for β(⋅)and α(⋅) needs stronger motivation.\n\n3. The feature matrix X in the Preliminaries section is not defined. The initial node features hi​(0)=xi​ for both SBG and FBG must be explicitly described. How are these initial node embeddings generated from the raw DTI/fMRI data? This is a fundamental detail currently missing.\n\n4. Figure 2, in its current form, is insufficient. It omits critical elements like the input adjacency matrices (As,Af), the internal computation of inter-modal coefficients (c_i^s,c_i^f​) via Q/K, and the role of prompts in the fusion module. A redesigned figure or the addition of a high-level algorithm pseudocode is strongly recommended to elucidate the end-to-end data flow.\n\n5. The description of the prompt-based fusion strategy is vague. The prompts Z_fp^s​ and Z_fp^f are stated to be \"defined,\" but it is unclear if they are randomly initialized learnable parameters or derived from another process. This must be clarified in Section 4.3.\n\n6. Given that SBG and FBG node features originate from fundamentally different distributions (DTI vs. fMRI), a brief discussion on whether any feature projection/normalization is applied to align the modalities before diffusion would be beneficial.\n\n7. Reporting means and standard deviations over 5 runs is a start, but it is insufficient for small-sample datasets like PPMI and 4RTNI. Statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests or non-parametric equivalents with appropriate correction for multiple comparisons) must be performed to confirm that the performance improvements over baselines are not due to chance.\n\n8. The claim that all baselines use \"optimal configurations\" is not verifiable. The authors must provide a detailed account of the hyperparameter tuning process for all baselines, ensuring a fair comparison. Were the same data splits and random seeds used? Was the search space comparable? This is critical for reproducibility.\n\n9. The manuscript should discuss cases where Xdiff does not achieve the top performance on all metrics (e.g., AUC on PPMI is lower than STAGIN, Sen. on ADNI is lower than AL-NEGAT). A thoughtful analysis of the potential reasons (e.g., model biases, dataset characteristics) would provide a more balanced perspective.\n\n10. The \"Related Work\" section should be reorganized to more sharply critique existing methods, clearly separating which ones fail to capture intra-modal dependencies and which ones fail to capture inter-modal correlations. This will more effectively frame the specific niche Xdiff occupies.\n\n11. An analysis or discussion of the model's computational cost and scalability relative to the baselines is missing and would be valuable for practitioners."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ySnbKlLLuu", "forum": "iIpduPWySk", "replyto": "iIpduPWySk", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11939/Reviewer_zvLc"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11939/Reviewer_zvLc"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11939/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761489230859, "cdate": 1761489230859, "tmdate": 1762922947587, "mdate": 1762922947587, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "ZiOuE6eb7v", "forum": "iIpduPWySk", "replyto": "iIpduPWySk", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11939/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11939/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762950474636, "cdate": 1762950474636, "tmdate": 1762950474636, "mdate": 1762950474636, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a novel method called Cross-modal Brain Graph Diffusion (Xdiff) for multimodal brain graph fusion, aiming to improve brain disorder detection.

However, dataset like HCP which involves over 1000 samples is also a public mutli-modal graph dataset which is common in multi-modal network analysis. Furthermore, diffusion-based methods require great GPU resources for training, and experiments on training resources statistics and training/inference speed is required.\n\n[1] Lu J, Wu Z, Chen Z, et al.
