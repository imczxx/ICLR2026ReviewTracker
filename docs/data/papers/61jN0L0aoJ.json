Differential games capture multi-agent interactions with opposing objectives, where optimal strategies are defined by equilibrium conditions. Classical theory based on Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle (PMP) and the Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs (HJI) equations provides principled foundations, but these conditions are rarely tractable in practice. Deep learning, by contrast, offers flexible function approximation but typically ignores such structure and depends on large datasets or extensive online interactions.\n\nWe introduce a framework that embeds equilibrium conditions and terminal constraints from the calculus of variations directly into the training objective. This enables neural networks to jointly learn state, control, and costate trajectories while handling variable terminal times and manifold-constrained terminal states, yielding approximate saddle-point equilibria.

Once this setup is in place, the resulting optimization could, in principle, be solved by standard variational inequality methods (extragradient, optimistic GDA, etc.), which the paper neither compares against nor discusses.

In such cases, the proposed reparameterization and normalization trick would not apply directly, and it remains unclear how SAL-DG would handle manifold-valued states or hidden coordinate dependencies.
