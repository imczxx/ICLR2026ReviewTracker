In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined in the policy.  However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that serve as a *reasoning bridge* to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high utilization from the raw chains-of-thought.", "tldr": "We propose Policy Reasoning Traces, a form of pseudo-expert reasoning imitation derived from frontier reasoning models to improve any off-the-shelf model's policy compliance capabilities.", "keywords": ["policy compliance", "reasoning trace", "chain-of-thought", "large language model"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/937a2ae964c09743808897e78d121d7a757ca73b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3337a65ce66bb222dd05b1cb510d2a004ffe13b4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the challenge of automated policy compliance assessment, a task that requires complex reasoning aligned with human-defined rules. The authors note that acquiring gold-standard expert reasoning traces for this task is prohibitively expensive. They propose a method called POLICY REASONING TRACES (PRT), which uses a powerful \"expert\" LLM to synthetically generate step-by-step reasoning traces, given only a case and its final compliance verdict (e.g., COMPLIANT/NONCOMPLIANT). These synthetically generated PRTs are then used as a \"reasoning bridge\"—either as few-shot in-context examples or as data for supervised fine-tuning—to improve the performance of a \"learner\" model.

Important Problem Domain: The paper tackles a practical and high-stakes problem. Automating policy compliance has clear real-world applications, and the challenge of aligning LLM reasoning with complex, human-authored policy documents is a significant research barrier.\n\n2. Intuitive Core Idea: The central idea of using a more capable model to generate pseudo-expert reasoning, thereby avoiding the bottleneck of human expert annotation, is intuitive and a common-sense approach to data augmentation.\n\n3. Strong Empirical Gains on Some Datasets: The method demonstrates clear and significant performance boosts over baseline models, particularly for open-weight models on the HIPAA dataset. The claim of achieving a new state-of-the-art on the GDPR dataset is also a notable empirical contribution."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Critical Unaddressed Risk: PRT Quality and Faithfulness: The entire method hinges on the assumption that the \"expert\" LLM generates high-quality, faithful reasoning traces. The paper provides no substantial validation of this. The expert model is given the gold verdict and asked to produce reasoning for it. This setup strongly encourages post-hoc rationalization, where the model may generate a plausible-sounding but incorrect reasoning path to justify the given answer. If the PRTs are flawed, unfaithful, or contain factual errors (e.g., wrong clause citations), the learner model is simply being trained on high-quality noise. This \"garbage in, garbage out\" risk is a fundamental methodological flaw that is not adequately addressed.\n\n2. Questionable Novelty: The technique of using a strong model to generate synthetic data (especially reasoning steps or chains-of-thought) to train a weaker model is a well-established paradigm in NLP (e.g., data distillation, synthetic CoT generation). The paper fails to clearly articulate what makes \"PRT\" a novel method beyond applying this existing technique to the specific domain of policy compliance.\n\n3. Confusing/Contradictory Results: The results on the ModelSpec dataset are concerning. The authors note that for models already optimized for this policy (OpenAI models), adding PRTs decreases performance. This finding, which is somewhat downplayed, severely undermines the method's generalizability. It suggests that these \"expert-generated\" PRTs may be of lower quality than the model's own internal reasoning, further supporting the concern in Weakness 1.\n\n4. Superficial Analysis of PRT Sources: The paper generates PRTs from a \"Generalist\" (DeepSeek-R1) and \"Specialist\" (SAULLM) model but then states that the Generalist PRTs were \"majority advantage\" and used for subsequent experiments. This is counter-intuitive (why would a specialized legal model be worse?) and this finding is not explored. This feels like a missed opportunity for analysis and weakens the paper's contribution."}, "questions": {"value": "1. PRT Quality Validation: Was any human evaluation conducted to measure the quality, faithfulness, and factual correctness of the generated PRTs? How do we know the \"expert\" model's reasoning for a verdict is the correct reasoning, and not just a plausible hallucination?\n\n2. Forced Justification vs. Organic Reasoning: How does this method compare to simply prompting the expert model with standard Chain-of-Thought (e.g., \"Let's think step-by-step\") and having it generate both the reasoning and the verdict? By providing the gold verdict, aren't you forcing the model to justify a conclusion, which encourages rationalization over genuine reasoning?\n\n3. ModelSpec Performance Drop: Could you elaborate on the performance degradation for OpenAI models on ModelSpec? Does this not imply that PRTs are only beneficial as a crutch for weaker models, and may actually be harmful (by introducing noise) when a model's existing reasoning capability is already strong?\n\n4. Generalist vs. Specialist PRTs: Why do you hypothesize that the Generalist model's PRTs outperformed the Specialist (legal) model's PRTs?

We appreciate that the reviewers identified the following contributions in our work:\n\n- *“touches on an important problem and proposes a simple but highly practical and scalable solution in policy compliance”* (BqWv, uHM2, QPkF)  \n- *“shows strong and significant empirical gains and state-of-the-art for both open-weight and commercial models”* (uHM2, BqWv, TNXz)  \n- *“goes beyond accuracy and shows evidence through deeper ablations that add depth to the proposed method, including citing correct policy clauses and cross-policy generalization”* (BqWv, TNXz)\n\nPlease find our general response and reviewer-specific response to your comments below. We aim for these detailed responses to address your questions and improve your overall assessment of the paper.\n\n### **On the various forms of novelty of the study**\n\nReviewer uHM2, QPkF, and TNXz inquired about the novelty of PRTs and how synthetic data used to improve learner models through teacher models already exists. While this is correct in a general sense (and can be said to any related synthetic data-related study), we believe our proposed PRT framework’s novelty comes in many different forms, especially for the challenging task of policy compliance, as described below: \n\nFirst, **using PRTs enables test-time compliance assessment without additional finetuning**. With respect to previous policy compliance methods, Deliberative Alignment (Guan et al., 2024) and GoldCoin (Fan et al.) require additional fine-tuning and preference optimization for compliance assessment prompts to work. We believe the use of PRTs is a strong advantage, especially if domain experts are specifically looking to use models for compliance-based tasks that are too large (e.g., 70-120B) to finetune or optimize on their own.\n\nSecond, the proposed work is the **first to explore providing learner models with examples of grounded reasoning from start (summarizing case information) to finish (finalizing a verdict) through PRTs**. The PRT generation pipeline (Section 2) ensures that the generated reasoning of PRTs continuously refers to the given gold-standard verdict. This notion of using example cases with reasoning and verdict to judge new cases is also grounded on principles of regulation and compliance (see rationale below).\n\nThird, our ablation studies show that **PRTs open new opportunities for further understanding compliance dynamics of LLMs**. We showed that the use of PRTs helps models generalize across policies, which may be impactful for new policies with limited data (Section 4.2). We also showed that the addition of PRTs allows learner models to identify the correct policy clause that matches the experts’ own identified clauses (Section 4.3), which is extremely crucial in legal and safety domains. \n\n### **On the rationale behind adding verdict information in generating PRTs**\n\nReviewer uHM2 and BqWv inquired about the rationale and motivation behind adding the verdict information when generating PRTs. In Section 2.1, as part of our method’s motivation, we cite an example from the legal domain where courts refer to reasoning from precedents (previous case information and decisions) to identify specific provisions of a policy that are applicable to a case being assessed before issuing a verdict. Hence, our PRT generation method, where we provide information to the expert model to generate reasoning from the train set that will be used for the evaluation of new cases from the test set, is **actually grounded on realistic policy compliance assessment procedures**. We emphasize the importance of emulating and grounding this real-world process in how models perform the task of policy compliance assessment.\n\nRemoving the verdict information from the PRT generation process can be done for the purpose of experimenting just to compare performance changes, but this action removes the information on which the expert models can ground their reasoning and loses similarity with actual policy compliance assessment, as discussed above."}}, "id": "EDAsxnyHQV", "forum": "QgEDWbZQ6V", "replyto": "QgEDWbZQ6V", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9485/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9485/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9485/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763590775092, "cdate": 1763590775092, "tmdate": 1763590775092, "mdate": 1763590775092, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the critical challenge of enabling LLMs to perform complex policy compliance assessments, a task that typically requires expensive, expert-human-generated reasoning data.

The PRTs are generated by providing the expert model with the gold-standard verdict (Compliant/Non-Compliant) in the prompt. This means the generated PRT is a post-hoc rationalization of a known answer, not a genuine, \"from-scratch\" reasoning process to find the answer. This methodological choice may create unnaturally perfect or biased reasoning traces that do not reflect the difficulty of the original task.\n2. The authors candidly report that their method hurts performance on OpenAI models (gpt-5-mini, gpt-oss) for the ModelSpec policy. While their \"doubly-optimized\" hypothesis is plausible, this is a significant failure case that demonstrates the method is not universally applicable and can be detrimental when a model is already highly aligned.\n3. The entire method hinges on the quality of the \"expert\" LLM (deepseek-R1 and SaulLM). The paper acknowledges these PRTs are \"imperfect weak supervision\" and may contain hallucinations, but it does not deeply analyze the impact of this imperfection. If the expert LLM is systematically wrong or biased in its reasoning, the learner models will simply inherit and scale this flawed logic."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The paper's \"internal\" compliance approach should be contrasted with \"external\" guardian models. Could the authors discuss the trade-offs (e.g., latency, cost, and robustness) of their method versus using a dedicated, external gurad like LlamaGuard, WildGuard[1][2], which provides runtime moderation and recovery feedback?\n2. Given the SoTA claims, would the authors consider evaluating their PRT-finetuned models on the new, large-scale DynaBench [3]? This would provide a more direct comparison to other SoTA models designed for similar general-purpose, dynamic policy enforcement.\n3. Regarding the PRT generation: What was the rationale for providing the gold-standard verdict to the expert model? Have the authors experimented with generating PRTs without this \"answer key\"? How does the quality and correctness of the expert's reasoning change in that more realistic scenario?\n4. Can the authors elaborate on the \"doubly-optimized\" failure case? Is it possible this is a style conflict (e.g., the deepseek-R1 reasoning style conflicts with the internal alignment of GPT models) rather than just \"overthinking\"?
