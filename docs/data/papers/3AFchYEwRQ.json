In this problem, we are given a labeled complete graph $G=(V,E^+ \\cup E^-)$, and the optimal clustering is defined as a partition of the vertices that minimizes the $+$ edges between clusters and $-$ edges within clusters. We investigate efficient algorithms to test the \\emph{cost} of correlation clustering: here, we want to know whether the graph could be (nearly) perfectly clustered (with $0$ cost) or is far away from admitting any perfect clustering. The problem has attracted significant attention aimed at modern large-scale applications, and the state-of-the-art results use $\\widetilde{O}({1}/{\\varepsilon^7})$ queries and time (up to log factors) to decide whether a graph is perfectly clusterable or needs to flip labels of $\\varepsilon {\\binom n 2}$ edges to become clusterable. In this paper, we improve this bound significantly by designing an algorithm that uses ${O}({1}/{\\varepsilon^2})$ queries and time. Furthermore, we derive the first algorithm that tests the cost for the special setting of correlation clustering with $k$ clusters with ${O}(1/{\\varepsilon^4})$ queries and time for constant $k$. Finally, for the special case of $k=2$, which corresponds to the strong structure balance problem in social networks, we obtain tight bounds of $\\Theta({1}/{\\varepsilon})$ queries -- the first set of \\emph{tight} bounds in these problems. We conduct experiments on simulated and real-world datasets, and empirical results demonstrate the advantages of our algorithms.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Correlation Clustering", "Structural Balance", "Property Testing"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9da27235c8e669d3ef4ac30389ed6f05d6f432bb.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies the problem of testing the cost of correlation clustering, i.e., to test whether the input graph $G=(V,E^+\\cup E^-)$ is clusterable (with $0$ cost) or is $\\varepsilon$-far away from being clusterable.

The simplicity of the improvement raises the question of why such a refinement was not already known.\n\n- **Coarse granularity of the testing objective.**  \nAs in all property testing formulations, the test only distinguishes between perfectly clusterable graphs ($\\mathrm{OPT}=0$) and those that are $\\varepsilon$-far from such structure ($\\mathrm{OPT} \\ge \\varepsilon \\binom{n}{2}$). This dichotomy is extremely coarse and offers little interpretive value for practical clustering, where intermediate cases are the norm.\n\n- **Relevance limited to dense theoretical settings.**  \nThe dense graph model and the assumption of oracle access to edge labels make the results largely theoretical.
