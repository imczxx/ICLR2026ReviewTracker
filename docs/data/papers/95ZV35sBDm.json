Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can aid mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose **SE-Diff**, a physiological simulator- and experience-enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)–based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered, experience retrieval–augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing stronger guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text–ECG semantic alignment over baselines. We further show that simulator-based and experience-based knowledge benefit downstream ECG classification.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diffusion Model; ECG; Simulator; LLM"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a2968ac4dd6bf6cabf071476711f766ad160b920.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes SE-Diff, a diffusion-based framework for text-conditioned 12-lead ECG generation that integrates a lightweight ODE ECG simulator via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, and augments conditioning with EHR-retrieved “experience” knowledge.

Specifically, SE-Diff uses a VAE to encode the waveform into a latent representation, and aligns the Beat Decoder output to the single QRS cardiac cycle. During diffusion training, an Euler consistency loss and a cross-lead (Einthoven/Goldberger) constraint are applied to the Beat Decoder output, incorporating the morphological priors of the ODE simulator. Finally, empirical knowledge is derived through EHR three-view similarity + LLM distillation, which is conditioned on the original diagnosis and metadata.

Solid quantitative results: On the MIMIC-IV-ECG, SE-Diff reduced MAE/NRMSE to 0.0923/0.0714 and heart rate error MAE_HR to 8.43 compared to DiffuSETS, while also improving rCLIP and rFID (0.947/0.951).

The evaluation scope is relatively narrow: it mainly focuses on the MIMIC-IV-ECG single database verification; there is a lack of cross-institutional/external data (such as PTB-XL) system evaluation and robustness reporting (multiple random seeds ± std, significance testing), and currently most tables contain single values.\n\n3. Boundaries of the simulator and constraints: Cross-lead constraints only cover the six identities of the limb/augmented leads, and no structural constraints are imposed on the precordial leads (V1–V6); although the Euler first-order integral + linear noise schedule has an intuitive explanation, there is a lack of comparison with more powerful numerical methods/schedules.\n\n4. Indicator dependence and potential bias: rCLIP/rFID ​​depends on the selected ECG/Text encoder. Although relative scores are used to alleviate this, it is still recommended to report the correlation between encoder variant sensitivity and multiple heart rate/morphology indicators to avoid \"encoder-specific\" conclusions.\n\n5. Ethics/privacy and leakage risks are not fully quantified: EHR retrieval is used for conditional construction (although de-identified), but there is no discussion on whether the retrieval context will leak target case labels/text clues, and there is little assessment of \"synthetic privacy\" and training-test information leakage."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
