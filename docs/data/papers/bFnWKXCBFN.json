We introduce BiCoLoR, a communication-efficient optimization algorithm that combines two widely used and effective strategies: local training, which increases computation between communication rounds, and compression, which encodes high-dimensional vectors into short bitstreams. While these mechanisms have been combined before, compression has typically been applied only to uplink (client-to-server) communication, leaving the downlink (server-to-client) side unaddressed. In practice, however, both directions are costly. We propose BiCoLoR, the first algorithm to combine local training with bidirectional compression using arbitrary unbiased compressors. this joint design achieves accelerated complexity guarantees in both convex and strongly convex heterogeneous settings. Empirically, BiCoLoR outperforms existing algorithms and establishes a new standard in communication efficiency.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["distributed optimization", "communication", "bidirectional compression", "local training", "acceleration"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/17e6c30c7aa9c183f293c69e98ab3a831237e998.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e10229cf0131884e86a44247e4639d477226e729.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents BiColor, a new algorithm for distributed optimization that combines local training and bi-directional compression.

More commonly in FL, only the uplink cost is considered and downlink communication costs are generally ignored.\n\nThis work studies a setting where the total communication cost (TotalCom) is a sum of UpCom + $\\alpha \\cdot$ DownCom for a parameter $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$. If $\\alpha = 0$, then the server to client communication cost is considered zero, and if $\\alpha = 1$, then downlink and uplink costs are symmetric and equally expensive.\n\nThe authors study how local training (LT), that is, each client making a few local updates before sending signals to the server, and bidirectional compression (BiCC), that is, messages sent by the clients to the server and back from the server to the clients being compressed using lossy compression, can reduce the number of bits communicated.\n\nOne key observation is that naive bidirectional compression tends to multiply the errors because the server aggregates lossy compressed messages from the clients to make updates and then compresses the updates again, so the errors pile up.\n\nThe authors introduce an algorithm called BiCoLoR which addresses bidirectional communication by making the uplink and downlink compressions independent and broadcasting differences of updates, where the difference is with respect to a shared parameter $y$ that is maintained the same on all client and server machines.\n\nTo achieve this effect, instead of considering the traditional FL objective of minimizing $\\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x)$, the authors consider $\\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x) + f_s(x) + g(x)$. Here $f_s(x)$ acts like an objective for the server so that it can calculate gradients for it, so in a way the server acts like the $(n+1)$th client. The presence of $g(x)$ lets the clients and server share parameters and reference points, allowing transmission of compressed differences.\n\nIn BiCoLoR, the clients compute local updates using a dual variable and $f_i$, and the shared update $\\hat{y}$ using the gradient of $g$. With probability $p_t$, they send the compressed difference of the local update and $\\hat{y}$ to the server, and the server broadcasts compressed updates back. The paper uses a combination of rand-$K$ compressors, which randomly select and scale $K$ out of $d$ gradient coordinates, with a general class of unbiased compressors with bounded relative variance.\n\nIn the strongly convex case, BiCoLoR achieves linear convergence in the number of total rounds; the TotalCom is bounded by $\\mathcal{O}\\\\left((K + \\alpha K_s)\\left(\\frac{d \\sqrt{\\kappa}}{\\sqrt{K K_s}} + \\frac{d^2}{K K_s} \\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nWhen $\\alpha$ is close to $0$, this becomes $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d \\kappa} + d)$, and it is $\\mathcal{O}(d\\sqrt{\\kappa})$ when $\\alpha$ is not too small.\n\nThe authors also prove a result for the general convex case and show that using a decreasing $p_t$ can reduce total communication rounds to $\\mathcal{O}\\\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{\\epsilon}}\\right)$.\n\nThe paper also includes experiments showing BiCoLoR achieves better convergence in terms of bits compared to baselines.\n\n\\section{What I like}\nThe problem considered in the paper is novel and highly relevant to the conference."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The problem considered in the paper is novel and highly relevant to the conference.\n\nThe paper considers and decouples uplink and downlink costs in distributed optimization.

So the results of BiCoLoR show that compression can get similar TotalCom, but not better. The authors do discuss why getting better convergence in terms of $d$ would be harder.\n\nThis is even without considering the bits required to communicate which $K$ coordinates are sent in the updates, and to achieve these results the optimization problem needs to ensure that there is a shared loss $g$ between the clients and the server.\n\nIn the case where $\\alpha$ is small, the results are not optimal, and another algorithm, ADIANA, in fact has better convergence.
