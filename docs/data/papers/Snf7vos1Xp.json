Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown promise for this task, but existing methods often rely on view-averaged gradient magnitudes, which easily cause needle-like artifacts in sparse views. To overcome this limitation, we propose GR-Gaussian, a graph-based 3DGS framework. It explicitly leverages a CT-specific prior, where regions of the same tissue or material have similar attenuation coefficients, forming a natural structural relationship among neighboring points. This structure motivates a graph-based representation, which guides gradient refinement to suppress needle-like artifacts. To exploit this structure, GR-Gaussian introduces (1) a Denoised Point Cloud Initialization strategy that mitigates initialization errors, and (2) a Pixel-Graph-Aware Gradient strategy that leverages graph-based density differences to refine gradient computation, improving splitting accuracy and density representation. Experiments on X-3D and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of GR-Gaussian, achieving PSNR improvements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021. These results highlight the importance of embedding domain-specific structural priors for accurate CT reconstruction under challenging sparse-view conditions.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Gaussian Splatting ; CT Reconstruction ; Graph-Based Radiative Gaussian Splatting ;"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b6568a7ac5642ed8958f8d643f3812aad15afc32.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7113d72ca5f32c17ef75d5b543cfbd1e2bb5eb45.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents GR-Gaussian, a graph-based framework for sparse-view tomographic reconstruction that extends the principles of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to the CT domain.

What are needle-like artifacts in sparse views, and what are their causes? The author should present the needle-like artifacts and provide a detailed analysis of their causes.\n2. Table 1 is hard to read. What is the configuration? What are the \"HO BS AO Average RD\"?\n3. The proposed method and related results exhibit noticeable secondary artifacts, especially in the chest and teapot cases in Figure 6.\n4. The comparison of reconstruction time with other methods is missing.\n5. Although the proposed graph-based formulation is well-motivated, the mathematical justification for how graph Laplacian regularization directly impacts convergence stability and artifact suppression is weak. The connection between structural priors and gradient refinement could be strengthened with ablation or convergence plots illustrating how the graph term influences training dynamics.\n6. The evaluation relies solely on PSNR and SSIM for quality assessment. While these metrics reflect reconstruction fidelity, they do not capture perceptual or diagnostic quality — particularly important in medical CT contexts.\n7. The proposed PGA strategy modifies gradient magnitudes based on local density differences (Eq. 12), but this adjustment is heuristically designed with limited theoretical or empirical justification for parameter λg. It is unclear how this linear combination between pixel-level and graph-level gradients balances stability versus over-smoothing. The lack of sensitivity analysis or ablation on λg prevents understanding of the robustness of the method across datasets and sparsity levels.\n8. The graph-based operations (KNN search, Laplacian regularization, voxel weighting) add significant computational overhead compared to vanilla 3D Gaussian Splatting. Although the authors mention efficient CUDA implementation, the algorithmic complexity is not analyzed. There is no discussion of scalability when the number of Gaussians (M = 50,000) increases or when applied to higher-resolution CT volumes. A complexity analysis or profiling would clarify whether the method truly achieves real-time or near-real-time performance."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "s7xHKstLC2", "forum": "Snf7vos1Xp", "replyto": "Snf7vos1Xp", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8639/Reviewer_ypEq"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8639/Reviewer_ypEq"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8639/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761725915689, "cdate": 1761725915689, "tmdate": 1762920466379, "mdate": 1762920466379, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a Graph-Based Radiative Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm for sparse-view CT.
