Existing panorama generation methods are limited by requirements for fixed 90° field-of-view inputs, single viewpoint assumptions, or extensive task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach addresses these limitations by leveraging a pretrained multi-view diffusion model (SEVA) to synthesize overlapping novel views along strategically sampled camera trajectories, followed by a novel pose-aware stitching algorithm that exploits known camera geometry for seamless fusion. Unlike traditional feature-based stitching, our pose-aware approach directly utilizes camera poses to determine optimal seams and blending regions. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches (FID of 12.82 on Laval Indoor, 22.99 on SUN360) while supporting arbitrary input configurations without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. \\href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MultiViewPano-71D7/README.md}{Anonymous Repository link.}", "tldr": "MultiViewPano is a training-free framework that uses a pretrained multi-view diffusion model and a pose-aware stitcher to generate 360° panoramas from one or more arbitrarily posed input images.", "keywords": ["360° panorama generation", "multi-view diffusion models", "training-free generative models", "novel view synthesis", "pose-aware image stitching"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5fec1af177e071e108e987ac184259b8858e64e2.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/54f7da28ac24ab3b27a8b8c52248dd6e9145989a.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a novel, training-free method for generating 360° panoramas from pinhole camera images. The approach leverages the existing large-scale video model, SEVA, to synthesize a series of pinhole images along a defined camera trajectory. These images are then seamlessly combined into a final panorama using a custom-designed \"Pose-based Stitcher\" module.\nA key advantage of this method is its flexibility, supporting both single- and multi-view inputs. The authors note that using multiple inputs can improve output quality. This framework overcomes critical limitations of prior work, such as the rigid requirement for 90° field-of-view inputs, the need for dataset-specific fine-tuning, and the inability to handle multiple input images.

Its performance on the Laval Indoor and SUN360 datasets even surpasses some methods that require dataset-specific fine-tuning.\n\nThe proposed method is highly flexible. Unlike prior work, it does not require input images to have a precise 90° field-of-view (FoV) or be captured from a fixed position. Instead, it supports any pinhole camera images as input, as long as their intrinsics and extrinsics (poses) are known.\n\nThe paper is well-structured, with clear logic that is easy to follow."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Lack of 360° Wraparound Consistency: The paper claims superior realism and semantic consistency. However, I observed a significant lack of 360° wraparound consistency at the horizontal edges (left and right) of the panoramas. When attempting to \"wrap\" the panorama by stitching the far-right edge to the far-left, the seams do not align seamlessly. This issue is evident in the first example of Figure 5, as well as in the second and fourth (top-to-bottom) examples in Figure 6. I question if this is a failure of the blending/feathering trick at the boundary, as this issue is notably absent in the CubeDiff results. This left-to-right consistency is crucial for panoramic images.\n\n\n2. Critique of the 2D Stitching Method: I have reservations about the proposed stitching method. The approach, which relies on dynamic programming based on 2D pixel-wise L2 costs, seems to prioritize 2D pixel similarity. A more geometrically-sound approach should perhaps be considered. For instance, in overlapping regions, priority should be given to points closer to the camera to correctly handle 3D occlusion, rather than preserving content based solely on surrounding pixel consistency.\n\n3. Confounding Variable (Clarity AI Upscaler): The use of the powerful \"Clarity AI Upscaler\" as a post-processing step introduces a confounding variable. It becomes difficult to determine whether the final seamless quality is achieved by the proposed dynamic programming stitcher or by the upscaler (which itself performs seamless tiling).\n\n4. Unfair Comparison: Related to the point above, it seems unfair to compare their final, post-processed (upscaled) results against the non-upscaled outputs of the baseline methods.\n\n5. Missing Discussion on Computational Cost: The framework relies on multiple large-scale models (SEVA, Clarity AI Upscaler). This likely results in significant computational overhead (e.g., resource consumption, inference latency) compared to other methods, yet this critical aspect is not discussed or benchmarked.\n\n6. Insufficient Validation of Multi-View Claims: The claim to handle any number and pose of inputs is not sufficiently validated.\n\n（1）The experiments are missing a quantitative ablation study on how the number of input images or the nature of their trajectories impacts the final output quality.\n\n（2）Additionally, the methodological choice of using the camera pose centroid as the \"scene center\" for multi-view inputs seems arbitrary. This is not the \"true\" scene center, and it is questionable whether this is the most robust or geometrically reasonable choice.\n\n7. Missing Related Work: The related work section is missing comparisons to other recent and highly relevant methods that also generate panoramas from pinhole inputs, such as PanoDecouple[1] (CVPR'25). While DA2: Depth Anything in Any Direction[2] might be too recent, a discussion and comparison against PanoDecouple seem warranted.\n\n8. Missing LLM Usage Disclosure: A required section detailing the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) appears to be missing. I thoroughly reviewed the main paper and the supplementary materials, but could not find the LLM usage disclosure as mandated by ICLR."}, "questions": {"value": "1. On Geometric Consistency and 3DGS Potential: The paper highlights improved consistency. How robust is this consistency in practice? Specifically, are the final stitched panoramas geometrically accurate enough to be used for downstream 3D scene reconstruction tasks, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)? If this method can serve as a reliable \"pseudo-camera\" rig for 3DGS, I would consider this a significant contribution and would be inclined to raise my score.\n\n2.
