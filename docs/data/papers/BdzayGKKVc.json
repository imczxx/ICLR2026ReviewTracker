Existing evaluation approaches often rely on image-text similarity metrics like CLIP, which lack precision. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to evaluate text-guided image editing models in a more grounded manner, along two critical dimensions: functional correctness, assessed via automatically generated multiple-choice questions that verify whether the intended change was successfully applied; and image content preservation, which ensures that non-targeted regions of the image remain visually consistent using an object-aware masking technique and preservation scoring. The benchmark includes over 1000 high-quality editing examples across 20 diverse content categories, each annotated with detailed editing instructions, evaluation questions, and spatial object masks. We note that our benchmark does not cover global editing tasks such as full style transfer, which remain important but are outside our current scope. We conduct a large-scale study comparing GPT-Image-, the latest flagship in the text-guided image editing space, against several state-of-the-art editing models, and validate our automatic metrics against human ratings. Results show that GPT-Image-1 leads in instruction-following accuracy, but often over-modifies irrelevant image regions, highlighting a key trade-off in the current model behavior. GIE-Bench provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing more accurate evaluation of text-guided image editing.", "tldr": "We present GIE-Bench, a benchmark for local text-guided image editing that disentangles functional correctness and content preservation with VQA-style and mask-based evaluation.", "keywords": ["text-guided image editing", "multimodal large language models", "instruction following", "local editing"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/da0b46bb82d9230cf7b4a79e96fc99665c7162a4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b7beb8f4edf5b3baa9a6e489e646f4c798fa6512.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a new benchmark for evaluating text-guided image editing abilities for existing models.

The proposal seems timely.\n+ The automatic pipeline involving GPT, GroundingDINO, SAM and masked metrics is well-engineered.\n+ The usage of multiple-choice VQA evaluation is more robust than binary yes/no formats (e.g., I2E-Bench), reducing chance accuracy and allowing large-scale automated evaluation.\n+ The empirical evaluation seems extensive and thorough."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Although the introduction of QA-based functional correctness is interesting, the proposed benchmark, if I understand correctly, focus primarily on single-turn image editing. Multi-step, compositional, or iterative editing scenarios are missing and therefore limit the real-world applicability.\n- The scale of human evaluation seems limited. Human study in sec. 4.3 uses 100 examples with 4 annotators, which is relatively small to 1 k+ samples in the full benchmark.\n- The QA stage is heavily based on gpt-4o model. This could lead to potential model bias for the benchmark; future updates of the corresponding model would render the current report outdated.\n- The content preservation ability assessment still relies heavily on masked MSE/PSNR, which remains low-level and is similar to existing benchmarks setup.\n- Admittely, I am not very familiar with the current progress of this particular sub-domain.

Second, it measures \"content preservation\" by using smart object masking to check if the model messed up parts of the image it wasn't supposed to touch.
