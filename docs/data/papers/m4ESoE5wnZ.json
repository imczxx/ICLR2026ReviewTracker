A small, standard transformer (just two layers) can learn the classic induction behavior. This does not require special positional encodings or carefully hand-crafted weights.The same basic induction behavior can emerge in normal multi-head / multi-layer transformers. It also works in deep models. Even in later layers, where tokens have already been transformed, the model can still perform an induction-like lookup — copying not the raw next token, but the next token’s representation. So the mechanism scales with depth.\n\n2.

Unrealistic global access assumption. The construction in Theorem 3.1 appears to require each position to aggregate global information about the sequence, including knowledge of the last token. This assumption is incompatible with causal attention, which restricts each position to past context. The paper does not discuss how such global aggregation could be approximated or implemented in a causal transformer.\n\n2. Scalability and practicality. Even setting aside causality, the mechanism in Theorem 3.1 assumes precise sequence-wide coordination that seems impractical for long contexts. It is unclear whether such an exact global signal can emerge or be learned in realistic training regimes.\n\n3. Connection to real models. The paper would benefit from stronger theoretical or empirical evidence that this form of “indicator-based induction” actually arises in trained transformers.

However, the core of the analysis focuses on what a network can represent, without any evidence that such structures actually emerge through optimization and therefore are realistic to study. It's unclear to me if these elegant theoretical solutions are on a plausible optimization path for a network trained with gradient descent, or if they represent one of many possible, but not necessarily learned, solutions.\n\n**Potential issue in the proof of Theorem A.1.** The target vector ID(X) is defined with a zero in its first entry; however, the construction seems to me to produce a 1 in that position. Specifically, the transformation matrix E ensures the first row of the intermediate matrix Z* is zero. According to the FFN's definition and the paper's own calculation, a zero input yields an output of 1. This would make the first row of the final output matrix a row of ones, which seems to contradict the definition of ID(X).\n\n**Relative positional encoding:** The paper proposes a new, inverted mechanism for induction heads where Layer 1 performs the token matching and Layer 2 performs the copy. While this is a valid theoretical construction, I wonder if it is less flexible than standard induction heads. The \"+1\" offset logic (copying the token immediately following a match) seems to me hardcoded into the architecture of the second layer's attention and FFN. This contrasts with mechanisms that utilize relative positional information, which can more naturally learn to attend to various offsets.\n\n**Multi-Head Case :** The construction seems to reduce the multi-head problem to the single-head case and does not seem to address the more complex question of how the output from multiple heads is used to form an induction circuit.\n\n**Experiments:** The experiments lack section lacks clarity about the training task. It is unclear if the repeated pattern is newly generated for each sequence, which would force the model to perform in-context learning via an induction mechanism or if the patterns are drawn from a fixed set, the model could solve the task by simply memorizing associations without needing to look back at the context, which would not necessarily validate the formation of induction heads.\n\nFurthermore, the experiment, which trains a network with some layers randomly frozen, demonstrates a degree of flexibility but does not directly test whether the specific, multi-stage circuit proposed in the theoretical proofs is what a model actually learns. The experiment supports the general idea that induction can emerge under constraints, but it doesn't bridge the gap between the paper's specific construction and the mechanisms learned in practice."}, "questions": {"value": "2.

Could the authors comment on the flexibility of their proposed two-layer circuit? For instance, could the model learn to implement an induction head that copies the token at position i+2 instead of i+1, or would this require a completely different weight construction for the second layer?\n    \n4. The paper highlights removing the reliance on RPE as a key contribution. However, some prior theoretical work on induction heads also uses absolute positional encodings. Could the authors clarify what specific \"reliance on RPE\" in previous research their work overcomes? Does this refer to a specific architectural RPE component, or the conceptual reliance on relative distances between tokens, which their model also seems to bypass in favor of an absolute-indexing copy mechanism?\n\n5. Could the authors please clarify the data generation process for the experiment in Section 4? Specifically, is the A B C -> D pattern newly and randomly generated for each sequence in the training set, or are the patterns drawn from a fixed, predefined set?\n    \n6.
