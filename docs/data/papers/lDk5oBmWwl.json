However, classical BRL methods assume known forms of transition and reward models, reducing their applicability in real-world problems. As a result, recent deep BRL methods have started to incorporate model learning, though the use of neural networks directly on the joint data and task parameters requires optimising the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). ELBOs are difficult to optimise and may result in indistinctive task parameters, hence compromised BRL policies. To this end, we introduce a novel deep BRL method, $\\textbf{G}$eneralised $\\textbf{Li}$near Models in deep $\\textbf{B}$ayesian $\\textbf{RL}$ with Learnable Basis Functions ($\\textbf{GLiBRL}$), that enables efficient and accurate learning of transition and reward models, with fully tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference on task parameters and model noises. On challenging MetaWorld ML10 and ML45 benchmarks, GLiBRL improves the success rate of one of the state-of-the-art deep BRL methods, VariBAD, by up to $2.7\\times$. Comparing against representative or recent deep BRL / Meta-RL methods, such as MAML, RL$^2$, SDVT, TrMRL and ECET, GLiBRL also demonstrates its low-variance and decent performance consistently.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Bayesian Reinforcement Learning", "Bayes-Adaptive Markov Decision Processes", "Meta Learning", "Meta-Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/72260e29bc59f425c3c0e23d7afd6bf9c4296681.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c56034ab36092f5d19e79302239af290b2baed64.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The work proposes a novel Bayesian RL method which avoids the difficulty of optimization of the ELBO.

The work begins by thoroughly motivating why BRL methods commonly require optimizing the ELBO before highlighting how the linear assumption enables them to avoid this issue at all. The resulting method provides a tractable, permutation-invariant posterior which allows for closed form marginal likelyhood updating.\nThe empirical evaluation highlights that the proposed GLiBRL approach has the capability of outperforming BRL/meta-RL baselines in the challenging metaworld setting.\n\nOverall it seems like an interesting contribution to ICLR and I am leaning towards acceptance."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The work is very well motivated and is a good fit for the ICRL community.

The linearity in learned feature space introduces an expressivity trade off; when true dynamics or rewards demand strongly nonlinear or interaction heavy structure, the burden shifts entirely to the feature networks.

The baseline set, while representative, omits some strong recent meta RL or Bayesian model based baselines and does not include PEARL like variants that more directly test the claim that conjugate training avoids ELBO issues in comparable settings.\n3. Computational efficiency claims are qualitative. There is limited reporting of wall clock time, memory, and per episode update cost as a function of basis width and dataset size, and no scaling plots that demonstrate the practical advantage of closed form updates as feature dimension grows.\n4. The probabilistic assumptions are restrictive, including Gaussian noise and independence between transition and reward parameters.

How would the method handle non identity row covariances in a matrix normal likelihood, or heteroscedastic and heavy tailed noise; is there a reparameterisation or approximate conjugacy that preserves a tractable training objective, and what is the empirical impact on performance?\n4. Since a key motivation is avoiding ELBO collapse, can you add diagnostics beyond expected KL, such as mutual information between latents and data or predictive log likelihood trajectories, and include a PEARL style comparator tuned on MetaWorld V3 to clarify whether GLiBRL’s advantage stems from conjugacy, feature learning, or both."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ViF0T6pvxy", "forum": "lDk5oBmWwl", "replyto": "lDk5oBmWwl", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7503/Reviewer_Lz3W"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7503/Reviewer_Lz3W"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7503/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761923496192, "cdate": 1761923496192, "tmdate": 1762919613445, "mdate": 1762919613445, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the use of a linear model (of learned basis functions) for producing a parametrized distribution describing a family of tasks, for use in a Bayesian RL framework.

Their Background seems to be indicate that the field jumped straight from generic classical Bayesian RL (which the title implies this paper is, but which it is not, and which is correctly attributed to Duff) to meta-learning. In fact the setting the paper is in is either a latent-context MDP (due to Brunskill and Li, 2013 or so) or a hidden-parameter MDP (due to Doshi-Velez, 2016 or so), depending on whether the latent parameter generating the family of MDPs is discrete or continuous. The authors being unaware of these lines of work lead them to miss important related literature, for example the Bayesian hidden-parameter MDP model due to Killian (2017), which is probably the state-of-the-art model in this context, and very close to the model proposed here. An experimental comparison to that work, as well as follow-on work by Yao and Killian, is mandatory. For example, the authors mention sampling using the learned models as future work, but Killian already did that, eight years ago.\n\nThe experiments are also somewhat limited, being five samples over two domains, one of which does not show much improvement over an (at this point) very well established but quite generic meta-learning method."}, "questions": {"value": "In your background section, do I understand correctly that by \"context\" you mean a batch of sample transitions from a single task?
