Effectively aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Given the immense search space of molecules and the importance of accurate protein–ligand modeling, this is a timely and valuable direction with broad relevance to both the ML and drug discovery communities.\n2. **Interesting method**: The proposed MOLCHORD framework is novel in combining a diffusion-based structure encoder with a large autoregressive language model (NatureLM variant), aligned via multimodal pretraining and refined with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This design enables flexible integration of protein sequence (FASTA), structure, and pocket-level information with molecular generation, representing an innovative multimodal approach that goes beyond pocket-only baselines.\n3. **Good writing and presentation**: The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a logical flow from motivation to methodology and experiments. The staged training process is explained systematically, and the results are presented with comprehensive baselines and ablations, making the contributions accessible and convincing to the reader."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Limitation to 1D/2D design**: The method only generates ligands as SMILES strings, without atomic 3D coordinates, meaning it is not a true 3D molecular generator. Therefore, it should also be compared with strong 1D/2D sequence-based baselines such as Reinvent 4 [1], which have been reported to outperform 3D approaches in SBDD [2]. Furthermore, previous 3D baselines (e.g., DecompDiff, MolCRAFT) reported Vina scores on raw generated structures without redocking, whereas MOLCHORD relies only on redocked poses, which may make direct comparisons less straightforward.\n2. **Rigid protein assumption**: MOLCHORD assumes proteins are rigid and does not model flexibility or conformational dynamics. Given the importance of induced fit and protein motion in real binding processes, this limitation should be explicitly discussed.\n3. **Unclear contribution of protein sequence/global structure**: Although the authors include FASTA and whole-protein features in pretraining and run some prompt-based ablations, there is no quantitative ablation study that isolates how much these inputs improve ligand generation compared to pocket-only conditioning. This weakens the justification for incorporating global protein information.\n4. **Unspecified SMILES representation**: The paper does not clarify whether canonical or randomized SMILES are used during training and evaluation. Since SMILES augmentation is widely known to affect generalization and molecular diversity, the choice should be specified and justified.\n\n[1] Reinvent 4: Modern AI–driven generative molecule design.\n\n[2] Structure-based Drug Design Benchmark: Do 3D Methods Really Dominate?"}, "questions": {"value": "1. **Choice of DPO vs. direct reward optimization**: Why does the RL stage adopt Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rather than directly using the original docking and property scores as scalar rewards, especially since those same scores are used for evaluation? Doesn’t the preference formulation risk losing information about score magnitudes?\n2. **Role of whole protein structure**: Since the binding pocket is treated as static during ligand design, what is the benefit of incorporating the whole protein structure? How can atoms outside the pocket meaningfully influence the generation process?\n3. **Reward design for fused rings**: Why is the number of fused rings explicitly included in the RL reward function, rather than directly using scores of QED and SA?\n4. **RL training dynamics**: Could the authors provide a reward curve or training trajectory during the RL process to illustrate stability, convergence, and the trade-off between affinity, diversity, and drug-like properties?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "YjzXICFrG5", "forum": "uuMMdEfFXR", "replyto": "uuMMdEfFXR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20661/Reviewer_MH1k"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20661/Reviewer_MH1k"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20661/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760981095017, "cdate": 1760981095017, "tmdate": 1762934049704, "mdate": 1762934049704, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes MOLCHORD to align protein structural representations with molecular representations in SBDD.
