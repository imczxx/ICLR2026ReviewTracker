Due to its ambiguous computational complexity, heuristic approaches such as simulated annealing are frequently used, achieving high solution probabilities while avoiding exhaustive enumeration. However, traditional simulated annealing usually struggles with low sampling efficiency and reduced solution-finding probability in complex or large graph problems. In this study, we integrate the principles of quantum technology to address the graph isomorphism problem. By mapping the solution space to a quantum many-body system, we developed a parameterized model for variational simulated annealing. This approach emphasizes the regions of the solution space that are most likely to contain the optimal solution, thereby enhancing the search accuracy.\nArtificial neural networks were utilized to parameterize the quantum many-body system, leveraging their capacity for efficient function approximation to perform accurate sampling in the intricate energy landscapes of graph problems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Quantum Algorithm", "Graph Isomorphism", "Neural Network Quantum State", "Simulated Quantum Annealing", "Variational Monte Carlo"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e71a8f97e37802ee0fdfa811c3c092154a67a501.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a quantum-inspired algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem by combining simulated quantum annealing with neural-network quantum states (NQS).
