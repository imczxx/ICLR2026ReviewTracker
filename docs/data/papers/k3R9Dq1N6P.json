While existing repository understanding methods have advanced the field, they predominantly rely on surface-level code retrieval and lack the ability for deep reasoning over multiple files, complex software architectures, and grounding answers in long-range code dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose DeepRepoQA, a repository question answering (QA) approach in realistic code environments. DeepRepoQA builds on the agentic framework where LLM agents find answers through a systematic tree search over structured action spaces. Our key innovations include balanced exploration and exploitation via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for multi-hop repository reasoning and LLM feedback that provides learned priors and values to reduce search depth and reduce drift. The system maintains structured memory paths that enable reliable evidence synthesis and traceable reasoning steps. Comprehensive experiments on SWE-QA demonstrate substantial performance gains over strong baselines, validating the effectiveness of systematic MCTS-guided exploration for multi-hop repository reasoning.", "tldr": "DeepRepoQA, a repository question answering (QA) approach where LLM agents find answers through a systematic tree search over structured action spaces.", "keywords": ["large language models", "code question answering", "understanding software repository"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b1d1f568478a1622cfa21db3854890532ee2d8d5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper propose DeepRepoQA, a agentic framework where LLMs agents find answers through systematic tree search over structured actions spaces on code repositories.

Novel approach. The paper positions repository-level QA problems as an MCTS planning problem, showing its novelty.

Strong empirical results. The paper conducts an extensive evaluation, substantially outperforming the baselines. Especially, DeepRepoQA outperforms the baselines by a lot in terms of completeness and reasoning, consistent with the claim that MCTS-guided exploration leads to more comprehensive and reliable answers.\n3.

The process for ending the search is not well-defined."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The paper's description of the \"Simulation\" phase (Section 3.5) and the \"Evaluation Agent\" (Section 3.4) is ambiguous. The agent is supposed to estimate a scalar value $V_{\\theta}(s,a)$, where the $\\theta$ notation implies a learned model. However, no training process or dataset for this value function is described. Is this agent a fine-tuned model? Or is it, in fact, a zero-shot LLM prompt providing a heuristic score (akin to the LLM-as-a-Judge)?\n2. Why token cost analysis is not performed? How expensive is this MCTS-based approach? Since the looks like a test-time scaling for repo-level QA problems, and in stages like perception it needs to summarize and produce a concise situational report from the direct trajectory and sibling attempts.\n3. Could LLM-as-judge introduce some bias to the evaluation? The LLM-as-judge is used prevalently in evaluation. Prior works show some threats of using LLM-as-judge for scoring[1] [2][3][4][5].\n4. When exactly will the search end? The paper states that termination occurs when the \"Finish\" action is selected by the MCTS loop. This suggests Finish is just another action (like FindClass or ViewCode ) proposed by the Planning Agent. It is unclear how the agent learns when it has gathered so-called \"sufficient evidence\" to propose this action, or how the Evaluation Agent scores it to make it a winning choice. An early Finish action would lead to an incomplete answer, while a late Finish would waste resources.\n\n[1] Krumdick, M., Lovering, C., Reddy, V., Ebner, S., & Tanner, C. \"No Free Labels: Limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge Without Human Grounding.\" arXiv:2503.05061.\n[2] Shi, L., Ma, C., Liang, W., Diao, X., Ma, W., & Vosoughi, S. \"Judging the Judges: A Systematic Study of Position Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge.\" arXiv:2406.07791 (June 2024, rev.

I think the paper would be greatly strengthened with better empirical evaluations. There are two weaknesses related to the SWE-QA benchmark. First, it is constructed from the 12 Python repositories that SWE-bench uses. Recent LLMs have data leakage issues on those repositories. Using more contamination-free datasets such as SWE-bench-Live [1] could help reduce this leakage issue. Second, the final scoring is based on LLM-as-a-judge, which can be biased by response length [2]. DeepRepoQA utilizes MCTS to iteratively collect information to produce a final answer. Compared to direct prompting or RAG-based baselines, it might produce longer answers and the empirical section does not mention controlling final answer length. It would be useful for the authors to comment on this.\nFurthermore, it would be useful to have some human correlation data to confirm LLM-as-a-judge does provide sensible evaluation results.\n\n[1] Zhang, Linghao, et al. \"SWE-bench Goes Live!.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2505.23419 (2025).\n[2] Hu, Zhengyu, et al. \"Explaining length bias in llm-based preference evaluations.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.01085 (2024).\n\n2.
