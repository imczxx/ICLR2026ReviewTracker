Recently, developments in ensemble theory have demonstrated that, for a wide variety of loss functions, the expected risk of the ensemble can be decomposed into a bias and variance term together with an additional term called *diversity*. By using this theoretical framework and by interpreting a *single* neural network as an ensemble, we expose a hidden diversity term in the decomposition of a neural network's expected risk. We argue that the additional diversity term regulates the variance error, thus identifying a new source of *implicit regularization* in neural networks. We demonstrate this regularization on regression and classification datasets by estimating the bias, variance, and diversity terms for both MLPs and CNNs. Using double descent as an example, we observe that diversity significantly increases for wide overparameterized neural networks. These results demonstrate a new perspective on implicit regularization in neural networks and open new possible avenues of research into their generalization.", "tldr": "By interpreting the neural network as an implicit ensemble, we expose an additional term in the bias-variance decomposition called diversity, which acts as an implicit regularizer.", "keywords": ["implicit regularization", "implicit ensembles", "neural networks", "bias-variance tradeoff", "double descent", "generalization"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/04cdf51394c3fa98db9e42a663ebdcb249349ce3.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ac433b1f04c86470e2dbe66ee1cb600d693bc983.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "- The paper proposes writing a single neural network with a dense final layer, as a weighted sum of subpredictors, where the weights are the rows of the logit layer scaled by a scalar multiplier depending on the initialization scheme.\n- It applies Wood et al.'s decomposition to these subpredictors, viewing them as an ensemble of learners that exhibit a \"diversity\" term.\n- The experiments suggest that, if I understood correctly, the risk of a single neural network can be estimated by computing the bias, variance, and diversity terms on the subpredictors."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "If I understood correctly, this work presents a novel application of Wood et al.'s decomposition to a single neural network, offering interesting insights into the generalization properties of deep nets.

I assume the models are trained, but this should be clearly stated. Are different training sets used since, in the expectations further below (Eq. 10), D is a random variable?\n4. What exactly is plotted in Figure 3 (right)? How are all the terms computed? Is it (option 1) the same training subsets as in Figure 3 (left), or (option 2) are these estimated quantities over subpredictors? If option 2, are the subpredictors trained on the entire training set, while the estimators in the left figures are trained only on subsets? Is there a scaling factor between quantities on the left and their estimators on the right ?\n\nMinor comments:\n===============\n5. Line 256: q^i versus q_{(i)} — why the change from subscript to superscript?\n6. Section 3.1: The indices i are used both for training examples and subpredictors, which causes confusion (e.g., the formula for R_{emp} on line 117 does not make sense). It is also used in d_i, where I assume it refers to input space dimension.\n7. Line 376: \"It is known that width is the primary factor for good network performance\" — this should be toned down, as for example, large language models often require increased depth rather than just increased width.\n8. Line 849 (Appendix): \"Importantly, we use the same seed to initialize the neural network weights on each trial set.\" If this is an important point, it should be discussed in the main body: what happens when seeds are not fixed?\n9.

(2023) is that they consider (pre-softmax) logit ensembling for classification models. I’ve often felt that this differs somewhat from the common practice of performing (post-softmax) probability ensembling. While logit ensembling is sometimes used, from a Bayesian perspective, if we think of modeling the categorical predictive distribution, (post-softmax) probability ensembling would be the more appropriate formulation in the context of Bayesian model averaging. I wonder, though, whether a similar line of reasoning could be extended to justify post-softmax ensembling as well; what are your thoughts on that?\n\n- One interesting aspect of neural network ensembles is that training individual members separately and then combining them often leads to different outcomes compared to training them jointly in an ensemble form from the start (Allen-Zhu and Li, 2023). The ensemble considered in this work corresponds to the latter case.
