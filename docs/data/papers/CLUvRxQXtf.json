Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a solution by adapting the model to these shifts during inference, without requiring labeled data. Prior methods like CLIP-OT leverage optimal transport for pseudo-labeling. However, the quality of these labels can be unreliable, leading to suboptimal adaptation and error accumulation. To address this, we propose CLIP-DR, which introduces two extra key components: (1) a cosine similarity loss to align image features with textual prototypes, stabilizing the adaptation direction; and (2) an information maximization regularizer to promote confident and diverse predictions, preventing model collapse. Extensive evaluation on seven benchmarks (covering 15 corruption types and domain shifts, totaling $\\sim$6000 trials) demonstrates that CLIP-DR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while adding $\\sim$0.01 seconds of computing time per batch (e.g., 4\\% and 12\\% higher than CLIP-OT and WATT-S on the TinyImageNet-C dataset with 1.98 second per batch).", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Test-time adaptation; Vision language model; classification; deep learning; calibration"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/093ad3e5983e368873e589cba3a1a1efdc2306ba.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a novel method, CLIP-TTA, which adapts CLIP models for downstream tasks without requiring labeled data.

The problem that how to utilize unlabeled data is central to several areas of machine learning, such as unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. A common approach is self-training, which alternates between assigning pseudo-labels and training the model with confident data. In our view, this paper improves the self-training framework by integrating optimal transport into pseudo-labeling, which is an interesting and inspiring idea.\n\n2. Building upon the improved self-training framework, the paper introduces two regularization losses which use the confidence (or entropy) of predicted sample to prevent collapse. These regularization methods are straightforward and conceptually sound.\n\n3. Figure 3 (Left) shows that the proposed method is not only effective but also efficient."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. In my opinion, this paper is somewhat incremental and similar with CLIP-OT [1]. While it adds two regularization losses to improve the pseudo-labeling process, the novelty feels reduced compared to CLIP-OT. I would appreciate a more detailed comparison to highlight the differences between this work and CLIP-OT.\n\n2. In Figure 5, hyper-parameters $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$  have minimal impact on the average accuracy of CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C. I suggest the authors provide further explanation on the effectiveness of the proposed regularization losses.\n\n3. CLIP-TTA updates only the visual encoder $\\theta$ during the adaptation process, assuming that distribution shifts affect only the images. This assumption limits the scope of application for this method.\n\n4. If I understand correctly, both regularization losses are computed on the output logits. The additional lines in Figure 2 seem unnecessary and make the framework more complex and difficult to understand.\n\n[1] Words Matter: Leveraging Individual Text Embeddings for Code Generation in CLIP Test-Time Adaptation, ArXiv 24"}, "questions": {"value": "See my questions in weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "bav56HiRTe", "forum": "CLUvRxQXtf", "replyto": "CLUvRxQXtf", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2333/Reviewer_dKuy"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2333/Reviewer_dKuy"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2333/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761762046085, "cdate": 1761762046085, "tmdate": 1762916195740, "mdate": 1762916195740, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new test-time adaptation method named CLIP-TTA for VLMs that addresses the unreliable pseudo-labels of prior work like CLIP-OT.

The direct objective of $\\mathcal{L}\\_{cos}$ is to align features, while $\\mathcal{L}\\_{IM}$ aims to promote confident and diverse predictions to prevent model collapse. The paper fails to clearly articulate the theoretical chain of reasoning for why \"alignment\" and \"preventing collapse\" directly solve the problem of over-confidence, making the connection feel indirect and insufficiently supported.\n\n2.\tThe experimental validation omits several standard and challenging benchmarks. To better assess robustness, evaluation on ImageNet-C[1] is necessary. Furthermore, to test generalization on different data types, the paper would benefit from including fine-grained classification datasets from the CLIP zero-shot suite, such as the DTD[2] or EuroSAT[3].\n\n3.\tAll experiments are conducted solely on the CLIP (ViT-B/32) backbone. To demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed dual-regularization approach, it should be tested on other vision-language model architectures, such as BLIP, to prove that the method is not just tailored to CLIP.\n\n4.\tThe paper's core methodological contribution is arguably incremental. The problem formulation (Eq. 1) is standard, and the optimal transport mechanism (Eqs. 2-8) is adopted directly from the CLIP-OT baseline.
