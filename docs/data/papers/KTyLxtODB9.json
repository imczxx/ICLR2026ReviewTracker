ROGA moves beyond simple reactive loops by introducing four foundational algorithmic innovations: (1) \\textbf{Active World Modeling}, an iterative process where the agent actively probes the environment to construct its own world model; (2) a \\textbf{Persistent Symbolic Memory} that explicitly tracks the state evolution for temporal reasoning; and (3) a \\textbf{Dynamic Capability Evolution} model for long-term adaptation and meta-learning on the agent's own capabilities.\nComprehensive experiments on widely used benchmarks show that ROGA consistently outperforms existing ATG agents by up to 13.64\\%.\nThese results underscore ROGA's potential to advance the ATG paradigm, delivering a practical pathway toward building sustainable generalist agents in realistic environments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Generalist agent", "Office productivity", "Tool generation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/219ac812a716786af9ad9a1a8d6c71b824b36942.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper “ROGA: Scaling Generalist Agents for Office Productivity Tasks via Tool Generation” introduces a new framework, ROGA, to advance the paradigm of Automatic Tool Generation (ATG) for generalist agents operating in real-world office environments such as Excel, Word, and PowerPoint.

We are especially grateful for the recognition of our work's **key strengths**, including the systematic identification of challenges in generalist agents (Reviewers SvUL, jaLz, akoz), the clear motivation study (Reviewers jaLz, SvUL), the well-structured writing (Reviewers SvUL, jaLz, akoz), the strong empirical results that show consistent outperformance (Reviewers 8iBf, jaLz, SvUL, akoz) and good generalization (Reviewers jaLz, SvUL), and significant practical impact (Reviewer jaLz).\n\nWe also deeply appreciate the insightful suggestions for improvement. We are particularly grateful for the feedback (from **Reviewer jaLz** and **8iBf**) that pushed us to move beyond a component-level description and articulate the core conceptual novelty of our work. Inspired by this, we have undertaken a **major revision** of the manuscript to reframe our contributions around the fundamental **paradigm shift** that ROGA represents.\n\nTo clarify this shift and better highlight our algorithmic innovations, we have mapped our original engineering-focused terminology to the new paradigm-level concepts that they instantiate. As suggested by **Reviewer jaLz**, this reframing clarifies that ROGA’s components are not just \"thoughtful engineering\" but concrete implementations of a principled and foundational contribution to agent design.\n\n| **Original Engineering Terminology (in Original Paper)** | **Revised Paradigm-Level Concept (in Revised Paper)** | **Core Limitation Addressed** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Comprehension–Operation Paradigm | **Active World Modeling (AWM)** | Failure to build a coherent world model from long, partially observable contexts. |\n| State-Sharing Sandbox | **Persistent Symbolic Memory (PSM)** | Memory-less execution model that fails to track state evolution in iterative tasks. |\n| Dual-Reflection + Tool Lifecycle FSM | **Dynamic Capability Evolution (including Situated Self-Correction & A Formalism for Capability Lifecycle)** | Static, one-shot capability generation that leads to redundant regeneration. |\n\nBased on all the valuable feedback, we have made the following major revisions to the paper:\n\n1. **Reframed Core Novelty Around a New Agent Paradigm (Reviewers jaLz, 8iBf, akoz):** We have significantly revised the Abstract, Introduction, and Methodology (Section 3) to articulate ROGA's three core algorithmic innovations: **Active World Modeling (AWM)**, **Persistent Symbolic Memory (PSM)**, and **Dynamic Capability Evolution (DCE)**. This reframing clarifies that our work introduces a new, coherent paradigm for agents in **long-term, stateful, partially observable environments**, particularly evidenced in Office tasks, rather than just a collection of engineered components.\n2. **Expanded Discussion on Related Work (Reviewer 8iBf):** We have restructured and expanded the Related Work section (Section 2.1) to include a dedicated discussion on **Tool Retrieval** (e.g., Toolformer, ToolLLM) and hybrid retrieval-generation approaches. This helps to more sharply define ROGA's unique contribution in addressing the preceding challenge of inferring tool requirements from partially observable environments.\n3. **Strengthened Cross-Domain Generalization Study (Reviewers akoz, jaLz, SvUL):** To further demonstrate ROGA's generalizability beyond office tasks, we have expanded our evaluation to include the **MMLU-Pro** benchmark, a challenging test of knowledge-intensive reasoning. The results (Table 5) show that ROGA maintains strong, competitive performance, confirming that our paradigm extends agent capabilities without sacrificing performance on general tasks.\n4. **Clarified Cost-Benefit Analysis (Reviewers jaLz, akoz):** We extended the \"Cost Analysis\" in Section 4.2 to explain that ROGA’s higher token usage is a strategic investment in a more robust reasoning paradigm (AWM and DCE) that prevents costly task failures. We also highlight that our **Dynamic Capability Evolution** mechanism serves as a built-in cost mitigation strategy by amortizing tool generation costs over time.\n5. **Added In-Depth Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis (Reviewers 8iBf, jaLz, SvUL) in Appendix C:** We added the detailed analyses to provide deeper insight into why our system works, including:\n    - A systematic **failure case analysis** that quantitatively links our ablation results to the primary error types.\n    - An analysis of the **limitations of our self-correction mechanism**.\n    - A **performance breakdown by file type**.\n6. **Provided Implementation Details (Reviewer akoz) in** **Appendix D.**\n\nWe believe these extensive revisions have significantly strengthened the paper and more clearly articulated its core scientific contributions. We thank all reviewers once again for their invaluable guidance, which has been instrumental in improving our work.\n\nSincerely,\nAuthors"}}, "id": "yW9oweDgyN", "forum": "KTyLxtODB9", "replyto": "KTyLxtODB9", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7225/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7225/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7225/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763734398390, "cdate": 1763734398390, "tmdate": 1763741073366, "mdate": 1763741073366, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ROGA, a generalist agent framework designed to overcome limitations of current Automatic Tool Generation (ATG) agents in open-ended office productivity tasks.
