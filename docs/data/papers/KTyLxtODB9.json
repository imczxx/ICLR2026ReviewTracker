To address these, ROGA proposes four key innovations — (i) a Comprehension–Operation (Comp-Op) paradigm that separates task understanding from execution to capture fine-grained file details, (ii) a Dual-Reflection mechanism that performs both functional and semantic validation of generated tools, (iii) a State-Sharing Sandbox for consistent intermediate context management, and (iv) a Finite-State Machine (FSM) for tool lifecycle management that automates validation, reuse, and deprecation of tools.

The Dual-Reflection mechanism provides a concrete and reproducible approach for improving tool reliability through iterative validation, while the State-Sharing Sandbox effectively enables multi-step tool coordination—an essential requirement for real-world automation tasks. The paper demonstrates methodological rigor with detailed benchmark coverage, using multiple baselines (AutoAgent, OctoTools, OWL, and SheetAgent) and both office and non-office domains.

Although benchmarks and metrics are clearly listed, the paper does not provide implementation details for the planner’s decision policy, the functional testing procedure, or exact hyperparameter configurations for reflection or state management. The work mentions “shared memory Mt” and “transition function δ” but omits practical instantiation details, making it difficult for results to be replicated. Third, while ROGA achieves strong empirical results, the evaluation is mostly limited to office-centric benchmarks and one general reasoning dataset. It would be valuable to include cross-domain or zero-shot adaptation studies to demonstrate broader generalization and scalability claims.
