While the paper includes a DAG validation and correction step to ensure logical consistency, it seems that this process lacks deep physics-aware validation. Crucial physical constraints like spatial conflicts, reachability, and precise timing are not rigorously checked during the initial DAG generation or correction phase, potentially leading to logically sound but physically infeasible plans that might only be detected later during execution or scheduling.\n2. The paper introduces a rollback mechanism in Stage 2 to resolve deadlocks arising from parallel execution attempts. While it is important, the paper lacks in-depth analysis on how frequently this rollback was triggered during experiments and its associated performance cost (e.g., increased makespan compared to an ideal parallel plan). This lacking of analysis makes it difficult to fully assess the real-world efficiency impact of the deadlock resolution strategy.\n3. The paper does not provide a formal or empirical analysis of computational complexity as the number of DAG nodes increases. Since both graph construction and re-traversal rely on LLM-based reasoning, the computational cost may grow quadratically or even combinatorially with larger task graphs. While the authors mention scalability, no details about timing or efficiency results are discussed. An discussion or ablation on graph size scalability would strengthen the paper.\n4. The paper shows that RoboPARA’s components are necessary, but it does not fully disentangle the effects of Stage 1 and Stage 2. The analysis focuses on outcomes (e.g., increased parallelism) rather than underlying causes, and it is not specified whether the improvement in Stage 2 comes from enhanced LLM self-consistency or simply from iterative refinement."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The authors formulate a new problem, the \"Dual-Arm Cooperative Scheduling Problem\", which aims to minimize the makespan (total execution time) by effectively scheduling tasks across two arms. The proposed RoboPARA framework operates in a two-stage process : first, it uses an LLM, augmented with a memory module (RAG) , to generate a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing task dependencies. Second, a \"Graph Re-Traversal\" algorithm, which is non-LLM based, optimizes this DAG to schedule operations, maximize parallel execution, and resolve conflicts.\n\nTo evaluate this framework, the authors also introduce the \"Cross-Scenario Dual-Arm Parallel Task dataset\" (X-DAPT) , a new benchmark containing over 1,000 tasks across 10 scenarios designed specifically to test dual-arm parallelism. Experimental results claim that RoboPARA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30% to 50% reduction in execution time and demonstrating superior parallel step execution, particularly in complex tasks."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper's primary strength is its formalization and direct confrontation of parallelism in dual-arm manipulation. While prior work often results in sequential execution , this paper defines a new, relevant problem (\"Dual-Arm Cooperative Scheduling\") and proposes a solution explicitly designed to optimize for it. This focus on decoupling tasks for parallel execution, rather than purely sequential or fully synchronous collaboration, is a significant and practical contribution.\n\nThe two-stage, hybrid architecture is a sound engineering approach. It leverages the LLM's strength in parsing human instructions and understanding task semantics to generate an initial plan (the DAG). It then wisely offloads the \"System-2\" optimization—a constrained scheduling problem—to a deterministic, algorithmic \"Graph Re-Traverse\" stage. This avoids the unreliability of using LLMs for complex, multi-step symbolic reasoning and allows for the implementation of robust logic, such as deadlock prevention and arm-lock compatibility checks .\n\nSimilar to the method, the X-DAPT dataset is a valuable contribution. The authors correctly identify that existing benchmarks often lack tasks with complex, inter-package dependencies that can be parallelized. By creating a dataset with multiple difficulty levels and a focus on long-horizon, multi-package scenarios , the authors provide a new and challenging testbed for the community to evaluate this specific dimension of robotic planning.\n\nThe paper is clearly written, and the framework is well-illustrated. The separation of Stage 1 (LLM-driven DAG generation) and Stage 2 (Algorithmic scheduling) is logical and easy to follow. The inclusion of detailed prompt templates in the appendix, while extensive, adds to the paper's transparency and reproducibility"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The authors designed both the solution (RoboPARA) and the primary benchmark (X-DAPT) on which it demonstrates overwhelming superiority. The results in Tables 1 and 2 show that RoboPARA achieves high scores on the new parallelism metrics (PPR and APR), while all seven baseline methods score 0.000 or near-zero on these metrics in almost every single category. This result is suggesting that the X-DAPT benchmark is overtuned to the specific graph-based, parallel-aware architecture of RoboPARA. This suspicion is reinforced by the results on a neutral, third-party benchmark (a reorganization of the RoboTwin dataset) . On RoboTwin (Table 13), RoboPARA still performs best, but the gap is far less dramatic. For example, on \"Easy\" tasks, RoboPARA's efficiency (TEI) is 10.6, while two baselines achieve 8.0. This is a reasonable improvement, not the 10x+ gap seen in the X-DAPT parallelism metrics. The overwhelming superiority vanishes on a benchmark the authors did not design.\n\nThe paper's core claim is a 30-50% reduction in \"execution time\", which is commendable. However, the paper's own limitations section admits that RoboPARA \"consumes an average of 1.3x more tokens than baselines due to iterative DAG corrections\". This suggests a significantly higher planning latency before execution can even begin. For many real-world, dynamic tasks, a 30-second reduction in execution is not a net gain if it requires an extra 60 seconds of planning. The paper's primary metric, TEI, is defined as successful steps divided by total task completion time in seconds , which seems to include planning time, but this is not explicitly stated. This ambiguity around the planning-time vs. execution-time trade-off is a major omission.\n\nThe method's success in Stage 1 is heavily dependent on extremely detailed, hard-coded prompt engineering. The appendix reveals that \"Template 2a: Dependency-Aware Graph Construction\" contains 19 separate, highly specific rules (e.g., \"Rule 10: The cutting operation can only begin when all objects are placed...\") . This raises serious questions about the method's generality. It appears less like a general-purpose planner and more like a system purpose-built and meticulously tuned for the 10 scenarios in the X-DAPT dataset. It is unclear how this method would scale to a new domain (e.g., \"car repair\" or \"lab automation\") without a similarly exhaustive, manual-engineering effort to define all domain-specific dependency rules."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can the authors explain the 0.000 performance of all baselines on the PPR/APR metrics on X-DAPT? Does this not suggest the benchmark is built exclusively to validate the RoboPARA architecture, rather than to provide a fair comparison? Why is the performance gap so much smaller on the RoboTwin dataset?\n\n2. How much manual effort is required to adapt the 19-point prompt template  to a completely new domain with new objects and dependencies? Does the reliance on such extensive, hard-coded domain knowledge not fundamentally limit the \"LLM-driven\" nature of the approach?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "1s20DsRH00", "forum": "b9GH5mMBfG", "replyto": "b9GH5mMBfG", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4045/Reviewer_qpfb"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4045/Reviewer_qpfb"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4045/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761957566596, "cdate": 1761957566596, "tmdate": 1762917149289, "mdate": 1762917149289, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces RoboPARA, an LLM-driven framework for dual-arm parallel task scheduling in robotic manipulation, addressing the limitations of existing methods in exploiting temporal overlap across sub-tasks.
