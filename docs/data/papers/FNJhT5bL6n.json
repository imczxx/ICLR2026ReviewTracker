Importantly, such variables are typically informative only in specific intervals and irrelevant elsewhere. We refer to this phenomenon as temporal saliency of exogenous variables, i.e., the time-varying relevance of external inputs for predicting the target series. In this paper, we tackle the \"forecasting with exogenous variables\" problem, where the model receives multiple input channels but predicts only one target variable. Recent studies have shown that channel-dependent Transformer architectures might be outperformed by simple channel-independent linear models, suggesting that current cross-attention mechanisms suffer to fully profit from exogenous information. To address this, we propose a morphing framework that adaptively reshapes exogenous time series before forecasting. For each channel and time step, a morphing function computes a ratio from the local relationship between the exogenous input and the target series and amplifies useful intervals accordingly. We instantiate morphing functions with interpretable information-theoretic metrics such as correlation, covariance, entropy, and mutual information, and evaluate them in ablation studies for long-horizon forecasting and state-of-the-art Transformer-based architectures. Results show that morphing is capable to yield significant improvements in certain dataset–model combinations. These findings highlight morphing as a simple yet effective way to enhance the utility of exogenous information and close part of the performance gap between linear and Transformer-based forecasting methods.", "tldr": "The paper presents results of an extensive time series forecasting ablation test, with exogenous data on multiple transformer model, which reveal strong indications that shape morphing of exogenous data positively affect forecasting accuracy.", "keywords": ["Temporal Saliency Detection", "Exogenous Data", "Time Series", "Forecasting", "Transformer Models", "Multivariate", "Morphing"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a2fed0f68194946cbdc78970df8b7b57271c1a7d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a morphing framework that adaptively reshapes exogenous time series before forecasting.

Clarity and Paper Structure: The paper's overall clarity is a primary concern.**\n\n- Unbalanced Focus: The writing in sections like Related Work (Section 2), as well as the experimental setup and conclusion, is overly verbose.

This forces the reader to constantly switch between the main text and the appendix to build a complete understanding of the proposed method, which hinders readability.\n\n- Lack of Intuitive Figures: This clarity issue is compounded by a lack of helpful visualizations. While Figure 2 provides a high-level overview, it fails to clearly illustrate how morphing impacts the final prediction. The paper would be significantly improved by a dedicated diagram illustrating the core algorithmic steps.\n\n**2.
