Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides an effective way to adaptively handle such uncertainties by incorporating traffic dynamics into state, but its performance crucially depends on how these dynamics are represented. Existing approaches either rely on global traffic information, which ensures decision completeness but suffers from redundancy and high computational cost, or oversimplified local features, which are efficient but often omit critical dynamics and lead to suboptimal paths. To address this, we propose a Dynamics Feature Representation (DFR) framework that progressively refines global traffic dynamics into compact features for RL-based DPP. Specifically, we introduce a policy attention mechanism that identifies a core subset of global dynamics by extracting the top-k shortest paths, and further constructs node-related local features by intersecting with n-hop neighborhoods, enabling near-optimal policy learning. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DFR guarantees state completeness, while empirical results confirm that, compared to classical baselines and standard RL methods, DFR significantly improves path planning performance and accelerates convergence. This work highlights the central role of feature representation in RL-based DPP and proposes a general framework that balances information sufficiency with computational efficiency, paving the way for scalable dynamic decision-making in real-world transportation systems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Dynamic Path Planning; Reinforcement Learning; State Representation; Dynamics Feature Representation; Policy Attention Mechanism"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b483a8bbae1062284828d11285211c41d8722c0c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles the problem of Dynamic Path Planning (DPP) in urban road networks under time-varying traffic conditions.

The proposed hierarchical state refinement framework is conceptually novel and effectively bridges the gap between global completeness and local efficiency in RL-based path planning. The integration of Policy Attention and n-hop Neighborhood represents an  interpretable way to distill global traffic dynamics into task-relevant local states. Moreover, the authors provide a solid theoretical grounding by connecting their approach to Predictive State Representation (PSR) theory, which strengthens the methodological rigor. The experimental design is systematic, showing how different values of (k, n) influence performance, and the released code enhances reproducibility. Quantitative results show that DFR achieves faster convergence and comparable or improved routing performance with significantly lower feature dimensionality.

The baseline comparison is also narrow, relying solely on DQN, without evaluating against more advanced or specialized methods such as GNN-RL, actor–critic algorithms, or model-based RL frameworks. The paper would benefit from more detailed explanations of the policy attention pre-training process, including the dataset, learning stability, and computational overhead. In addition, the hyperparameters k and n are fixed and manually chosen; introducing or discussing a self-adaptive mechanism for these parameters would make the approach more robust.

Methodology Explanation and Experimental Validation:\nThe experimental evaluation appears to test only fixed combinations of k and n values. It remains unclear whether the method dynamically adjusts these parameters across cities of varying scales or under different traffic densities. The paper would benefit from a more in-depth discussion on the tuning of hyperparameters k and n—specifically, how to select these parameters to achieve optimal performance under diverse network structures and traffic conditions. Furthermore, is there a method to automate the selection of these parameters to minimize manual configuration efforts? Addressing this would significantly enhance the practicality and scalability of the proposed approach.\n\n2. Generalization Capability of the Model:\nThe current experiments are conducted solely on a road network subgraph from Nanjing, which consists of a relatively small scale (378 nodes and 864 edges). This raises concerns about whether such a subgraph is representative of larger and more complex urban traffic systems. It is essential to evaluate the model's performance on road networks from other cities, particularly on larger-scale networks (e.g., thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of edges). Further experiments across cities with varying traffic conditions and network topologies are recommended to verify the model's universality and robustness.\n\n3. Insufficient Completeness of Experimental Results:\nThe paper only compares the proposed method against baseline models such as \"No Policy Attention\" and \"No Neighborhood Expansion,\" which are essentially ablative studies.
