While there is much-warranted discussion about how to address the safety, bias, and legal woes of state-of-the-art AI models, rigorous and realistic mathematical frameworks to regulate AI are lacking. Our paper addresses this challenge, proposing an auction-based regulatory mechanism that provably incentivizes devices (i) to deploy compliant models and (ii) to participate in the regulation process. We formulate AI regulation as an all-pay auction where enterprises submit models for approval. The regulator enforces compliance thresholds and further rewards models exhibiting higher compliance than their peers. We derive Nash Equilibria demonstrating that rational agents will submit models exceeding the prescribed compliance threshold. Empirical results show that our regulatory auction boosts compliance rates by 20% and participation rates by 15% compared to baseline regulatory mechanisms, outperforming simpler frameworks that merely impose minimum compliance standards.", "tldr": "We propose an auction-based regulatory mechanism that incentivizes agents to develop and deploy safer AI models.", "keywords": ["Regulation", "Mechanism Design", "Auctions", "Artificial Intelligence"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/49273b072f27bd0235ac4ae72c113401df34f76e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6b87feb51e3fe6927b47fd0959e8a96ffbdab0f4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a type of all-pay auction for AI regulation, whereby model-making agents submit models to a regulator for approval.

In this framework, the regulator defines both a compliance threshold—measured by performance on regulator-specified tasks—and the `cost'  (eg: inference cost) required to achieve it. Agents (such as AI developers) assess the total value they expect to receive from deploying their models and any potential regulatory rewards; they participate only if this value exceeds the threshold cost. Participating agents submit their models along with a bid that reflects their investment in achieving compliance. Models with bids below the threshold are excluded. The regulator then randomly pairs the remaining models and, in each pair, selects the model with higher compliance as the winner. Winning models receive both a deployment reward and a premium bonus, while losing models receive only the deployment reward."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- Interesting idea of applying game-theory to AI regulation compliance\n- Easy to understand, simple formulation"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "See Question"}, "questions": {"value": "Does defining 'compliance' as a single scalar score (serving as a proxy for overall performance) limit the practical utility of this framework?

Alternatively, if all dimensions are treated uniformly, the framework may still disincentivize models that are exceptionally strong in some areas but weaker in others—or those that are broadly competent but not top-tier in any single metric.
