However, existing VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (\\textit{i}) producing precise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (\\textit{ii}) bridging domain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot embodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent variables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy learning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal knowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we present \\textbf{XR-1}, a novel framework for versatile and scalable VLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments.\nAt its core, XR-1 introduces the \\emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation learned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and robotic motion.  UVMC addresses these challenges by (\\textit{i}) serving as an intermediate representation between the observations and actions, and  (\\textit{ii}) aligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to capture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a \\emph{three-stage training paradigm}: (\\textit{i}) self-supervised UVMC learning, (\\textit{ii}) UVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and (\\textit{iii}) task-specific post-training.  We validate XR-1 through extensive real-world experiments with more than 12,000 rollouts on six different robot embodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\\pi_0$ and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel objects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.

However, therotically, the same $(a_{t:t+h}, m_{t:t+h})$ can correspond to very different $(c_t, c_{t+h})$, since the action sequence and motor states only describe the robot itself, while the visual inputs capture the entire scene, including background and objects, which can be changed arbitrarily across episodes.

Perhaps a more fair direct comparison with the baseline methods would be a variant of XR-1 that is fine-tuned on task-specific datasets without XR-D pretraining. This would enable a more fair analysis of whether the XR-1 training recipe and UVMC representation are beneficial, since there is potentially a confounding factor in the performance improvement that comes from additional supervision from pretraining data collected on embodiments similar to the ones used for post-training evaluations. Currently, it is not clear whether the proposed training recipe or the XR-D dataset pretraining is contributing more to the performance. Further discussion on this or clarifications on the differences between train and test would be critical for adjusting my recommendation for this submission (I am willing to adjust my score since I believe there are several positive aspects to this paper otherwise).\n* In the abstract, the authors write, \"Existing methods often encode latent variables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy learning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal knowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets.\" Similarly, in the related works, the authors write, \"However, since the pre-training involves lagre-scale heterogeneous robotics and human data, existing VLA models remain limited ability to achieve effective unification across the heterogeneous modalities.\" These are fairly broad and abstract claims, and it is not clear what they mean and whether there is empirical validation for such claims. Clarification on the meaning behind these statements and why they are true (through supporting evidence) would strengthen the paper. For example, $\\pi_0$ and OpenVLA have shown multi-task multi-embodiment control ability as well as adaptability to new robot embodiments through post-training, and it is not clear why XR-1 would be unique in these respects.\n* In Section 4.2, the authors write, \"Several baselines even collapse to 0% performance on harder tasks, which we attribute to insufficient auxiliary supervision and gradient conflicts during multi-task optimization.\" More details on this finding would strengthen the paper. Are prior methods struggling to fit the multi-task training dataset, or is there some other issue causing relatively poor performance compared to XR-1? Details on how baseline methods are trained and qualitative descriptions of how they fail would be helpful to aid understanding.\n* There is no discussion or experiments on having two separate cookbooks for visual representations and motion representations.
