However, traditional distillation approaches face challenges related to knowledge conflicts and high resource demands, particularly when leveraging multiple teacher models. In this paper, we introduce the concept of **Knowledge Purification**, which consolidates the rationales from multiple teacher LLMs into a single rationale, thereby mitigating conflicts and enhancing efficiency. To investigate the effectiveness of knowledge purification, we further propose five purification methods from various perspectives. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods not only improve the performance of the distilled model but also effectively alleviate knowledge conflicts. Moreover, router-based methods exhibit robust generalization capabilities, underscoring the potential of innovative purification techniques in optimizing multi-teacher distillation and facilitating the practical deployment of powerful yet lightweight models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["knowledge distillation", "large language model", "LLM routing"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/adb4e5c1064319d0dffd13456fd69d9088c9c028.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses a critical problem in multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD) for Large Language Models (LLMs): the performance degradation that occurs as the number of teachers increases, attributed to knowledge conflicts.
