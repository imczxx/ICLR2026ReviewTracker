While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition, they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use coding as an enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management and data processing, while still utilizing visual interaction when necessary. We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena benchmark, where CoAct-1 achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.8% on OSWorld and 52.5% on WindowsAgentArena, significantly outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to just 10.15 on OSWorld, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and scalable path toward generalized computer automation.", "tldr": "We propose CoAct-1, a hybrid multi-agent system that combines GUI control with direct code execution, achieving SOTA performance and improved efficiency on OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena by dynamically delegating tasks to GUI or coding agents.", "keywords": ["Computer-using Agent", "Multi-gent System", "LLM Agent"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b3b67a424decd815ede244320395dedde02cb2e9.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/60a53e009f00c03d7d90f72e621c0ee79ed958ac.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents CoAct-1, a multi-agent system that combines GUI operations with programmatic execution for autonomous computer control tasks.

Introducing coding as an augmented action space for computer-using agents is an innovative and promising research direction that offers a new paradigm for general computer automation.\n\n- The multi-agent architecture is well-designed, with the Orchestrator dynamically delegating subtasks to either the Programmer or GUI Operator, effectively combining efficient programmatic execution for backend operations (file management, data processing) with GUI interaction for frontend tasks. The hierarchical memory design (isolated working memory vs. long-term planning memory) effectively prevents context pollution.\n\n- Comprehensive evaluation on two challenging real-world computer operation benchmarks demonstrates significant performance improvements (4.78% over the best baseline on OSWorld, 22.7% on WindowsAgentArena). The efficiency analysis is thorough, clearly showing the advantages of code actions over GUI action sequences, particularly in Calc, VS Code, and multi-application tasks."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Imprecise Action Space Definition: The paper defines the action space as A = A_GUI ∪ A_Code, but these two action types have fundamentally different granularities and abstraction levels.
