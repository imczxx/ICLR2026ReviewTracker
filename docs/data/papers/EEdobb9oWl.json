To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel evolutionary framework. Our method starts with sample molecules that are fragmented and fed into a policy-decoupled architecture.

This approach expands the latent fragment space without relying on predefined libraries. By employing a grid-based fragment-masked crossover, our method enables combinatorial explorations and extends beyond conventional fragmentation patterns. In comparative experiments, our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on most PMO benchmarks and target-protein docking tasks.

For single-objective problems, an artificial second objective (e.g., SA in the PMO benchmark) must be introduced, which may be unreasonable. For example, in PMO rediscovery tasks, the main goal is to find molecules similar to a target. If the target has poor SA, adding SA as an explicit objective may actively hinder optimization. In general, introducing arbitrary auxiliary objectives is not a principled solution.\n   - The assumption of “intra-grid convergence” may not hold in practice, especially when optimal points in chemical space are sparse [2]. In many objectives such as docking scores, crossover offspring often perform worse than both parents. Thus, the theoretical premise behind the grid strategy is questionable for real-world property landscapes.\n3. **Interpretability claim**: The paper repeatedly emphasizes interpretability, but it is unclear how the generated structures can be interpreted beyond standard fragment recombination. No concrete explanation or case study is provided to support this claim.\n4. **PMO experimental setup**:\n   - Several PMO objectives inherently conflict with diversity, such as rediscovery and similarity tasks, making the evaluation of diversity unreasonable in those settings.\n   - Ten PMO objectives are themselves multi-property objectives (MPOs) originating from GuacaMol [3]. Since this paper emphasizes multi-objective molecular generation, it is unclear why those built-in multiple properties were not directly used as objectives, and instead a new SA score was introduced.\n5. **Docking experimental setup**:\n   - Comparisons are reported based on the top-5% molecules, but this subset may vary greatly in size across methods. A fixed set size (e.g., top 100) would make the comparison more consistent and fair.\n   - No diversity metrics are reported for docking tasks, leaving it unclear whether RL-GFM achieves good diversity in addition to docking performance.\n\n### **Minor**\n\n1. No analysis of runtime or computational efficiency is provided.\n2. Since no code or data is released, a reproducibility statement is recommended.\n3. In Table 3, the standard deviations of RL-GFM results should be reported with the same precision (3 decimal places) as the baselines.\n\n[1] Tianfan Fu, et al. \"Reinforced Genetic Algorithm for Structure-based Drug Design.\" NeurIPS, 2022.\n\n[2] Austin Tripp, et al. \"An evaluation framework for the objective functions of de novo drug design benchmarks.\" ICLR workshop, 2022.\n\n[3] Nathan Brown, et al. \"GuacaMol: benchmarking models for de novo molecular design.\" JCIM, 2019."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could the authors clarify whether their grid-based crossover achieves unique benefits beyond efficiency compared to exhaustive parent pairing? In other words, are the gains due to pruning unpromising combinations, or does the grid introduce qualitatively new recombinations that would not appear in a full GA?\n2. The initial population of molecules significantly determines the quality of the whole generation process, but this is not studied. For example, if the initial population doesn't contain a certain substructure, it will not be generated all along the fragment-based process. How to overcome this? In addition, the standard deviations in Table 3 are very low. Are they initialized with randomly selected different molecular sets?\n3. For the PMO tasks, why you report the top-10 score AUC and the top-100 diversity, instead of a consistent set size? In addition, why the RL-GFM is evaluated under a budget of 3,000 oracle calls, instead of 10,000?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "m9n4VdV1eu", "forum": "EEdobb9oWl", "replyto": "EEdobb9oWl", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6162/Reviewer_3RZY"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6162/Reviewer_3RZY"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6162/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760876693485, "cdate": 1760876693485, "tmdate": 1762918509571, "mdate": 1762918509571, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "sJvTVLGziO", "forum": "EEdobb9oWl", "replyto": "EEdobb9oWl", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6162/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6162/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763717646165, "cdate": 1763717646165, "tmdate": 1763717646165, "mdate": 1763717646165, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "RL-GFM, a reinforcement learning and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm framework for molecular generation and optimization is proposed in this paper.
