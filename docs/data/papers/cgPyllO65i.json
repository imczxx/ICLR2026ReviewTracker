While most existing studies focus on generating native protein structures for applications such as binding target discovery and drug design, this paper tackles a different problem.  We aim to generate both native and non-native protein conformations, i.e., 3D structures along the folding pathway. This task holds significant potential for advancing key applications, including folding pathway prediction, drug discovery, and the study of protein misfolding diseases.\nTo address this challenge,  we introduce $\\underline{Pandora}$ (i.e., $\\underline{P}$rotein Conform$\\underline{a}$tio$\\underline{n}$ $\\underline{D}$iffusi$\\underline{o}$n Model for Gene$\\underline{ra}$tion), a novel diffusion-based framework designed to generate diverse, physically and chemically plausible protein backbone structures. By leveraging a diffusion architecture, Pandora captures a broad spectrum of folding patterns while adhering to biophysical constraints. Extensive experiments across multiple protein folding pathway datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in producing realistic and biologically meaningful conformations.

Using internal coordinates for molecular conformation generation is highly efficient for small molecules, but it poses challenges for large proteins:\n  a). The dimensionality of internal coordinates grows rapidly and can far exceed that of Cartesian coordinates in large proteins.\n  b). Errors accumulate during coordinate transforms—when reconstructing Cartesian coordinates from internal angles, small angular errors propagate along the chain, resulting in large deviations in terminal atoms.\n  c). Internal coordinates capture only local geometry, so constructing residues that are distant along the sequence but spatially adjacent is likely to cause steric clashes.\nDo authors consider these problems? \n2. It appears the authors directly cutoff variables to suitable range, which may introduce discontinuities and unstable boundary derivatives. Would a diffusion defined on an appropriate Riemannian manifold be a more suitable choice? Have the authors considered this alternative?\n3. As the paper notes, the baselines operate at the residue level, implicitly or explicitly fixing subsets of bond lengths and bond angles. By contrast, Pandora is an atomic-level model. Consequently, many of the baseline comparison metrics are not directly meaningful.

Pandora uses a graph-based transformer architecture to encode geometric information at both node and edge levels, and performs diffusion directly in this internal coordinate parameterization. Experiments on fast-folding proteins demonstrate that generating conformations in internal coordinate space leads to more accurate recovery of bond lengths, angles, and backbone torsions, both in terms of prediction error and distributional similarity to MD ensembles.

Although the paper aims to explore non-native conformation generation, specifically for protein folding, it presents limited architectural, modeling, or analytical innovation compared to existing protein conformation generation models.\n2. While the method claims atomic-level modeling by diffusing over bond lengths, angles, and dihedral torsions, it only models backbone atoms and does not include side-chain degrees of freedom. This makes the \"full atomic freedom\" claim less convincing, especially given that models like AlphaFold3 and Boltz explicitly model both backbone and side chains in full degree of freedom.\n3. The experimental evaluation is restricted to a subset of existing benchmarks (5 training + 2 test proteins from fast-folding datasets), which has present in Str2Str, BioEmu, ConfDiff, or EquiJump. The author formed their own analysis focuses on recovery MSE and distributional accuracy in internal coordinates, the results are limited and are not strongly demonstrating that Pandora can model folding/unfolding pathways, generalize to new proteins, or handle larger systems.\n4. Clarity: The paper would benefit from substantial revision for clarity. The methodology section is dense and difficult to follow, and common components such as diffusion training and sampling could be presented in a more standard and simplified manner."}, "questions": {"value": "### Model\n\n1. The paper uses a $f_{cut}$ function to clip angle and torsion values within defined ranges. This seems a bit ad-hoc. Have the authors considered defining the diffusion process directly in the angle or torsional space (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01729), where the periodicity is naturally handled?\n2. Several Method details are unclear:\n    - The paper states that the model \"smooths discrete data (bond length, bond angle, dihedral angle) into continuous distributions.\" Why are these values described as discrete?\n    - What is meant by the \"distance relation\" in line 282?\n    - In Equation (6), should there be a softmax or normalization?\n    - In line 299, what does the variable *h* represent?\n\n3. Since the baselines (Str2Str, ConfDiff, ConfRover) were re-trained, could the authors provide more details on their reproduction? For example: specific model variant, number of parameters, training epochs, optimizer, learning rate, and compute resources.\n    - For Str2Str, what forward noising cutoff was used?\n    - For ConfDiff, was classifier-free guidance used as in the original paper?\n\n### Experiments and results\n\n1. $\\xi_0$ Recovery Task Definition: Could the authors explain the task in more details? How are samples generated for each model? Which values are used as reference for MAE computation? How many samples are generated per protein?\n2. The paper states that a transferable setup is used (five proteins for training, two for testing) in Experimental setup. However, primary results in Sections 4.2–4.5 are on the training split, with only Section 4.5 showing held-out test results. This difference should be more clearly stated for an accurate interpretation of the results. \n\n3. BioEmu (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv9817) is common diffusion-based protein conformation baseline that has used for fast-folding proteins. Boltz (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.14.659707v1) is another diffusion-based model, while originally used for protein folding, their all atom diffusion architecture can serve another strong baseline for this task. \n\n4. The free energy surfaces (e.g., Figure 4) are shown in low-dimensional projections of RMSE and Rg, where a standard practice for fast folding dataset is to project coordinate onto TICA (time-lagged independent components), which captures the slow collective motions (e.g., folding/unfolding). Could the authors provide results based on TICA coordinates or similar analysis as in BioEmu and EquiJump (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09667)?\n\n5. Evaluation is limited to bond/torsion-space metrics where the Pandora’s are specifically optimized, but lacks coordinate-based assessments (e.g., clashes, residue-residue contacts) needed to evaluate full 3D structural validity and ensemble fidelity.\n\n7. In Table 6: where do the reported “number of conformations” come from, and why does the WW domain contain far less  conformations than other proteins?\n\n### Other comments\n\n1. The introduction can be more concise and focused. For example, broad statements such as \"Beyond structural prediction… sparking a surge of innovative research… showcase the transformative potential of deep learning in addressing complex biological problems\" feel generic and distract from the main topic. In the abstract and introduction, protein design models are mentioned but not clearly discussed in the context of protein structure/conformation generation.\n\n2.
