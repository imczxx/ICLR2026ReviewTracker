The performance of these methods depends, in unsupervised settings, on the data augmentation strategy used from generating similar and dissimilar samples. Configuring an augmentation strategy composed of various transformation is a time-consuming process, typically performed by trial and error, and dependent on extensive domain knowledge. In this work, we propose Automated Time Series Augmentation (AutoTSAugment), a modular, model-agnostic time series augmentation framework for generating augmented time series that can be used within any contrastive-based time series representation learning method, and define a novel search objective that allows evaluating the quality of augmentations in unsupervised settings. The proposed framework is designed as an unsupervised AutoML framework composed of a search space that contains a diverse range of augmentation methods and a search strategy that automatically navigates the sampling of these methods. We evaluated if this model-agnostic framework can replace augmentation strategies in existing contrastive learning methods using three baseline time series representation learning methods and three search strategies (random sampling, random search, and Bayesian optimisation search) on the downstream tasks of univariate and multivariate time series classification and forecasting across 164 datasets. Our empirical results demonstrate that the methods trained within the AutoTSAugment framework achieve similar, or better, results than those obtained using manually tailored augmentation methods, eliminating the need for labour-intensive manual experimentation of augmentations. The results also demonstrate that employing random sampling within this framework achieves similar results to that of dedicated search algorithms while having up to 63.25\\% faster training times on average compared with other search strategies. Furthermore, we studied the effect of an adaptive search space, which recommends augmentation methods based on dataset characteristics, showing results equivalent to a fixed search space in downstream tasks while being up to 58.21\\% faster.", "tldr": "A framework for automated augmentation methods selection for unsupervised time series representation learning evaluated on a total of 164 widely-used datasets.", "keywords": ["Time Series", "Representation Learning", "Data Augmentation", "Contrastive Learning", "Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)", "Unsupervised Learning"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/65b43bc3c71d0d356f0930a1486419019651ba12.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces AutoTSAugment, a modular and model-agnostic framework for automatically discovering data augmentation strategies for unsupervised, contrastive-based time series representation learning.

While the framework as a whole is novel, the core technical contribution of the unsupervised search objective could be better motivated and clarified.\n- The paper cites [Baratchi et al., 2024] for the general form of the search objective, which may lead readers to question how much of the formulation is a novel contribution of this specific work versus an adaptation of an existing AutoML pattern.\n- The score function, Eq. 2 $\\mathcal{P}(f;\\mathcal{X})$,  is hard to understand.   The scoring function $\\Phi_{\\tau}(d) = s \\cdot |d - \\tau|$ is a simple absolute distance from a pre-defined threshold $\\tau$. Its conceptual novelty is limited.  \n\n2. Unclear writing.  For example, in the contribution, the authors claim this module is designed for time series methods. Why time series is unclear?  I am not sure it is because of the search space. The second contribution, \"beyond that of standard AutoML\", lacks evidence. \n\n3. Unreasonable experiment setting. This paper's main contribution should be the augmentation framework. So the baseline should contain the basic AutoML method and explain why this method is better than the normal AutoML.

(2024) [3], and labeling it a “standard AutoML problem formalization,” without acknowledging the specific differences and contributions of our work. Baratchi et al. (2024) [3] do not define the specific unsupervised distance-based augmentation objective proposed in our work.\n\n2) Several criticisms that are either addressed in the paper or beyond its scope.\nExamples: \n- The request to include “other AutoML methods” as baseline comparisons, without mentioning any examples of any concrete methods that satisfy the experiment settings (from reviewer EXGo). We explicitly explain in the introduction and the related work sections that, to the best of our knowledge, there is no other AutoML method that has the following properties: (i) tailored to time series, (ii) works in unsupervised settings, (iii) model-agnostic, (iv) modular, and (v) interpretable. Given this, we did not find any other AutoML method that can be directly compared with AutoTSAugment.\n- The request to include “other architectures for time series, such as transformer, linear, and so on” (from reviewer EXGo). We explicitly define the purpose of AutoTSAugment as working with unsupervised contrastive-based time series representation learning methods. We selected the methods that are recognized as the SOTA in the literature to do our experiments and did additional experiments on time series foundation models in the appendix. The vast majority of the SOTA unsupervised contrastive methods for time series are based on CNN (e.g., AutoTCL, TS2Vec .. etc) [1][2], so using CNN-based models as the main set of baseline methods was not an arbitrary choice.\n\n3) The reviewers acknowledge the empirical evaluation is extensive and practically relevant; however, they still decide on rejection by labelling the work as “incremental” or “engineering” without offering a precise explanation of what would count as sufficient conceptual novelty in this area, or how we could revise our work to meet that bar.\n\n4) All the 4 reviews are fully or partially generated by AI. According to (source: https://iclr.pangram.com/reviews?query=autotsaugment), our paper received the following reviews: 1 x Fully AI-generated, 1 x Heavily AI-edited, 1 x Moderately AI-edited, and 1 x Lightly AI-edited, with 0 fully human-written reviews.\n\nGiven these points, we are not confident that additional author time spent on a rebuttal would lead to a careful, human-led re-evaluation of the work, and therefore decided to withdraw the paper and consider another venue.\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Qianwen Meng, Hangwei Qian, Yong Liu, Yonghui Xu, Zhiqi Shen, and Lizhen Cui.

The scenario described in Figure 1, which highlights the framework's efficiency, seems practical only when training multiple different models on the exact same, pre-generated set of augmented data.

Could you clarify the practical importance and applicability of this \"compute once, reuse often\" paradigm in typical research or production workflows?\n\n2.  For the adaptive search space experiment, you used `RandSampling(n=1)`. This seems to reduce the \"search\" problem to simply picking a single, pre-recommended option. Why was this simplistic setting chosen instead of using the recommendations to guide a more complex search (e.g., by creating a weighted sampling distribution for Random Search or a more informed prior for Bayesian Optimization)?\n\n3.  The paper claims a significant speed-up of \"up to 63.25% faster,\" but this metric compares the different search strategies *within* the AutoTSAugment framework. It doesn't compare the framework's end-to-end runtime against the original, highly optimized monolithic baselines.

The idea of making augmented views “similar but not identical” is well established in contrastive learning.
