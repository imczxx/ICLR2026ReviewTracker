AGENT4WEAKNESS aims to provide richer statistical insights and generate customized evaluation reports through collaborative agents and specialized tools.\nThe core methodology of AGENT4WEAKNESS is structured around a multi-agent workflow consisting of a Planner, an Analyzer, and a Reporter, leveraging comprehensive evaluation data. Experimental results demonstrate that reports generated by AGENT4WEAKNESS show a significant improvement of 2.6 out of 10 points across four evaluation dimensions (Requirement Fulfillment, Content Value, Factuality, and Readability) compared to a direct answering baseline, with high consistency with human evaluations (Pearson r=0.801, Spearman \\rhoρ\\rhoρ=0.944). Notably, it achieves a 3.4-point improvement in Content Value, signifying richer analyses, and a 3.4-point improvement in Requirement Fulfillment, indicating its flexibility.

The paper squarely tackles the challenge of LLM weakness discovery, a critical need as models grow more complex. The authors clearly motivate that current eval methods lack substantive comparisons (no statistical rigor) and flexibility to meet different analysis needs.\n2. The proposed Agent4Weakness framework is innovative in using a multi-agent collaboration for evaluation. It combines a Planner, Analyzer, and Reporter agent with specialized roles. This design allows the system to break down the user’s query, fetch and compute detailed statistics, and compile findings into a coherent report. The use of external tools (for data analysis and statistical testing) within the agent workflow is a strong point, as it grounds the LLM’s analysis in solid quantitative evidence rather than just its internal knowledge. This represents a creative extension of chain-of-thought prompting into a tool-augmented, multi-step evaluation process.\n3. Agent4Weakness produces much more informative and accurate analyses than the baseline. The strong performance across multiple dimensions underscores the efficacy of the approach. Furthermore, the authors show that LLM-based scoring of the reports correlates strongly with human evaluation (Pearson r ≈ 0.80, Spearman ρ ≈ 0.94),  which suggests the evaluation criteria were meaningful and actually reflect human-perceived quality.\n4. The system doesn’t just produce higher-level summaries – it can pinpoint specific weaknesses with verifiable accuracy. Such detailed weakness analysis is a clear strength over traditional evaluations that would simply report an average score."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. High Complexity and Resource Requirements: The proposed system is quite complex, involving three coordinated agent roles and multiple tool integrations. Running Agent4Weakness requires a powerful backbone LLM and a large set of evaluation data in memory. This complexity could pose practical challenges. For example, orchestrating multi-agent prompts and tool calls may be slow or expensive compared to a single-pass evaluation.\n2. The paper primarily compares Agent4Weakness to a direct answering baseline. While this highlights the advantage of the structured approach, the baseline is relatively rudimentary. It does not, for instance, use any chain-of-thought or tools at all. In other words, an intermediate baseline (say, a single-agent chain-of-thought using the same tools, but without specialized roles) could help attribute the improvements more precisely. As it stands, the evaluation convincingly shows superiority to an “uninformed” baseline, but not necessarily to any sophisticated alternative.\n3. The paper demonstrates that Agent4Weakness’s outputs correlate well with human judgments of quality, but it doesn’t compare against human-written analysis of model weaknesses. Of course, expecting the authors to produce human-written reports for all cases is impractical, so this is more of an observation than a strict criticism."}, "questions": {"value": "1. You chose a direct-answer baseline for comparison, arguing that prior specialized pipelines aren’t as flexible. Nonetheless, have you considered comparing Agent4Weakness to a simpler single-agent chain-of-thought approach using tools? For example, one could prompt a single LLM with something like: “Here is all the data, think step by step to analyze weaknesses…” and allow it to call the same tools (sort of an ablation of the multi-agent structure). This might isolate the benefit of having distinct Planner/Analyzer/Reporter roles.\n2. The multi-agent pipeline with external tools sounds computationally heavy (multiple prompt exchanges, tool calls, etc.). Do you have a sense of the runtime or cost overhead of Agent4Weakness compared to a direct evaluation? For instance, how long does it take to generate a full report for one model’s weaknesses, and could this be a bottleneck if evaluating many models continuously?\n3. You showed a compelling result that providing the model with the identified weaknesses and suggestions can improve its performance via prompt adjustments. Do you envision a more automated integration of Agent4Weakness into the model development loop? For example, could the reports be used to inform fine-tuning data generation or to create adversarial test cases for continuous improvement?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5ec5PoaURt", "forum": "WYzDAFeYMS", "replyto": "WYzDAFeYMS", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20198/Reviewer_4zmv"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20198/Reviewer_4zmv"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20198/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761815075916, "cdate": 1761815075916, "tmdate": 1762933701349, "mdate": 1762933701349, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces AGENT4WEAKNESS, a multi-agent system designed to overcome the limitations of current LLM evaluation methods, specifically their \"insufficient comparison\" and \"inflexible evaluation\".

Without knowing the internals or the properties of the model, it would be hard to assess whether the report is helpful. One example given in the paper is that AGENT4WEAKNESS identifies that the reasoning process of DeepSeek-V3.1 on AIME2025 questions is disorganized and suggests using markers such as “### Step 1” to structure the reasoning and adding verification of intermediate results after each step. This particular example can be problematic because for some models, adding additional structure or verification may force model to reason out of distribution. This may lead to decreased performances. \n\n```Nature of Model \"Improvement\" is in context only``` \n\nThe 3.7-point performance improvement (Section 4.3) is a strong result, but it appears to be achieved by feeding the system's analysis and suggestions back into the model as part of the prompt. This demonstrates an improvement in in-context learning or prompt adherence based on the analysis, which is different from a permanent improvement to the base model (e.g., via fine-tuning).
