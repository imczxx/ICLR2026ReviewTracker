However, the noise accumulates in the model through the two-phase indivisible sequential process of LDP, thereby bringing the well-recognized privacy-utility trade-off challenge. In this paper, we propose an ideal interaction mode, Ideal Differential Privacy Federated Learning (IDP-FL), which allows for independent protection in the uplink and downlink phases. Through a comparative analysis of noise accumulation in IDP-FL and LDP-FL, we discover and theoretically prove that LDP-FL suffers from inherent \\textit{noise redundancy}, i.e. noise accumulation in uplink exceeds privacy requirements in downlink. To avoid this defect, we propose a novel framework, Noise Annihilation Differential Privacy Federated Learning (NADP-FL), which can be regarded as an instantiation of IDP-FL. In this framework, a portion of noises are distributedly generated in pairs, thereby mutually canceling each other out during aggregation and not appearing in the downlink phase. As a result, NADP realizes independent protection for both phases, eliminating unnecessary noise accumulation, achieving a more favorable privacy-utility trade-off and enhance protection in a way that incurs no further utility loss. We validate the superior utility, scalability and robustness of our framework through extensive experiments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["differential privacy", "federated learning", "privacy-utility trade-off"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f2b629a2f727b7d2d2b4fa982f37d8eed9e4861f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper revisits Local Differential Privacy Federated Learning (LDP-FL) and claims that its sequential design causes “noise redundancy,” where uplink noise unnecessarily propagates to the downlink phase and degrades model utility.

While the authors frame this as an improvement \"beyond LDP-FL\", it fundamentally changes the LDP threat model by introducing cryptographic assumptions and inter-client key exchange. This positions the work directly against existing SA+DP literature, rather than as a novel improvement to LDP itself. The central idea is to use SA to reduce the noise required for DP, which is not a new contribution.\n\n\n- The overhead comparison to SA-FL (Bonawitz et al., 2017)  is unconvincing. The proposed NADP-FL protocol appears to be a simplified SA mechanism that does not account for key features, such as robustness to client dropouts. The paper's own experiments (Appendix F.2) confirm that dropouts negatively impact NADP, and potentially more so than LDP. Therefore, claiming lower overhead  than a more feature-rich and robust protocol is an unfair comparison and does not provide a meaningful assessment of the protocol's efficiency. \n\n- The paper lacks a formal, provable security analysis for its cryptographic protocol. While it provides a privacy analysis to demonstrate $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP, it does not offer a formal security proof (e.g., via simulation) for the \"noise annihilation\" mechanism itself, especially in the presence of malicious clients. The discussion in Appendix A 12 is informal and insufficient. This stands in contrast to foundational SA works, which provide rigorous, provable security guarantees.\n\n- The experimental results for utility are not compelling, especially when viewing the framework as an SA+DP solution. The reported accuracies on MNIST (e.g., ~80-87% for N=100 ) are significantly lower than what is often achieved by standard SA+DP implementations, which can surpass 90% accuracy even with strong privacy guarantees. This suggests that the proposed method does not, in practice, deliver a superior privacy-utility trade-off compared to existing, more robust solutions."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "kBS2KiS01K", "forum": "WGJdTju8kf", "replyto": "WGJdTju8kf", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10892/Reviewer_nkwZ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10892/Reviewer_nkwZ"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10892/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761712568834, "cdate": 1761712568834, "tmdate": 1762922101270, "mdate": 1762922101270, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose an ideal interaction mode, Ideal Differential Privacy Federated Learning (IDP-FL), which decouples the uplink and downlink phases for independent privacy protection.

The claim that the framework \"will not collapse\" is not a formal security guarantee.\n--The practical overhead issue of this method.\nThe NADP-FL framework introduces significant overhead not present in LDP-FL. This includes a \"Preparation Phase\" for all clients to perform pairwise Diffie-Hellman key exchange and, in each round, the local computation of k−1 paired noise sequences and the execution of the complex noise allocation algorithm (Alg. 2). While the complexity is analyzed (Table 2), the practical scalability of this overhead (e.g., key management in a dynamic FL system with thousands of clients) is a major concern.\n--This method is quite sensitive to user disconnections.\nThe \"noise annihilation\" mechanism fundamentally relies on the successful aggregation of all k paired noises. The paper acknowledges that client dropout leads to \"incomplete noise cancellation\". While experiments in Appendix F.2 show the impact is \"limited\" , they also indicate that NADP's accuracy is \"more affected than LDP\" by dropout. This introduces a new fragility, as dropout is common in real-world federated systems.\n--The noise allocation in this method is relatively complex and may be difficult to implement in practice.\nThe proposed noise intensity allocation (Algorithm 2) is non-trivial. It requires sorting clients by dataset size and solving a system of equations. The paper itself notes that \"finding a non-negative solution becomes challenging\" in some cases and resorts to an \"approximate solution\".
