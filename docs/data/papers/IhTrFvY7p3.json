To address these issues, the paper prooses a new network design, Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH). MeSH improves over common recurrent schemes that re-include long-term context (e.g. residual connections, or re-adding the original input) by introducing a multi-slot memory module. For this a simple Read and Write routing blocks are introduced, simple linear layers+softmax that map each D-dimensional hidden state element to one of B memory slots, such that the network can differentiate different long/short term memory needs inside the hidden state. Experiments on four Pythia LLM benchmark models show that MeSH outperforms common recursive baseline schemes, and sometimes even non-recursive baselines with significantly more parameters.

One obvious parallel older than transformers are LSTMs, which also provides a memory mechanism for recursive networks to selectively update the latent state and differentiate short-term and long-term information. Various more recent works have also proposed integrated memory banks into transformer architectures, e.g. [Bulatov,NeurIPS'22][Wang,NeurIPS'23], among others. Perhaps the review in [Omidi,25] could help. In any case, there is no mention of or comparison to such works, which makes it difficult to assess this paper's contributions.\n\nI see this as the main weakness of the submission.\n\n## [W2] The paper's arguments are not clear at various points (or perhaps I do understand and simply disagree):\n* line 108: \"The information overload on the hidden state forces the model to find a low-dimensional 'common ground' representation that can safely survive multiple transformations, which directly causes loop representational collapse.\"\n\t* -> while I do not doubt the representational collapse, based on the presented diagnostics in the paper, the paper presents as cause the \"information overload\", but I don't find this a logical explanation by itself. Intuitively a low-dimensional subspace would indicate that the feature distribution is simpler than what a model can express. So, if the network has to manage \"multiple, often conflicting, roles simultaneously\" (line 103), wouldn't that mean we should expect the network to require a higher-dimensional subspace, rather than less? I don't have hard evidence for this either, but my point is that it doesn't seem so self-evident to me what causes representational collapse as is posited in the paper.\n* line 252: \"Since each router (R(t)_write,R(t)_read) has its own unique set of learnable parameters for each iteration t, the model is no longer forced to apply a single, universal transformation.\"\n\t* But also in MeSH, the f_core function remains fixed. Yes, MeSH allows to swap input and output, but the core operation is still not aware of the processing step (the \"undifferentiated computation\" of line 092). The proposed memory block operations themselves don't appear to impute information that could inform the core compute unit of the iteration, and it is unexplained how adding memory enables the model to assign specalized roles to each iteration. Of course, the model could learn to encode some step counter in the input/output statespace to inform it of its processing stage, but this was already true for the memory-less baseline.\n\n## [W3] Missing analysis of how proposed memory banks operate in practice\n* The paper lacks experiments focused on inspecting the behavior of the proposed new module, which are critical to assess if the method works because of the claimed reasons, and to validate the various claims and hypotheses made throughout the paper:\n\t* I would have liked to see some investigation if the memory model works \"as advertised\": can we see that the different iterations indeed assign different weights in the linear layer to different memory banks, and that memory written in earlier iterations is used in later iterations? Some sort of analysis on how the memory banks are read/write in real-world scenarios could help.\n\t* The effect of the number of memory banks B also belongs in the main paper, in my view. I did find the ablation study on Pythia-410M in Appendix E.1, but I was somewhat surprised a general rule of B = N_loop + 3 was propose on this single result. Investigating the effect of B on all four datasets would have made the analysis more thorough and convincing.\n\n## Minor\n* Line 133, symbols $L$ and $D$ are not explained.\n* It is not completely clear from the text what the \"Vanilla\" baseline refers to in Section 4.2. Only later in the paper did I understand that it is a non-recursive transformer, which has different parameters for each iteration.\n\n\n## References\n[Bulatov,NeurIPS'22]: Bulatov, Aydar, Yury Kuratov, and Mikhail Burtsev. \"Recurrent memory transformer.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 11079-11091.\n\n[Wang,NeurIPS'23]: Wang, Weizhi, et al. \"Augmenting language models with long-term memory.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2023): 74530-74543.\n\n[Omidi,25]: Omidi, Parsa, et al. \"Memory-augmented transformers: A systematic review from neuroscience principles to enhanced model architectures.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2508.10824 (2025)."}, "questions": {"value": "* How does the work relate to other works that have integrated memory in recurrent networks, and transformer networks specifically?
