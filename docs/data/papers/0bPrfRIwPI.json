A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Model Safety", "Training-Free Continual Projection"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c1cda63474d35cc4fe64b712eb5f69c7205c5f4a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection to mitigate safety risks arising from the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs).

The paper lacks critical baseline comparisons. Several relevant and strong methods are missing, including Antidote: Post-fine-tuning Safety Alignment for Large Language Models Against Harmful Fine-tuning Attack, Vaccine: Robust Safety Alignment via Adversarial Safety Prefilling, Shape it Up! Restoring LLM Safety during Finetuning via STAR-DSS, and constrained SFT approaches (e.g., few-token deep ICLR paper). These methods represent state-of-the-art safety interventions and are necessary for a fair evaluation.\n2. The proposed method is not truly scalable. While the projection is training-free, the neuron identification step is model-specific and requires expensive per-layer cosine similarity computations and activation scoring. If the model changes, the entire process must be repeated, making it less practical than simply running a small SFT or LoRA update on a mixture of safe and unsafe data.\n3. The safety neuron localization is sensitive to both model architecture and the prompt distribution used during identification. This undermines claims of generality and makes the method brittle in dynamic or adaptive threat settings.\n4. There is no evaluation of adaptive attacks that directly target or poison the neuron identification or projection steps.\n5. The method relies on a single model family and a limited set of harmful prompts, which raises questions about generalization to other architectures and domains.\n6. No analysis is provided on the cost or wall-clock time of neuron discovery, which is essential to justify efficiency claims.\n7.
