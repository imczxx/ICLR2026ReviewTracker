In parallel, equivariant representation learning has emerged as a powerful framework for constructing latent spaces where analytically known group transformations could act directly, capturing geometric structure in data and enhancing both interpretability and generalization.\nHowever, we identify that existing approaches often suffer from \\textit{latent misalignment}, a discrepancy between the intended group action and the actual required transformations in latent space, as the learned latents fail to consistently preserve the equivariant relations imposed by the underlying group symmetry. This misalignment degrades view synthesis quality and undermines the theoretical guarantees of equivariant representation learning. \nTo address this issue, we introduce \\textbf{Residual Latent Flow}, a flow-matching-based correction framework that corrects the misaligned latents, thereby improving compliance with the underlying equivariance relation.\nWe show experiments that flow-based correction significantly reduces latent misalignment and improves novel view synthesis quality, under orthogonal group $\\mathrm{SO}(n)$, using synthetic image datasets with rotational freedom.

It (A) considers a simple autoencoder with an equivariance loss to be the end-all in equivariant representation learning and (B) assumes that the quality of representations should be evaluated solely by considering whether the decoded image was correctly transformed. While I'm sure that this approach existed, it is not cited anywhere in the main text (as far as I can see) and it also appears to be the sole baseline. \n- Regarding (A): There are many equivariant representation learners for image synthesis that do not take this form and it is unclear if the proposed methodology would extend to them. \n- Regarding (B): Network representations are commonly evaluated using a diverse set of downstream tasks and only image synthesis (on synthetic datasets) is presented here. For example, what about equivariant representations for other tasks that may benefit such as pose estimation?  Further, the focus on image synthesis raises non relevant but practically material concerns like the experimental trends very much depending on decoder capacity, latent size, the image loss used, etc.\n\nCurrently, the gains displayed in Table 1 are marginal relative to the effort required to train a secondary posthoc generative flow model to improve the original model. It is unclear if these small gains will transfer to more powerful representation learning or generative modeling strategies.\n\nLastly, as a more minor point, L053 claims that some portion of the empirical lack of equivariance is due to the data variability in non-closed-form ways (e.g. occlusion, lighting). While this is true to some extent, even with a perfect dataset, this empirical lack of equivariance will always persist with current architectures due to aliasing of intermediate representations (see [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12423) and [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02984)). This statement in the paper should be given more nuance.\n\n### Experiments:\n- All of the experiments in the paper are conducted on entirely synthetic programmatically generated images. While these are great for benchmarking as they give exact ground truth, IMO they are insufficient to demonstrate that a given algorithm is useful for real problems. This paper would need to design and execute experiments with a real dataset or two before it can be considered to be broadly useful.\n- As far as I can tell, there are no baselines in the entire paper, just a single uncited method that just removes the flow matching from the proposed method (i.e. an ablation). This is insufficient and the paper needs significantly more experimental depth. There are many, many papers in this space about equivariant latents creating controllable outputs such as [1](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/e63309e532688c722177f81e99f94f32-Paper-Conference.pdf), [2](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/9bfc2c20fa2f56a18397eafe1be8a50a-Paper-Conference.pdf), [3](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/birrell22a.html), [4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11663), [5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07559), [6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11673), [7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12423), and many others including all the references within them. At least two to three relevant baselines should be included.\n\n### Presentation:\n- From Section 3.2, it is clear *how* the flow matching is performed. However, unless I missed something, the paper never clarifies *why* it decided on a flow matching setup. One can imagine many different ways to achieve this latent alignment, and flow matching is not the first approach that would come to mind. Please elaborate on the rationale for this choice and its comparative advantage over other approaches for this problem.\n- It is quite unclear from the paper whether the flow matching module is trained alongside the image representation learner end-to-end or if its trained post hoc. Please clarify.\n- The paper takes too long to get to its contribution (on page 5) as it covers the reasonably well known fundamentals of equivariant learning in great detail. As a result, many key details that are much more specific to the paper, like Appendices B.2--B.4 are missing from the main text. The background of their chosen model based on this relatively new strategy called \"Neural Fourier Transforms\" should be expanded as well."}, "questions": {"value": "It is possible that I misunderstood core contributions and I am very open to being corrected during the discussion period.
