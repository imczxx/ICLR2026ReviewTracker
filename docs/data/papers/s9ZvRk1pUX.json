To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates traditional numerical solvers, such as the finite element method, within physics-informed deep learning. This framework enables the exact imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions seamlessly, and efficiently addresses complex, non-analytic problems. The proposed approach is versatile, making it suitable for integration into any physics-informed model. Crucially, our hybrid gradient computation is up to two orders of magnitude faster than AD, as its computational cost remains unaffected by the underlying model's complexity.

More diverse PDEs and geometries are needed to demonstrate generality and robustness.  \n- **Outdated comparison:** The study only compares with the original PINN. Recent advancements (e.g., arXiv:2402.00326, arXiv:2306.15969, and many others) are completely ignored, making the experimental evaluation obsolete and unconvincing.  \n- **No theoretical foundation:** The paper lacks mathematical justification, convergence analysis, or error estimates for the proposed hybrid scheme.  \n- **Contradicts the purpose of PINNs:** The method requires meshing to compute numerical derivatives, eliminating the key advantage of PINNs as mesh-free solvers.
