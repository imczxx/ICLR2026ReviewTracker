However, these approaches fall short on core tasks such as open molecular generation and optimization: they lack explicit reasoning processes, and their outputs cannot be systematically verified, leading to severe issues of scientific hallucination. To overcome these limitations, we propose ChemReason, a chemical LLM grounded in generative code reasoning. Unlike non-reasoning LLMs, ChemReason is a code-driven reasoning model that provides transparent inference for molecular editing, generation, and optimization. By dynamically generating and executing chemical verification code during reasoning, the model validates each step, ensuring the scientific reliability of its answers under open-domain conditions. On the TOMG benchmark, ChemReason achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates end-to-end verifiable inference for open molecular tasks. More broadly, the proposed \"code–verification–reflection\" paradigm offers an extensible pathway for AI for Science, providing a generalizable architecture for addressing complex scientific computing challenges.", "tldr": "We present ChemReason, a code-driven reasoning language model with dynamic chemical verification, enabling verifiable molecular generation and optimization and achieving state-of-the-art performance on open molecular tasks.", "keywords": ["Chemical Reasoning LLM", "Computational Chemistry", "Code-Augmented Reasoning", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ec15340785e035051a19a1a800f8817ac5d02820.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b59242c4d7cf8f2cc51351baf9e3ea52eecd6d92.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce ChemReason, a tool-augmented reasoning LLM fine-tuned for molecular editing, optimization, and generation.

It’s unclear whether improvements reflect overfitting or superior chemical reasoning. Please add:\n    - *Task-transfer tests*: Without retraining, does the model generalize to related objectives (e.g., solubility/TPSA optimization, scaffold hopping)?\n    - *Capability retention*: Does it retain general language-modeling abilities, or have these degraded?\n\n- **W2: Lack of uncertainty and significance.**\nThe significance of results cannot be assessed without variability estimates. If these are Pass@1, please run ≥3 independent runs with different seeds and report mean ± s.d., plus ideally paired significance tests.\n\n- **W3: Unclear differentiation from tool-enabled general LLMs.**\nConceptually, your model is an LLM with Python + *RDKit* tool access, capabilities also available in recent GPT models.

Although these are near-contemporaneous, please mention early preprints on chemical reasoning LLMs (e.g., ether0, ChemDFM-R) in the Introduction/Related Work for completeness.\n- W6: Terminology: “cold-start.”  The term is used inconsistently in the LLM/RL literature, sometimes for an SFT phase (as in your case) and sometime for RL without an SFT phase. Currently, you introduce “cold-start” at L68 and only clarify SFT at L240.

Also, do I understand correctly that the difference between C-SFT and C-SFT+TIR, is that both the trained on the traces with code but only +TIR had access to tool calls during evaluation? As you can see I'm bit confused on differences between your models and SFT training data. Please clarify these. OK, it seems that you give of these explanations in 4.3 after the main results.

The trajectory generation for the SFT? For me it reads as the likelihood of answer given a set of tasks $\\mathcal{T}$, but probably it should for a one specific task? And do I understand correctly that $k$ is number of reasoning-code-result iterations, or what exactly is a reasoning step?\n- Q3: Not sure I understand section 3.3.2 and Eq. 2 correctly. From previous sections, I understood that all your COTs contain a tool call. However, from Eq. 2 I would understand that you have cases where you have tools calls and others that do not. Please clarify.\n- Q4: Please clarify the variants before the main results: What exactly are Qwen3-8B-SFT (ori), C-SFT, and C-SFT+TIR? What is \"original\" data? Also confirm whether C-SFT and C-SFT+TIR share the same code-trace training data, with +TIR differing only by tool access at evaluation, as for my TIR doesn't make sense during SFT.

Even several fundamental requirements for an academic paper have not been properly achieved. For example:\n    * A great number of citations are missing, such as TOMG-bench, Synapse, and all the baseline models used in their experiments. (Also, the format of all the citations is incorrect.)\n    * The writing logic of the Related Work section is confusing, and some parts read more like content that should belong in the Introduction section.\n    * Several concepts in the paper are insufficiently or inadequately explained, such as the method to assign difficulty levels to the problems in TOMG-Bench, the role or function of R' in Figure 2, and the differences between C-GRPO and GRPO.\n2. Their description of the advantages and core methodology of GRPO is almost entirely incorrect. The key improvement of GRPO lies in estimating the expected reward of the current state, V(S), through group-wise averaging, thereby eliminating the need for a Critic Model as used in PPO. However, in this paper’s discussion:\n    * “Instead of assigning absolute rewards, GRPO normalizes rewards within each group.” Other algorithms, such as REINFORCE-Baseline and PPO, also compute the advantage rather than directly using the absolute reward, so this is not a distinguishing feature of GRPO.\n    * “While other RLHF approaches require a dedicated reward model, GRPO can flexibly rely on any scoring function or even a stronger LLM to assess solution quality.” The authors seem to conflate the RL optimization algorithm with the reward system. For all algorithms that support optimization using outcome rewards, such as REINFORCE++, PPO, and GRPO, the method of obtaining the reward is irrelevant to the optimization process itself. As long as an outcome reward can be provided, these algorithms can be used for training.\n3. Dedicated design of code templates seems to hinder the generalization capability of the model."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The format of all the citations is incorrect.

This assumption appears plausible, as generating executable code forces the model to make explicit design choices and reason about program correctness. In doing so, the LLM may develop a deeper understanding of the problem, which could also enhance general reasoning, e.g., reasoning about orchestrating tool usage and arriving at final solutions. Consequently, investigating whether this assumption holds is highly relevant and could yield genuinely novel research insights.\n\n* **(S2) – Experimental results indicate potential significance.**\nExperiments on the TOMG dataset and corresponding ablation studies indicate that the staged training procedure (SFT followed by RL) is beneficial. Models trained with both stages outperform their respective baselines. Compared to other base models, the proposed approach also seems to perform well. The choice of the TOMG dataset is appropriate, as it enables evaluation across three relevant tasks: molecular editing, molecular optimization, and conditioned generation.\n\n### Comments\n* A notable advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to verify the validity of generated SMILES strings (i.e. RDKit processibility).

The reference provided for (a) does not substantiate this statement and does not focus at all on tool-augmented agents. For (b), no reference is provided. Consequently, the validity of both statements remains highly unclear.\n    - Verifiability: In a strict sense, the correctness of the generated tools cannot be guaranteed. While in most practical cases it might be sufficient to check only for the correct answer, the generated tools might rely on Clever-Hans effects rather than on a correct implementation.\n\n* **(W2) - The central research question is never answered due to a missing experiment**. The interesting research question is: Does generating tools on the fly within the reasoning trace help to boost reasoning capabilities compared to models using external tools? However, this question is never answered because no model with external tool usage has been trained and evaluated. To answer the raised question, reasoning traces for both approaches would need to be compared. A standard RL-trained model without tool usage would also be necessary to evaluate whether tool usage is required at all to solve the tasks.
