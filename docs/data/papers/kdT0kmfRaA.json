Existing approaches to improving video quality typically rely on heavyweight post-editing models, which may introduce new artifacts, or costly fine-tuning of the generator backbone, limiting scalability and accessibility.\nWe introduce Critique Coach Calibration (CCC), a training-free, model-agnostic framework for iterative prompt evolution that closes the gap between direct generation and reality. In each cycle, an off-the-shelf multimodal large language model (MLLM) produces a structured critique of a generated video—identifying semantic misalignments, subject drift, and missing objects—and then reformulates the input prompt based on this feedback. By repeatedly evolving prompts through this critique–coach loop, CCC steadily improves both video quality and adherence to everyday physics, all without modifying the generator or relying on external editing modules.\nEmpirical results on different video models show that CCC consistently enhances semantic alignment and visual quality through the power of adaptive prompt evolution.", "tldr": "We propose Critique Coach Calibration (CCC), a training-free prompt evolution framework where MLLMs iteratively critique and refine prompts to improve video generation.", "keywords": ["video generation", "prompt evolution", "multimodal large language models"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e8bcf72f589e8570f7d930db119b157612f680da.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes CCC, a training-free, model-agnostic framework that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to iteratively critique and rewrite input text prompts for video generation.

The paper aims at addressing a challenging issue in text-to-video generation -- poor semantic alignment between user prompt and generated video content -- which remains unsolved despite recent advancement in the video generation field.

The proposed framework is largely an engineering workflow rather than a technically innovative algorithm. The core operation is simply prompting GPT-4o to critique and rewrite/refine text prompts. There is no new module, optimization, or theoretical insight. The contributions are incremental relative to prior “prompt-optimization via (M)LLM feedback” works (e.g., Idea2Img, OPT2I).\n2. **MIssing Comparisons**. The is no comparison against more robust prompt-optimization methods or modern reinforcement feedback approaches (e.g., DPO-Video). and repairing methods (e.g., VideoRepair). Being training-free is a merit, but I am still curious about what the boundary of this line of work is and how they compare with RL-based methods.\n3. **Insufficient Qualitative Evidence and Missing Videos**. The paper provides very few qualitative examples and no accompanying video results. Without visual evidence, it is impossible to verify the claimed improvements (aligment and perceptual quality).\n4. **Marginal Improvement**. The proposed method cannot fundamentally improve the model’s capability -- for example, if the base model is unable to generate certain content, this approach cannot help. In contrast, a more effective prompt-extension method might achieve better alignment between user intent and the generated results."}, "questions": {"value": "**Unclear Definition of Structured Feedback**.
