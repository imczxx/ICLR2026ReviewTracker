Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models, and both typically require control over training. \nWe propose non-transferable examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace, preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common preprocessing, while non-targets collapse even under severe distortions. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Neural Networks", "Model Specificity", "Non-generalizable Examples"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a912657c62ecb1f416efe2e0761ad96ea51978e1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Non-Transferable Examples (NEs) — a training-free, input-side method for model-specific data authorization.

This formulation shifts the control from model training or encryption to input-level encoding, representing a genuinely novel conceptual contribution.\n2.\tThe proposed approach is simple, efficient, and broadly applicable. Since NEs only require access to the first-layer weights of the target model, they can be deployed across diverse architectures, including CNNs, Vision Transformers, and vision-language models, without retraining. This makes the method attractive for real-world deployment.\n3.\tThe authors support their approach with a solid mathematical analysis. By leveraging spectral theory and the Hoffman–Wielandt inequality, they rigorously show why the encoded data maintain performance on the authorized model but degrade substantially on others due to subspace misalignment. The theoretical framework aligns well with empirical findings."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.\tIf many encoded samples are publicly available and generated under a consistent subspace or seed, an adversary could apply PCA or covariance-based spectral analysis to infer correlated energy patterns and approximate the manipulated subspace, partially neutralizing the encoding and restoring unauthorized performance.\n2.\tNE is an input-side, inference-stage defense that becomes ineffective when large-scale datasets are directly used for training or fine-tuning. Attackers can adapt by learning on re-encoded data or mixing it with original samples.\n3.\tBecause NE encoding depends on precise spectral alignment with the target model’s first-layer subspace, common transformations—compression, resizing, cropping, or illumination shifts—may distort the encoded signals and weaken the authorization effect.
