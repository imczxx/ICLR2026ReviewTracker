This paradigm retains the generative power of SGMs while allowing adaptation to different forward models without requiring re-training. In parallel, derivative-free posterior sampling algorithms have gained increasing attention for solving inverse problems where the derivative, pseudo-inverse, or full knowledge of the forward model is unavailable or impractical to compute. Despite their success, these methods lack principled foundations and provide no convergence guarantees to the true posterior distribution or to its $\\varepsilon$-accurate approximation. We propose \\textit{zeroth-order annealed plug-and-play Monte Carlo (ZO-APMC)}, the first principled derivative-free framework for solving general inverse problems that requires only forward-model evaluations and a pre-trained SGM prior. We derive complexity bounds for obtaining samples with $\\varepsilon$-relative Fisher information under a non-log-concave likelihood distribution and, under a Poincar\\'e inequality assumption, $\\varepsilon$-accuracy in total variation distance, and we establish weak convergence of ZO-APMC to the target posterior.

I am also struggling with the main take away of the theory. If there was \"informal\" statements in the main paper, one could distill the statements into takeaways for practitioners, ignoring technical constants and looking at the main scaling behavior.\n\n3) assumption 5 bites itself with the usual diffusion assumptions. At least in the diffusion case, one can show that the score needs to explode to \"approximate\" an empirical distribution. The authors now require that the learned score is bounded, and the difference to the true score is bounded, which I dont think is possible for empirical measures, and explodes for smoothing going to zero. (see for instance \"Score based generative models detect manifolds\")\n\n4) I am also skeptical of the main motivation. The authors state examples like if the forward operator is a PDE solution, but calculating gradients (if the pde is already implemented) is in O(1). Of course there can incur instabilites, but they might also happen in the usual forward eval without the gradients. If the authors could elaborate on their specific setting, they would apply their algo in, I would be happy.

The central premise of this work is to establish theoretical guarantees for a highly specific, arguably contrived, problem setting: derivative-free posterior sampling with SGM priors. While technically challenging, the practical motivation for this exact combination feels weak. A significant portion of modern inverse problems, especially in imaging, do have differentiable forward models (e.g., via auto-differentiation through simulators). The community is increasingly moving towards differentiable programming. This paper overstates the prevalence of purely \"black-box\" scenarios where its method would be uniquely essential, making the direction feel more like a niche theoretical exercise than a solution to a pressing, widespread problem.\n2. The paper attempts to tame the notoriously high variance of ZO gradient estimators within a stochastic sampling framework. This involves complex machinery like PAGE-style variance reduction and delicate annealing schedules, creating a \"tricky\" and highly engineered solution. The resulting algorithm is complex, laden with sensitive hyperparameters.\n3. Despite the variety of tasks, the experimental setup feels superficial and fails to convincingly demonstrate that ZO-APMC represents a significant practical advancement over existing methods. The results (Table 1) show that ZO-APMC (PSNR 35.29) barely outperforms a simple baseline like DPG (PSNR 32.17) and is still noticeably worse than the gradient-based APMC (PSNR 36.55). \n4. The paper's main selling point is its theoretical guarantees. However, the derived complexity bounds are astronomical (e.g., O(d⁷...)). Such bounds are often so loose that they provide little practical insight into the algorithm's real-world behavior or how to set its hyperparameters."}, "questions": {"value": "I'm curious to know, besides publishing papers, what is the practical significance of researching inverse problem solving under black boxes?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "JT4yZUabz5", "forum": "EKLhCNjzQR", "replyto": "EKLhCNjzQR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15872/Reviewer_2vHU"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15872/Reviewer_2vHU"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15872/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761916256527, "cdate": 1761916256527, "tmdate": 1762926088340, "mdate": 1762926088340, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
