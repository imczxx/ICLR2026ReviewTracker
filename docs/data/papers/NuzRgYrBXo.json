It argues that the efficacy of TDD-style repair is constrained by feedback quality, which is undermined by the scarcity of high-quality tests and the noise of automatically generated suites. The central thesis is quality over quantity in feedback, instantiated via two principles: property-oriented and structurally minimal. Property-oriented feedback verifies general semantic properties that correct programs must satisfy (e.g., sorted output is non-decreasing), providing oracle-agnostic guidance beyond input–output mismatches and mitigating the test-oracle problem. Structural minimality demands the simplest counterexample that triggers a property violation, lowering cognitive load and isolating root causes. To realize these principles, the authors propose Property-Generated Solver (PGS), a multi-agent framework with a Generator (for code synthesis and repair) and a Tester (for high-quality feedback). The Tester extracts properties from problem statements, generates diverse inputs to probe them, detects violations, and returns the structurally simplest counterexample as a clear corrective signal. Across HumanEval, MBPP, LiveCodeBench, and CodeContests, PGS consistently outperforms TDD and self-debugging baselines on multiple LLMs, raising bug-repair rates by 1.4×–1.6× and setting a new state of the art."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. **Novel and Insightful Core Idea**: The paper's primary contribution is its novel and insightful perspective that shifts the research paradigm from test quantity to feedback quality. This addresses a critical yet largely overlooked dimension in existing work on LLM-based code refinement, providing a valuable new direction for the field.\n\n2. **Rigorous and Well-Grounded Methodology**: The methodology is rigorous and logically sound. A key highlight is the well-designed pilot study that empirically validates the paper's foundational principles before introducing the full framework. This study convincingly demonstrates the superiority of property-oriented feedback over simple I/O mismatches and identifies input token count as the most effective proxy for creating structurally minimal, actionable feedback.\n\n3. **Comprehensive and Solid Empirical Evaluation**: The paper is supported by a comprehensive and convincing empirical evaluation. The experiments are conducted across a diverse suite of widely-recognized benchmarks, spanning a wide spectrum of difficulty from function-level synthesis to competition-level programming. The validation on multiple state-of-the-art language models further demonstrates the robustness and generalizability of the proposed framework, showcasing its model-agnostic benefits."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Potentially Outdated Foundation Models**: The generalizability of the findings is potentially limited by the choice of foundation models (DeepSeek-Coder-V2, Qwen2.5-Coder, DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-32B). These models, while capable, are no longer at the state-of-the-art. The performance gap between the strongest model used and more recent, powerful models (e.g., Qwen3-Coder-30B, which scores over 50 on SWE-bench) is significant. This raises questions about whether the observed gains would persist on leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-5, Claude 4 series), which may exhibit different failure modes and require different feedback strategies.\n\n2. **Questionable Cost-Effectiveness on Simple Tasks**: The application of a sophisticated, multi-agent framework like PGS to single-function benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP) raises questions of cost-effectiveness. Although performance gains are reported, these benchmarks are often solvable by simpler methods. The results are therefore less significant in justifying the framework's complexity, as its true advantage lies in tackling more intricate problems where such sophistication is necessary.\n\n3. **Unaddressed Dependence on Tester Agent Capability**: The framework's success appears to be heavily dependent on the capability of the Tester agent, yet its robustness is insufficiently discussed. The paper does not adequately address scenarios where the Tester might generate incorrect or trivial properties, which could misguide the refinement process and degrade performance. An analysis of the framework's sensitivity to the Tester's capability (e.g., by using a weaker model) would strengthen the claims.\n\n4. **Lack of Cost-Benefit Analysis**: The paper lacks a thorough cost-benefit analysis. The multi-step iterative process of PGS likely incurs substantial computational overhead (in terms of token usage and latency) compared to simpler refinement methods. Without a direct comparison under a fixed computational budget, it is difficult to assess the practical trade-offs and overall efficiency of the proposed approach.\n\n5. **Discrepancy in Reported Baseline Score**: A minor discrepancy was noted in the baseline performance for DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-32B on LiveCodeBench. The paper reports a pass@1 of 64.4%, which appears to differ from the 57.2% cited in the model's official technical report. Clarification on this point would be beneficial for ensuring the reproducibility of the results.\n\n6. **Minor Presentation Flaw in Appendix**: There is a presentation error in the appendix where Figure 6 and Figure 7 are identical. This appears to be a copy-paste error and should be corrected to reflect the distinct case studies described in the text."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Generalizability to State-of-the-Art Models: The paper demonstrates strong results on capable open-source models. However, to what extent do the benefits of property-oriented and structurally minimal feedback generalize to leading proprietary models (e.g., the GPT-5 ，Claude 4 series and Qwen3-Coder)? A supplementary analysis on these models would significantly bolster the paper's claims of generalizability.\n\n2. Sensitivity to the Tester Agent's Capability: The framework's performance seems contingent on a highly capable Tester agent. How sensitive is the overall performance of PGS to the capability of this agent? Specifically, what is the impact on the fix rate if a weaker model (e.g., the same model as the Generator) is used for property and input synthesis?\n\n3. Efficiency Under a Fixed Computational Budget: Could you provide a comparison of PGS against other iterative baselines under a fixed computational budget (e.g., total token consumption)? This would provide valuable insights into the practical cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.\n\n4.

While the evaluation metric is named \"pass@1\", there are some subtleties worth discussing. Iterative refinement methods generate multiple programs so calling it pass@1 is misleading.

For example, PGS generates 5 candidate properties and 64 new test inputs in each iteration step. Properly counting the number of tokens would provide a more complete compute vs performance tradeoffs. \n\n2. The benchmarks are small scale code generation.
