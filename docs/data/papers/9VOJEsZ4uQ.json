However, existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search (DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (\\ie, math, code and knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Model", "Mixture-of-Experts", "Test-time Scaling"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/545399790b1e6560435784c0e5679d9a8c807f12.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4ec2a7c0b0482e04411d85536e6a64cb5a83b48d.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Dynamic Experts Search (DES), a test-time scaling strategy tailored for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. The key idea is to treat the number of activated experts k at inference as a controllable search dimension, rather than a fixed architectural constant. DES has two components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which exposes k as a knob during generation to induce structural diversity in reasoning trajectories; and (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which keeps k consistent along a single trajectory but varies it across trajectories so the search can both maintain stability within a path and explore diverse configurations across paths. \n\nThe empirical picture is fairly comprehensive: DES is evaluated across several MoE models (Qwen3-30B-A3B, Ling-lite-1.5, OLMoE-1B-7B-Instruct, DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat), two verifiers (Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-7B and Llama3.1-8B-PRM-Deepseek-Data), and multiple benchmarks in math (MATH500, AIME24/25, GSM8K, SVAMP), code (HumanEval, LiveCodeBench), and knowledge (LiveBench reasoning). Against Best-of-N, Beam Search, and DVTS, DES consistently improves accuracy and precision at similar reported cost. Ablations suggest that (i) exploring multiple k values increases the chance of hitting a configuration that yields a correct solution, and (ii) inheriting k along a trajectory filters out unpromising configurations as the verifier prunes candidates, increasing pass@N and final accuracy. The paper also argues that DES does not simply “use more experts,” showing the average activated experts during search does not exceed the default.\n\nOverall, the paper pushes a simple but compelling idea: leverage the latent structural flexibility of MoE at test time to unlock complementary solution sets that temperature-based sampling alone does not reach."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The central idea is fresh and timely: moving beyond output-level diversity (temperature/top-p) to architecture-aware diversity by controlling MoE’s activated expert count. It’s a natural fit for the growing prevalence of MoE models.\n- Methodologically simple and easy to reason about: treating k as a test-time knob plus a straightforward inheritance rule that gives implicit configuration-level credit assignment along the search.\n- Empirical breadth and consistency: many models, two verifiers, and diverse benchmarks with sensible, consistent improvements over multiple baselines. The gains are not tied to one model family or evaluation domain.\n- Thoughtful ablations: the paper separately probes the contributions of exploring different k and inheriting k; the violin plots and step-wise views help argue that improvements are not a byproduct of trivially activating more experts.\n- Practical upside: if exposing k can be standardized in inference stacks (e.g., vLLM), DES could be a “drop-in” test-time enhancement that avoids retraining and scales with budget."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Cost accounting is under-specified for MoE: the paper mainly uses generated tokens as a proxy for computation, but per-token cost scales with k in MoE. Even if average k doesn’t exceed the default, small shifts matter. A fairer comparison would report FLOPs or at least “token-count × average-k” (and preferably align average k across methods or normalize results by FLOPs).\n- Reproducibility and implementation detail gaps: changing top-k routing at inference isn’t universally exposed; capacity factors, load-balancing, and token dropping can complicate things. The paper should document how k is controlled in practice (per-layer or global, capacity handling, any router noise) and quantify the throughput/latency/memory impact of varying k.\n- Evidence on “complementary solution sets” could be tightened: the Jaccard analysis is persuasive, but I would like to see stronger statistics across seeds/difficulty strata and a low-temperature or fixed-seed setting isolating structural (k) diversity from sampling diversity.\n- Baselines could be stronger on diversity: comparisons to more diversity-focused search variants (temperature schedules, top-p sweeps per branch, stochastic beam, nucleus-beam hybrids, or recent foresight/token-level diversity methods) would better establish DES’s advantage.\n- Decision-rule inconsistency: the text alternates between PRM-best and majority vote for final selection. The main results should lock in one rule (and report the other as supplemental), along with an analysis of where the two diverge.\n- Sensitivity analysis: results depend on the initial k set, T, M, and temperature. A more systematic study with CIs would help practitioners know how to set these knobs and how robust the gains are to reasonable changes.\n- PRM reliance and potential leakage: the paper should explicitly discuss possible overlaps between PRM training data and the eval sets, and include a sanity check with an alternate verifier or a pure answer-checking setup to show robustness.\n- Minor editorial issues: a duplicated paragraph in the appendix on math answer extraction; one appendix table labels a verifier as a “policy model”; and some notation (e.g., Top_M) could be made more precise. These are easy fixes but worth cleaning up."}, "questions": {"value": "- The idea is interesting and promising, but the implementation and cost accounting need to be clearer. For reproducibility and fair comparison, I’m especially looking for the following.\n\n1) k implementation and control\n- How exactly do you expose and tune the MoE router’s top‑k in your inference stack (vLLM/Transformers)? Is k global across all MoE layers or configurable per layer? When k changes, do you adjust capacity factor, token dropping, or router noise to keep routing stable?\n- Does changing k require edits to model weights or router kernels? Please provide the minimal diffs/flags for reproducibility.\n\n2) Compute cost accounting\n- Since per‑token FLOPs scale with k in MoE, token count alone isn’t sufficient. Please report FLOPs or a reliable surrogate (e.g., tokens × average‑k × number of MoE layers), and plot accuracy vs. FLOPs under cost normalization.\n- Provide throughput/latency/memory as a function of k (tokens/s, per‑sample latency, peak VRAM), and show how DES affects system efficiency across context lengths.\n\n3) Capacity and routing behavior\n- As k increases, do you see more capacity overflow or token dropping? What capacity factor and load‑balancing settings do you use? Please report drop rates vs. k and any mitigation.\n- Do you add router noise at inference? If so, how does it interact with k and affect reproducibility?\n\n4) Decision rule consistency\n- The paper alternates between majority voting and PRM‑best. Which rule is primary for the main results? Please add an agreement analysis when they diverge, with an error taxonomy and sensitivity to budget N.\n\n5) Structural vs. sampling diversity\n- The Jaccard analysis is compelling. Can you isolate structural (k) diversity from sampling diversity by fixing seeds or using very low temperatures while varying only k? Please report statistics across multiple seeds and difficulty strata, with significance tests.\n- Include per‑problem case studies where changing k flips failure to success, and describe the associated routing/load changes.\n\n6) Diversity‑oriented baselines\n- To strengthen claims over diversity‑aware methods, please add or clarify: stochastic beam variants, temperature/top‑p schedules per subtree, nucleus‑beam hybrids, token‑level diversity (e.g., Phi‑decoding), and stronger DVTS configurations. Match budgets under a common cost normalization.\n\n7) Hyperparameter sensitivity and robustness\n- Run systematic sweeps (with CIs) over the initial k set (range and granularity), T, M, and temperature. How sensitive are gains to these knobs? What happens as n (number of initial k values) is reduced?\n- Report step‑wise average k and its variance under DES, and verify the claim that “average k does not exceed default” across datasets and budgets.\n\n8) PRM dependence and potential leakage\n- Audit for overlap between PRM training data and evaluation sets (MATH/AIME, GSM8K, LiveBench, etc.). If overlap exists, how do results change after filtering?\n- Add robustness tests with an alternative verifier and a pure answer‑checker (no PRM) to assess DES’s reliance on PRM scoring quality.\n\n9) When and why DES helps\n- Can you correlate problem characteristics with preferred k (e.g., routing entropy, gate‑margin distributions, reasoning length/depth)? Any evidence that certain layers benefit more from larger/smaller k?\n- Does per‑layer heterogeneous k (or a schedule that adapts k across steps) further improve performance, and is it stable?\n\n10) Fairness of “thinking mode” comparisons\n- Are comparisons equalized by FLOPs or only by tokens? Please report accuracy vs. FLOPs and pass@N, and time‑to‑first‑correct where applicable. Clarify stopping criteria and any length penalties.\n\n11) Reproducibility details\n- Will you release code/configs to toggle k at inference? Please provide seeds, prompts, router settings, vLLM flags, and any CUDA/kernel constraints. Also fix minor editorial issues (duplicated math answer‑extraction paragraph, verifier mislabeled as “policy model,” precise definition of Top_M in Eq. (4)).\n\n12) Beyond MoE\n- Do you see analogous “structural knobs” for dense models (e.g., dynamic depth/width, selective channels in grouped‑FFN) where the DES paradigm transfers? Any preliminary evidence?\n\n- Overall, I like the motivation and direction. If you firm up the implementation and cost details above, the conclusions will be stronger and the work easier to reproduce and extend."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "9NQ0Cvxtln", "forum": "9VOJEsZ4uQ", "replyto": "9VOJEsZ4uQ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2397/Reviewer_4yj6"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2397/Reviewer_4yj6"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2397/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761359579212, "cdate": 1761359579212, "tmdate": 1762916218745, "mdate": 1762916218745, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new Test-Time Scaling (TTS) strategy that leverages the structural flexibility of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models to improve reasoning performance.
