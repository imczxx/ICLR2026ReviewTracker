Due to the presence of missing values in the medical tabular data, these techniques commonly impute the missing values before applying classifiers. However, most existing techniques classify patients solely based on each patient's individual features, overlooking the potential benefits of using similarities among patients to improve both imputation and classification. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-based Feature-Attentive Classifier under Missingness (G-FACM), a novel framework for classification on medical tabular data. G-FACM constructs feature-attentive k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graphs to seamlessly integrate graph data imputation methods with medical tabular classification. The key idea is to construct a kNN graph among patients by prioritizing features that are most important for classification. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that G-FACM successfully bridges the gap between graph data imputation methods and medical tabular classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various medical tabular datasets.", "tldr": "We introduce Graph-based Feature-Attentive Classifier under Missingness (G-FACM), a novel framework for classifying medical tabular data containing missing values.", "keywords": ["AI for healthcare", "medical classification"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a017330e8a89811c4526b2d4fd5f9dfbf95b22cf.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a method for patient classification in medical table data with missing values.

It is difficult to follow the claim of how this two-step process (building a graph, then imputing on it) is fundamentally different from a standard imputation method that learns from the data (e.g., one trained on the entire dataset, on a specific class, or on features selected for class discrimination). While learning a graph before applying graph-based methods is a known technique, it usually requires specific motivation, such as leveraging inductive bias like in biological networks. That motivation is absent here. The contribution does not appear to be a sufficiently novel step forward for ICLR.\n\n- The paper's claim in the abstract and title that current methods use only the specific sample to impute missing data seems incorrect. Even simple methods like mean imputation are based on other samples, and more advanced ML-based imputers learn from the entire dataset to model the data's conditional probabilities.\n\n- The paper misses a fundamental difference between its setup and the existing graph imputation literature. In previous work, the graph typically represents additional information or a known inductive bias. Here, the graph is constructed from the data itself (essentially clustering samples from the same class) and then used for imputation. This appears to be a circular approach, and it's not clear how this provides more information than simply using an imputer trained on a single class or on discriminative features.\n\n- The paper does not provide a clear justification for its sophisticated feature selection method (lines 052-053).
