While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query, limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity, utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective generation of LVLMs. The source code will be released upon acceptance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["large vision language models", "large language models", "contrastive decoding", "multimodal learning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/46caedbd832a975073b6a4aa3154ca83242fdd08.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by improving visual contrastive decoding (VCD).

The SAS Augmentation Choice seems arbitrary to me, as \"Noise, Horizontal Flip, Vertical Flip, Random Crop, Random Mask and Color Inversion\" only presents a subset of the image's properties. For instance, when asked about size, reachability, OCR or spatial relationship, chances are that these Augmentation choices will not work.\n3.

The paper presents a complete and well-designed decoding framework. The experimental section is thorough, covering multiple models and benchmarks, and the results consistently show that the proposed SAVCD method outperforms baselines in improving factuality.

The core idea of having the model self-select the most appropriate visual augmentation via prompt engineering to construct an \"amateur\" perspective for contrastive decoding is highly novel and interesting. It explores the possibility of using a model's own reasoning capabilities to guide its decoding process, offering a new perspective on mitigating LVLM hallucinations.\n3.

This introduces a degree of circular reasoning. If the model's foundational reasoning is strong enough to perform this selection task perfectly, the initial problem of hallucination might be less severe. This design makes the method's success partially dependent on the very problem it aims to solve.\n2.  **Over-reliance on Prompt Engineering**: The method's effectiveness is heavily dependent on a meticulously crafted, complex prompt that includes extensive descriptions and examples. Such approaches are often brittle, being sensitive to changes in wording, structure, or even model versions. Furthermore, its scalability is limited; for instance, introducing new augmentation types would require manually modifying and debugging this complex prompt. This makes the method feel more like a highly-tuned heuristic for a specific set of tasks and models rather than a general, robust principle."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  Regarding the robustness of SAS selection: What is the accuracy of the model's augmentation selection in the first step? Are there cases where the model selects a suboptimal or incorrect augmentation, leading to worse results than the baseline? Could the authors provide an analysis of such failure cases?\n2.  Regarding the limitations of the SAT algorithm: The core of SAT is using entropy to measure model uncertainty. However, models can sometimes produce a completely wrong hallucination with very high confidence (i.e., very low entropy). In such \"confidently wrong\" scenarios, could SAT's stricter threshold inadvertently lock in this error, making it harder to correct?\n3.  Regarding the generality of the prompt: The SAS prompt appears quite elaborate. How much would the performance degrade if this prompt were simplified (e.g., providing only the names and simple descriptions of augmentations, without the ICL examples)? This would help in understanding to what extent the performance gain comes from the method itself versus the elaborate prompt engineering."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "KIA23lFBHH", "forum": "Z1zHgGGG3B", "replyto": "Z1zHgGGG3B", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8720/Reviewer_msRD"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8720/Reviewer_msRD"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8720/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761894390857, "cdate": 1761894390857, "tmdate": 1762920519882, "mdate": 1762920519882, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Self-augmented Visual Contrastive Decoding, a training-free decoding strategy designed to mitigate hallucination problem in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
