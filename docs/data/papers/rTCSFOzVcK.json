In recent years, some researchers have attempted to learn better representations to solve RL tasks, among which the contrastive reinforcement learning that is independent of rewards demonstrating strong performance. However, how to make contrastive learning better applicable to reinforcement learning settings is still a problem. In this paper, instead of learning representations related to goals in environments, we present hierarchical contrastive reinforcement learning (HCRL) method that reduces the difficulty of learn goal representations by introducing intermediate representations related to states. HCRL expresses such an idea that the agent should first understand the environment and then understand the tasks in the environment. Our method fully utilizes the information in the GCRL setting and provides a better representation learning method, which has better performance in various complex and sparse environments without adding additional assumptions or constraints. The results of comparison experiments show that HCRL has faster convergence speed and higher success rate than prior work on a range of goal-conditional RL tasks. We further conduct ablation studies and additional evaluations to validate our method.

The authors build on contrastive reinforcement learning and propose learning intermediate sensorimotor action-state representations using contrastive objectives. The experiments show improved results across several environments compared to a set of baselines.\n\nThe method appears is novel, albeit incremental over CRL. However, the paper suffers from grammatical issues, missing words, and a general lack of clarity. The motivation behind the proposed approach could be more clearly framed. In addition, the experiments do not demonstrate the benefits of the approach in complex state and goal spaces.\n\nWriting and Presentation Issues\n\n- Line 48: The meaning of “a representation that implies a probability” is unclear.\n- Line 77: It is unclear what is meant.\n- Line 83: Sentence appears incomplete.\n- Line 134: The subtitle is awkwardly phrased.\n- Abstract: The sentence “Our work fully utilizes the information in the GCRL setting” is vague. What specific information is being referred to? Moreover, the abbreviation GCRL is not introduced before use.\n- Line 232: It seems the authors intended to refer to s′ (next state).\n- Figures 1–3: These figures are never cited or discussed in the text.\n- Lines 256–259: The intuition behind the method is unclear and should be elaborated.\n- Line 285: A parenthesis is missing.\n- Line 316: The subsection title “Apply Representation to RL” is unclear—consider rephrasing (e.g., “Applying Learned Representations to RL”).\n- Line 377: The statement “The recommended target representation dimension is 64” requires either a citation or an experimental justification.\n- Section 5.3: The qualitative results are not analyzed or discussed.\n- More detail should be provided about the state and action spaces used in experiments.\n\nExperimental Concerns\n\n- It is unclear why the experiments in Figure 9 are not presented alongside those in Figure 4. The authors explain that these environments are “too simple to converge quickly,” which is confusing: simpler environments are typically expected to converge more easily.\n\n- A central objective of the method is to learn intermediate representations. Therefore, experiments in more challenging settings (e.g., with image-based state and goal inputs) would strengthen the paper.\n\n- The paper does not clearly identify which factors contribute to the method’s performance. In the ablation study, the authors should analyze success rates with and without each of the two loss functions. Without the first loss function (Equation 11), the method closely resembles CRL, differing mainly in neural network architecture. It is therefore important to clarify whether the performance improvements stem from architectural changes or from the first contrastive loss. The loss functions in Equation 11 should have distinct names for clarity."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- Interesting topics and relevant benchmark\n- Preliminary experiments demonstrate significant improvements over the baselines"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- General lack of clarity\n- Incremental method, relative to CRL\n- Critical experiments are missing to validate the method"}, "questions": {"value": "Please, see above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "hwvhto7sOZ", "forum": "rTCSFOzVcK", "replyto": "rTCSFOzVcK", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2141/Reviewer_nF5P"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2141/Reviewer_nF5P"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2141/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761575308523, "cdate": 1761575308523, "tmdate": 1762916047705, "mdate": 1762916047705, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a method for learning decoupled state-to-state and state-to-goal representations for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning.
