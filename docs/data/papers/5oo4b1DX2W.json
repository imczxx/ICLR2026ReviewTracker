Existing methods have largely focused on source localization, overlooking the reconstruction of propagation trees, i.e., the underlying \"who-infected-whom\" paths that are essential for interpreting diffusion dynamics. We introduce DIPT (Deep Identification of Propagation Trees), a probabilistic framework that infers propagation trees from observed node diffusion states. DIPT models local influence strengths between nodes and leverages an alternating optimization strategy to jointly learn the diffusion mechanism and reconstruct the propagation structure. Empirical results across five real-world datasets demonstrate that DIPT consistently outperforms existing approaches in accurately reconstructing propagation trees.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Propagation Trees", "Information Diffusion", "Inverse Optimization Problems"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4aee3492624f617dab43779b0017f684c132025e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a probabilistic framework Deep Identification of Propagation Trees,  to infer propagation trees from final observed node diffusion states, without knowledge of the diffusion mechanism.

In the setting of some other works, the feature of the nodes is usually unknown. However, the core influence function, `f_ψ(F_u, F_v)`, is entirely feature-driven. This potentially limits the method's applicability in domains where informative node features are scarce or unavailable (e.g., anonymous networks).
