Leveraging information asymmetry, AgentSynth constructs subtasks that are simple during generation but significantly more challenging when composed into long-horizon tasks, enabling the creation of over 6,000 diverse and realistic tasks. A key strength of AgentSynth is its ability to precisely modulate task complexity by varying the number of subtasks. Empirical evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents suffer a steep performance drop, from 18\\% success at difficulty level 1 to just 4\\% at level 6, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and discriminative power. Moreover, our pipeline achieves a low average cost of \\$0.60 per trajectory, orders of magnitude cheaper than human annotations.

Despite its effectiveness, the \"easy-to-hard\" data synthesis approach in this paper is not entirely novel and can be observed in data synthesis across various other domains.

Some data cases presented in the main text are unnecessary, resulting in a limited experimental section and potentially giving the impression of a less robust study. It is recommended that the authors allocate more space to additional experimental analyses to provide readers with more insights.\n\n3. The evaluation setting in the experimental section of this paper lacks the use of any agent scaffold, which is too simplistic and may not adequately represent the true capabilities of the model.
