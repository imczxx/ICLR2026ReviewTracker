This market dynamism is well captured by the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis (AMH), which states that the core factors behind profitability shift as markets evolve over time. To bridge the gap between existing agent architectures and this market reality, we introduce FinThink, an AMH-grounded MAS designed for dynamic adaptation. FinThink's novelty lies in three core components: (1) A Context-aware Workflow for Reasoning (CWRM), which enables architectural adaptivity by dynamically adjusting reasoning depth based on signal complexity. (2) A Reasoning-Driven Hierarchical Memory (R-Mem), which facilitates evolutionary adaptivity by teaching the system to navigate signal conflicts in varying market regimes. (3) A Sentiment-To-Logic (STL) Prompt Protocol, which ensures reasoning stability by preventing the multi-agent process from degenerating into simplistic voting. In backtests on five major tech stocks (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, TSLA, and AMZN), FinThink demonstrates significant improvements over contemporary LLM-based agents, achieving a median advantage of 9.2% higher Sharpe Ratio, 113.1% higher Calmar Ratio, and a 46.3% reduction in Maximum Drawdown.", "tldr": "We introduce FinThink, a multi-agent trading system grounded in the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis.

The authors posit that existing financial MAS fail because their static workflows are misaligned with the dynamic, evolving nature of real-world markets, a concept described by the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis.\nTo solve this, FinThink introduces three core innovations:\n(1) Context-aware Workflow for Reasoning. An adaptive architecture where an LLM planner proposes reasoning steps and depth based on market signal complexity, which is then validated by a deterministic Finite State Machine (FSM). This allows the system to \"think deeper\" during periods of uncertainty.\n(2) Reasoning-Driven Hierarchical Memory. An \"evolutionary\" memory system that moves beyond simple PnL triggers. It reflects on entire trade lifecycles to distill \"corrective heuristics.\" Critically, it organizes these memories into \"Narrative Driver Clusters\" to enable cross-asset learning.\n(3) Sentiment-To-Logic Prompt Protocol.

The idea of learning from entire trade lifecycles rather than reactive, trigger-based reflections, like a simple PnL drop, is far more robust. The concept of \"Narrative Driver Clusters\" to facilitate cross-asset generalization is particularly insightful and well-argued.\nThe ablation study in Table 3 is excellent. It clearly demonstrates the critical importance of both the R-Mem (performance is catastrophic without it) and the STL protocol (performance severely degrades without it).

The conceptual framing around adaptivity and reflective reasoning is largely incremental over these works, which already explored hierarchical memory, risk control, and multi-agent reasoning frameworks for trading decision-making.\n\n[1] Yu, Y., Yao, Z., Li, H., Deng, Z., Jiang, Y., Cao, Y., ... & Xie, Q.

As seen in Tables 1–2 (pp. 9–10), FinThink outperforms baselines in Sharpe and Calmar Ratios on average, but its Total Return (TR) often falls below FinCon for certain stocks (e.g., AAPL, GOOG, MSFT), suggesting that the method’s advantage could lie primarily in conservative risk management rather than genuine predictive superiority. This raises concerns about whether the reported gains reflect robust reasoning enhancement or simply stronger regularization.\n\n3) Although Appendix A.1 includes an ablation study for R-Mem and STL modules, it omits a systematic examination of the modified risk module introduced in the main text (via STL-II integration and cross-asset memory), as the authors emphasize that this is a major systematic change of their framework versus prior works. The paper does not isolate how these design elements contribute to the final performance, leaving their effectiveness short for evidences. A deeper ablation or sensitivity analysis on risk-module parameters, together with statistical significance testing, would be necessary to substantiate the claimed benefits and demonstrate the distinct contribution of each innovation."}, "questions": {"value": "Refer to what I mentioned in the weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "6wtDxFTgou", "forum": "vm7xqrU345", "replyto": "vm7xqrU345", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16090/Reviewer_kuPQ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16090/Reviewer_kuPQ"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16090/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761983928059, "cdate": 1761983928059, "tmdate": 1762926271236, "mdate": 1762926271236, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes FinThink, a Multi-Agent System based on the AMH theory.

The paper claims \"significant improvements\" and \"superior risk-adjusted returns\" in the abstract and experiments section. These claims rest entirely on risk-adjusted metrics (SR, CR) and MDD. However, the cumulative return curves in Appendix A.2 reveal a very different story: FinThink is mediocre in terms of total return. FinThink's total return is visibly lower than the B&H benchmark and other models like FinCon.\n\n2. The core of CWRM is the \"FSM Controller,\" which acts as a \"rule enforcer\" for \"logical coherence\". Yet, the specific state transition rules of this FSM are never defined in the paper. Algorithm 1 is just a black-box validateTransition call.  The core innovation of R-Mem, the \"Narrative Driver Clusters\", is admitted to be a \"fundamentally a heuristic design\".\n\n3. The experiment relies on Gemini-2.0-flash only. It is important to see how FinThink works for different LLMs, at least a stronger one.\n\n4. The experimental setup for the cross-asset memory is questionable. The paper mixes TSLA and AMZN data for training and then evaluates the model on these same assets. This methodology is poorly explained and raises serious concerns about potential data leakage, as it fails to test the model's ability to generalize to truly unseen assets.\n\n5. The memory methodology is vague and insufficiently evaluated. The paper states the memory is trained for only 3 epochs, and the process of how \"corrective heuristics\" are precisely extracted from trade cycles is not clearly articulated; it reads more like a narrative than a defined algorithm. Furthermore, the memory component is not directly compared to baseline mechanisms (like FinCon's) and lacks dedicated ablation studies or case studies to validate its specific contribution."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the weaknesses above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "SBoDkjladd", "forum": "vm7xqrU345", "replyto": "vm7xqrU345", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16090/Reviewer_XFbk"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16090/Reviewer_XFbk"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16090/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762016035171, "cdate": 1762016035171, "tmdate": 1762926270726, "mdate": 1762926270726, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
