Existing methods rely on deterministic representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach, UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for large-scale metagenomic analysis.", "tldr": "We introduce the first probabilistic embedding framework for metagenomic binning, modeling each DNA fragment as a probability distribution to capture uncertainty, with closed-form contrastive learning and theoretical guarantees.", "keywords": ["metagenomic binning", "probabilistic embeddings", "dna", "genome"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e8fae6e5db2afe4bd39f0a84319b95407d230681.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/8410d98a177a379a4cf25bc957e8554a7e61a439.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Metagenomics binning is an important step for analyzing microbial communities. It can benefit from a probabilistic clustering approach owing to domain-specific caveats such as inter-species DNA sharing. However existing data-driven approaches (e.g. kmer profiles and foundation model embeddings) produce deterministic embeddings.\n\nTo address this, the authors propose a probabilistic formulation of contrastive learning, where an encoder produces a mean and variance of a latent representation (similar to that of an inference network in classical VAE literature), and a non-Euclidian similarity objective is optimized over (paired) fragmented sequences. Experiments are conducted over established binning benchmarks, showing that a small, trained-from-scratch MLP can be competitive against a much larger, pretrained foundation model (DNABERT-S)."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- Metagenomics binning is a well-motivated scientific problem with important applications, and it's good to see efforts designed at improving this task. \n- I really appreciate the authors' clarity in presenting their main theoretical results, which very clearly demonstrate the impossibility of deterministic embedding in producing the correct clustering, and how a probabilistic approach could fare better.\n- Experimental results are good. A small MLP trained from scratch can match and/or outperform a much larger DNABERT-S finetuned from a capable foundation model (DNABERT-2)"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- I do find the application area to be too siloed in metagenomics applications. While the probabilistic embedding framework is general, the authors should discuss how their approach can be beneficial for the broader scientific ML community, and / or the theoretical contribution is significant / contains deep technical innovations, discussed next.\n- Overall, while the theoretical results are neat and clearly presented, they are primarily derived from existing techniques / known results in probability. \n- On the empirical side, it is good that a small network can outperform specialized foundation models (DNABERT-S), but it does make the scale of experiments a bit lacking. For example, the authors can finetune DNABERT-S with their objective and evaluate whether this objective can bring meaningful improvements from a strong base model. \n- On the other hand, recent works (e.g. [1]) have shown that carefully trained supervised baselines can outperform specialized foundation models in the genomics domain, and it'd be great if the authors can conduct an experiment on their simple MLP, but with the standard contrastive learning objective, and evaluate the model performance on binning benchmarks. This should give us a concrete idea of their objective's benefits.\n\nOverall, I like this work but find it to be a bit too niche for ICLR. \n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02796"}, "questions": {"value": "NA.
