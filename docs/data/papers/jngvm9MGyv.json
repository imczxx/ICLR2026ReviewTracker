This task is termed NFV-RA. Recently, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods have been showing promising potential to address this combinatorial complexity of constrained cross-graph mapping. However, RL-driven NFV-RA research lacks a systematic benchmark for comprehensive simulation and rigorous evaluation. This gap hinders in-depth performance analysis and slows algorithm development for emerging networks, resulting in fragmented assessments. In this paper, we introduce Virne, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to accelerate the research and application of deep RL for NFV-RA. Virne provides customizable simulations for diverse network scenarios, including cloud, edge, and 5G environments. It features a modular and extensible implementation pipeline that integrates over 30 methods of various types. Virne also establishes a rigorous evaluation protocol that extends beyond online effectiveness to include practical perspectives such as solvability, generalizability, and scalability. Furthermore, we conduct in-depth analysis through extensive experiments to provide valuable insights into performance trade-offs for efficient implementation and offer actionable guidance for future research directions. Overall, with its capabilities of diverse simulations, rich implementations, and thorough evaluation, Virne could serve as a comprehensive benchmark for advancing NFV-RA methods and deep RL applications.

More emphasis on real-world network scenarios (such as live 5G networks or dynamic, large-scale production environments) could further strengthen the validity and practical applicability of the framework.\n2. The NFV-RA problem often involves strict resource constraints (e.g., computing power, bandwidth, latency, etc.). RL agents may face challenges when dealing with these constraints, especially as the network scale increases, causing the solution space to grow rapidly and leading to inefficiencies in the agent's learning of optimal strategies. It is recommended to introduce a detailed discussion on handling constraints: further analysis and discussion on how to manage these complex resource constraints during the RL training process.\n3. It is worth discussing how to enhance the agent's transferability across multiple NFV-RA tasks through a multi-task MDP framework or meta-learning.
