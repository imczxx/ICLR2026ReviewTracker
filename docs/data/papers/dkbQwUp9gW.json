While automatic optimization methods exist, they often rely on coarse, task-level outcomes, neglecting the rich trajectory-level information that captures how agents reason, coordinate, and fail. To address this gap, we propose a Trajectory-Aware Verbalized Optimization (TAVO) framework for prompt refinement in multi-agent systems. Inspired by reinforcement learning, TAVO introduces a credit assignment mechanism that decomposes interaction trajectories into sub-trajectories, linking specific reasoning and coordination steps to the final outcome. This generates fine-grained, process-level feedback. By modeling prompts as verbalized policies, TAVO translates this trajectory feedback into concrete editing instructions, which are aggregated across tasks for systematic refinement. Experiments on both collaborative and competitive multi-agent benchmarks demonstrate that our framework enhances system performance while reducing coordination costs, underscoring the value of leveraging trajectory-level signals to construct more adaptive and efficient LLM-based multi-agent systems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Agentic Optimization", "Agentic Evaluation", "Multi-agent System", "verbalized optimization"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/738fd43d7ac0314d4ebbf7c0d24956a83b88dfd8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents TAVO, a framework for optimizing prompts in multi-agent systems by leveraging trajectory-level information.

The proposed \"trajectory-level credit assignment\" approach is highly similar to reflective frameworks such as Reflexion[1], which both use interactive trajectories and feedback from final outcomes for self-correction. This paper refines this approach only by explicitly partitioning trajectories into sub-trajectories, representing an engineering improvement rather than a fundamental innovation.\n2. The paper claims to extend verbal-feedback paradigms to multi-agent settings with role-aware policies (L135). However, it remains unclear what new challenges arise from this extension or how the proposed framework addresses them technically.\n3. The method largely assumes fixed communication topologies and dependency structures, overlooking the causal and dynamic nature of multi-agent optimization (cf. GPT-Swarm [2]). \n4. The horizontal comparison in Table 1 does not convincingly highlight the novelty of TAVO. Claimed features such as “interpretability,” “trajectory-level reasoning,” and “gradient-free optimization” are already present in prior prompt optimization frameworks.\n5. The paper attributes “interpretability, generalizability, and accessibility” to TAVO’s advantages over existing prompt optimization methods (L315–317). However, interpretability and accessibility are not unique to TAVO.\n6. All experiments are conducted on MultiAgentBench and have not been validated on different benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, AgentBench, or complex reasoning environments). Furthermore, the baseline appears to only select single-agent prompt optimization methods and does not include multi-agent optimization frameworks such as GPT-Swarm\n7. The authors claim that “outcome feedback improves process-level milestones but not final performance (L458–460),” yet provide no explanation of why such asymmetry arises. A causal or diagnostic analysis would strengthen the argument.\n8. Key modules—such as the policy-editing suggestions (Sec 4.3)  and aggregated policy refinement (Sec 4.4) components—are not individually ablated, making it difficult to assess their specific contributions.\n9. The paper does not test whether the approach remains effective under changes in the base LLM or initial prompt settings.\n10. Minor issues.

One major limitation of this framework is that all prompts of the LLM-optimizers in TAVO, including the credit assignment agent, have been highly manually engineered (See Appendix D.2), therefore brittle, and appeared to overfit to the task of MultiAgentBench. This raises the concern of the generalization of the framework to other general domains of tasks. In addition, I do not find the proposed approach fundamentally different to the TextGrad methods.\n\n2. Similarly, the evaluation is only conducted on the MultiAgentBench and on a single family of LLM backbone (i.e., GPT4o-mini). It is important to verify the proposed approach in the general domain of reasoning benchmarks, such as SuperGPQA, BBEH, for further validating the effectiveness of the framework.\n\n3. Though I am generally in favor of the credit assignment idea to improve the existing textual gradient prompt optimization approaches, there are many reasoning tasks, such as Math, where the middle stage of reasoning misses the ground truth. Consequently, it is difficult to analyze the faithfulness of intermediate reasoning chains, where the credit assignment is also likely to fail there. The TAVO framework highly relies on a single LLM-optimizer to analyze intermediate reasoning results, which may not be reliable in many scenarios.\n\n4. The implementation details of the baselines are unclear to me. I think the TextGrad is the strongest baseline there, but how is TextGrad implemented in the multi-agent context? The missing implementation details of baselines make the performance improvements by TAVO less convincing. Other automatic multi-agent prompt optimization approaches should be considered, such as MIPROv2 [1] and the symbolic optimizer [2].\n\nSome minor points: I find the connection of TAVO to RL is weak. The credit assignment is a general idea in optimization problems for multi-agent systems. It may be better not to refer to RL that many times in writing.\n\n[1] Opsahl-Ong, K., Ryan, M.
