Yet existing approaches lack both systematic analysis and a generalizable representation of this payload-induced degradation.\nTo address this limitation, we propose GapONet, a payload-conditioned nonlinear operator that maps simulation context functions to residual actions for hardware. We then introduce a payload-aware <collect–analyze–solve> framework to learn this operator GapONet. First, we curate a sim-real paired dataset TWINS spanning multiple payloads, robots, motions, actuation rates, and simulators, comprising more than 11,298 motion sequences. Second, we perform payload-aware system identification to isolate payload-related effects and quantify their contributions, and analyze sim-to-real gaps across different simulators. Third, we train the operator GapONet to predict delta action for real-time, generalized, payload-conditioned compensation. We further introduce actuation functions and sensor predictors, which enable parallel RL training of GapONet with substantially reduced energy consumption.\nWhile tracking unseen motions, GapONet keeps the incidence of large sim-to-real gaps below 0.09%, whereas competing methods remain near 10%. By correcting upper-body gaps, GapONet also stabilizes lower-body locomotion tracking, laying the foundation for improved performance in humanoid loco-manipulation tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Sim-to-real gap", "Nonlinear operator", "Humanoid robot"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a1cb138d84e8e03f495eae300ae405d43ad4157e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/2bd886ced72006ae1f23fd7572ab0e7e8d6acbbe.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a well-motivated study on improving sim-to-real transfer for humanoid robots.

The paper addresses a highly practical challenge in humanoid sim-to-real transfer by explicitly modeling the payload effect not as random noise but as a structured conditioning variable during motion tracking. This perspective is realistic and directly relevant for real-world humanoid deployment.\n2. Building on DeepONet’s operator-learning framework, the paper presents a novel combination between nonlinear operator learning and the sim-to-real transfer process in robotics. It highlights the separable nature of the payload by treating it as the query variable in the operator formulation. Moreover, it introduces an insightful perspective on sim-to-real alignment—modeling the domain gap as a mapping from simulation actuation functions to residual actions, rather than as pointwise corrections.\n3. The paper provides detailed technical descriptions of its data collection pipeline, including the construction of a cross-robot, cross-simulator dataset covering diverse humanoid motions under varying payload conditions.

Why did you choose a reinforcement learning (PPO) algorithm to train GapONet, given that the original DeepONet paper uses supervised learning? The paper does not explain the motivation or provide the formal RL formulation.\n3. In Section 4.3, you claim that computing all sensor values is computationally prohibitive. Could you clarify whether this limitation is due to the RL setup? If so, why is RL used instead of supervised regression?\n4. Why is the default large-gap ratio set to 0.5 rad, especially when Figure 3(b) shows that the typical error is below 0.3 rad?\n5. In Section 3.3.2, you state that the deviation is nonlinear and that phase lag is related to payload. However, the phase difference between sim and real does not necessarily imply delay, and there is no quantitative result showing nonlinearity. Could you clarify this claim?\n6. How did you select the data and motions used in Section 3.3? In Figure 3(b), the deviation at 0 kg payload reaches 0.1 rad, but in Figure 3(c), the inter-simulator joint angles appear much smaller.

While prior work has used residual learning, the application of a payload-conditioned operator network (inspired by Neural Operators) to model the complex, functional relationship of the sim-to-real discrepancy is a novel approach in the context of humanoid robotics. The use of a branch-trunk decomposition to separate the payload-independent dynamics from the payload-dependent non-linearities is a clever architectural choice that enhances generalization. The work is highly significant for the field of sim-to-real transfer, especially for complex, high-DoF systems like humanoids.

While the operator network formulation is the central claim of the paper, the experiments do not sufficiently justify its necessity over a standard, high-capacity Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with the same payload conditioning. The authors should provide an ablation comparing GapONet to a simpler, non-operator network that takes the same inputs (sim context and payload) and outputs the residual action. Without this, it is difficult to ascertain if the performance gain is due to the operator learning formulation or simply the nonlinear, payload-conditioned residual structure.\n\n2. The paper focuses heavily on payload variation. While this is a critical source of non-linearity, the true test of an operator network is its ability to generalize across different functional inputs. The current evaluation only tests generalization across a continuous parameter (payload mass).\n\n3. he paper mentions the curation of the TWINS dataset, which is a major contribution. However, the paper does not explicitly state whether the dataset and the trained GapONet models will be made publicly available. Given the scale and complexity of the data collection, the lack of public release significantly hinders the reproducibility of the results and limits the impact of the dataset contribution.\n\n4. The paper's primary focus is on a model-based correction approach. A key alternative for sim-to-real is robust policy learning via Domain Randomization (DR). The paper should include a more direct and quantitative comparison to a strong DR baseline, where the policy is trained with randomization over the payload range, to demonstrate the superiority of the GapONet correction approach in terms of sample efficiency or final performance."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Ablation on Operator vs. MLP: Could the authors provide an ablation study comparing the proposed GapONet architecture against a standard, high-capacity MLP that is also conditioned on the payload and the simulation context?

Generalization to New Tasks: The current experiments focus on generalization across payload mass for a fixed set of motions. Can the authors comment on or provide results for the generalization of a trained GapONet to a completely new motion or task that was not part of the TWINS training set?\n\n\n3. Computational Overhead: What is the inference time overhead introduced by GapONet on the real hardware? Given that the correction is applied at the control frequency, the latency is critical. Please provide a quantitative measure of the inference time compared to the control loop frequency.\n\n4. Role of the Branch-Trunk Decomposition: The paper mentions the branch-trunk decomposition.
