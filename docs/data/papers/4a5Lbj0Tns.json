This paper introduces a paradigm shift towards insight-exploration-validation, enabling an intelligent and evolutionary exploration of material design pathways. We actualize this paradigm through MatEvolve, a synergistic symbolic–LLM agent that reconceptualizes material design as a closed-loop, programmatic evolution task. Central to MatEvolve is a novel symbolic formalism, Material Edit Language, which empowers the agent to programmatically take chemical operations. The exploration trajectory is directed by a multifaceted guidance strategy, comprising a dynamic knowledge injection mechanism and a two-stage exploration strategy that balances broad exploration and deep optimization. Furthermore, a multi-objective fitness landscape ensures directional and efficient navigational guidance. These integrated strategies contribute to a 32.2% improvement over direct material structure modification. Crucially, comparisons demonstrate that our insight-exploration-validation paradigm outperforms the traditional enumeration-screening approach by 33.6%, highlighting its superior efficacy in navigating vast design spaces.", "tldr": "MatEvolve reframes materials design as closed-loop insight–exploration–validation via a symbolic–LLM agent with MEL, dynamic knowledge injection, and two-stage exploration, achieving >30% gains over enumeration–screening.", "keywords": ["Evolutionary Agents", "AI for Science", "Materials Design"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a97701491d412d3420b796a9d7163eb8b9f4c0e7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes synergistic symbolic LLM framework MatEvolve for material design.

Additionally, the authors curate a knowledge base, in the format of the language, of exemplified edits from the literature. These exemplified edits serve as useful inspiration to guide the design.\n\nThe authors conduct a reasonably comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate the proposed method and compare it with relevant LLM-driven design methods. The ablation study carefully discusses the impacts of the three components of the method: the language, the knowledge base, and the evolution strategy. The authors also demonstrate two practical use cases: designing solid-state electrolytes and cathode materials."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Despite the novelty and good coverage, this paper's contribution is not convincingly strong because of the heavy influence of AlphaEvolve and the unpolished presentation. Specific comments are below.\n\nThe figures that illustrate the proposed method are unintuitive and hard to understand. The overall architecture (Figure 2) is not a workflow but an ensemble of concepts and components. The MEL illustration (Figure 3) is ok. The knowledge injection figure (Figure 4) is very cryptic; the reader does not have a clue what the boxes (such as \"Exp 1\") are and what the number sequences (such as 9, 3, 7, 6, 5, 8) mean. The evolution strategy figure (Figure 5) is also cryptic, especially the \"adaptive steering\" part. Overall, these figures do not help the reader's understanding of the work.\n\nThe section regarding knowledge base construction (Section 3.3.1) can benefit from more elaboration, particularly regarding what efforts are automatic (through LLM prompting) and what are manual. Also, the validation procedure should be given more details, such as what the \"decoder\" is and whether human experts are involved. After all, manually inspecting 200 entries sounds manageable and it is expected that the authors conduct expert validation.\n\nIt would be helpful to discuss the coverage (in terms of the kind of materials) of the 200 entries and their intersection with the two use cases in the paper.\n\nThe presentation of the evolution strategy (Section 3.4.2) is insufficient. The authors would want to discuss (1) what the differentiation is from AlphaEvolve; (2) why not use traditional optimization methods (such as genetic algorithms, Bayesian optimization, or Monte Carlo tree search); and (3) how to deal with multiple objectives. Moreover, the breadth-first and depth-first explorations are also unclear. The authors may write down the overall algorithm, which elucidates these explorations.\n\nIt is controversial whether Table 2 really suggests the superiority of the proposed method MatEvolve. On the one hand, MatEvolve does yield the best scores for the $S_{\\text{val}}$ and $S_{\\text{SSE}}$ metrics. On the other hand, $S_{\\text{SSE}}$ is an aggregate of six metrics and MatEvolve performs worse than screening and LLMatDesign on half of them ($S_{\\text{form}}$, $S_{\\text{highT}}$, and $S_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$). This showcases the danger of using one aggregate metric to replace multiple objectives when comparing methods.\n\nTable 2 is only for the solid-state electrolytes use case. The authors should show a similar table for the other use case (cathode materials).\n\nIn Section 4.2.2, the authors state that \"domain-specific knowledge plays a more decisive role than general coding capability\" (in fact, this is mentioned multiple times in the paper). It is, however, unclear how the authors reach such a conclusion. Among the compared models, no one is known to be trained with more knowledge/data of the use case than are others. Furthermore, all models use the same curated knowledge base. How do the authors reach the conclusion that some models are better than others because they have more domain-specific knowledge?"}, "questions": {"value": "See the Weakness section above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "hGn6QGEVPc", "forum": "4a5Lbj0Tns", "replyto": "4a5Lbj0Tns", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23535/Reviewer_NVU7"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23535/Reviewer_NVU7"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23535/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761855652905, "cdate": 1761855652905, "tmdate": 1762942701382, "mdate": 1762942701382, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents MatEvolve, a symbolic–LLM agent for closed-loop, multi-objective materials design.
