The reported efficiency metrics (e..g., >99% activation sparsity) are highly significant for the target application of on-device learning and data-drift adaptation.\n\n3.  **Rich Ablation Studies:** The paper's claims are well-supported by a comprehensive set of ablation studies.

A key question is whether this framework can be effectively scaled to the fine-tuning of modern, massive-scale models, such as LLMs with >7B parameters? How does the static layer selection and dynamic channel selection interplay in such homogeneous, transformer-heavy architectures?\n\n2.  **Runtime Overhead of Dynamic Selection:** The paper clearly demonstrates the *memory* and *FLOPs* advantages of TraDy. However, it does not discuss the potential *wall-clock time* overhead.
