KD for recommender systems targets at distilling rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our goal of distilling rankings on the teacher's top items. We empirically demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether or not it is ranked high by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

The motivation for model compression in recommendation systems is questionable. Unlike CV/NLP models that require edge deployment, recommendation systems typically operate on cloud infrastructure where model size is rarely a bottleneck. The authors fail to provide compelling evidence that model size poses a significant problem in recommendation scenarios. Without clear justification for why compression is necessary in this cloud-based deployment context, the practical value of this work remains unconvincing.\n2. The teacher models used in this study are relatively modest in size, with the largest containing fewer than 300M parameters. This contradicts the fundamental premise of knowledge distillation, which typically involves compressing truly large, unwieldy models like LLMs or large vision transformers. With teacher models of this scale, standard optimization and deployment techniques should suffice, making the proposed distillation approach potentially unnecessary for the problem at hand.\n3. Current trends in recommendation system distillation focus on using large multimodal models as teachers to guide smaller ID-based models—a more practical scenario given the genuine computational overhead of multimodal architectures. However, this paper exclusively employs ID-only models for both teacher and student, which represents a less compelling use case. The authors should justify this choice or adopt the more realistic multimodal-to-ID distillation setting.\n4. Recent work [1] has demonstrated the effectiveness of Wasserstein distance for knowledge distillation in recommendation systems. However, the authors do not compare their approach against alternative distance metrics, including Wasserstein-based methods. \n\n\n[1] Zhuang, Ziyi, et al. \"Bridging the Gap: Teacher-Assisted Wasserstein Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Multi-Modal Recommendation.\" Proceedings of the ACM on Web Conference 2025. 2025."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

While NDCG is a standard metric for evaluating recommendation performance, it may not be an ideal loss function for distillation purposes. 2) Observation 4.5 is interesting, but it is derived solely from the CiteULike dataset, making the evidence less robust and limiting generalizability. 3) Assumption 4.3 imposes a relatively strong condition that may be difficult to satisfy. Is this assumption strictly necessary to establish the theoretical connection between CE and NDCG? Could weaker or more relaxed conditions be used instead? 4) There appears to be a gap between the theoretical analysis and the proposed method. Does the proposed method strictly satisfy Assumption 4.3? Can the proposed loss function tightly bound the NDCG metric as claimed?\n\n\n2.\tMy another concerns lie on the technical contribution: 1) The theoretical relationship between NDCG and CE loss has been explored in prior work (e.g., [a1]). Connecting NDCG and CE in the specific setting of knowledge distillation may not constitute a highly novel contribution unless unique theoretical challenges are clearly articulated. What are the distinctive theoretical hurdles addressed in this work, and what new insights are provided? 2) The proposed method appears to be a relatively simple distillation trick. While simplicity is not inherently undesirable and sometimes could be a good properties, a deeper theoretical justification is needed to explain why this strategy is particularly effective or elegant for this task. What are the inherent merits or underlying principles that make it well-suited here?\n\n3.\tI also have some minor concerns on the experiments: 1) The baselines are relatively dated (before 2023). Incorporating more recent state-of-the-art methods would strengthen the evaluation. 2) The experiments are conducted only on three datasets. Including more datasets would better. \n\n[a1] On the effectiveness of sampled softmax loss for item recommendation."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "uMPbmrnTea", "forum": "T8xJmykE2H", "replyto": "T8xJmykE2H", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15021/Reviewer_xgs9"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15021/Reviewer_xgs9"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15021/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761992519692, "cdate": 1761992519692, "tmdate": 1762925348905, "mdate": 1762925348905, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
