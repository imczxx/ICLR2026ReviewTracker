However, current RAG-based methods mainly operate on zero-(nodes) and one-dimensional (edges) elements, failing to capture higher-dimensional topological structures, such as cycles, that are essential for identifying critical substructures and modeling complex relational patterns. This limitation hinders the retrieval of high-dimensional topological characteristics and weakens reasoning over graphs with complex higher-order interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel Retrieved Cellular Topologies-Augmented Graph Learning Framework (ReTAG), that leverages cellular complexes to model and retrieve multi-dimensional topology-aware subgraphs, termed cellular topologies. These structures encode multi-dimensional topological interactions across nodes, edges, and higher-dimensional cells. During inference, ReTAG retrieves cellular topologies based on their topological and semantic alignment with the input graph, and integrates them via a multi-dimensional topological message-passing mechanism that enables effective propagation of topological information across dimensions. Experiments on node classification, link prediction, and graph classification show ReTAG outperforms existing methods.
