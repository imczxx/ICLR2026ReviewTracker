While recent advances in neurosymbolic reasoning and object-centric learning bring us closer to this goal, existing systems rely either on object-level supervision or on a predefined decomposition of the input into objects. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic formulation for learning object-centric representations directly from raw unstructured perceptual data and using only distant supervision. We instantiate this approach in DeepObjectLog, a neurosymbolic model that integrates a perceptual module, which extracts relevant object representations, with a symbolic reasoning layer based on probabilistic logic programming. By enabling sound probabilistic logical inference, the symbolic component introduces a novel learning signal that further guides the detection of meaningful objects in the input. We evaluate our model across a diverse range of generalization settings, including unseen object compositions, unseen tasks, and unseen number of objects.

The authors aim to bridge the gap between perception (inferring objects from images) and reasoning (logical inference over those objects) in order to achieve systematic generalization beyond the training distribution. In particular, they consider tasks where supervision is only given as high-level labels (distant supervision), such as the sum of digits in an image or the category of a hand of cards, rather than any annotations of individual objects.\n\nMain Contributions: (1) The paper highlights limitations of prior neural and neurosymbolic models, which either required object-level supervision or assumed a fixed, known decomposition of the input. It proposes a new probabilistic generative formulation that learns object-centric representations directly from raw images with only task-level (distant) supervision. (2) It instantiates this formulation in the DeepObjectLog architecture, combining slot-based neural perception with probabilistic logic programming (ProbLog) for end-to-end differentiable reasoning. This design satisfies key requirements: handling a variable number of objects, reasoning under uncertainty, and inducing relational structure without direct object labels. (3) The authors introduce new benchmark tasks to evaluate relational generalization under weak supervision, including a MultiMNIST addition task (sum of digits in an image), a CLEVR-Addition task (adding counts of objects in paired images), and a newly created PokerRules dataset (classifying poker hands from images of playing cards). These tasks are specifically designed to test generalization to unseen object combinations, unseen object counts, and even novel task rules or classes not encountered in training. (4) Comprehensive experiments show that DeepObjectLog consistently outperforms baseline methods – both purely neural models and prior neurosymbolic approaches – especially in out-of-distribution generalization settings. The model is able to generalize to novel combinations of familiar objects, new object categories, and larger numbers of objects more robustly than the baselines, while also providing interpretable object-level predictions."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.  Innovative Neurosymbolic Integration: The paper successfully combines slot-based object-centric perception with probabilistic logic programming. This is a novel integration – prior works did not achieve end-to-end training of object discovery guided by logical reasoning.\n2. Effective Use of Distant Supervision: DeepObjectLog learns from only high-level task labels (distant supervision) and avoids any direct supervision on object existence or identity. This weakly-supervised paradigm is very appealing – it means the model can be trained on data where only aggregate or logical labels are provided.\n3. Strong Generalization Performance: A major strength is the model’s performance on out-of-distribution generalization tests. DeepObjectLog dramatically outperforms baseline models in all the evaluated scenarios."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Dependence on Provided Logical Rules: A potential weakness is that the approach requires expert-defined logical rules for each new task. The logic component is not learned from data; it must be coded (in ProbLog) to describe the task’s outcome in terms of object properties.\n2. Scalability and Complexity: The integration with probabilistic logic programming can introduce computational overhead. ProbLog, while efficient for moderate-scale inference, may struggle as the number of objects or logical facts grows large. The paper’s experiments involve at most 4–6 objects (cards or digits) and relatively simple rules. It is unclear how well the method scales to scenes with, say, dozens of objects or highly complex rule sets.\n3. Synthetic Data and Visual Complexity: All evaluation tasks are on synthetic or simplistic visual data – e.g., MNIST digits on blank backgrounds, rendered CLEVR objects, and playing card images on a plain background. While this is suitable for controlled experiments, it leaves open the question of how the method handles more complex real-world images (with clutter, occlusion, varying backgrounds, etc.). \n4. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The approach introduces a few new hyperparameters – notably the maximum number of slots $N$."}, "questions": {"value": "1. In the PokerRules experiment, the model was tested on an unseen hand type (“three of a kind”) and achieved 72% accuracy OOD. Could you clarify how this was handled in terms of the logic program and training? Specifically, was the logical rule for detecting a “three of a kind” included in the model from the start, or introduced only at test time? If the rule was added at test time, it’s impressive that the model adapts; however, how was the model’s output space configured to allow a new class it never saw during training (did the output simply come from the logic query without needing a dedicated neural output)? A detailed explanation of how novel classes are introduced and whether any fine-tuning is required would be helpful.\n2. How does the training and inference time scale with the number of slots (objects) and the complexity of the logic program? For instance, if we were to increase $N$ or add more complex rules (say involving all pairs of objects or higher-order relations), does the inference via ProbLog become a bottleneck? The current tasks have relatively small $N$ (up to 5 objects). It would be useful if you could comment on any experiments or observations about performance as $N$ grows. Additionally, do you use any optimizations for the logic module (e.g., caching of inference results, using the structure of the logic to prune possibilities) during learning? Understanding the computational limits will inform how far this approach might scale to more complex scenes.\n3. To disentangle where the gains come from, did you consider a variant of the model that does not use the logical loss but still uses the slot-based architecture (for example, training the slots + classifier purely on predicting the global label, akin to a black-box neural network without logic)?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "1ZZdqKwz2G", "forum": "XInaErAeu4", "replyto": "XInaErAeu4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12454/Reviewer_Nexu"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12454/Reviewer_Nexu"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12454/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761719849206, "cdate": 1761719849206, "tmdate": 1762923334240, "mdate": 1762923334240, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes DeepObjectLog, a neurosymbolic architecture that couples an object-centric perceptual module (Slot Attention) with probabilistic logic programming (ProbLog) to learn from distant supervision: only global task labels and a logic program, with no object-level annotations.

In Line 72 it is stated that OC models often rely on object-level supervision, either a label or annotation for each object. This is not true. Slot Attention is a similarity-based method that works like a soft k-means [14], and is generally trained fully unsupervised with a decoder and a reconstruction loss. The only information Slot-Attention–based OC models require beforehand is the number of slots (i.e., objects), which has been a downside shown to cause over- or under-segmentation [1]. However, [2, 3] address this limitation and show on-par or better performance compared with plain Slot Attention. I would appreciate it if the authors could elaborate.\n2. Line 131: it is claimed that without logical feedback, current OC models cannot learn from relational structure unless it is explicitly specified. That is not accurate. Several works evaluate OC models on a wide range of downstream reasoning tasks, from RL to VQA, in both in-distribution [4, 5] and out-of-distribution [6] settings, showing that OC representations capture relational information well and can be on par with foundation models for ID and compositional OOD performance.\n3. I would like to see DINOSAUR-like OC models [7], where a pretrained backbone provides representations to Slot Attention and reconstruction is done in latent space. I would also like to see the performance of a plain foundation model (e.g., DINOv3) with a small projection layer for the task as another baseline. With these additions, I believe the paper would become more relevant to a larger community.\n4. Several claims and benefits of the proposed approach are already well-known, and some are properties of Slot Attention which are well-known in the OC community. For example, test-time generalizability of Slot Attention to different numbers of objects and out-of-distribution generalization of OC models have been analyzed in [6, 13]. Furthermore, several works have shown the shortcomings of VLMs on compositional generalization tasks [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. I would appreciate it if the authors could elaborate on these works and how the paper relates to these prior works. Additionally, please elaborate on what are the implications and novel insights of the work and the impact the authors would expect for the community.\n5. Regarding weakness #3, how sensitive is performance to inaccurate or incomplete logic rules (e.g., missing predicates, conflicting constraints)?
