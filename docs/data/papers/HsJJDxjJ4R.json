Cell perturbation prediction is a major experimental challenge and has motivated substantial research in machine learning for biology. In this work, we generated a multimodal benchmark dataset that captures the dynamic response of human fibroblasts to transient transcription factor perturbations. We performed time-series live cell imaging with fluorescent cell cycle reporters over 72 hours and collected long-read single-cell RNA sequencing data from the same population of cells. We release the processed dataset, preprocessing pipelines and benchmarking code along with the evaluation of existing models using our data as ground truth. This work supports the development and evaluation of machine learning methods for modeling dynamical systems from multimodal datasets. HYPED consists of RNA sequencing data from approximately 20,000 cells and 203 imaging timepoints across four experimental conditions, totaling 2030 imaging frames.

The dataset will be valuable for benchmarking multimodal and temporal machine learning approaches.

Most existing datasets use CRISPR or viral integration which permanently alters DNA, and the authors make a convincing case for why this matters clinically and scientifically.\n* The long-read sequencing is a nice touch. Being able to capture full-length transcripts and isoform diversity goes beyond what standard short-read scRNA-seq provides.

They benchmark Geneformer and GEARS on sequencing and FM2S on imaging, but these are all unimodal evaluations. The whole point of collecting both modalities should be to enable multimodal learning, but there's no demonstration of this. What does jointly modeling imaging and transcriptomics buy you? Can you predict sequencing from imaging or vice versa? Can multimodal models better predict perturbation outcomes? Without answering these questions, I'm left wondering if the multimodal aspect is actually useful.\n* The scope is quite limited, only three perturbation conditions (plus control) on one cell type. I understand this is acknowledged in the limitations, but it raises questions about whether this dataset is substantial enough for training modern foundation models or even properly evaluating perturbation prediction methods. \n* The imaging is continuous over 72 hours, but sequencing happens at a single endpoint (48h). How do you connect individual cells imaging trajectories to their transcriptomic states? You can't directly match them since sequencing destroys cells. The paper mentions collecting from \"the same population\" but doesn't explain how you'd actually use both modalities together for a single cell. This seems like a fundamental challenge for multimodal modeling that's just glossed over."}, "questions": {"value": "* Why are the cosine similarities so high (>0.95) in the benchmarking? Does this suggest the perturbations are subtle, or that current models are already quite good at this task, or something about the evaluation setup?\n* Can you clarify the temporal alignment between modalities? Since sequencing requires lysing cells while imaging is non-destructive, how would a multimodal model actually use both data types for the same cell? Is the idea that you learn population-level associations, or is there a way to track specific cells?\n* What specific multimodal learning tasks do you envision for this dataset? Can you predict imaging phenotypes from transcriptomics or vice versa?
