We demonstrate that if we have access to the distribution of a structural causal model, and additional data from  *only two* environments that sufficiently differ in the noise statistics, the unique causal graph is identifiable. Notably, this is the first result in the literature that guarantees the entire causal graph recovery with a constant number of environments and arbitrary nonlinear mechanisms. Our only constraint is the Gaussianity of the noise terms; however, we propose potential ways to relax this requirement. Of interest on its own, we expand on the well-known duality between independent component analysis (ICA) and causal discovery; recent advancements have shown that nonlinear ICA can be solved from multiple environments, at least as many as the number of sources: we show that the same can be achieved for causal discovery while having access to much less auxiliary information.", "tldr": "We show that the causal graphs of structural causal models with arbitrary mechanisms are uniquely identifiable from the auxiliary information of only two environments.

It is good as long as we can identify more than from only one environment (e.g.,  the CPDAG).  The goal is not the exact DAG recovery at any cost, but rather to make full use of available information in practice.

The dependence of this number to the graph size is not a bad thing.

The setting in the simulation results is overly simplified, as it only considers a graph with two variables. In this case, the graph structure only has three possible configurations, making the recovery task much easier.
