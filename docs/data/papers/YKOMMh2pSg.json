Robust reinforcement learning (RRL) tackles this challenge by optimizing policies against the worst-case scenario defined within an uncertainty set. However, RRL remains impractical due to the cost of the Max-Min optimization, where it suffers from the query complexity for exhaustively finding the worst-case (dubbed ‘Min’) within the uncertainty set 𝒰, i.e., O(|𝒰|). By viewing this via a lens of quantum perspective, we raise a pivotal question: If we can query from the environment with quantum superpositions, is it possible to accelerate the Max-Min optimization of RRL? Our answer is ‘Yes’. Our method, called quantum robust inner minimization (QRIM), encodes the uncertainty set with quantum superposition and amplifies low-return cases, thus enabling RL for solving the robust (i.e., worst-case) Bellman equation. Importantly, QRIM achieves a quadratic speed-up in query complexity without altering the outer RL pipeline, i.e., O(√|𝒰|). In both classical emulation of the quantum-access oracle and full quantum routines, QRIM learns more robust policies for unseen task variations than classical RL methods, while achieving a quadratic reduction in query complexity compared to classical RRL methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning", "Quantum computing"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/76affc29e4524aeb8c9124d53e00f083271ab9ec.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work deals with the potential benefits of quantum computing for RL.
