The motivation of the proposed approach from the biological mechanisms suffers from the absence of formal convergence proofs or any analytical intuition why the proposed pipeline corresponds to the minimization of classification error on the test set.\n2. The main ingredients have clear analogues in the BP-based methods (adaptive learning rates, tricky initializations, and specific update rules); however, no comparison with existing alternatives is presented. I see many \"yet another\" instances of the classical ingredients for the learning pipeline, without any theoretical proof of why they are better than existing ones. Even the reported results of the ablation study are insufficient since the predefined hyperparameters are used, and no recipe for searching them in other tasks is discussed.    \n3. The proposed approach has a lot of hyperparameters, which make it less portable to other datasets and models (MLP with different numbers of layers), e.g. $\\varepsilon$ in (2), $\\lambda$ in (6), $\\tau$ in (10), $K$ in (11), $p$ in (12), $\\gamma$ in (17), etc \n4. Although the use of edge devices is the key feature of the presented study, the applications selected for experiments are relatively standard. I am not sure that learning the image classifier on the Raspberry Pi or similar chips is the most popular way to use such devices. Such inconsistency makes the reported results less impressive and raises many questions regarding the target use cases.\n5. The proposed approach demonstrates a uniform accuracy drop for the considered datasets; therefore, a comparison with other strategies to reduce memory footprint is necessary. Probably using mixed precision, low-rank approximations, model distillation, or other techniques can provide a similar memory footprint while maintaining or improving test accuracy. More experiments are needed here.    \n6. Moreover, I see that prospective learning is a much slower approach than BP-based learning, so I would like to see the discussion on why the memory efficiency is more critical than training duration for the considered setup of exploiting an edge device."}, "questions": {"value": "See the weaknesses above. \n\nIn addition, please comment on the following questions.\n1. Why were the considered datasets selected for benchmarking? I can imagine a promising application of using a prospective learning approach on edge devices is online voice processing or image segmentation in an autonomous vehicle. Both settings also require fine-tuning to the new data.\n2. What is \"FastOrthogonalize\" procedure?\n3. What numerical algorithm was used to solve (6)?
