The motivation connects well to the later design of the RLPIR algorithm.\n- **Efficiency.** RLPIR achieves a substantial 6.96× reduction in training time compared to RLVR while maintaining comparable accuracy. The prefix rollout design reduces long-horizon credit assignment and training instability by focusing on the most critical early decision tokens. This leads not only to faster training but also to shorter and more efficient reasoning trajectories at inference time.\n- **Generalization.** The method demonstrates transferability across multiple model families (Llama, Qwen2.5, Qwen3) and task domains (general and math). This prefix rollout design avoids overfitting to specific solutions and promotes better cross-domain generalization. RLPIR also offers a promising path for applying RLVR to domains where verifiable signals are hard to access or unavailable."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **Overlap with existing work.** The core idea of prefix-based optimization and its motivation are largely inherited from the prior work [1], **where similar findings on prefix consistency and prefix finetuning have already been established.** This paper mainly revalidates those insights and designs an RL-based training algorithm, in contrast to the original SFT formulation in the previous study. As a result, the conceptual originality is somewhat reduced, and the contribution lies more in integration and empirical verification rather than in introducing a fundamentally new algorithmic innovation.\n- **Incomplete and unstable results.** The main results in Table 3 **omit** RLVR baselines for the Llama3.1 and Qwen2.5 models, making it difficult to consistently assess the relative gains. Moreover, since these models often produce outputs shorter than Qwen3 (thinking), additional evidence is needed to support the claimed efficiency benefits of applying 512 token prefix rollouts to them. Most analyses (Sections 7.3, 8.1–8.3) rely on the Qwen3-8B that is a **“thinking”** model, which tends to generate extremely long reasoning output; thus, the reported improvements may not generalize to non-reasoning models such as Qwen2.5-Instruct or even Qwen3-Base.\n- **Hyperparameter dependence.** The method’s performance is sensitive to the choice of prefix length, as shown in Section 8.1, and different models may require distinct optimal prefix settings (more results are needed here). This suggests that prefix length functions as a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned, therefore limiting the practical usability of RLPIR across diverse settings. Developing an adaptive or self-scheduled prefix selection mechanism could help mitigate this limitation and enhance the framework’s robustness and applicability.\n\n[1] The First Few Tokens Are All You Need: An Efficient and Effective Unsupervised Prefix Fine-Tuning Method for Reasoning Models.

Penalize the diverse outputs may be helpful for math tasks, as shown in the recent works that RLVR always decrease the output entropy[1,3], and accelerate this process may make model converge faster[2]. RLPIR looks also accelerate this process. But it's not definitely helpful for long-term training. Especially it's not applicable for open-ended problems or long-form generation tasks, also limit its influence. (paper only discuss on math training set)\n4. Maybe you could compare the pass@k performance between RLVR/RLPIR/original model, I think RLPIR may increase slower as k increases since it encourages more consistent output.\n5.
