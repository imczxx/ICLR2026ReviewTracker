A key challenge, especially in high-dimensional settings, is to determine the mixture order and estimate the mixture parameters. We study the problem of approximating a target measure, available only through finitely many of its moments, by a mixture of distributions from a parametric family (e.g., Gaussian, exponential, Poisson), with approximation quality measured by the 2-Wasserstein ($\\operatorname{W2}$) or the total variation ($\\operatorname{TV}$) distance. Unlike many existing approaches, the parameter set is not assumed to be finite; it is modeled as a compact basic semi-algebraic set. We introduce a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations with asymptotic convergence to the desired optimal value. In addition, when a certain rank condition is satisfied, the convergence is even finite and recovery of an optimal mixing measure is obtained.\nWe also present an application to clustering, where our framework serves either as a stand-alone method or as a preprocessing step that yields both the number of clusters and strong initial parameter estimates, thereby  accelerating convergence of standard (local) clustering algorithms.", "tldr": "Mixtures Closest To A Given Measure: A Semidefinite Programming Approach", "keywords": ["Polynomial Optimization", "Mixture models", "Semidefinite Programming", "Clustering"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ee1ddcf4c5ddd38b92a12c4d1452d74d9974ad85.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/0a32c3767eb6e75f55b6f486dfdc93f2f83bcf9b.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper applies a recently published approach to the approximation of W1 and TV distances between measures (Laserre 2024) to the specific case of approximating a given density by a finite mixture.

Second, the benefit of using the method in an ML application is questionable. The experiments in the paper (using the method to initialize EM) show a decrease in the number of iterations required to achieve convergence but given the high computational cost of computing the initialization it is not clear that this is an attractive method for practitioners: I assume almost any practitioner would prefer to run EM for more iterations instead of solving an SDP.  \n\nAnother issue of relevance is the reliance on TV and W1 metrics.

While I think that this is certainly a very interesting line of research, understanding this paper in detail requires an in-depth understanding of previous works.\n\n- Structure: Choosing Wasserstein and TV seems somewhat arbitrary at first glance. While it makes sense given the existing literature, it would make sense to discuss potential extensions to MMD, sliced Wasserstein and other divergences.\n\n- Mathematical statements in the main text are not formulated very clearly, e.g., Thm 1. While the supplementary provides an exact formulation, the formulations in the main text seem rather vague.\n\n- Line 187: “ The optimization problem in (7) is formulated over\nprobability measures, making it infinite-dimensional, and thus intractable in its original form.” Note that this might be somewhat misleading since parametric mixtures and empirical measures are not infinite-dimensional. Maybe the conditions should be specified.\n\n- lines 255-257: “However, the sample size $N$ is often large enough, and therefore, by the law of large numbers, the difference between empirical and true population moments is negligible.” I think that the joint estimation of all moments depends on the ambient dimension $d$. Therefore, the phrase in the paper might be misleading, i.e., $N$ would have to be *very* large in high dimensions. Please comment on the potential impact of the curse of dimensionality.\n\n*Numerical Evaluation*:\n\n- The paper ‘Sliced Wasserstein Distance for Learning Gaussian Mixture Models’ (Kolouri et a., 2017) proposes another method to fit Gaussian mixtures with a (sliced) Wasserstein distance. While there are key differences, I think that this is a relevant reference and that there should be a numerical comparison between this method and the proposed one. Similarly, the cited paper ‘Learning Gaussian Mixtures using the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Gradient Flow’ (Yan et al., 2024) learns Gaussian mixtures using the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry, and I would have appreciated a numerical comparison.\n\n- Figure 1: This is an interesting visualization, but then again, many methods have been proposed to curb the number of mixture components. Moreover, the regularization term works as a kind of prior on the component number. Thus, a comparison with Bayesian mixture techniques (Richardson et al., 1997; Nobile, 2005; Miller et al., 2018) would have made more sense.\n\n- Figure 2: Please note that k-means is a highly efficient and fast algorithm and that there exist many fast and effective initialization heuristics beyond ‘random’ ones. Moreover, there is no clear advantage of ‘TV’-initialization in general and no clear advantage of ‘Wasserstein’-initialization for large ‘mixture indices’. Moreover, the runtime of initialization+K-means should be reported since this is the value that is actually interesting in practice. \n- Figure 3: This experiment gives no additional insight beyond the ones presented in Figure 2. Projecting MNIST onto 2 dimensions is not really a high-dimensional experiment.\n- Gaussian mixtures allow for very nice visualizations in 2D. Therefore, I would have appreciated a density heatmap or a similar plot that showcases the behaviour of the Wasserstein-optimal vs. the TV-optimal vs the KL-optimal (obtained via EM) mixtures for a fixed number of components. Given that the paper focuses on such settings, readers would have gained a more intuitive understanding. \n\n\n*Conclusion*:\nDespite the interesting theoretical background, the paper suffers from a lack of realistic high-dimensional experiments, comparative/ablation studies, and visual intuition. Moreover, the contents of this paper are not presented in a very accessible manner and are hard to follow for readers who are not familiar with (Lasserre, 2009, 2015, 2024a, 2024b). I would recommend that the authors add more visual studies and investigate the adaptation of their optimality formulations to higher dimensions. Personally, I would find a thorough investigation of the interplay between KL, Wasserstein, and TV optimality for 2d mixtures highly interesting."}, "questions": {"value": "- I would have been interested in the impact of optimizing a given divergence on another divergence. What is the interplay of TV and Wasserstein?

I feel as if this is closer to the presented work since a regularization term/component number prior is used. \n\n- What is the impact of varying the regularization?

While they are not meant to fit mixtures, they are meant to compare between a target and a reference mixture. Did you consider metrics of this kind for your evaluation?
