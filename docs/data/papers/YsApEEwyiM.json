The proposed method primarily reuses the standard HDC pipeline (encoding → bundling → similarity search), with only moderate extension via cluster aggregation. There is no clear conceptual innovation beyond applying HDC to biomedical data, which makes the contribution more application-level than methodological.\n2. The paper does not fundamentally address the long-standing issue that HDC-based models often underperform deep neural networks in complex, high-dimensional feature spaces. While the reported 1% gap to Bayesian ResNet is notable, it is unclear whether this holds across more challenging datasets or higher intra-class variability.\n3. In practical HDC implementations, the encoding stage (mapping raw features into hypervectors via item memory or continuous item memory) dominates both latency and energy consumption. However, the paper omits reporting encoding cost or how the chosen encoder scales in time, memory, and energy. This is a critical omission because the efficiency advantage may vanish once encoding overhead is included.\n4. The paper fixes the hypervector dimension and precision but does not explore how these parameters affect accuracy, energy, or latency. Such analysis is crucial, as HDC accuracy is highly sensitive to dimensionality and quantization (binary vs. int8 vs. float32). Without this exploration, the claimed “energy efficiency” lacks reproducibility and generalization.\n5. The reported 350× efficiency improvement appears to be a theoretical estimate rather than measured on actual hardware (e.g., MCU, FPGA, or ASIC). Without concrete energy profiling of encoding, similarity computation, and memory access, the practical significance of this number is uncertain.\n6. The experiments are limited to a small set of biomedical datasets (e.g., heart sound classification). Comparisons exclude other lightweight neural or neuromorphic baselines such as quantized CNNs, TinyML architectures, or SNN-based classifiers, which would provide a fairer context for energy–accuracy trade-offs."}, "questions": {"value": "see weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["Yes, Privacy, security and safety"]}, "rating": {"value": 0}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "czh9Cv3qGY", "forum": "YsApEEwyiM", "replyto": "YsApEEwyiM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8914/Reviewer_1EHd"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8914/Reviewer_1EHd"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8914/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761791894653, "cdate": 1761791894653, "tmdate": 1762920665633, "mdate": 1762920665633, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents HDC-X, which leverages hyperdimensional computing to enable lightweight medical data classification.

The encoding, training (bundling), and retraining methods that are presented in this paper are not new, which are from VoiceHD (Imani 2017) and HDCluster (Imani 2019), etc, so I am not very convinced about the novelty of this work. \n2. The target task can be very easy to achieve with small and lightweight DNNs, but the baseline DNNs seem to be very heavy. Also, at the inference time, the DNN can be compressed with lower precision for better efficiency. \n3. Baseline implementation details, such as HDC, HDCluster, etc, are not very clear, and I think the authors should present HDC-X's difference over baselines, especially HDC-based ones.\n4.
