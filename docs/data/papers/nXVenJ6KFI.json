However, due to the risk of negative transfer between mismatched tasks, the effectiveness of MTL hinges on identifying which tasks should be learned together. In this paper, we show that for tabular datasets, this affinity between a pair of tasks can be predicted based on static features that characterize the relationship between the datasets of these tasks. Specifically, we show that we can train a regression model for predicting pairwise task affinity based on computationally efficient features, requiring ground-truth affinity values for only a small, random sample of task pairs to generalize across all possible pairs. We demonstrate on three benchmark tabular datasets that our proposed approach can predict affinity more accurately at lower computational cost than existing methods for identifying task affinity, which treat task data as black boxes and require training-based signals. Our work provides a practical and scalable solution to task grouping for MTL, enabling its effective application to tabular datasets with large numbers of tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Machine Learning", "Multi-Task Learning", "Task Affinity", "AutoML"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1c2e2ac7388d9dd5f6df5b94a04e49512fd5dde8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/bf6b9ee2d68189b549f212648896a6b33d00d6f6.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a feature-based approach for predicting pairwise task affinity in multi-task learning (MTL) for tabular datasets."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper includes evaluation on three different benchmark datasets with different characteristics, and the experiments cover multiple aspects including prediction accuracy, computational cost, and downstream task grouping performance."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The biggest limitation is that this approach only works for tabular datasets with shared input dimensions. The authors acknowledge this (line 64-: \"We assume a common input dimension p across all tasks\"), but this severely limits applicability. Most interesting MTL problems in computer vision or NLP don't have this property. The paper should discuss more clearly when this assumption holds and provide examples beyond the three benchmarks tested.\n2. The paper is quite empirical. While the hypothesis that \"tasks with more similar data distributions benefit from joint training\" is intuitive, there's little theoretical justification for why these specific features should predict MTL gains. Some analysis connecting feature values to properties that affect gradient-based optimization or representation learning would strengthen the work.\n3.

These include measures of dataset size, input-space distances, distributional divergence (e.g., energy distance, feature mean gaps), and representation similarity (e.g., cosine similarity, PCA alignment). \n- The authors construct pairwise feature vectors from these metrics and train a quadratic regression model to predict MTL gains, defined as the relative improvement in task performance when trained jointly versus independently. Crucially, the model is trained only on a small subset of task pairs with known ground-truth MTL gains. \n\nThe framework was tested on three standard tabular MTL benchmarks, School, Chemical, and Landmine datasets. The proposed model outperformed prior task-affinity estimation methods, such as TAG (gradient-based affinity estimation) and GRAD-TAE (gradient-projection model), in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. For example, the proposed method achieved correlations up to 0.58 with true MTL gains on the Landmine dataset, while requiring only a fraction of the training time needed by baselines.
