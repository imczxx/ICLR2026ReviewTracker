We introduce nonlinear causal sparse-smooth network, a framework that decomposes high-dimensional industrial forecasting into interpretable sparse-smooth feature extraction followed by nonlinear prediction. Unlike black-box deep learning approaches that use all sensors indiscriminately, our method automatically identifies critical sensor subsets while learning smooth temporal filters that reflect physical process dynamics. We cast this as a structured optimization problem with sparsity penalties for sensor selection and smoothness regularization for temporal patterns, unified within an identifiable Wiener model architecture. Theoretically, we prove convergence guarantees, establish sensor selection consistency, and derive generalization bounds that explicitly account for the interplay between sparsity, smoothness, and nonlinearity. On a challenging industrial refinery benchmark, our structured approach achieves a 25.2% lower error rate than state-of-the-art Transformer models, while simultaneously identifying a sparse subset of critical sensors and their interpretable dynamic modes. Our work demonstrates that incorporating strong, domain-aware inductive biases into a structured architecture offers a powerful alternative to monolithic black-box models for real-world industrial forecasting.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Industrial Time Series Forecasting", "Sparse Learning", "Temporal Regularization", "Interpretable Machine Learning", "Nonlinear System Identification"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d744f82b6a34a770e29fed5fafa8d14f82db10ef.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focuses on time series modeling for industrial time series.

For example, the model name is nonlinear causal sparse-smooth network. Causality is a statistical term with strict demand of formal analysis and assumptions. From the paper I do not see even the fundamental assumptions of causal analysis (e.g., unconfoundedness assumption, positivity assmption). Moreover, identification property is not analyzed or even discussed but it is the core of causal analysis methods.\n- The solution process and its analysis is highly relevant to ADMM. Clarification and reference are needed.\n- The conclusion should include a critical discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and, based on these, propose future research directions aimed at addressing the identified shortcomings.\n- The authors identify three challenges—correlated sensors (variables), complex nonlinear dynamics, and interpretability—and claim these are unique to industrial time-series forecasting (TSF). However, these issues are prevalent across general TSF and broader machine learning contexts, and thus may not be unique to industrial applications.\n- Furthermore, the connection between the proposed method’s components and the stated challenges remains unclear. The authors should explicitly explain how each component is designed to address a specific challenge and substantiate these claims with empirical evidence (e.g., ablation or hyperparameter studies) and theoretical justification.\n\nExperiments.\n- Reproducibility. The dataset used for experiments seems not available. The code is not provided either.\n- Coverage. The experiments rely solely on a private dataset, which limits the generalizability and comparability of the results. Time-series forecasting research typically requires evaluation on diverse public datasets—such as ETT, Electricity, and PEMS04—many of which are industrial in nature. Moreover, numerous public industrial datasets are readily available, as confirmed through a simple search by the reviewer (not necessarily concrete). The absence of experiments on these datasets raises concerns regarding the breadth and representativeness of the experimental design.\n- Baselines. The selected baselines (e.g., ridge regression, LASSO, SVR) are outdated and insufficient for benchmarking modern time-series forecasting methods. The most recent baseline included, the Transformer, became outdated before 2020. Between 2020 and 2025, deep learning has driven significant advancements in time-series forecasting, exemplified by models such as TimeBridge (2025), CycleNet (2025), iTransformer (2024), P-sLSTM (2025), MixMamba (2024), and SparseTSF (2025). Furthermore, large language model (LLM)-based approaches, including TEST and Time-LLM, have emerged for zero-shot and few-shot forecasting. These models should have been incorporated to align the study with the contemporary research landscape. Authors should also investigate these literature from the beginning of their research program."}, "questions": {"value": "Please kindly see the weakness window."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "KswPPKHhpN", "forum": "8X0VgAQJMF", "replyto": "8X0VgAQJMF", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12294/Reviewer_4HoE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12294/Reviewer_4HoE"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12294/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761620286285, "cdate": 1761620286285, "tmdate": 1762923224348, "mdate": 1762923224348, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes NL-CS3, a framework that decomposes industrial time series forecasting into sparse-smooth feature extraction followed by nonlinear mapping.
