We formalize a capacity-1 spike-retiming threat model with a unified trio of budgets: per-spike jitter ($\\mathcal{B}{\\infty}$), total shift ($\\mathcal{B}{1}$), and tamper count ($\\mathcal{B}{0}$). \nFeasibility requires timeline consistency and non-overlap, which makes the problem discrete and constrained. \nTo optimize such retimings at scale, we use projected-in-the-loop (PIL) optimization: shift-probability logits yield a differentiable soft retiming for backpropagation, and a strict projection in the forward pass produces a feasible discrete schedule that satisfies capacity-1, non-overlap, and the chosen budget at every step. \nThe objective maximizes task loss on the projected input and adds a capacity regularizer together with budget-aware penalties, which stabilizes gradients and aligns optimizing with evaluation. \nAcross event-driven benchmarks (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST) and diverse SNN architectures, we evaluate under binary and integer event grids and various retiming budgets, and also demonstrate effectiveness on adversarially trained models designed to counter timing-only attacks.\nFor example, on DVS-Gesture the attack attains high success (over 90\\%) while touching fewer than 2\\% of spikes under $\\mathcal{B}_{0}$.\nTaken together, our results show that spike retiming is a practical and stealthy attack surface that current defenses struggle to counter, setting a clear reference for temporal robustness in event-driven SNNs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["spiking neural networks", "event dataset", "snn", "attacks", "adversarial attacks"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9071c5d05f793c2263a3c446818b95e9ff4e70cf.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work introduces a timing-only adversarial attack on event data in the white-box, untargeted setting.

Without contrast, the method's performance lacks an anchor point. Moreover, the paper already cites two methods for the raw even attack. The authors are encouraged to appropriately compare the proposed method with them. \n\t> I understand the method is formulated under a new constraint; it might not be possible to enforce the baseline to obey the same constraint. However, a curve of Acc vs. constraint budget (with the baseline method shown as a horizontal line) might be straightforward for comparison, and the proposed method excels across a broader range of constraint budgets. \n2. *Lack of realistic consideration*. Lines 53-66 compose the motivation part of the spiking retiming attack. The authors state that retiming spikes is more realistic and harder to catch with intensity-based checks, since the sensors themselves exhibit jitter and latency. This is true. However, in such cases, filtering methods will be used for preprocessing to remove noisy events. *Therefore, whether these simple methods can filter out adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.* \n3. *Low performance under targeted attack*. First, in a targeted attack, the target labels are usually randomly selected, and results are averaged across different seeds. Selecting 0 as the target label produces bias in the evaluation. Second, the ASR is really low, especially under the integer grid. Also, similar to W.1, there is no comparison of baseline methods, so we don't know whether it is intrinsically problematic for a targeted attack or an issue with the proposed method. The authors are encouraged to increase the budget to provide a curve like W.1, along with comparisons of other baseline methods to illustrate the position of the proposed algorithm better.\n\nIf the above weaknesses are addressed appropriately, I am inclined to accept the paper."}, "questions": {"value": "- What is the advantage of changing the timing of the spike? Assuming we enforce a similar $\\ell_{0}$ constraint on other raw even attack methods, i.e., the perturbed image must have the exact event count as the original, then, for the spiking timing attack, it also adds additional constraint, that is, if one event is removed, then for the *same position within this time window*, we must add one additional event back.

As a core part of the method, the meaning of every variable and equation must be clearly demonstrated. For instance, in Eq.8, does ‘shift logits’ represent the possibility of each $(s,j)$ changing to other time bins? In Eq.9, does $S(x)[t,j]$ represent the weighted possible value in $[t,j]$ after perturbation? The author should clarify what the term and equation are used for instead of only using concepts or definitions like ‘the expected soft retiming’. For section ‘feasible strict projection under budgets’, it is better to use an algorithm or a diagram instead of cluttered text.\n\n2.The budgets used in the paper are questionable. Take L0-norm as an example. If two active indices at the same spatial position ((1,0,1,1) and (2,0,1,1) in TCHW) are swapped, the frames remain unchanged, yet the B0 is 2. Will your attack method consider or optimize these redundant perturbations? Moreover, can the author compare your attack with other sparse DVS attack in L0-norm defined previously [1]? In other words, calculate the number of changed pixels in your adversarial examples to compare with previous SOTA works.\n\n3.In experimental results, the model SpikingResformer performs badly in all experiments. In [2], SpikingResformer reaches 84.8% in CIFAR10-DVS, while in Table 2 is only 70.3%. If the accuracy gap is large, why use this model? In Table 4, the accuracy is only 22% in binary grid.
