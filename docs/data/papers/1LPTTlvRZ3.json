However, the prevailing “concat-then-project” paradigm disrupts the inherent alignment between CLIP's visual and textual modalities and undermines the temporal modeling capabilities of the additional video encoder. To address these, we propose FDAP, a plug-and-play Feature Decoupling and Aggregation Paradigm. FDAP introduces two key components: a Textual-Guided Feature Decoupling Module (TGFDM) that preserves CLIP’s cross-modal alignment and SlowFast’s temporal modeling via independent attention maps, and a Dual-branch Feature Aggregation Module (DFAM) that dynamically adjusts feature weights during aggregation based on query-specific needs. Extensive experiments across four VTG methods (M-DETR, TR-DETR, CG-DETR, Flash-VTG) on three benchmark datasets (QVHighlights, Charades-STA, TACoS) demonstrate consistent performance gains, \\emph{e.g.}, a 3\\% improvement in M-DETR’s R1@0.7 metric.

Pooling attention maps and feeding a small MLP to predict dynamic fusion weights is a common adaptive-fusion pattern. Please present it as an engineering choice, cite close precedents, and include ablations against alternatives (gating, softmax/Dirichlet weighting, mixture-of-experts) to demonstrate why this variant is preferable here.\n2. “Temporal-Guided Attention” vs. preserving SlowFast’s intrinsic dynamics. Eq. (5) defines a text-conditioned frame self-attention, where the affinity involves the query text. This is not the same as preserving SlowFast’s query-agnostic motion modeling. Please clarify whether the intent is to expose SlowFast cues under textual guidance or to truly preserve them. Consider: (i) a query-agnostic temporal attention variant as a control, and (ii) analyses showing how much the query changes SlowFast features.\n3. Mixed comparison protocols reduce fairness/interpretability. The tables mix (i) prior-paper numbers and (ii) your re-implementations, likely under different training setups (data, augmentation, audio, pretraining). This makes it hard to attribute gains. Please separate these blocks, and provide a unified reproduction with the same recipe and modalities for all baselines, reporting mean±std (multiple seeds) and basic significance tests.\n4, sqrt(L), sqrt(T) scaling needs explicit rationale. Unlike vanilla attention’s sqrt(d), Eqs. (4)/(5) scale by sequence-length factors. Please state the softmax axes precisely and justify why it is appropriate for your affinity definitions. \n5. T×T complexity isn’t reflected in the efficiency results. The module implies 𝑂(𝑇2) temporal attention, but Table 5 only reports aggregate FPS/params. Please plot FPS/peak memory as T grows. \n6.
