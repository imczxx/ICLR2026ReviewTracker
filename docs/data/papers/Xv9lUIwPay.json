Existing diffusion-based privacy methods are vulnerable to the purification effect, which weakens adversarial signals, and their single-stage optimization struggles to balance deceptiveness and visual quality. To address this, we propose a two-stage face privacy protection framework. In Stage 1, we introduce Negative Prompt Inversion (NPI) into the diffusion reverse process and incorporate an angular margin constraint to steer features toward a target identity in feature space—counteracting the dilution of adversarial signals at the source and mitigating gradient conflicts and trade-off issues. Stage 2 focuses on perceptual quality, using perceptual loss and regularization strategies to enhance naturalness while preserving the method's ability to deceive recognizers. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ and LADN public datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art protection success rates (PSR) while maintaining high image quality, underscoring its promise for privacy protection and real-world deployment.", "tldr": "Two-stage diffusion with Negative Prompt Inversion and angular-margin loss delivers state-of-the-art face-privacy protection while keeping images natural.", "keywords": ["Face privacy protection", "Diffusion models"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/77d2acbe784d9d72b5395aea085258a15bdf6dab.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d1d258c7b7214ce0ba6e2889610171f5f3547d0a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a two-stage diffusion-based framework for facial privacy protection.

The proposed method is purely designed to impersonate a given face image of a target identity (different from the victim). It is unclear whether the proposed method is effective in more privacy-relevant obfuscation scenarios (a.k.a. dodging). Note that successful impersonation does not necessarily imply successful dodging. Prior literature has already highlighted the differences between the two settings (see [1] and Section 5 of [2]), which should be taken into consideration in the experiments and/or discussions.\n\n    [1] Rethinking Impersonation and Dodging Attacks on Face Recognition Systems, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08903v4\n \n    [2] Enhancing Facial Privacy Protection via Weakening Diffusion Purification, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10350\n\n2. The proposed framework is quite complex, including two stages and multiple components per stage. The insights into why these stages/components are important/necessary are not explained well in Section 3. In Stage 1 (Identity Diversion), three loss functions are introduced: $L_{Cosine}$, $L_{Arc}$, and $L_{attn}$. Are they all necessary to achieve the goal of identity diversion? Their motivations are not well elaborated in Section 3.3, making it difficult for readers to appreciate their importance. Additionally, the role of the second stage is argued to be further improving the perceptual quality. Do we really need to separate the framework into two stages? It appears that separating into two stages may double the computational costs and result in unfair comparisons with existing methods, as they do not involve an additional step for further refinement. That being said, the authors are recommended to discuss the computational costs of their method, with comparisons to prior competitive alternatives such as WDP and DiffAM.\n\n3. The paper does not provide pseudocode for the algorithm, making it difficult to understand its exact implementation. For example, the method proposes replacing null-text embedding with negative prompt inversion (NPI); however, the implementation details of NPI are unclear. How is the negative prompt inverted? How are the hyperparameters set? Do you make any thoughtful adaptations to improve the performance, or is this a straightforward application of an existing method? The lack of clarity of the proposed framework leaves some doubt about whether the experimental results can be reproduced.\n\n4. The paper does not provide evaluations or discussions on how robust the method is with respect to image transformations, such as image cropping, JPEG compression, Gaussian corruptions, simple denosing operations, etc. As mentioned in the abstract, the work is motivated by the observation that diffusion-based privacy methods are typically vulnerable to purification effects. However, it is somewhat surprising to me that no experiments are provided to evaluate whether the proposed framework is more resilient to the purification effect.\n\n5. The quality of the writing needs to be improved, especially for the introduction. There should be a blank space between the citation and the preceding word. When referring to multiple references, it is typical to place multiple citations inside a single bracket. In addition, lines 089 and 140 have obvious spacing issues. The authors should do a better job in proofreading before submission, and are recommended to review the accepted papers from previous years to familiarize themselves with the typical ICLR citation format.\n\n6.
