However, they often rely on predefined, high-action trajectories, which limits both sampling efficiency and final restoration quality. To address this, we propose a Consistency Geodesic Bridge (CGB) framework to construct a lower-action, geodesic trajectory. We achieve this by designing a novel bridge process that evolves over a shorter time horizon and makes the reverse process start from an entropy-regularized point that mixes the degraded image and Gaussian noise, which theoretically reduces the required trajectory action. To ensure this path approximates a geodesic on the data manifold, we innovatively leverage a pretrained denoiser as a dynamic geodesic guidance\nfield. To solve this process efficiently, we draw inspiration from consistency models to learn a single-step mapping function, optimized via a continuous-time consistency objective tailored for our trajectory, so as to analytically map any state on the path to the target image. Notably, the path length in our framework becomes a tunable task-adaptive knob, allowing the model to adaptively balance information\npreservation against generative power for tasks of varying degradation, such as denoising versus super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGB achieves state-of-the-art performance across various image restoration tasks, while enabling high-quality recovery with a single or fewer sampling steps.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["image restoration", "bridge diffusion"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/31fe5d6fe18cc375881bad6828d181d878d608fb.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper aims to address an important and challenging problem in the field of image restoration: how to achieve extremely high sampling efficiency while maintaining high-quality restoration. The authors propose a novel framework called the **Consistency Geodesic Bridge (CGB)**, whose core idea is to ingeniously integrate three cutting-edge research directions: (1) bridge diffusion models that directly connect the distributions of degraded and clean images; (2) a geometric perspective that views the “geodesic” path on the data manifold as the most efficient restoration trajectory; and (3) consistency models that enable single-step inference without the need for ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers. The CGB framework claims to construct a low-energy geodesic trajectory and derives a closed-form “CGB solver” that can be trained through a consistency objective function. As a result, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality metrics with a very small number of sampling steps (NFE = 5–10)."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. This paper proposes the CGB framework, which remodifies the generation process based on the idea of minimum energy, demonstrating a certain level of insight.\n2. It achieves industry-leading inference efficiency with very few function evaluations, significantly enhancing the practical value of generative tasks.\n3. By introducing a single tunable parameter $T_0$, it achieves task adaptivity and maintains a balance between performance and flexibility across different restoration tasks."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Theory:**\n1. The core motivation of the paper is to construct a path of minimum energy. The authors state in the appendix that the energy of the geodesic trajectory is 0, so they attempt to construct a geodesic named CGB. However, the construction on the right-hand side of equation (6) is merely a linear interpolation. Although the authors mention that this construction starts from $T_0$, reducing time and energy—thus seemingly consistent with the motivation of minimizing energy—this does not provide a reasonable scheme for constructing a geodesic. Hence, there is a certain conflict between the motivation and the construction.\n\n2. In Proposition 4.1, the authors claim that the CGB trajectory achieves lower energy, providing two reasons: (i) a shorter integration interval; (ii) at $t = T_0$, the denoiser is given a more “in-distribution” input. This reasoning lacks rigor. The first point is trivial: integrating a non-negative function over a shorter interval naturally yields a smaller value, but this does not imply that the path itself is more efficient—a shorter but sharper path may have higher energy than a longer but smoother one. The second point is more of an intuitive conjecture. Theoretically, given the energy formula, the construction in equation (6) and a certain diffusion bridge equation could be quantitatively compared.\n\n**Experimental:**\n\n3. The comparisons are unfair. The paper uses Flux-dev as the base model, which already has strong generative capabilities, while some other methods, such as UNIDB, are based on SD. Since the paper mainly presents a theoretical improvement and claims superiority over diffusion bridges, to prove that the CGB path is optimal, comparisons should be made between models that are as similar as possible but differ in theory.\n\n**Overall:**\nI believe the authors essentially constructed a model:\n$\\mathbf{X}_t = (1-t)\\left[\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{t}{T_0}\\right)^{\\kappa}\\right)\\mathbf{X}_0 + \\left(\\frac{t}{T_0}\\right)^{\\kappa}\\mathbf{Y}\\right]+ t\\mathbf{X}_T,$\nwhich can essentially be viewed as learning a mapping from $X_0$ to the distribution $N((1-T_0)Y,T_0^2I)$, representing a conditional mapping from a high-quality image to a low-quality one plus a certain amount of noise. Moreover, both training and inference are conducted within the range $[0,T_0]$ (note: $X_T$ is independent of $T$ and just a purely noise). Therefore, although the integration length is nominally reduced, theoretically it is not fundamentally different from previous bridge models ending in Gaussian distributions, and in fact it is essentially time varying Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process—it is merely a scaled version. Considering points 1, 2, and 3, this does not demonstrate that such a construction is truly of minimum energy or superior. I recommend that the authors further verify the theoretical optimality of CGB from two aspects:\n\n1. **Theoretically**, directly provide an inequality proof showing that the energy of CGB is lower than that of other bridge models;\n2. **Experimentally**, validate the superiority of CGB through experiments using models that are as similar as possible but differ in theoretical design.\n\nFinally, I would like to discuss the fundamental motivation proposed by the authors—that minimizing energy leads to an optimal path. In the paper, the authors state that typical diffusion-bridge models add noise to the image during the reverse process and then denoise it, with the noise level peaking at intermediate steps. They argue that this noise-adding process during inference is unnecessary and thus propose to start generation directly from $T_0 < T$, restoring high-quality images directly from low-quality ones, which they claim yields minimal energy and an optimal path.\n\nHowever, I believe that the noise-adding process in the reverse procedure serves an important purpose: it helps to destroy certain information (such as degradation information) before reconstructing a high-quality image, thereby achieving better results. If, as the authors suggest, one wishes to directly transform a low-quality image into a high-quality one without the add-noise-then-denoise process, then models like Rectified Flow (RF) could be directly applied, since RF can progressively transform a low-quality image into a high-quality one as described by the authors. Moreover, RF is also an energy-minimizing model in the context of optimal transport. However, according to experimental results, using RF for image restoration does not perform as well as diffusion-bridge models that incorporate stochastic noise. \n\nIf my understanding is incorrect, I welcome the authors to provide clarification."}, "questions": {"value": "See weekness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "uoH93BbEux", "forum": "B9JHSksyox", "replyto": "B9JHSksyox", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4449/Reviewer_Em12"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4449/Reviewer_Em12"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4449/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760689095807, "cdate": 1760689095807, "tmdate": 1762917371805, "mdate": 1762917371805, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposed a novel geodesic diffusion bridge framework through constructing a efficient and geodesic trajectory, which effectively avoids redundant re-noising phases in traditional diffusion bridges.

The paper's main contribution of enabling \"**direct and single-step** inference\" is misleading. The proposed CGB solver is described as a single-step mapping and the training objective is for distillation. However, all experiments are conducted with **5-10 NFEs** inference, and no real single-step results are shown. The experiments are contradicted with the statements of contribution.\n\n3. The motivation for geodesic trajectory and the related Proposition 4.1 seem intriguing but I'm not convinced by Proposition 4.1. Proposition 4.1 claimed CGB trajectory defined on $[0, T_0]$ for $T_0<1$ achieves a lower total energy (Eqn. 4) than standard bridge models operating on [0,1] for two reasons: (1) reduced integration upper bound, (2) a smaller initial control at time $T_0$. Although the integration upper bound is reduced from 1 to $T_0$ which results in the reduced trajectory cost (first term in Eqn. 4), the terminal cost $\\gamma/2 ||X_T-Y||^2_2$, second term in Eqn. 4, could not be ignored: the terminal cost is near or even equal to zero in standard bridge models (e.g. DDBMs and UniDB), while, as for CDB, the starting point $X_{T_0}$ of its reverse trajectory is a noise mixture distinct from $Y$, which appears to result in a non-zero and potentially substantial terminal cost. Therefore, it's not obvious for the two total costs to demonstrate which is smaller and it's better for the authors to provide a rigorous mathematical proof of Proposition 4.1 instead of only the text explanation. Otherwise, the correctness of Proposition 4.1 remains to doubt.\n\n4. The comparison to baselines seems insufficient. Since the authors included DA-CLIP [4], MaRS [5] (the training-free accelerated-sampling version of DA-CLIP), and UniDB [6] in their main experiments, they should compare UniDB++ [7] with the same NFEs as CGB/MaRS, which is a specific training-free acceleration algorithm for UniDB and achieves better results in lower NFEs, as mentioned in Related Works.\n\n[4] Luo et al. \"Controlling Vision-Language Models for Multi-Task Image Restoration.\", 2023.\n\n[5] Li et al. \"MaRS: A Fast Sampler for Mean Reverting Diffusion based on ODE and SDE Solvers.\", 2025.\n\n[6] Zhu et al. \"UniDB: A Unified Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control.\", 2025.\n\n[7] Pan et al. \"UniDB++：Fast Sampling of Unified Diffusion Bridge.\", 2025.\n\n5.
