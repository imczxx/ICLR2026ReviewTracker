However, these frameworks predominantly serve developers with extensive technical expertise—a significant limitation considering that only 0.03% of the global population possesses the necessary programming skills. This stark accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone, regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural language alone? To address this challenge, we introduce AutoAgent - a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, AutoAgent comprises four key components: i) Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, iii) Self-Managing File System, and iv) Self-Play Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention. Beyond its code-free agent development capabilities, AutoAgent also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants. Comprehensive evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate AutoAgent's effectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, AutoAgent's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-related capabilities have shown consistently superior performance compared to many alternative LLM-based solutions.", "tldr": "We introduce AutoAgent - a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone.", "keywords": ["LLM agent"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d226fc5a03bf106cf52e55f4416dbcbdc49c8c86.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces AutoAgent, a novel framework designed to democratize the development of Large Language Model (LLM) agents by enabling fully automated, zero-code creation and customization through natural language.
