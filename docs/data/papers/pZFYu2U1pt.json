We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises 1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting decision-making processes, and (3) the final text.\nThrough comprehensive experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1) process supervision requires at least 10k general samples for stabilization—below this threshold, performance degrades monotonically (35.78% → 42.16% → 50.00% → 62.75%), (2) creative capabilities are culturally bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.Dataset available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/COIG-Writer", "tldr": "We introduce a novel Chinese creative writing dataset that incorporates authors' genuine thought processes to train AI models to generate content with greater depth and personality.", "keywords": ["LLM", "Chinese Creative Writing", "Process-Augmented Data"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c462b4af1319a0684b65ec78e97a7c81a6ba030b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces COIG-Writer, a new dataset for Chinese creative writing.

A \"two-component model\" of creative writing exists, composed of Narrative Logic (from process supervision) and Linguistic Expression (from general data).\n2.

The paper's premise rests on \"reverse-engineered thought processes\". This is a synthetic, post-hoc rationalization. The paper provides no evidence that these chains are valid, reliable, or representative of actual human creative cognition. No Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) for the reasoning generation task is provided. This is a fatal methodological flaw.\n2. The paper must include a baseline trained on the 1,665 articles without the 1,089-character reasoning chains. Without this ablation, it is impossible to know if the \"process supervision\" (the reasoning) adds any value, or if the performance gains simply come from fine-tuning on 1,665 high-quality, in-domain articles.\n3. The paper's main finding (the \"10k stabilization threshold\") is confounded. The best model is trained on 11,665 total samples, while the baseline $\\mathcal{M}_{G}$ is trained on 10,000. The results cannot distinguish between the effect of \"process supervision\" and the effect of simply having 16.65% more training data. The monotonic improvement is also just as likely to be a standard result of mitigating catastrophic forgetting by data mixing, not evidence of a \"two-component model.\"\n4. The dataset (N=1,665) is too small to be a significant contribution. The paper's own experiments show models trained on it alone ($\\mathcal{M}_{CW}$) are non-functional, severely limiting its utility.\n5. The paper fails to compare its models against any SOTA baselines (e.g., zero-shot performance of strong foundation models like GPT-5, Gemini 2.5pro, or Claude sonnet 4.5) or on established creative writing benchmarks (e.g., LitBench, WritingBench).\n6. The human evaluation uses only four trained evaluators, with annotators assigned to specific models, introducing a risk of rater-model confounds.

The authors argue that creative writing is compositional, requiring both \"narrative logic\" and \"linguistic expression,\" and that existing models fail due to a lack of process-level supervision, especially in non-English contexts.

Models trained on the Chinese process data failed to improve English writing and exhibited cross-lingual contamination, demonstrating that creative reasoning does not transfer easily.\n\n3. **The \"TTR Paradox\"**: Lexical diversity (measured by Type-Token Ratio) inversely correlates with human-perceived quality.

Traditionally (for humans), lexical diversity is considered positively correlated with creativity, fluency, or sophistication -- especially in second-language acquisition and stylistic analysis (e.g., [3, 4]). This empirically discovered paradox is idiosyncratic to COIG-Writer, and loosely aligns with threads in linguistic literature that stipulates fluency and coherence may rely on controlled lexical reuse rather than maximal variety (e.g., [1, 2]).\n\n\n### Ref: \n\n1.

This could limit the generalization capability of models trained exclusively or heavily on this data, particularly for the less-represented genres.\n\n2. **Subjectivity of Reverse-Engineered Reasoning**: The \"reasoning process\" is a post-hoc rationalization created by an expert annotator, not a direct recording of the original author's true thought process. While the paper's methodology ensures these chains are plausible and coherent, they are fundamentally a simulation. This introduces a potential source of bias, as the dataset may reflect a specific, systematic style of \"how to think about writing\" rather than a diverse range of actual human creative processes.\n\n3. **Generalizability of the \"10k Threshold\"**: The 10k general sample threshold for stabilization is a key finding but is likely specific to the experimental setup (base model, size of D_cw, etc.). It is presented as a somewhat firm number, but it is more likely a heuristic that would vary with model size, the quality of the general data, and the size of the process-supervised dataset itself."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The reverse-engineering of thought processes is a fascinating but inherently subjective task. What steps were taken to ensure inter-annotator consistency on the structure and content of the reasoning chains, beyond just ensuring the final triplet was coherent? Is there a risk that this process ingrains a specific, uniform style of \"rationalization\" into the dataset?\n\n2. The 10k general-sample \"stabilization threshold\" is a very interesting result. How do you hypothesize this threshold might change with different base models or a larger process-supervised dataset? For instance, if you had 10,000 COIG-Writer samples, would the need for general data decrease, or would the optimal ratio remain similar?\n\n3. **The \"TTR paradox\" is a powerful finding**. Could you provide a qualitative example from your evaluation that illustrates this? For example, showing a snippet from a baseline MG generation that has high TTR but is logically disconnected, compared to a McW+10k generation with lower TTR but better thematic consistency, would further strengthen this claim."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "nBUdSjB87m", "forum": "pZFYu2U1pt", "replyto": "pZFYu2U1pt", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8577/Reviewer_pczx"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8577/Reviewer_pczx"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8577/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762324679620, "cdate": 1762324679620, "tmdate": 1762920426769, "mdate": 1762920426769, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
