We systematically analyze these patterns and observe substantial accuracy variance across patterns on math and science benchmarks, implying that the pattern a model adopts is often sub-optimal for a given problem. We introduce Group Pattern Selection Optimal (GPSO), a reinforcement-learning framework that extends GRPO with multi-pattern rollout, optimal pattern selection per problem via verifier signals, and attention masking to prevent leakage from explicit pattern suffixes into the learned policy. By intelligently exploring a portfolio of diverse patterns and optimizing the model's policy on the most effective ones, GPSO learns the intrinsic mapping from problem to pattern. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSO delivers consistent and substantial performance improvements across a wide range of model backbones and reasoning benchmarks, effectively mitigating the sub-optimality issue and enabling more robust and adaptable LLM reasoning.", "tldr": "We propose GPSO, a training paradigm that optimizes reasoning pattern selection and improves LLM reasoning accuracy", "keywords": ["LLM reasoning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4795e5a48b32d30f5f9331b3e83e3accd311d9b3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper identifies that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often default to dominant, sub-optimal reasoning patterns. It introduces Group Pattern Selection Optimization (GPSO), a reinforcement learning framework extending GRPO. The method operates by performing multi-pattern rollouts, where a single problem is prompted with several different \"reasoning pattern suffixes\". A verifier signal is used to identify the most effective pattern for that specific problem, and the model's policy is then updated using only the trajectories from that optimal pattern group. GPSO employs attention masking to prevent the model from overfitting to the explicit pattern suffixes, thereby forcing it to learn an intrinsic mapping from the problem to the optimal reasoning strategy.

Figure 1 demonstrates that different reasoning patterns yield different accuracies for the same problem and that current RLVR pipelines can bias models toward a single, sub-optimal dominant pattern.\n\n- The proposed training mechanism, GPSO, is general and well-designed. It builds on GRPO by adding multi-pattern rollouts, best-pattern selection, and attention masking, which could potentially be integrated into various RLVR-style pipelines.\n\n- The contribution of the reasoning pattern optimization, using masking for pattern prompting invariance and a best-group update to force the model to learn an internal reasoning pattern policy, is a valuable idea for improving the quality of intermediate reasoning tokens generated by the model.\n\n- The method shows consistent performance gains, particularly on weaker to midsize models (e.g., ~2–3 point average gains on 1.5B–8B parameter models) on difficult math benchmarks."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The pipeline’s absolute effectiveness remains unclear because the trained model still trails very much behind the oracle “Best” per-question pattern upper bound from the analysis in Figure 1; the gap (e.g. 90% best on AIME2024 with Qwen3 thinking compared to the achieved 77.5% which is only less than 1% gain compared to the baseline 76.7% and trailing behind even some reasoning pattern prompting methods) suggests the bottleneck is only slightly addressed.\n\n2. The training objective relies on a \"hard\" best-pattern selection. The method always picks the single best pattern group (by highest verified accuracy) and completely ignores all other patterns. This discards potentially useful training signals from other rollouts. An ablation exploring \"soft\" inclusion (e.g., weighting each pattern group by its verifier score) would be useful to support the hard best-only design.\n\n3. There is a lack of statistical significance reporting. Evaluation relies on Pass@1 averaged over 4 samples per problem, decoded at a non-zero temperature (T=0.6). Results are reported as single numbers without variance or confidence intervals. This reduces the impact of the findings, especially since several gains on stronger models are less than 1 point (e.g., +0.8 on Qwen3-8B) and could be statistical noise.\n\n4. Despite discussing patterns like “employing tools,” the experiments are confined to math/science QA with textual reasoning. There is no evaluation on tasks that require external tools (e.g., code execution, retrieval, calculators), task decomposition, or search, so it is unclear whether pattern effects and GPSO’s gains persist in those domains."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can you report variance or confidence intervals for the results in Tables 1?\n\n2. How does GPSO's performance compare to a simpler inference-time selection baseline? For example, prompting the base model with all n (3) patterns, sampling m times, and  using majority voting for example to select the final answer? This would help isolate the gains from the RL training itself versus the multi-pattern ensemble.\n\n3. What is your intuition for why a \"soft inclusion\" of other reasoning patterns (e.g., a weighted mix based on verifier scores) would not outperform the \"best-only\" hard selection strategy?\n\n4.
