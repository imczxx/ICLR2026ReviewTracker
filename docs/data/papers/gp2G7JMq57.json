These examples fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the pedagogical principle of ``tailored teaching with balanced difficulty''. We reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a well ordered set of training examples that align with the model’s current capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1) model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and (2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each question–image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.", "tldr": "We boost multimodal reasoning by selecting prompts like a personalized curriculum, balancing what the model finds difficult (its uncertainty) with the inherent complexity of the questions.", "keywords": ["Multimodal Chain-of-Thought", "Reasoning", "Prompt Curriculum"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0f125576144b52f0fdedb70eb5c06d1e49f25e47.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d59aae6f847c511bed14eac1ec4cbb277e6b97b5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a novel framework named CAMS to address the performance instability of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCOT) caused by its reliance on randomly selected examples.

Limited Scope of the Complexity Assessor and Its Potential Impact on Generalization: The paper's core innovation, the \"complexity\" dimension, is defined in a way that equates complexity with structural difficulty (i.e., more reasoning steps). This approach is effective for problems where complexity and difficulty are aligned. However, it may fail on tasks where difficulty stems from conceptual insight rather than procedural length. The paper's own results (Figure 4) hint at this, showing a smaller performance gain in the language science (LAN) domain. This raises concerns about the method's effectiveness on higher-level reasoning tasks where a key insight, not structural complexity, is the primary barrier.\n\n2. Lack of Transparency and Reproducibility in the Complexity Assessor's Training: A key step is the \"Evol-Complexity\" method, which uses ChatGPT to iteratively increase question difficulty to generate training data. However, the paper does not provide the specific prompts and examples used to guide this process. This makes the core module a \"black box,\" hindering reproducibility and preventing a deeper analysis of the biases the assessor might have learned from ChatGPT.\n\n3. High Computational Cost is Undiscussed: The CAMS framework requires a computationally intensive preprocessing stage, involving multiple inference passes for uncertainty estimation and calls to another large model for complexity assessment. The paper focuses exclusively on performance gains without providing any discussion on the trade-off between these gains and the significant increase in computational overhead, which is a critical factor for practical application."}, "questions": {"value": "1. On the Effective Boundary of the Complexity Assessor: We observed in Figure 4 that the performance gain in the language science (LAN) domain was less pronounced than in NAT and SOC. Could this suggest that your complexity assessor, trained by increasing \"reasoning steps,\" is less effective at capturing the \"conceptual\" or \"insight-based\" difficulty common in language problems? Following this, how would you anticipate your method performing on high-level reasoning tasks like AIME math problems, where difficulty is almost entirely conceptual? Have you considered alternative or complementary methods to assess complexity for such challenges?\n\n2. On the Reproducibility of \"Evol-Complexity\": To improve the transparency and reproducibility of your work, would it be possible to provide the specific prompt used to guide ChatGPT in increasing question complexity, along with one or two full examples showing a question's \"evolution\" through the iterative process?\n\n3.

It is not obvious that a 25/25/25/25 split is optimal across different models, which have unique knowledge gaps, or across different datasets with varying intrinsic difficulty distributions."}, "questions": {"value": "Plz answer my concerns in the weakness section"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "tZS7BKKVR9", "forum": "gp2G7JMq57", "replyto": "gp2G7JMq57", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10551/Reviewer_U7iv"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10551/Reviewer_U7iv"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10551/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761794782979, "cdate": 1761794782979, "tmdate": 1762921828073, "mdate": 1762921828073, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"title": {"value": "Response to all reviewers about common questions (Part 3/3)"}, "comment": {"value": "## A5.Example of sample evolution\n\n### Example of adding constraints\n\nIncreasing sample complexity by adding constraints\n\n| **Instruction**                                              |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Find the title of a book about a political movement in the 1940s. |\n| **Response**                                                 |\n| Find the title of a book about a 1940s anti-colonial political movement with first-hand activist testimonies. |\n| Find the title of a 1940s anti-colonial political movement book set in Southeast Asia with first-hand activist testimonies and a major international literary award. |\n| Find the title of a 1940s anti-colonial political movement book set in Southeast Asia, written by a local female activist (1945-1949), with first-hand activist testimonies and a major international literary award. |\n| Find the title of a 1940s anti-colonial political movement book set in Southeast Asia, written by a local female activist (1945-1949), centered on rural grassroots mobilization and translated into three European languages, with first-hand activist testimonies and a major international literary award. |\n\n\n### Example of specification\n\n\nIncrease sample complexity by making it more specific.\n\n| **Instruction**                                              |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Find the title of a book about a political movement in the 1940s. |\n| **Response**                                                 |\n| Find the title of a non-fiction book about a Southeast Asian political movement in the 1940s that shaped post-WWII governance. |\n| Find the title of a non-fiction book about a Southeast Asian anti-colonial political movement in the 1940s that shaped post-WWII governance drawing on first-hand activist accounts. |\n| Find the title of a non-fiction book about a Southeast Asian anti-colonial political movement in the 1940s that shaped post-WWII governance drawing on first-hand activist accounts, focused on Indochina or Indonesia and analyzed through transnational lenses. |\n| Find the title of a non-fiction book about a Southeast Asian anti-colonial political movement in the 1940s that shaped post-WWII governance drawing on first-hand activist accounts, focused on Indochina or Indonesia and analyzed through transnational lenses, emphasizing marginalized women activists’ roles in diplomatic shifts. |\n\n###"}}, "id": "KNfC47w54R", "forum": "gp2G7JMq57", "replyto": "gp2G7JMq57", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10551/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10551/Authors"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10551/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763518293445, "cdate": 1763518293445, "tmdate": 1763518293445, "mdate": 1763518293445, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes CAMS, a prompt demonstration selection framework for multimodal CoT reasoning.

The core contribution feels like a combination of existing ideas in LLMs rather than a new concept for multimodality. The improvement over simple baselines is often modest. The proposed method also introduces additional computation cost in prompt selection.\n2. The proposed complexity scorer is trained on text-only data using an outdated LLM (llama-2) and applied to caption-plus-question inputs for multimodal tasks, but this paper does not offer convincing evidence that this score meaningfully reflects sample difficulty for these VQA benchmarks.\n3. Key choices such as the disagreement threshold for splitting easy and hard examples and the fixed mixing of high- and low-complexity samples are not thoroughly studied. There is no sensitivity analysis that shows the method is robust to these hyperparameters.\n4. It would be better to see quantitative discussion of computational cost because CAMS requires multiple passes of a large MLLM over a training subset and additional passes of a complexity scorer.  For realistic scenario, processing the whole training dataset may be costly or infeasible.\n5. I would like to know why CAMS constructs a single global prompt pool per dataset and does not adapt exemplars to individual test questions, which contradicts the \"tailored\"."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "eKIdyDqGGv", "forum": "gp2G7JMq57", "replyto": "gp2G7JMq57", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10551/Reviewer_eDCG"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10551/Reviewer_eDCG"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10551/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762380965155, "cdate": 1762380965155, "tmdate": 1762921827557, "mdate": 1762921827557, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
