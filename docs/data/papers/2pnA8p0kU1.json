As solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems is challenging, primal heuristics have been developed to quickly identify high-quality solutions within a short amount of time. Recently, a growing body of research has also used machine learning to accelerate solution methods for challenging combinatorial optimization problems. Despite the increasing popularity of these ML-guided methods, a large body of work has focused on Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). \nMBQPs are challenging to solve due to the combinatorial complexity coupled with nonlinearities. This work proposes ML-guided primal heuristics for Mixed Binary Quadratic Programs (MBQPs) by adapting and extending existing work on ML-guided MILP solution prediction to MBQPs. We introduce a new neural network architecture for MBQP solution prediction and a new training data collection procedure. Moreover, we extend existing loss functions in solution prediction and propose to combine contrastive weighted cross-entropy losses. We evaluate the methods on standard and real-world MBQP benchmarks and show that the developed ML-guided methods significantly outperform existing primal heuristics and state-of-the-art solvers. Furthermore, models trained with our proposed extension with combined losses outperform other ML-based methods adapted from MILPs and improve generalization in cross-regional inference on a real-world wind farm layout optimization problem.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["combinatorial optimization", "machine learning", "primal heuristics"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2f3eabd77f7d39e3c1ec815d594bbdaef34fef0a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes ML-guided primal heuristics for mixed binary quadratic programs by encoding each instance as a tripartite graph  and using Graph attention to predict assignments to binary variables.
