Existing approaches either sacrifice efficiency for versatility or fail to capture the distinct representational requirements of various degradations. We present MIRAGE, an efficient framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we propose a channel-wise functional decomposition that systematically repurposes channel redundancy in attention mechanisms by assigning CNN, attention, and MLP branches to handle local textures, global context, and channel statistics, respectively. This principled decomposition enables degradation-agnostic learning while achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs. Second, we introduce manifold regularization that performs cross-layer contrastive alignment in Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) space, which empirically improves feature consistency and generalization across degradation types. Extensive experiments across five degradation settings demonstrate that MIRAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency, outperforming existing methods in both single and mixed degradation scenarios while showing strong zero-shot generalization to unseen domains.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Image Restoration", "Transformer", "Contrastive Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/589db9b26ce3af78c4e79340dab661acb8b107e0.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes MIRAGE, an efficient framework for degradation-agnostic image restoration.

The proposed SPD manifold alignment introduces cross-layer contrastive learning between shallow and latent features using covariance-based second-order statistics. This prevents feature collapse common in Euclidean contrastive learning and promotes consistent, degradation-agnostic representations. Ablations show clear gains.\n3.

While the paper’s SPD-based manifold regularization is empirically effective, its mathematical formulation remains heuristic.

The experiments comprehensively compare with transformer- and prompt-based all-in-one models (PromptIR, MoCE-IR, AdaIR), but omit recent diffusion-based or state-space approaches that are increasingly strong in low-level restoration.\n3.
