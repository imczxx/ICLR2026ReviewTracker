We challenge the assumption that fine-tuning of large, bespoke models is required to improve model generation accuracy. Here we propose Label Boosted Retrieval Augmented Generation (LaB-RAG), a small-model-based approach to image captioning that leverages image descriptors in the form of categorical labels to boost standard retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with pretrained large language models (LLMs). We study our method in the context of radiology report generation (RRG) over MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus. We argue that simple classification models combined with zero-shot embeddings can effectively transform X-rays into text-space as radiology-specific labels. In combination with standard RAG, we show that these derived text labels can be used with general-domain LLMs to generate radiology reports. Without ever training our generative language model or image embedding models specifically for the task, and without ever directly \"showing\" the LLM an X-ray, we demonstrate that LaB-RAG achieves better results across natural language and radiology language metrics compared with other retrieval-based RRG methods, while attaining competitive results compared to other fine-tuned vision-language RRG models. We further conduct extensive ablation experiments to better understand the components of LaB-RAG. Our results suggest broader compatibility and synergy with fine-tuned methods to further enhance RRG performance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["retrieval augmented generation", "radiology report generation", "label boosting"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1ccdcba197e4926abcd041951c6d2cdd9b36d721.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes LaB-RAG, a radiology report generation framework that avoids fine-tuning large models. Instead, it first predicts categorical clinical labels using a separate image encoder, then leverages retrieval-augmented generation with frozen LLMs. By filtering and formatting retrieved reports using the predicted labels, the model enables an in-context style generation process during inference. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus demonstrate competitive performance, particularly in F1-CheXbert, and show that improvements in image feature quality or labelers further enhance the results.\n\nWhile the approach is interesting in that it divides the roles of the image encoder and language model differently from typical VLM methods, the methodological novelty mainly lies in combining existing components rather than introducing fundamentally new modeling techniques.

As also reflected in the appendix, the improvements do not provide strong evidence that the method can compete with current state-of-the-art systems. Evaluation against more recent models such as MAIRA-2, MedVersa, and MedGemma would be necessary to contextualize the contribution.\n• The method adopts a modular pipeline where the image encoder is responsible for all visual understanding by predicting labels first, and the language model relies solely on these labels for report generation. While this is a valid design choice, the paper does not sufficiently demonstrate that reducing direct cross-modal interaction offers clear advantages over more integrated VLM architectures. Additional evidence would be needed to justify this as a superior paradigm for medical report generation.\n• The effectiveness of the approach depends heavily on the quality and accuracy of the labeler and image encoder, which introduces possible bottlenecks and limits robustness."}, "questions": {"value": "n/a"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "n/a"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "so7yy14FWa", "forum": "4sF3GdzgV9", "replyto": "4sF3GdzgV9", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8014/Reviewer_gTuS"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8014/Reviewer_gTuS"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8014/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761646390015, "cdate": 1761646390015, "tmdate": 1762920017764, "mdate": 1762920017764, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "8tCaXHkWN5", "forum": "4sF3GdzgV9", "replyto": "4sF3GdzgV9", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8014/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8014/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763048243763, "cdate": 1763048243763, "tmdate": 1763048243763, "mdate": 1763048243763, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents LaB-RAG (Label boosted Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a modular framework for radiology report generation (RRG) which expands conventional RAG with categorical labels predicted from X-ray images.

Novel yet practical conceptual innovation:\nThe paper presents a novel creative leap of categorical label prediction and RAG, flavoring a negligible-cost classical ML input with modern LLM output generation. The idea moves away from the current trend of full tuning or parameter-efficient tuning of large models, suggesting a new flexible alternative which is computationally inexpensive.\n2. Wide empirical evaluation:\nThe performance of LaB-RAG is evaluated on two large datasets (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) and numerous clinical and linguistic metrics, evaluated in comparison to both retrieval-based and fine-tuned models. Furthermore, extensive ablations are provided in connection with label filtering, label formatting, image embedding, language model choice etc. The sheer number of experiments provides strong empirical support.\n3. Transparency through modularity and comprehensibility:\nThe pipeline consisting of an image encoder-label predictor node-retriever-LLM node is transparent, comprehensible and easily extensible. All modules can be independently improved or redefined/modulated, which is especially attractive for real-world performance regarding AI in medicine.\n4. Strong performance making virtually no use of training time:\nThe resulting performance approaches SOTA with no tuning of large models, demonstrating great efficiency and practical success. The effectiveness of the method across conventional RRG metrics gives strong evidence for its conceptual basis.\n5. Good discussion and self-awareness:\nThe authors demonstrate a perceptive grasp of where the LaB-RAG performs well (clinical label level metrics), where it fails to perform (lessening of riches of semantics of underlying labelled words per RadGraph) and provide case studies showing interestingly that correctness at a label level does not necessarily translate to correctness in semantic understanding.\n6. Good concern for open science:\nThe anonymization of coding release and, especially, concern with ethics of data handling enhance the discussed reproduction and acceptable science concerns of the paper."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited conceptual depth beyond engineering style content:\nWhile it is clear that the engineering is done well and thoroughly, the real novelty (label augmented retrieval) is really just an incremental extension of known paradigms (RAG + structured auxiliary features). This contribution can be described as limited at least for ICLR, being of largely empirical rigor rather than of theoretical rigor.\n2. Dependence upon labeler quality and domain heuristics:\nThe performance is reliant on pre-extracted or classifier assigned labels (CheXbert, CheXpert) that themselves are erroneous. The strength of the system therefore appears to be strongly coupled with label quality and thus to possibly lack robustness and transfer to tasks where these no longer exist with clearly defined categorical descriptive noun labels.\n3. Testing semantic evaluation ambiguity:\nWhile the paper comments on F1RadGraph vs F1CheXbert, it fails to provide any deep qualitative error analysis or propose any new paradigms of evaluation to assist in bridging the apparent semantic separation that seems to exist between the two indices. One could argue therefore that the SOTA reported is not a true reflection of clinical interpretability or fidelity.\n4. Questionable generalization beyond radiology:\nIt is likely however that the proposed paradigm does not generalize in the real world to non-structured image captioning tasks (e.g. natural scenes or pathology without categorical labels). The suggestion of broad modular applicability appears overstated at best in the absence of at least one demonstration of application to a non-radiologic scientific question.\n5. Prompt engineering sensitivity not well addressed:\nThere is exploration of the “Simple” vs “Verbose” prompt construction, but the authors do not necessarily provide any systematic or theoretical framework to support the superiority of the form of construction required. Given the model’s dependence on prompt quality, the lack of this adds to the lack of strength of the claims made regarding robustness.\n6. Writing and structure could be more succint:\nThe paper in some areas is lengthy and dense and suffers from considerable redundancy in relation to experimental variations and descriptions. Some of the methodological descriptions (e.g. Algorithm 1) seem more appropriate to an engineering pamphlet than a conference paper narrative."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Generalizability:\nWhat applicability do the authors see LaB-RAG having in relation to img captioning tasks where no categorical labels are available or where the categories are numerous and ill-defined (natural scenes or pathology slides or endoscopic)? \n2. Robustness to label noise:\nHave the authors done any quantification with respect to demonstrating the sensitivity of LaB-RAG to misclassified or missed positive or negative labels in the labels predicted? Could labeling corruption actually occur of an adversarial type and have a considerable degrading effect on performance? \n3. Retrieval corpus dependence:\nGiven that the basis of retrieval examples is taken from the same corpus, what would the performance of LaB-RAG be if retrieval examples were taken out of domain or even limited in quantity?\n4. Prompt interpretability:\nCould the authors give us some qualitative evidence that the LLM can formulate responses that is conditioned on the labels gotten (vis. attention visualization or some controlled ablation)? \n5. Evaluation discrepancy:\nWith LaB-RAG achieving a good F1CheXbert but poor F1RadGraph, what should those utilising the work infer from these indices in terms of clinical practice? Is the practical improvement a significant one or is it mainly a metric improvement?\n6. Integration potential:\nThe paper has the suggestion that LaB-RAG can be utilized synergistically with fine-tuning methods. Maybe the authors could give us an example of how they see this hybridisation being accomplished in real-world practice (LaB-RAG would be used for retrieval but a fine-tuned LLM for generative purposes)?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ZuALBntSil", "forum": "4sF3GdzgV9", "replyto": "4sF3GdzgV9", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8014/Reviewer_dVJ8"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8014/Reviewer_dVJ8"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8014/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761832775554, "cdate": 1761832775554, "tmdate": 1762920017335, "mdate": 1762920017335, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "LaB-RAG is a modular framework designed to generate radiology reports from chest X-ray images without fine-tuning large models.

It performs competitively on the “Impression” section as well, matching the best fine-tuned models while requiring significantly less computational overhead. Ablation studies reveal that label filtering and prompt formatting are key contributors to performance, and that domain-specific image encoders and high-quality label extraction tools (like CheXbert) are essential.
