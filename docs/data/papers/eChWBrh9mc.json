Neural networks stand out as architectures on which to build feature selection methods, and recently, neuron pruning and regrowth have emerged from the sparse neural network literature as promising new tools. We introduce EntryPrune, a novel supervised feature selection algorithm using a dense neural network with a dynamic sparse input layer. It employs entry-based pruning, a novel approach that compares neurons based on their relative change induced when they have entered the network. Extensive experiments on 13 different datasets show that our approach generally outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and in particular improves the average accuracy on low-dimensional datasets. Furthermore, we show that EntryPruning surpasses traditional techniques such as magnitude pruning within the EntryPrune framework and that EntryPrune achieves lower runtime than competing approaches.

The key idea is an entry-based pruning criterion. Specifically, when a pruned input feature is (re)introduced as a candidate into the input layer, the algorithm measures the short-horizon relative change it induces. This is operationalized as the z-scored L1-norm of its first-layer gradient accumulations over the first n mini-batches post-entry. These accumulated scores are stored for all features. Periodically, the algorithm identifies the K features with the largest stored entry scores and prunes the rest. Then, it randomly regrows a batch of new candidate inputs whose incoming weights are reinitialized to tiny values. According to the authors, this strategy balances between established and freshly (re)introduced features and mitigates the bias of magnitude-based pruning toward long-tenured inputs. \nEmpirically, across 13 datasets (tabular, vision, speech, genomics, and text), EntryPrune often outperforms or matches SotA feature selection baselines (NeuroFS, LassoNet, STG, QS, RFS, etc.). An ablation suggests that entry-based scoring (short-horizon gradient sums) beats magnitude‐based criteria inside the same framework. The proposed method often runs faster wall-clock than a sparse-training baseline (NeuroFS).

In fact, I think they should be considered as competitors in the evaluation. \n2. Uncertainty quantification plays a critical role when it comes to feature selection. EntryPrune does not consider this aspect. Is there a way to measure/quantify the uncertainty of the selection process in EntryPrune?\n3. It is not clear what the contribution of the entry metric from regrowth is. Is it possible to isolate this contribution?\n4. The robustness analysis could be much deeper.
