We tackle single-step inorganic retrosynthesis and show that explicit chemical principles are potent inductive biases for learning to plan syntheses. We introduce PRICIN, a principle-centered approach that reformulates precursor planning around two laws: elemental conservation and electron balance. PRICIN embeds stoichiometry and oxidation-state semantics directly into the target representation via two pretraining objectives, including an auxiliary oxidation-state supervision that injects charge awareness. At inference, a lightweight element-wise filter first predicts the required number of precursors and then prunes candidates that violate conservation constraints, yielding explainable, chemically consistent precursor sets without external retrieval or rigid templates. Across the Retrieval-Retro (year-split) and Ceder benchmarks, PRICIN attains state-of-the-art performance on Top-$k$ and combination Top-$k$ metrics, improving over the previous best by +5.59 Top-1 and by up to +19.2 points on Top-$k$. Ablations confirm that oxidation-state supervision and conservation-aware filtering are both necessary and complementary, substantially reducing early-rank errors.

For example, in Fe₃O₄ there are two Fe³⁺ and one Fe²⁺ ions.

How is this performed? I assumed retrieval means that the training data is explicitly stored and can be accessed verbatim during generation (relating it to e.g. RAG in LLMs), yet I missed where this is done in PRICIN.\n\n- **(W1b)**: I'm confused about the \"Elemental conservation\" paragraph and in particular Equation 2. While Equation 1 does seem to correspond to preserving atom counts under appropriate stochiometric coefficients, Equation 2 seems to suggest only preserving the presence or not of particular atom types. Is therefore PRICIN only enforcing the latter? If yes, it seems somewhat weird to introduce the method as adhering to elemental conservation (e.g. see abstract), as that could be misunderstood.\n\n**(W2)**: The paper can be somewhat hard to parse for a person outside of the materials discovery space, even if they have general chemistry knowledge. This could be improved. For example, oxidation states could be explained in a more accessible way.\n\n---\n\n**Other comments**\n\n**(O1)**: In the ablation study, authors note a synergistic effect between the two ablated model elements, where adding only one does not meaningfully improve performance. This seems counterintuitive to me. I wonder if the authors have any explanation why that would be the case. Being \"greater than the sum of the parts\" is one thing, but in this case it appears the parts alone bring zero benefit, and combined they bring a substantial one.\n\n**Nitpicks**\n\nAcross the paper, parentheses around citations are missing where they should be present, and present where they should be missing. If the citation appears as part of the sentence, e.g. \"Author et al have shown that...\", it should not be parenthesized, while if it appears as a remark outside of sentence, e.g. \"This thing is known (Author et al).\", it should be. See e.g. beginning of Section 1, Section 2, and the \"Baseline methods\" paragraph in Section 5.1.\n\n---\n\n**Note**\n\nI have a lot of experience in AI for Chemistry and in particular organic synthesis, but very limited experience in the materials space and inorganic synthesis. Therefore, I mark my review as lower confidence. While from the ML point of view the approach appears sound, I could not verify the more domain-specific parts."}, "questions": {"value": "See the \"Weaknesses\" section above, especially **(W1)**, for specific questions."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "w2p6RrPQth", "forum": "JSNdIzVGeO", "replyto": "JSNdIzVGeO", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15293/Reviewer_QPrt"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15293/Reviewer_QPrt"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15293/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761918144333, "cdate": 1761918144333, "tmdate": 1762925589618, "mdate": 1762925589618, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
