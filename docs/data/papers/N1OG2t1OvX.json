However, they remain unexplored under semi-supervision, where the scarcity of annotated 3D data impedes their widespread adoption. In this work, we present Semi-3DETR, the first framework to systematically adapt DETR to semi-supervised 3D object detection by addressing challenges unique to 3D. Compared to 2D semi-DETR, semi-supervised 3D DETR faces amplified issues of fragile volumetric pseudo-labels, unstable query alignment, and noisy bipartite matching. Our Semi-3DETR mitigates these issues by introducing three core components: Robust Pseudo-Label Denoising (RPLD) to filter and refine volumetric pseudo-labels against orientation and depth errors, Query Alignment Consistency (QAC) to stabilize teacher–student query correspondence under 3D transformations, and a Hybrid Matching Strategy (HMS) to balance one-to-one and one-to-many assignments under noisy supervision. We further adopt a softmax classifier to enforce class exclusivity and improve pseudo-label reliability in semantically ambiguous 3D categories. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and SUN RGB-D demonstrate the feasibility of our Semi-3DETR with promising results compared to fully supervised and semi-supervised baselines.

This appears to me the same as the method proposed in 3DIoUMatch, which similarly has a 3D IoU head, and filters labels based on class, IoU, and objectness confidence. In this aspect, I am hesitant to cite this section as a contribution of this work. I am, however, confused by the ablation in Table 5, where the authors compare with the IoU module of 3DIoUMatch and report better performance. What, precisely, is the difference between these two methods?\n- Regarding query alignment consistency, this paper writes \"Unlike Semi-DETR Zhang et al. (2023), which enforces cross-view consistency only on 2D image queries, our method reconstructs 3D object queries that capture both semantic features and geometric attributes of center, size, and orientation.\" The author emphasizes the difference between 2D and 3D, but functional, the methods appear very similar. Semi-DETR takes pseudo-label boxes on unlabeled images, extracts features from the input (image), and puts them into the teacher and student to enforce consistency between their predictions. The proposed work seems to similarly take pseudo-labels from the teacher, get the corresponding content query & position query (since V-DETR has two types of features for each query), and similarly puts them through the teacher & student to enforce consistency. While I recognize the benefits of leveraging methods developed in 2D for the 3D task, this does seem to weaken this paper's contribution.\n- The Hybrid Matching Strategy is also very similar to Semi-DETR's Stage-wise Hybrid Matching. While there is a difference - the proposed work explicitly does one-to-many matching during pre-training and one-to-one during semi-supervised, while Semi-DETR trains semi-supervised initially with one-to-many before switching to one-to-one, Semi-DETR does not have an explicit labeled-only pre-training phase, making the two pipelines functionally similar. \n- The authors mention the necessity of comparing improvement, not absolute performance, due to the difference in base architectures. However, the proposed model has smaller improvement than baselines in Table 1, albeit it has a higher starting point, and it also does not achieve as good performance in SUN RGB-D."}, "questions": {"value": "While this paper demonstrates strong performance in SSL 3D detection, it seems like most of the module contributions are brought from prior work Semi-DETR and 3DIoUMatch. While I believe that deriving best practices from previous methods is important and I also acknowledge the difficulties in transfering some 2D techniques to 3D, it also does seem to me that this paper's unique contributions may not be sufficient. At this stage, the differences between the proposed modules and prior work is not sufficiently discussed - if the authors can discuss this, I will consider raising my score.
