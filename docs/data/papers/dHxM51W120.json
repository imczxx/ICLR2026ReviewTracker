However, ad-hoc tuning of learning rates poses a challenge, leading to inefficiencies in practice. To address this issue, recent research has focused on developing ``parameter-free'' algorithms that operate effectively without the need for learning rate tuning. Despite these efforts, existing parameter-free variants of AdaGrad and Adam tend to be overly complex and/or lack formal convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present AdaGrad++ and Adam++, novel and simple parameter-free variants of AdaGrad and Adam with convergence guarantees. We prove that AdaGrad++ achieves comparable convergence rates to AdaGrad in convex optimization without predefined learning rate assumptions. Similarly, Adam++ matches the convergence rate of Adam without relying on any conditions on the learning rates.

Theoretical Clarifications**\n\nWe have enhanced the discussion regarding convergence rates in Section 4.1 and Section 5.2 (Q1 of Reviewer J4sP). Additionally, we clarified the distinctions between the AMSGrad-style and non-AMSGrad-style variants of Adam++ Case 2 in Section 5.1 and Appendix H.2.3 (Q3 of Reviewer hSug). Finally, we provided additional explanatory details for the proofs located in Appendices B, C, and D (Q2 of Reviewer 66vf).\n\n### **2. Extended Experimental Evaluation**\n\nWe implemented additional ablation studies to empirically validate the optimization and implicit regularization effects in Appendix H.2.2 (Q3 of Reviewer 66vf), as well as experiments comparing Case 2 of Adam++ with and without the AMSGrad-style mechanism in Appendix H.2.3 (Q3 of Reviewer hSug).\n\nTo further illustrate the robustness of our proposed method, we added baseline figures for AdamW across different step sizes in Figure 7 (Q4 of Reviewer J4sP and Q1 of Reviewer 66vf).\n\nAdditionally, we relocated the language model experiments from Appendix H to Section 6.2 to present a comprehensive empirical validation of the proposed optimizers (Q1 of Reviewer hSug).\n\n### **3.
