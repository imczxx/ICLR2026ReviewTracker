However, they often require domain-specific calibration due to physicochemical diversity and mismatches between practical computational settings and those used in constructing the pre-training data. We propose a sparsity-promoting fine-tuning method for E(3)-equivariant materials foundation models that prune low-contribution parameters during training. Across molecular and crystalline benchmarks, our approach updates only 3 % of parameters, and in some cases as little as 0.5 %, while matching or exceeding the accuracy of full fine-tuning. Beyond energy and force calibration, we apply our method to magnetic moment prediction and magnetism-aware total energy estimation, achieving broader applicability of materials foundation models. Analysis of sparsity patterns further reveals physically interpretable signatures, such as enhanced $d$-orbital contributions in transition-metal systems. Overall, our results establish sparsity-promoting fine-tuning of equivariant models as a flexible and interpretable method for domain specialization of materials foundation models.", "tldr": "This work proposes a sparsity-promoting fine-tuning method for equivariant MLIPs that integrates equivariant constraints with selective parameter pruning.", "keywords": ["machine learning interatomic potentials", "equivariance", "sparsity-promoting"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/16bd02f69cf8b67d55b82c8fb990fb6a15e8a5a8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/0038117c18f6afe1b3e89eac02cab114583da363.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors present a method that enables pre-trained equivariant models for materials and molecules to be fine-tuned for new downstream tasks (e.g. different level of theory, different elemental compositions, etc) with very minimal parameters updates (< 5%) while maintaining equivariance.

Lines 316-317 state “Total sparsity measures the fraction of updated parameters,” implying that higher sparsity means more updates.
