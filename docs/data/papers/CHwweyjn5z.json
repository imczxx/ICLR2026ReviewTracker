Despite being central to our human intelligence, it has received marginal attention in AI research. To be clear, AI systems exist that manifest reflexivity. As we argue, meta-reinforcement learning modules and self-improving systems manifest reflexivity, as do Large Language Models that have the capacity for metacognition, so-called self-attention, and second-guessing. Reflexivity is the common denominator in each of these capacities and mechanisms. The manifestation of reflexivity in current AI systems is, however, a side-product of other goals. To date, no explicit attention has been directed at artificially replicating this central element of human intelligence. We propose that a general capacity for reflexivity is key to bringing AI to the next level.", "tldr": "Reflexivity is a central element of human intelligence and focusing research on it is key to bringing AI research to the next level.", "keywords": ["Self-Attention Mechanisms", "Metacognition", "Meta-learning", "Large Language Models", "Self-Representation"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ad932f0117d04847f344d93ea5de61cce5cef442.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper discusses the notion of reflexivity in AI systems, drawing analogies to human reflexivity, metacognition, and self-awareness.

While the manuscript may be engaging as a reflective or conceptual perspective on AI systems for a non-technical journal, it does not meet the standards for technical contribution required by ICLR. \nThe topic connects to ongoing discussions about metacognition, self-improvement, and interpretability, and could be of general intellectual interest to researchers thinking about the longer-term nature of machine intelligence. The writing is clear, accessible, and well organized, and the paper provides a reasonably comprehensive overview of related ideas from philosophy and AI. As a conceptual or perspective piece, it succeeds in bringing together different strands of thought and highlighting a potentially underexplored notion. However, while this makes it an engaging read, it also underscores that the paper’s contribution is primarily conceptual rather than technical.\nThe paper is out of scope for the conference and should instead be directed to a venue that welcomes conceptual or interdisciplinary discussions on the philosophy or cognitive foundations of AI."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The main weakness of the submission is that it does not contain any technical, empirical, or theoretical contribution that would make it suitable for ICLR. The discussion remains at a high, philosophical level and does not lead to new methods, models, algorithms, or even formal analyses of reflexivity. The examples drawn from meta-reinforcement learning, self-attention, and self-improving systems are purely illustrative and based on existing literature, without new insight that could be operationalized or tested. Moreover, most of the claims made are speculative and not supported by experimental evidence or formal argumentation. As such, while the topic may be of conceptual interest, the work does not meet the expectations of a machine learning conference like ICLR, which emphasizes technical innovation and rigorous evaluation. Overall, the paper would be more appropriate for a venue focused on philosophical or interdisciplinary reflections on AI rather than for a technical ML conference."}, "questions": {"value": "See above"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 0}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "zQysz6aZ8r", "forum": "CHwweyjn5z", "replyto": "CHwweyjn5z", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21268/Reviewer_6QN5"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21268/Reviewer_6QN5"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21268/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761650661471, "cdate": 1761650661471, "tmdate": 1762941661426, "mdate": 1762941661426, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "- This paper is a position paper that argues that reflexivity is a central but overlooked component of intelligence; the author surveys several AI architectures and paradigms (e.g., meta RL, self-modifying networks, second-guessing in CoT) as evidence of partial or implicit forms of reflexivity. \n- The paper then concludes with a call to action, that AI research should be aimed to engineer reflexive capacities, as this enables systems to self-monitor and -improve and exercise self-control"}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The philosophical conceptualization is clear, offering operational and manifestation conditions, it also distinguishes between feedback loops and genuine reflexivity\n- It connects diverse areas of ML research under the lens of reflexivity, which may stimulate interdisciplinary discussion\n- The paper is well-written and accessible to a broad academic audience"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The paper is not formatted correctly using the ICLR template\n- It reads more like a position essay than a technical research paper.
