Drawing inspiration from the score function used in diffusion models, which measures the distance between a sample and the data manifold in probability space, we generalize this concept to the functional domain. \nTo achieve this, we introduce the Discriminative Score Function (DSF), which quantifies the functional distance between a sample and the data manifold by mapping both into a shared functional space using the Loss Tangent Kernel (LTK), a variant of the Neural Tangent Kernel.\nOur framework is architecture- and algorithm-agnostic, as evidenced by various architectures such as ViT, ResNet, and DETR on tasks including object detection, classification, and self-supervised learning (\\eg, CLIP and DINO).
