Our approach provides a unified way to compute required gradients in closed form, with tailored gradient flow \ncalculations for both continuous and discrete components, yielding a framework that is both theoretically grounded and \npractically efficient. To address recurrent instabilities, we develop a general input-to-state stability analysis applicable to a broad class of gated RNN architectures under bounded inputs, extending beyond existing restricted settings. Building on this foundation, inference is carried out by parameterizing continuous latent states with recurrent networks in the spirit of Gaussian filtering, while discrete latent dynamics are inferred through conditional neural sampling. This joint design enables end-to-end learning of complex temporal structure without reliance on restrictive Markovian transition assumptions. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world physical dynamical systems demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance in state estimation, \nregime detection, and imputation under noise and partial observability.", "tldr": "We propose a generative model that addresses the challenge of learning nonlinear Physical systems by modeling latent spaces.", "keywords": ["Generative moels", "Physical Systems"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bb276867a027681b3d893fa79e77968906825204.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/279851432818efe82da9014b6e8a1922fab69808.zip"}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
