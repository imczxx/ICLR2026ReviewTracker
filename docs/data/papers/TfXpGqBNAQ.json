In causal representation learning (CRL), estimates of latent factors and their causal structure are particularly brittle to such mixing effects. We address this by denoising in a learned latent space, where the corruption approximately follows an additive noise model realized via an embedding encoder. We recover the clean latent distribution by minimizing a free-energy objective function, which couples a Kullback–Leibler divergence between the convolved clean model and the observed embedding distribution with an entropy regularizer for stability. From this objective function, we  further compute the variational derivatives, derive a weighted Wasserstein gradient, and design an explicit particle flow algorithm to carry out the latent-space denoising. The resulting denoiser functions as a drop-in module for CRL and, across noisy real-world and simulated datasets, improves overall accuracy and structural recovery relative to standard CRL baselines.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Additive noise model; Wasserstein gradient flow; Causal representation learning"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/aa7b792d09af3e8fadca903970f30c1d7d939943.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/43992326c3e867277875232fa1504f66fff6a855.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a latent-space denoising method for learning from data corrupted by unknown nonlinear mixing and noise.

The authors propose a new method called Latent-Space Denoising, which acts as a \"plug-and-play\" module upstream of an existing CRL model. The core idea is to first learn an encoder $h$ that maps noisy observations $Y = X + \\epsilon$ (where $X=f(Z)$ is the nonlinearly mixed clean data) into a latent space $U= h(Y)$. The authors justify that, via a first-order Taylor expansion, the latent representation of the noisy data can be approximated as the latent representation of the clean data plus an additive noise term: $h(Y) \\approx h(X) + J_h(X)\\epsilon$. Given this latent additive noise model, the paper proposes to recover the \"clean\" latent distribution $p(Z)$ from the \"noisy\" latent distribution $p(U)$ by minimizing a free-energy objective. This optimization is implemented using a free-energy-guided Wasserstein particle flow.

This argument is not convincing to me, as it seems to rely on the component wise identifiability of the inverse of the ground truth mixing map. Even in the noise-free cases, oftentimes the component wise identifiability cannot be guaranteed (only group wise). Even under strong conditions where the component wise identifiability can be achieved, with the additional noise in the observation, the identifiability does not automatically hold. Plus, when the noise is large the first-order Taylor approximation may not perform well.  Thus, the validity of this approximation, which is essential to the method, is not sufficiently investigated and justified.\n\nIdentifiability from Noisy Data: The paper does not theoretically address how its two-stage process (denoising then identification) impacts the identifiability guarantees of the baseline CRL model. Standard CRL identifiability results are for noise-free data. The authors need to provide justification that their denoising step successfully recovers a representation from which the true causal factors are still identifiable.\n\nLimited \"Plug-and-play\" Validation: The paper claims LSD is a \"plug-and-play\" module, but this is only demonstrated by integrating it with CCRL. To substantiate this claim, the authors should show results with other, diverse CRL methods (e.g., VAE-based or other contrastive methods) to prove its general applicability.
