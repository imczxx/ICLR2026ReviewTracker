However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often lead to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We also co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["quantization", "large language models", "model compression"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5b145e5f4092c6a123d113f3cb419de4bb0f0774.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents ParoQuant, a weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) method designed for reasoning LLMs. The core idea is to apply scaled pairwise rotation, combining independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling, to suppress outliers efficiently.

Clear and Well-Founded Motivation: The paper observes that rotating only the top 10% of the most significant weight channel pairs can achieve nearly the same reduction in quantization error as performing a full rotation. This insight eliminates a large amount of redundant computation from full matrix multiplications, leading to a much more efficient quantization process.\n\n2. Methodology with GPU-Aware Design: Building on this motivation, the authors propose a three-step design for the scaled pairwise rotation transform.\n\nStep 1: Replace costly full orthogonal matrix multiplications with a set of decomposed Givens rotations.\n\nStep 2: Eliminate inter-rotation dependencies to allow fully parallel execution on GPUs, resulting in independent rotations.\n\nStep 3: Since a single independent rotation cannot adequately capture complex weight distributions, apply a series of independent rotations combined with channel-wise scaling to improve representation and quantization accuracy.\n\n3. Practical CUDA Implementation: The paper further introduces a co-designed efficient transform kernel that maximizes GPU parallelism by executing computations across three levels:\n\nToken-level: Parallelization over the token dimension of the activation tensor.\n\nChannel-group level: Different CUDA blocks handle different groups of channels.\n\nPair level: Each rotation pair is processed by a separate CUDA thread."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Overall, I found the paper well-written and technically solid. The following are just minor curiosities rather than critical weaknesses:\n\n1. The 4-bit performance gains appear somewhat modest for certain model sizes and tasks (e.g., Perplexity and AIME). It would be interesting to see whether ParaQuant delivers more substantial improvements at lower bitwidths, such as 3-bit or 2-bit quantization.\n\n2. Do you have any insight into why E-QAT performs particularly poorly on AIME, given that ParaQuant can essentially be viewed as an extension of E-QAT with additional learnable rotations?
