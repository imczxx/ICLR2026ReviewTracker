Current approaches face several limitations in long-range TM: (i) traditional model-based image fusion methods fail to restore dynamic scenes, (ii) learning-based approaches demonstrate either inadequate distortion correction or poor deblurring performance, and (iii) simulators and synthetic training sets inadequately capture the characteristic features of long-range atmospheric turbulence. To achieve optimal restoration with minimal computation, we propose a low-cost single-frame TM pipeline featuring two key innovations: (i) a novel physically-grounded degradation simulator that enables rapid data generation while maintaining fidelity, and (ii) a simple yet effective parallel-training two-stage architecture for sequential distortion removal and deblurring. We demonstrate $4.3\\times$ acceleration in degradation simulation and a minimum $2\\times$ improvement in training efficiency compared to the baseline. Networks trained on our synthetic data consistently outperform those trained on other SOTA simulations. Our pipeline not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-frame TM but also surpasses many multi-frame approaches.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["computer vision", "image restoration", "turbulence mitigation", "long-range observation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/841649c8f89df7e4e58b389f1b3f6e7820917600.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f425e2fa90207be2ddc6b488d61de80876a877a5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a single frame turbulence restoration method along with a physics-inspired method for generating diverse turbulence data.

The finding that parallely training the de-tilt and de-blur modules retains restoration effectiveness is interesting and, to my knowledge, novel.

It does not have the same physics-grounding as previous methods, though there is benefit to having the speed and diversity and appears to positively contribute to the image reconstruction.\n\n3.

There is minimal quantitative comparison between methods on simulated data or real-world data that has some semantic metric (e.g., the text dataset by Mao et al.). Even given the limitations of turbulence comparisons, it should still be offered.\n\n2. The method appears to primarily stabilize the tilt and oversmooth regions (because it is single frame, this is expected and reasonable). The issue is that most of the testing shown is on vehicles with mostly flat details, hence the over-smoothing is not visually severe. Balancing these results with a face or text datasets or even within the dataset from Xu et al. on non-vehicles would be more convincing.\n\n3. Following the previous weakness, I anticipate multi-frame methods could recover details impacted by blur especially for static scenes. Having a sense as to the gap in performance would be convincing.\n\n4. While I regard the mask-then-conv discussion as well-written and beneficial to the paper, there is some prior work in this space. A keyword for this would be “product-convolution” versus “convolution-product”. A few papers as recent as 2024: Lauer, Deconvolution with a spatially variant PSF; Hirsh et al, Efficient filter flow for space-variant multiframe blind deconvolution; Sroubek et al., Decomposition of Space-Variant Blur in Image Deconvolution; Chimitt et al., Scattering and Gather for Spatially Varying Blurs. My intention is not to suggest the authors cite all/any of these papers, rather to present a few key references and make their own assessment.\n\n5.
