However, recent theoretical studies indicate that flatness does not universally guarantee better generalization. Instead, this paper investigates a global geometrical property for domain generalization, i.e., mode connectivity, the phenomenon where distinct local minima are connected by continuous low-loss pathways. Different from flatness, mode connectivity enables transitions from poor to superior generalization models without leaving low-loss regions. \nTo navigate these connected pathways effectively, this paper proposes a novel Billiard Optimization Algorithm (BOA), which discovers superior models by mimicking billiard dynamics. \nDuring this process, BOA operates within a low-dimensional Krylov subspace, aiming to alleviate the curse of dimensionality caused by the high-dimensional parameter space of deep models. \nFurthermore, this paper reveals that oracle test gradients strongly align with the Krylov subspace constructed from training gradients across diverse datasets and architectures. \nThis alignment offers a powerful tool to bridge training and test domains, enabling the efficient discovery of superior models with limited training domains.\nExperiments on DomainBed demonstrate that BOA consistently outperforms existing sharpness-aware and DG methods across diverse datasets and architectures.\nImpressively, BOA even surpasses the sharpness-aware minimization by 3.6\\% on VLCS when using a ViT-B/16 backbone.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Loss landscape", "mode connectivity", "Krylov space", "domain generalization"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7f2c984b8fe1f11b80ba554961ccd6941a2c8408.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/611931f5e4b451d47bbd331d5315cea57c6cce50.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "To find flat minima that perform better on the test data under distribution shift, the paper considers mode connectivity.
