However, existing LS methods struggle to balance circuit structure compactness and functional accuracy, often leading to suboptimal generation. To address this problem, we propose a novel *Circuit Program Evolution* framework, namely CircuitEvo, which iteratively leverages large language models (LLMs) to evolve circuit programs towards improved compactness while preserving functional accuracy. Specifically, CircuitEvo models the circuit graph as a structured program and leverages the strong generative capabilities of LLMs — guided by domain-specific evolutionary prompt strategies — to generate promising circuit candidates in each iteration. Moreover, a structure-aware circuit optimization module is introduced to correct functional discrepancies by appending necessary substructures to the generated circuits.  To the best of our knowledge, CircuitEvo is *the first* LLM-based LS approach that can iteratively improve a circuit's compactness while ensuring functional accuracy.  Experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that CircuitEvo can efficiently generate accurate circuits with up to 16 input number and 69 output number. Moreover, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of circuit size, achieving an average improvement of 6.74%.", "tldr": "A Graph Structured Program Evolution Framework for Circuit Generation with Large Language Models", "keywords": ["Electronic Design Automation; Logic Synthesis; Large Language Models;"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ddafab5a43c733234a849c1792da0a8ac00c1d83.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "CircuitEvo is a novel framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to iteratively evolve circuit programs, enhancing compactness while ensuring functional accuracy. ​\n\nThe paper introduces CircuitEvo, the first LLM-based logic synthesis method that improves circuit compactness and functional accuracy. ​It employs a graph-structured circuit program representation to facilitate LLM comprehension and generation. ​It integrates an evolutionary program generator and a structure-aware function optimizer in an iterative framework. ​Empirical studies show  an average improvement of 6.74% in circuit size over state-of-the-art methods. \n\n\nTask:  Given a truth table T , CircuitEvo aims to generate a circuit program P that exactly satisfies the given functionality while minimizing the number of structure lines (circuit nodes)."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The proposed graph-structured circuit program effectively encodes circuit topology and functionality in a textual format. ​\n\nThe program consists of three parts: IO definition, structure description, and function definition.\nThis representation bridges the gap between circuit graphs and language-based reasoning, enhancing LLM capabilities. ​\nThe LS problem is formulated to generate a circuit program that satisfies functionality while minimizing the number of nodes. ​\n\nEvolutionary Program Generation Process\nCircuitEvo employs an evolutionary framework to generate diverse and promising circuit programs using LLMs. ​\n\nInitializes a diverse population of accurate circuit programs through a decomposition strategy.\nUtilizes domain-specific evolutionary prompting strategies to guide LLMs in generating high-quality programs. ​\nIncorporates fitness-based population management to select the top-performing programs for subsequent iterations."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The LS summary uses very dated algorithms: existing LS approaches typically follow a generate-then optimize framework: they first generate a circuit from the truth table, then apply various operators for circuit optimization.
