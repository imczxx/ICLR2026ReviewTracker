Numerous exploration techniques strive to surmount this challenge by inciting agents to explore novel states. However, as familiarity with the environment burgeons, the novelty of states wanes, yielding an unguided exploration trajectory during later phases of learning. To surmount this quandary, this study posits that the difficulty of attaining a state functions as a more potent intrinsic motivational beacon, guiding the agent throughout the learning process. This difficulty signal encapsulates pivotal insights into the environment's underlying structure and the task's trajectory, a facet transcending the exclusive purview of state novelty. Subsequently, we introduce a reward prediction network to acquire a hybrid reward sourced from both state difficulty and novelty. Initially elevated for novel states, this reward progressively converges toward the state's inherent difficulty as visitations accumulate. This dynamic formulation assuages the scourge of catastrophic forgetting, shepherding the agent precisely across the learning odyssey. We establish the theoretical underpinnings of this reward mechanism as a distinct manifestation of reward shaping. It ensures the consistency between the learned policy and the original policy and additionally transforms the sparse reward problem into a dense reward problem, consequently accelerating the entire learning process. We evaluate the proposed Difficulty and Novelty Co-driven Exploration agent on several tasks with sparse rewards, and it consistently achieves satisfactory results.", "tldr": "A novel exploration method in Reinforcement Learning", "keywords": ["Exploration"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f13e311d84ad5d9ea7b85581ae6db8ca78a36829.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ad6b7abd5a41926868cc464505a3b8898c93d8e9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "DANCE is an intrinsic-motivation method that blends novelty with enduring difficulty: a random-target vs. learned-predictor RPN yields intrinsic reward as prediction error, which is high for new states and, with revisits, converges to the state’s steps-to-reach (difficulty), thus sustaining exploration.

The core idea is to combine state novelty and difficulty to maintain exploration signals throughout training. The method introduces a Reward Prediction Network (RPN), structurally similar to Random Network Distillation (RND), consisting of a fixed random target network and a predictor network trained to minimise prediction error. Unlike RND, the target embedding in DANCE is augmented with a “difficulty” signal proportional to the number of steps taken to reach each state. The resulting intrinsic reward is high for novel states early in training and converges to the state’s difficulty value as familiarity increases, thus preventing the intrinsic signal from vanishing. The authors provide theoretical analysis interpreting DANCE as a form of potential-based reward shaping that preserves policy invariance, and claim that the approach transforms sparse-reward problems into dense-reward ones.
