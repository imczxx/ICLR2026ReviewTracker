Despite their importance, predicting NC base pairs remains challenging due to the absence of a standardized benchmark for systematic evaluation. To address this, we introduce NC-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to NC base-pair prediction. NC-Bench provides 925 curated RNA sequences with 6,708 high-quality NC annotations, fine-grained edge and orientation classification tasks, and IsoScore-based embedding evaluation, offering a rigorous foundation for systematic assessment. Building on this, we propose NCfold, a dual-branch framework that couples sequence features with structural priors derived from RNA foundation models (RFMs) via Representative Embedding Fusion (REF) and REF-weighted self-attention. This closed-loop design iteratively refines sequence and structure representations, alleviating data sparsity and enhancing predictive accuracy.  Experiments on NC-Bench show that NCfold outperforms existing methods, with zero-shot and ablation studies confirming its effectiveness and underscoring the need for NC-specific benchmarks.

In the Introduction, the authors support their new benchmark with the claim that previous methods are “primarily designed for canonical base-pairs” predictions. I do not agree with this statement. Already early DL methods like [1] clearly state in their Abstract:\n\n>[...] Here, we propose the use of deep contextual learning for base-pair prediction including those noncanonical and non-nested (pseudoknot) base pairs stabilized by tertiary interactions. [...]\n\nFollowing methods like [2-4] continue leveraging the advantage of DL methods to output an L x L matrix which allows them to include nc-pairs but also pseudoknots and even multiplets. So these methods can predict all kinds of nucleotide interactions in general. The performance on nc-interactions, however, remains far behind the performance for canonical pairs. To the best of my knowledge, even the used baseline provided in [5] outputs ct files, which allows them to predict all kinds of nucleotide interactions. The prediction quality then mainly depends on the chosen weights (see questions).\n\nHowever, I generally agree that the LW-classification is missing in all these approaches.\n\n2. I’m particularly concerned about the data set construction. The authors use mmseqs to reduce redundancy between datapoints. However, the splitting of the data into train, validation, and test is not further defined. There was a lot of work recently that showed that careful data splitting is an essential part during evaluation of learning-based methods for RNA secondary structure prediction [6-9]. In this regard, I cannot fully trust the reported results. At least two recent RNA benchmarks tackle the problem of data curation for different tasks [10, 11]. In particular, RNA3DB would be a perfect fit here, since it provides a strong split based on RNA families, is based on PDB samples, and the authors could run their exact same data processing pipeline to extract pairs.\n3. Following up on this: Why do the authors exclude all WC interactions? This strongly reduces the practical usefulness of NC-Bench and makes the evaluation look a bit like it is constructed for NCFold. I agree that this procedure increases the focus on NC pairs, and from Fig4, we clearly see that there is need to improve these predictions, but it would be much more interesting (and challenging) to improve NC-pair predictions alongside general pair predictions. There could still be an option to only evaluate NC-pairs, but there is no need to exclude other pairs from the start.\n4. For a  benchmark, the API is one of the major aspects (Is it easy to use? Can I integrate it into my research without any effort?) and so is reproducibility (How is the data processed exactly? Is this all in line with the results in the paper?). I would encourage the authors to publish the code anonymously. Today, that is really easy to do (e.g. via https://anonymous.4open.science/) and allows reviewers (and only reviewers) to check the code.\n5. Generally, I'm not convinced that the proposed integration (and ranking) of multiple embeddings from RFMs is a giant step forward from the methodological perspective, even if the ranking approach via IsoScore is interesting.\n\n**Minor**:\n1. It would be interesting to see how far pseudoknots are considered here. Using PDB samples, we typically see a lot of non-canonical interactions and these include pseudoknots and base multiplets. I think these details should be shown somewhere in the paper.\n\n[1] Singh, J., Hanson, J., Paliwal, K., & Zhou, Y. (2019).

What was the rationale for using IsoScore as a score for embedding quality? Why not use some embedding metrics as e.g. described in [12] for DNA Language Models? I’m not super familiar with the current literature on RFM embeddings, but it seems that there are multiple approaches available to study the embedding quality and the cited paper for IsoScore from 2021 appears quite old when considering the recent progress in FM research.\n3. As far as I can see, the matrix input in the REF-weighted self-attention is processed with convolutions to get a more local view. Did the authors also test other architectural choices?

Direct RNA 3D structure prediction remains challenging, with all-atom models still showing limited performance due to the limited availability of 3D structures.

Predicting non-canonicals (often termed 2.5D) provides a lot of useful structural detail and might be a better prediction target than full 3D for the time being.
