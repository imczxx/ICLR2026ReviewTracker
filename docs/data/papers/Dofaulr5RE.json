The primary challenge of GON arises from the need to construct a Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map to understand the environment while simultaneously localizing an unobserved goal. Existing map-based methods typically employ self-centered semantic maps, often facing challenges such as reliance on complete maps or inconsistent semantic association. To this end, we propose Plug-and-Play Label Map Diffusion (PLMD), which defines a novel map completion diffusion model based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). PLMD generates obstacle and semantic labels for unobserved regions through a diffusion-based completion process, thereby enabling goal localization even in partially observed environments. Moreover, it mitigates inconsistent semantic association by leveraging structural consistency between known and unknown obstacle layouts and integrating obstacle priors into the semantic denoising process. By substituting predicted labels for unobserved regions, robots can accurately localize the specified objects.

PLMD’s \"obstacle-guided diffusion\" is a minor modification of existing diffusion-based map completion (Ji et al., 2024).

High computational overhead: PLMD’s FLOPs (34.5G) are an order of magnitude higher than lightweight navigation models (e.g., SemExp’s 3.1G). The paper only mentions \"periodic activation\" (every 50 steps) as an optimization but does not propose model compression (e.g., quantization, pruning) to improve real-time performance, which is critical for robot navigation. More experiments are required.\n\n3. The authors admit most failures stem from localization errors due to bad semantic segmentation, but PLMD does not include mechanisms to mitigate this (e.g., multi-modal fusion, uncertainty estimation for segmentation). This makes the module fragile in scenarios with low-quality RGB-D inputs.\n\n4.

During the rebuttal period, we follow your suggestions and try to deal with your concerns from the following aspects:\n\n1. In response to reviewer **3tou**'s feedback, we conducted three additional experiments: First, we evaluated five weight distributions on HM3D and MP3D, confirming that the original weights of 0.5/0.4/0.1 remain optimal for both SR and SPL. Second, we supplemented experiments on PLMD's generalization to open-vocabulary goals, finding that replacing the original closed-vocabulary semantic segmentation tool with Grounded SAM improves navigation performance for unseen categories (e.g., lamp, toy car). Finally, ablation experiments with varying diffusion steps confirmed T=100 achieves the optimal balance between inference time and generation quality, reducing total time while maintaining navigation performance.\n2. Based on reviewer **bH3K**'s feedback, we refined descriptions of the training and validation sets in Sections 3.2, A.3, A.5, and A.6.\n3. Following reviewer **trH3**'s suggestions, we improve the writing of the paper. Section 3.2 now includes additional details on training the obstacle map network. Additionally, we added computational efficiency analysis for reinforcement learning methods like ON/MRON. Section A.8 now include time distribution data for PLMD across RL-based ON/MRON tasks, demonstrating its computational overhead remains within acceptable limits.\n4. In response to reviewer **SDaV**'s feedback, we clarified the importance of obstacle constraints for pure semantic diffusion methods in sparse BEV maps within the introduction. Then we conduct model quantization experiments. Results show that quantized FLOPs are significantly reduced without notable computational efficiency gains, while navigation performance and map quality deteriorate, confirming that navigation latency is primarily determined by the planner.\n5. Following suggestions from reviewers **3tou, trH3, and SDaV,** we further refined theoretical clarifications and elaborations in related work.\n\nFinally, we would like to thank the four anonymous reviewers once again for their invaluable comments and suggestions, which substantially enhanced the technical quality and clarity of our manuscript.

Why don't you predict them simultaneously?\n4)Why is the time efficiency computed with the method based on LLM/LVM? If LLM/LVM is introduced as the navigation strategy, its potential for predicting goal location should be evaluated and compared, not singly as a navigation strategy.

The primary objection I have is that the training process for the diffusion model appears to be entirely in the same environment as the test evaluation, as given by \"we generate training and validation data from label maps collected during the interaction of robot with the environment. First, we randomly initialize a starting position within indoor environments\" and \"To train the PLMD, we collect obstacle and semantic maps of size 256×256 through the Habitat simulator\". Allowing the system to go and build a diffusion model of the environment is fundamentally no different (and arguably harder) than allowing the robot to go and build a map ahead of time. This paper could only be of interest if there had been any attempt to test in one environment and evaluate in another, different environment. The authors do not even appear to have partitioned the environment into disjoint train and test areas.\n\nSecondly, the experimental results are very unclear. How is the map updated?  What (simulated) sensor data is used? It is not clear why success is not 100% -- if the goal object is not at the predicted location, does the mission terminate? That is not a particularly useful setting for this problem -- a far more useful (and common) setting is where diffusion model is used as a prior, and expected costs are calculated using the model as a prior, iterating via replanning until the goal is found.\n\nThe paper focuses on finding goals in unknown maps, but does not compare against the fairly large literature in robotics that addresses that problem, and primarily compares itself against RL and other diffusion approaches. It would be interesting to compare against the planning under uncertainty work that leverages structured models (e.g., work by Greg Stein, Nikolay Atanasov, Luca Carlone, etc.).\n\nIf the paper had focused entirely on the problem of map prediction and not the navigation problem, I might be more in favour of this paper, but even viewed in that light, the contribution is relatively modest. The paper presents results that indicate that the two-level label map captures \"the contextual relationship between obstacles and semantic features\" but this seems to be a statement that explicitly modelling the relationship between obstacles and semantics provides a better model overall, which has been known for sometime in the semantic SLAM community."}, "questions": {"value": "- Why does the robot not succeed 100% of the time?

The absence of these measurements limits the assessment of the method’s engineering practicality and deployability. It is recommended to include additional validation experiments reporting average inference latency and GPU resource usage to demonstrate the real-time feasibility of the proposed approach in embodied intelligence scenarios.\n- The paper claims that PLMD is a “general-purpose navigation enhancement method,” but all experiments are conducted primarily on closed-set semantic datasets. The model has not been evaluated on open-vocabulary tasks, zero-shot or few-shot transfer scenarios, nor has its performance been verified across different datasets or real-world environments. This weakens the evidence supporting the claim of generality.
