However, evaluating these policies typically requires large-scale sampling in simulation benchmarks, leading to high time costs. Moreover, existing evaluation pipelines are usually fixed, do not account for user needs, and report only a single scalar score, lacking interpretability. In contrast, human experts can quickly form an intuitive impression of a policy’s capabilities from just a handful of executions. We therefore propose ManipEvalAgent, an efficient, promptable, and dynamically multi-round evaluation framework for robotic manipulation policies. The framework conducts small-batch, multi-round evaluations and adaptively plans subsequent evaluation steps based on intermediate observations from each round. Via code generation, it constructs tasks and evaluation functions within simulator. By generating evaluation functions and leveraging vision–language models (VLMs) for video understanding, ManipEvalAgent provides user-instruction-centric, fine-grained analysis. Our approach offers three key advantages: (1) efficiency, no need for massive sampling; (2) promptable, planning the evaluation process according to user queries; and (3) interpretability, providing diagnostic text that goes beyond a single score. Across multiple settings, our evaluation method significantly shortens the overall time compared with traditional simulation benchmarks, while reaching conclusions comparable to those from large-scale simulation benchmarks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Robotic manipulation", "Evaluation", "Agent"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5c8bb412f70ef3a7a9a2a716f4baeffed70cd9e7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes ManipEvalAgent, a promptable, multi-agent framework to evaluate robotic manipulation policies.

Users can ask specific questions about how they want their policy evaluated, like \"how robust is my policy to variations in object colors?\", and the simulation engine will use AI models to piece together simulation assets and call simulation APIs to construct a series of scenes that test the user's query. The simulation engine analyzes results evaluating a policy on a scene it created, and then based on the results decides what scene to construct next for evaluation. The main motivation the authors propose for having such an agentic evaluation platform is that simulated evaluations take quite a long time to run, and at the end you usually just get back one numerical score specifying how well your policy did, and so it's hard to debug what exactly the policy does/doesn't do well. In evaluating their AI-based evaluation platform, the authors find that indeed time can be saved, with baseline simulated evaluation platforms taking 2+ hours to evaluate, but the proposed approach taking ~45 minutes. Rankings of policies on the proposed adaptable benchmark also correlate with rankings on previous widely used simulation benchmarks."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "(1) It is often the case that researchers want to learn what a policy they've trained does well at, and what it fails at, and there can be a lot of nuance in where the policy fails/does well. At the same time existing evaluation platforms usually just output a single numerical score, making it hard for the researcher to get this more nuanced insight into the performance of their policy. This paper proposes an approach by which the evaluation platform can respond to user queries and adaptively build a set of tasks to benchmark on that will answer the question.\n\n(2) The evaluation system seems well engineered and complete from the paper's description of it.\n\n(3) Simulated scenes/assets usually fall prey to difficulties of scale, spurring recent work in procedural generation. This paper's evaluation platform can viewed as another instance of procedural generation, which makes it more scalable."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "(1) While the proposed simulation benchmark can foreseeably be useful to researchers for model development and debugging, from my understanding it will be difficult to use it as a *benchmark*. Because the benchmark is not static, and the scenes/tasks change based on user queries, it becomes difficult to compare various methods objectively. Further, even if the same prompt is used (i.e., \"evaluate how good my policy is on pick and place tasks\") the AI-powered evaluation platform may be non-deterministic and thus generate different scenes for different policies, again preventing comparisons.\n\n(2) While the idea is interesting, the premise that a new simulation evaluation platform should be built at all is in my opinion problematic. There are several simulation benchmarks for robotic manipulation, and much work has tried to develop robotic policies that push the frontier of these benchmarks. However there is no guarantee that good performance on these simulation benchmarks translates to good real world robotic performance (which generally is what the robotics community is aiming for), and so a new simulation benchmark misses the forest for the trees, and promotes the optimization of a metric that does not necessarily have great correlation with the fundamental scientific questions researchers are interested in answering -- how well do policies do on real-world tasks. In my opinion there is still room for simulated evaluation benchmarks, like hyper-realistic benchmarks that very accurately model real world physics/visuals, but this work does not tackle that problem.\n\n(3) Table 2 shows how well the ranking of policies produced by the proposed benchmark correlate with rankings of the same policies on previous simulation benchmarks. The correlation does not seem to be very strong, and even if it was, correlation with prior simulations shouldn't even be a metric to optimize, because there is no evidence that those prior simulations correlate with the real world.\n\n(4) The motivation that time can be saved with the proposed benchmark is not a great motivation. Simulation evaluation platforms are generally considered to be cheap (relative to real-world evaluations, hence their appeal), and a drop in evaluation time from 2 hours to 45 minutes isn't very substantial."}, "questions": {"value": "(1) How can the proposed agentic simulated evaluation system be used as a benchmark, which as far as I understand is the goal of the work (see weakness (1))?\n\n(2) Table 3 shows how often the evaluation platform fails to evaluate the policy (e.g., due to AI issues). While it doesn't fail often, which is good, when it does fail what should the user do to get their policy evaluated?\n\n(3) The evaluation makes use of VQA models in various parts -- what happens if the VQA model makes mistakes? How does this affect the set up of the evaluation and the results? Can the results still be useful to researchers if the VQA model can make mistakes?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "cjM0DMmnFr", "forum": "3u6AkbWEls", "replyto": "3u6AkbWEls", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1192/Reviewer_8VKw"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1192/Reviewer_8VKw"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1192/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762116704905, "cdate": 1762116704905, "tmdate": 1762915702428, "mdate": 1762915702428, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
