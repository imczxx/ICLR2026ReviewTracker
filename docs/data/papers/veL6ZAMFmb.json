We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\\to0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.", "tldr": "We introduce an anisotropic forward noise operator in diffusion models, theoretically showing score correctness under full frequency support and empirically demonstrating improved generation via tailored inductive biases.", "keywords": ["diffusion models", "score-based generative modeling", "methods", "inductive bias", "image generation", "sampling", "spectral methods"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f6cdcfc3c39df7456c1c0053a6ea4df0b9dc5635.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c444ada4eacd79a862ab395e24441ccba11b5a1d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper explores introducing anisotropic noise to the forward process of diffusion models, as a method of controlling the inductive biases present during training to better match that of the training data.

The theoretical results only show that the true data distribution can be recovered, but it does not provide any reason for why adding anisotropic noise would be helpful in training and sampling of diffusion models. It would be more compelling if there are results showing what is the optimal noise to add for any given data statistics (e.g. average power spectral density).\n3.

While SAGD is designed to put inductive bias on the frequency of noise, it is unclear why this is necessary for real-world image data.

Therefore, I recommend the authors to give frequency distributions of images in real-world image datasets like CIFAR, ImageNet etc. to further demonstrate the motivation.\n2. **Lacking Experiment** on real-world image datasets. The model does not benefit much on real-world image datasets (like CIFAR), or benefits very little from the proposed method (like FFHQ), and the manuscript does not show more experiments in more common-used large-scale datasets like ImageNet or so. I recommend the authors to consider providing experimental results at least on ImageNet, and preferably on even larger datasets like LAION or MSCOCO.\n3. **Unclear Applications**. Since most of the experiments are done either on specific (hand-drawn) datasets or on corrupted datasets, it is quite unclear how SAGD could help to advance the diffusion-based models.

The key innovation is to steer which frequency bands are destroyed during the forward process, thereby embedding explicit inductive biases about what information the model should focus on learning.

The computational overhead is negligible.\n\n\n3).

Some of the recent works have not been cited. \n\n\n2). I would like to know, when w(f) strongly suppresses or amplifies certain bands, does this cause numerical instability or poor conditioning in the FFT/IFFT pipeline?\n\n\n3). I would like to know why authors specifically normalizes the coordinates to (-0.5,0.5)? Additionally, as the power-law weighting depends on the magnitude of the normalized frequency, would the same still be optimal if the FFT were parameterized on (-1,1) ? If so,\nhow should w(f) be rescaled to make results invariant to the frequency normalization convention? In other computer vision areas that use normalized coordinates, the coordinate normalization range plays a crucial role in overcoming spectral bias.\n\n\n4). Did authors explore data-driven approaches to design or adapt w(f) automatically?\n\n\n5). While the paper conceptually distinguishes SAGD from prior anisotropic or colored-noise diffusion approaches, it does not include quantitative comparisons with these methods. I feel a direct empirical comparison with conceptually similar published works\nespecially recent anisotropic diffusion or noise-shaping models would be necessary to fully assess the proposed method’s performance and novelty.\n\n6). The paper introduces anisotropic noise using an FFT-based approach to modify noise in the frequency domain. However, as I understood, this ultimately produces spatially correlated noise in the image, why is the frequency-domain formulation necessary?
