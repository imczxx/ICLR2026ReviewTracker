We introduce a formalization of the concept of game mechanics that operationalizes mechanic-learning as a causal counterfactual inference task and uses the causal consistency principle to address the challenge of generating gameplay with world models that do not violate game rules. We present Multiverse Mechanica, a playable video game testbed that implements a set of ground truth game mechanics based on our causal formalism. The game natively emits training data, where each training example is paired with a set of causal DAGs that encode causality, consistency, and counterfactual dependence specific to the mechanic that is in play—these provide additional artifacts that could be leveraged in mechanic-learning experiments. We provide a proof-of-concept that demonstrates fine-tuning a pre-trained model that targets mechanic learning.

The model starts by framing the problem as learning from video, then reduces that to a few input frames. Unfortunately, the evaluation metrics do not touch on the central question of whether the generated data was neccessary or sufficient for causal learning. Under questions I offer some suggestions on what experiments could help directly test this core idea. With development I believe these would be a strong launching point for the ideas to see further development and extension.\n\n# clarity\nThe notation often was confusing and cluttered, rather than clarifying on the formalism.

Given the established criteria of how well the model predicts outcomes given information on the intervention:\n\t- As a base experiment, remove all visual information (or map it as a single pixel indicating each state) and demonstrate the core claims. This setting decouples model representational learning capacity from causal learning. Then demonstrate that the model trained with equivalent amounts of level-1, level-2, and level-3 data shows the expected pattern of succeeding in tests only with level-3 and not the prior levels.

The game is reasonably complex from the perspective of the contained mechanics, requiring reasoning on spell types, elemental affinities, weapon classes and equipment to make decision on taken damages. At the same time, its visual simplicity and ability to produce \"impact frames\" make it convenient for small scale ablations. This can constitute a good benchmark or tool for ablations for future works.\n- The paper seems polished and detailed.

The authors make every effort to introduce the formalism, but the paper might not easily accessible to the broad generative models audience.\n- The employed logic formalism appears difficult to define even for a relatively simple game as the one created by the authors. A concern is whether the proposed formalism and methodology could eventually scale to modeling the more complex game mechanics encountered in mainstream video game titles. If such possibility is not foreseen, the impact of the method could be limited. I could see a use for the formalism in evaluating in a rigorous way video sequences for the purpose of determining if a model has learned the described mechanic correctly, but I don't see an easy way of scaling training as performed in Sec 5 on a more complex scenario.\n- The proof of concept model shown in Sec. 5 is built based on the assumption that contrasts are known, a condition that is satisfied for the proposed synthetic data generator. For example, it proposes a seed consistency loss aligning noise for samples across contrasts and a structure alignment loss. These components would be difficult to leverage in the context of large scale video generation methods, which would be the ultimate models on which to perform evaluation for game mechanics understanding, but that would require large amounts of data for which contrasts would be very difficult to derive.\n- The experimental setting with respect to employed metrics and experimental setting is unclear, making it difficult to interpret results. I suggest authors to describe each of the employed metrics and its computation procedure.\n- Interpretation of the experimental results is difficult because of the lack of baselines or ablations.

It remains unclear whether the framework scales to multiple simultaneous mechanics or to other base models. Again, this should work in principle, but empirical evidence is still lacking.\n\n- In terms of empirical validation, the paper also lacks ablation and baseline comparisons. Since the new loss formulation is one of the main contributions, it would be highly beneficial to show what happens when either the seed-consistency (L1) or structure-alignment (L2) term is removed, and to compare against simpler alternatives (for example, standard fine-tuning or contrastive alignment).\n\n- Finally, the evaluation metrics are indirect.
