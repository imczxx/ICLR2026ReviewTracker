We formalize this intuition with ReMax, an objective that evaluates a policy by the expected maximum return over $M$ samples ($M \\in \\mathbb{N}$), while accounting for return uncertainty. Optimizing this objective induces stochastic exploration as an emergent property, without explicit bonus terms. For efficient policy optimization, we derive a new policy-gradient formulation for ReMax and introduce ReMax PPO (RePPO), a PPO variant that optimizes ReMax while generalizing the discrete retry count $M$ to a continuous parameter $m > 0$, enabling fine-grained control of exploration. Empirically, RePPO promotes exploration without bonuses and outperforms entropy-regularized PPO on the MinAtar benchmark.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Exploration", "Policy gradient"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/315c7a56f126f561986818ec8d97cdbf897b7527.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/77d7444b6d93a84305fc32757015d1958ee87eb7.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes ReMax objective to train explorative reinforcement learning policy.
