However, their applications remain limited due to: (i) current successes being primarily confined to 2D segmentation tasks—we observe that diffusion models tend to collapse at the early stage when applied to 3D medical tasks; and (ii) the inherently isolated iteration along timesteps during training and inference. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel framework named Cross-Timestep, which incorporates two key innovations: an Adaptive Priori Decoding Strategy (APDS) and a trans-temporal memory LSTM (tLSTM) mechanism. (i) The APDS provides prior guidance during the diffusion process by employing a Priori Decoder(PD) that focuses solely on the conditional branch, successfully stabilizing the reverse diffusion process. (ii) The tLSTM integrates convolution and linear layers into the LSTM gating structure, and enhances the memory cell mechanism to retain temporal state, explicitly preserving and propagating continuous temporal states across timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that Cross-Timestep performs favorably on heterogeneous 3D medical datasets. Three real-world cases further analyze the collapse phenomenon in 3D medical diffusion models and validate that APDS effectively prevents initial-stage collapse without excessively constraining the model, while tLSTM facilitates the performance and scalability of diffusion models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diffusion Models; Medical Image Segmentation; LSTM"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8344c10f7afe7aa268b19546920201ffbee845a1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a 3D diffusion framework for medical image segmentation that addresses the instability of conventional diffusion models when applied to volumetric data.

Identifying an Under-Explored Problem: The paper identifies and addresses the \"initial-stage collapse\" problem in 3D medical diffusion models. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the authors show that standard 3D diffusion models fail when sampling from high-noise timesteps, but succeed when starting from mid-level noise. This finding renders the proposed Adaptive Priori Decoding Strategy (APDS) an intuitively appealing and well-motivated solution.\n2. Achieving SOTA Performance: The paper thoughtfully combines effective components (SC-tLSTM and FFT-tLSTM) to create a powerful, stateful denoiser. This architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on two multi-center 3D datasets (LNCTVSeg (CT) and OAseg (MRI)), demonstrating the framework's robustness and practical utility."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited Architectural Novelty: The proposed framework appears to be a complex integration of existing and well-established components, rather than a new algorithmic contribution. \n    + On the SC-tLSTM: The core idea of tLSTM is to apply a recurrent model (LSTM or GRU) to maintain a state across the diffusion timesteps. However, the combination of tLSTM and diffusion models tends to be inelegant. It forces an external, stateful memory (tLSTM) onto the diffusion model's fundamentally Markovian process, which seems unjustified from a theoretical standpoint. As demonstrated by prior work [1], LSTM-based U-Net backbones have already been explored and proven effective for 3D medical segmentation. The SC-tLSTM module itself appears to be a straightforward combination of the standard spatial-channel attention mechanism [2] and the tLSTM component.\n    + On the FFT-tLSTM: The novelty of FFT-tLSTM is questionable. Leveraging the frequency domain (via FFT) within a diffusion model framework for medical image segmentation has already been published [3]. The proposed FFT-tLSTM thus appears to be a minor variation that simply inserts the tLSTM components into an established FFT pipeline.\n    + On the APDS: The APDS uses a segmentation decoder that operates solely on the conditional image to generate a coarse structural prior. This concept of using the conditional input to create explicit guidance is a well-established technique in conditional diffusion models and thus cannot be regarded as a significant innovation.\nThe authors should more clearly highlight their components' algorithmic novelty over prior research. They should also strengthen the explanation of how the integration of these modules provides synergistic benefits that validate their effectiveness.\n\n2. Insufficient Experimental Validation\n    * Lack of Comparative Qualitative Visualizations: The paper's quantitative claims are not supported by adequate qualitative evidence. While Appendix G (Fig. 10) shows the proposed model's output, it fails to provide essential side-by-side visual comparisons against the SOTA baselines. Without these direct comparisons, it is impossible to qualitatively assess the model's claimed advantages.\n    * Missing Computational Cost Analysis: The framework introduces significant architectural complexity (e.g., APDS, tLSTMs) without any analysis of the computational overhead. The authors should provide metrics on training/inference time and GPU memory usage. This information is crucial for evaluating the method's practical feasibility and understanding the trade-off between performance and efficiency.\n    * Inadequate Comparison with State-of-the-Art Diffusion Models: The authors cite Diff-UNet [4] in the related work section, which makes their omission from the quantitative comparison a significant weakness. I strongly recommend the authors include comparisons against these recent diffusion-based models [4-6]. Such a comparison is essential to properly benchmark the \"Cross-Timestep\" framework and convincingly validate its claimed segmentation superiority.\n\n3. Clarity and Writing Quality\n    * Discrepancy in Abstract: The abstract explicitly claims: \"Three real-world cases further analyze the collapse phenomenon...\".
