Post-hoc explanation methods, such as Class Activation Mapping (CAM), were developed to enhance interpretability by highlighting important regions in input images. However, existing methods often treat internal representation (feature maps or patch tokens) as independent and equally important, neglecting their semantic interactions, which can result in irrelevant or noisy signals in the explanation. To overcome these limitations, we propose ClusCAM, a gradient-free post-hoc explanation method that groups internal representations into meaningful clusters, referred to as meta-representations. We then quantify their importance using logit differences with dropout and temperature-scaled softmax to focus on the most influential groups. By modeling group-wise interactions, ClusCAM produces sharper and more interpretable explanations. The approach is architecture-agnostic and applicable to both Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers. Through our extensive experiments, ClusCAM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up to 17.8\\% and 27.87\\% improvement in Increase in Confidence and Average Gain, respectively, and produces visualizations more faithful to the model's prediction.", "tldr": "We propose a new gradient-free and CAM-based explanation method in image classification, this method can work well on both CNNs and transformer-based models.", "keywords": ["explainability", "class activation mapping", "vision models", "image classification"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c9551990df535baf9487feae208287824d081bbe.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7ea7e8547d121cc6590da7baa2ff41bbd682c0ad.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper is aiming at enhancing the XAI of CNNs and ViTs. The idea is to cluster the representations into K groups, then upsample and normalize them to be the same size as the input, and use them as a soft mask of the input. Then aggregate the difference between the logit activation of the masked input and the benign one. This approach is treating in a weighted manner the different concepts of the input. It is like projecting the input into concepts and highlight mostly the dominant ones."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "* XAI is a very important topic, especially nowadays when it is crucial to better understand the inner process of networks.\n* The Related Work section is detailed and informative, and the academic gap is well explained.\n* The idea of combining concept fetching with explainability is intriguing."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* The approach is written as if it can be applied for both CNNs and ViTs. One of the gaps mentioned is that current approaches is overlooking weighting when aggregating representations. While it might hold for CNNs it is not true in ViTs, see for example [1], [2] and [3]. Moreover there is a large amount of dedicated approaches for XAI specifically on ViT which is failed to be mentioned.\n* The method is primarily empirical with lack of intuitive explanation on the considerations for why applying each step behind it. For example why specifically using Kmeans++ (and not any other clustering scheme?)? why the element-wise product between the meta-representation to the input represents? Why is formula 5 is reasonable? what if it would be division? why removing the r% least important meta representations? (If they are not important for the classification, then they do not have impact anyway). In general it might be OK when there is empirical progression, however in my opinion it should come along with intuitive explanation so that follow-up researcher could extend your ideas. In my opinion it is lack in the current submission.\n* Most of the enhancement is of very empirical steps like filtering out less relevant projections. I believe the authors need to clearly separate the conceptual novelty from the empirical contributions and to focus more on the conceptual contribution. Most of the paper elaborate on the empirical steps, which is with less academic improvement.\n\nMinor weaknesses:\n* confusing notations. H and W represent the input dimensions while h and w represent the representation dimensions. I would select other notations to make it clearer.\n* The placement of visualizations is a bit awkward. For example, the algorithm is presented before the algorithm itself is explained.\n* The initials ViT is more common for Vision Transformers than VT.\n* r is used both for the ratio of the dropout and for the percentage of meta-representations to filter.\n* What is the meaning of the colors in Fig. 2? If it is just to indicate different meta-representations, then it is not so clear.\n\nrefs:\n\n[1] Transformer interpretability beyond attention visualization, Chefer et al.

How do you think your approach will be affected from this? specifically Im curious on the hard clustering step which i assume that will cause hard selection for a certain \"meaning\".\n* The clustering stage is closely related to concept clustering which typically implemented through Sparse AutoEncoders (SAE). Have you tried implement it with SAEs ([2] for example but there are a lot of papers in this topic)? If so, then what are the results? If no, I would recommend try it since it is always better to lean on a grounded approaches.\n* How does the normalization is done? Which method of Upsampling is applied?\n* Why is M_j represents importance? The element-wise multiplication explained as a sort of soft masking when M is the soft mask matrix. Implicitly it is referred that the magnitude of the representation represents importance (personally I agree with this observation), but in your view, why do you think it holds?\n* Why do you selected using dropout to filter out outliers? It is statistical operator, it can in some cases not filter them at all? Moreover, it is not a good practice that the inference is random (depend on the seed). It was found that \"registers\" might be the cause for outlier heads in ViT [3], at least for ViT it can be the starting point to find this outliers systematically instead of filter them statistically.\n\n\nIn general, I think that the paper is too much empirical in his nature, and the authors should clearly distill the pure conceptual contribution from the empirical steps. In some cases it is even better to get a method which is a bit less good in performance but much more understandable. In the case of your approach, I think that the approach is too empirical such that it is very hard to isolate the pure contribution. Moreover, I think that the authors should focus more on explaining the intuitions behind the approach steps, and to make it clearer what information is better seized using your approach.\n\nrefs:\n\n[1] Interpreting the Second-Order Effects of Neurons in CLIP.

The initial K-Means++ clustering of internal representations increases inference time, particularly for large-scale models. Although ClusCAM can operate faster than exhaustive ablation-based approaches like Score-CAM and Ablation-CAM when applied to Vision Transformers (ViTs), its computational cost still limits scalability in real-time or resource-constrained environments. Moreover, while the paper proposes data-driven strategies for selecting key hyperparameters, these procedures are primarily heuristic and lack a strong theoretical foundation, leaving room for further formal analysis and optimization."}, "questions": {"value": "While the proposed method demonstrates several notable strengths, I have some concerns regarding its broader applicability and theoretical grounding. For instance, gradient-based analyses still provide valuable information for enhancing output probabilities, as they capture model sensitivity through backward propagation. It would be worthwhile to investigate whether ClusCAM could be integrated with gradient-based interpretability approaches, since many state-of-the-art explanation frameworks leverage both forward and backward reasoning. Although the reported results indicate that ClusCAM outperforms several contemporary baselines, a more comprehensive comparison with recent state-of-the-art model, such as Attention-Guided CAM (AAAI 2024) combining forward and backward attention mechanisms to suppress noise in Vision Transformer, would further strengthen the empirical validation of this work. Additionally, for small target objects, the hyperparameter, particularly the number of clusters, may have a significant impact on the interpretability and stability of the resulting explanations, and this sensitivity warrants further analysis. For the temperature-scaled softmax, ClusCAM uses a τ value less than one. I agree that without temperature scaling, the softmax weights can become overly uniform. However, a low τ amplifies noisy or erroneous signals. Therefore, it would be beneficial to validate this behavior using test images that contain large homogeneous backgrounds with small target objects."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "pMvnnu0Xa3", "forum": "MYGtEADPUs", "replyto": "MYGtEADPUs", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18606/Reviewer_ztRk"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18606/Reviewer_ztRk"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18606/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761472350289, "cdate": 1761472350289, "tmdate": 1762928321418, "mdate": 1762928321418, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper propose ClusCAM, a gradient-free post-hoc explanation method that groups internal representations into meaningful clusters (meta-representations).
