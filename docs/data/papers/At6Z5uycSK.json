In this paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph. Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on the selected subgraphs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph Classification", "Sparse Learning", "Graph Mining", "Deep Learning"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cdd8bb3b6495c2150e8637af310ab4310e33e1de.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes EIN, a graph-level prediction model that (i) represents each training graph by exact subgraph-isomorphism features (SIF) over all subgraphs up to size maxpat, (ii) learns a small, task-specific set of predictive subgraphs via group-sparse (ℓ₂,₁) regularization in a Graph Mining Layer (GML), and (iii) trains an FFN head on the selected SIF.

The most recent baseline used in this paper is from 2019, while newer works exist that need to be used as baselines [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].\n\n· The ablation studies are minor (frequency vs binary, deeper FFN, etc.)\n\n· The entire framework seems to be dependent on the maxpat hyperparameter (maximum subgraph size). The computational complexity grows combinatorially with maxpat. The paper uses maxpat=10, but many meaningful substructures in domains like chemistry (e.g., functional groups) or social networks (e.g., small communities) might require larger patterns to be discriminative. The method provides no scalable path to discover these.\n\n· Theorem 2.1 shows that the effectiveness of the pruning hinges on the UB(H) being reasonably tight. If UB(H) is a loose over-estimate, the pruning will be far less effective than claimed, as many branches of the gSpan tree that should be pruned\n\nwill not be. The paper provides no analysis or empirical evidence regarding the tightness of this bound across different datasets.\n\n· The results for EIN+GIN are presented, but the analysis is shallow. It is unclear how the GNN and EIN components interact. Does the GNN learn complementary features that the subgraph features miss? Does the presence of the GNN change which subgraphs are selected by EIN? A deeper analysis of this interaction is needed to justify the combined architecture.\n\n· The method is fundamentally limited by the subgraph enumeration process. Even with a high pruning rate, the number of traversed nodes and the total computation time are immense. For example, the Cycle_XOR dataset, which only has 600 graphs, required over 10000s to train. This is orders of magnitude slower than standard GNNs. The approach does not scale to large-scale graph datasets like those in molecular biology or social networks, where graphs can have hundreds of nodes. \n\n\n\n[1] Yu, Zhaoning, and Hongyang Gao. \"Molecular representation learning via heterogeneous motif graph neural networks.\" International conference on machine learning.
