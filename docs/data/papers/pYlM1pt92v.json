However, these models are inherently limited in that a vast amount of information in biology exists as text, which they are unable to leverage. There have therefore been several recent works that propose the use of LLMs as an alternative to single-cell foundation models, achieving competitive results. However, there is little understanding of what factors drive this performance, along with a strong focus on using LLMs as an alternative, rather than complementary approach to single-cell foundation models. In this study, we therefore investigate what biological insights contribute toward the performance of LLMs when applied to single-cell data, and how these models can complement single-cell foundation models to improve upon their performance. We first conduct a series of interpretability and ablation tests which show that LLMs leverage marker gene knowledge and simple gene expression patterns, contributing to their competitive performance. We then introduce scMPT, a proof-of-concept model which combines single-cell representations from LLMs and single-cell foundation models, demonstrating synergies between these representations through stronger, more consistent performance across datasets and tasks. We also experiment with alternate fusion methods, which highlight the potential of combining specialized reasoning models with scGPT to improve performance. This study ultimately showcases the potential for LLMs to complement single-cell foundation models and drive improvements in single-cell analysis.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Computational Biology", "Multimodality", "Interpretability", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Genomics"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/75bdd0e6e8fa461b8c712101fd761a2ea51d89f5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper explores methods for bridging the gap between text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized single-cell foundation models trained on raw  single-cell data. Single-cell (gene expression) data is a high-dimensional vector of gene activity counts for a single cell that is usually very sparse (only a few genes are active/expressed in each cell at a time). The authors' core methodology is to convert this vector into a \"cell sentence,\" which is a text string of gene names, ranked by their expression level. The main intuition/idea behind this conversion is to tap into the vast textual knowledge of LLMs, namely from curated datasets about gene markers for a specific biological class.  Namely, an LLM trained on medical literature would likely learn the association between the word \"insulin\" and the phrase \"Beta cell.\"\n\nThe paper has two parts: First, it presents an interpretability study to investigate what biological insights LLMs learn from these \"cell sentences.\" The authors use  standard interpretability techniques (LIME and Integrated Gradients) to uncover what \"marker genes\" where used for a prediction. They report that the genes the model found \"important\" were, in fact, biologically-known marker genes, confirming one of the parts of the hypothesis.  Second, the paper introduces scMPT, a simple fusion model. This model takes the frozen embeddings from a single-cell model (scGPT) and a text-encoder LLM (Ember-V1), concatenates them, and feeds them into a small, trainable MLP. The authors claim this fusion model achieves strong performance, even suggesting it is \"competitive with full fine tunes of scGPT\" on tasks like cell-type classification. The claims for this second part are highly questionable as discussed in weaknesses section."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper's only methodologically sound contribution is the interpretability analysis in Section 4.1. This section is well-executed and validates that the authors' model learns to identify key biological features. However, the novelty of this analysis is limited, as the core finding—that a model learns marker-gene associations for cell typing, validated against the PanglaoDB database—was previously demonstrated by the scBERT paper (Yang et al., 2022) . The paper's novel contribution is therefore a methodological validation in successfully replicating this concept on a different class of model (a general-purpose text encoder, not a specialized biological model). Therfore, this is a good but incremental validation rather than a novel conceptual discovery."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The paper has several critical flaws in methodology which leaves its central claims unsubstantiated. \n\n- The paper's headline claim is that its scMPT model is \"even competitive with full fine tunes of scGPT.\" The key evidence is in Table 3, where scMPT (F1=0.745) appears to beat the \"scGPT (full fine-tune - reported)\" baseline (F1=0.718) on the Pancreas dataset, which is a highly surprising fact. However, the scMPT's score of (F1=0.745) was tested on an **intra-study** benchmark, as elaborated here:\n\n> We focus our experiments on the datasets that were used to evaluate the cell type classification and clustering performance of GenePT (Chen & Zou, 2023)... For each dataset, we use the **same train/test split** as each of these respective works ... \n\nThe cited GenePT and other cited work use a randomized intra-study (eg. they note \"For the Aorta dataset, we used a random 80%/20% train/test split. \").  In contrast, the scGPT baseline (F1=0.718), was generated on a much harder, **cross-study** benchmark, elaborated here:\n\n> The human pancreas dataset contains data from five scRNA-seq studies... The five datasets were **split into reference and query sets by data sources**. The reference set consists of data from **two data sources**, and the query set contains the **other three**.\n\nTherefore, the authors are comparing their high score on a much simpler intra-study split task to a baseline's score on a hard generalization task, which invalidates their primary claim of SOTA-competitiveness. \n\n\n-  Flawed claim of minimal loss under \"cell sentence\" conversion: The paper builds upon on converting numerical expression data into \"cell sentences, and and cites Levine et al. (2023) to claim  \"minimal information loss\" under such a conversion.  However, in a more careful examination of the cited paper (Levine et al. 2023), the  evidence shows that a linear model that attempts to reconstruct the expression values from the ranks, achieving an $R^2$ score of 0.815 (Figure 3 in Levine et al.). This means that nearly **20%** of the variance in the original data is lost during the conversion to a \"cell sentence.\" Representing a 20% loss of information as a \"minimal loss\" without citing an exact figure is a misrepresentation of what the literature shows. \n\n- It also fails to cite and discuss CellPLM (Wen et al. 2023), a highly relevant related work that directly critiques the paper's \"cell as sentence\" methodology, arguing it misses crucial cell-cell relationships.\n- Missing baseline: The paper's empirical evaluation fails to compare against scBERT (Yang et al. 2022), another prominent transformer-based foundation model for this exact task.

That yields to sample-inefficient and risks optimistic estimates (especially for few, separable labels).\n- If I follow correctly the methodology, IG and LIME are applied to an MLP on frozen Ember-V1 embeddings, not to the end-to-end LLM or the generative-LLM setup. So attributions correspond the MLP+Ember composite, not to scMPT nor the reranking LLMs.\n- My main concern is that the ablations might hint some shortcut learning: Hashing names wipes performance, which might mean heavy reliance on lexical identity rather than biological semantics.

Over-reliance on simple tasks.\nThe primary evaluation task is cell type classification, is known to be relatively easy (especially for well known cell types), as marker genes alone yield high accuracy. The study does not address more challenging cases such as fine-grained subtypes or rare cell populations, where complementary multimodal reasoning would be more revealing.\n\n5. Scope dilution.\nAlthough interesting, the inclusion of LLM-based reasoning experiments (e.g., scGPT + o3-mini / DeepSeek-R1) feels underdeveloped and somewhat disconnected from the main contribution. The small scale and lack of deeper analysis make it difficult to interpret their significance (e.g. o3-mini alone outperform other models in the Pancreas dataset). \n\n6.
