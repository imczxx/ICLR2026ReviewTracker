Significant progress has been made for biomolecules and crystalline materials. Here, we address amorphous materials (glasses), which are disordered particle systems lacking atomic periodicity. Sampling equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials is a notoriously slow and difficult task. This obstacle could be overcome by developing a generative framework capable of producing equilibrium configurations with well-defined likelihoods. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework which combines Riemannian stochastic interpolant and equivariant flow matching. Our method rigorously incorporates periodic boundary conditions and the symmetries of multi-component particle systems, adapting an equivariant graph neural network to operate directly on the torus. Our numerical experiments on model amorphous systems demonstrate that enforcing geometric and symmetry constraints significantly improves generative performance.", "tldr": "We combine equivariant flow matching and Riemannian stochastic interpolants to learn the equilibrium distribution of amorphous particle systems and show that we can reweight the generated samples effectively.", "keywords": ["Generative Modelling", "Equivariant Deep Learning", "Sampling", "Machine Learning for Physics", "Stochastic Interpolants", "Flow Matchings"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/29a69c914b5e6c79db7ca3a2609f1e3859abd420.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a generative model for amorphous materials based on stochastic interpolants, taking symmetries and periodic boundary conditions into account.

(1) is not a metric on the quotient space M? Perhaps you meant to say it is not a true metric on R^d.\n\nThe potential energy as defined in Eq. (2) assumes no self-interaction across the periodic boundaries, right?\n\nWhat do you mean by \"For instance, the modulo operator defines a fundamental invariance for probability densities on M, as any density that is not modulo-invariant would assign infinite mass (...)\"? Do you mean p(X) = p(X+kL) for all k in Z^d? I am not sure I understand this, since if X is in M, then X (in R^d) and X+kL (in R^d) is literally the same point in M, so this is already built into the domain, p: M->R.\n\nLine 131. Is the ⨂ notation necessary here? Could you not just write (X + u) % L? I think that is fairly standard and perhaps more readable. Same goes for line 139. Perhaps you prefer the chosen notation because it makes it explicit that operations are on all N atoms?\n\nWhat is the practical significance of Eq. (4)? Also, if b should be in R^{N|S|+Nd} that seems to not align with the definition of b in appendix A, lemma 10: b=1_N ⨂ c where c is in R^d.\n\nCould the logarithmic map (Definition 2) be written more compactly as (A-B+L/2) % L - L/2 ?\n\nOn the flat torus, where the differential of the exponential map is the identity, doesn’t Eq. (9) recover the exact trajectories rather than only the time-marginals?\n\nI am confused about the notation in Proposition 8. The velocity field is defined as \\hat v: [0,1] x C -> TC. So is are the coordinates not already defined on M, and thereby by definition \\hat v(t, (s,X)) = \\hat v(t, (s,X+kL)) ?\n\nWhat is the relation to generative models based on kinetic Langevin diffusion?
