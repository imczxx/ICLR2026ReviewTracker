The key idea is to treat not only atoms and chemical bonds as tokens, but also higher-order geometric structures, specifically bond angles and torsion angles, as explicit tokens that can directly interact through an attention mechanism constrained by tetrahedral geometric consistency, rather than relying on traditional models to infer such information implicitly from pairwise distances. The paper further introduces a chirality-aware angular learning objective, the Directed Cycle Angle Loss, which models angles as directed periodic variables over (0,2π); this is intended to distinguish local chirality and avoid discontinuities around cases that occur in standard angle regression or classification. In addition, the model employs a hierarchical virtual node design that aggregates information separately at the atom, bond, angle, and torsion levels before passing it to a global node, aiming to alleviate the information bottleneck of a single global aggregator.
