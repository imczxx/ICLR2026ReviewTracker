While recent studies have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a principled testbed. In this paper, we present **MIRAGE-Bench** — **M**easuring **I**llusions in **R**isky **AGE**nt settings — the first unified benchmark for eliciting and evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii) environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without enumerating full action spaces. **MIRAGE-Bench** provides actionable insights on failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["hallucination", "LLM agents", "benchmark"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2843f7c139d04ba4a6f4f3f69896ea9d35aae9c5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes MIRAGE-Bench, a unified benchmark for studying hallucinations in agentic language models.

The LLM-as-a-Judge setup limits the reliability of evaluation. Validation is based on only 160 human-labeled samples with moderate agreement, which is insufficient to ensure trustworthiness. Relying on one LLM to judge another introduces unverified bias and instability, especially under prompt variations.\n\n2. The Contextual Snapshot Strategy sacrifices dynamic fidelity for reproducibility. By freezing the agent’s state before potential hallucination points, the benchmark reduces complex multi-turn reasoning to isolated steps. It therefore fails to capture long-horizon planning, feedback integration, and recovery abilities crucial for real-world agents.\n\n3. The paper diagnoses a key “successful workflow” bias but lacks an effective mitigation. While the analysis convincingly links hallucination to overfitting on optimal trajectories, it offers no concrete or tested method to reduce this bias. Merely calling for future work on “risk settings” leaves the contribution incomplete.\n\n4. The benchmark’s generalizability is limited by dependence on structured environments. Most data come from existing benchmarks with structured HTML trees or terminal outputs, making some risk types (e.g., Pop-up Distractions) ineffective. It underrepresents hallucinations in unstructured text, documents, or visual contexts found in generalist agents.\n\n5. The conceptual boundary between hallucination and general error remains unclear. Many reported hallucinations could be reframed as planning or attention failures. This ambiguity weakens the core claim that scaling offers little gain in faithfulness, as results may reflect labeling uncertainty rather than genuine performance limits."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the above-mentioned weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "PtWouQnyB1", "forum": "jau7d0SfPQ", "replyto": "jau7d0SfPQ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4066/Reviewer_vWvc"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4066/Reviewer_vWvc"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4066/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761638566836, "cdate": 1761638566836, "tmdate": 1762917162486, "mdate": 1762917162486, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "MIRAGE-Bench introduces the first unified benchmark for hallucinations in interactive LLM agents.
