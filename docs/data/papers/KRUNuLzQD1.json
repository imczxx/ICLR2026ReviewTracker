Although trillions of dollars are laundered each year, detection rates remain low because launderers evade oversight, confirmed cases are rare, and institutions see only fragments of the global transaction network. Since access to real transaction data is tightly restricted, synthetic datasets are essential for developing and evaluating detection methods. However, existing datasets fall short: they often neglect partial observability, temporal dynamics, strategic behavior, uncertain labels, class imbalance, and network-level dependencies. We introduce AMLGentex, an open-source suite for generating realistic, configurable transaction data and benchmarking detection methods. AMLGentex enables systematic evaluation of anti-money laundering systems under conditions that mirror real-world challenges. By releasing multiple country-specific datasets and practical parameter guidance, we aim to empower researchers and practitioners and provide a common foundation for collaboration and progress in combating money laundering.", "tldr": "AMLgentex is an open-source framework for generating realistic transaction data that enables rigorous evaluation of anti-money laundering methods under real-world conditions.", "keywords": ["Graph Neural Networks", "Anti-Money Laundry", "Privacy", "Graph data", "Distribution shift", "Imbalance", "Dataset", "Synthetic Data", "Heterophilic Graphs"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fe2a5ae539561d80610ff1b8779ec9314461b607.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a platform called AMLGENTEX, which integrates multimodal data and large-scale model (LLM) capabilities related to anti-money laundering (AML) in the financial sector.

It is my opinion that broader discussions are needed to compare this method to synthetic data in general and say how this helps to forward the AML literature. \n\nRelated to that, I believe a more extended reflection on the implications of this work should be discussed in the conclusion. \nDeep in the appendix, the authors have put the limitations of this work. I find this an important part of the reflection that should be made in the main body of text. \n\nSome claims are made at the end of the introduction, but I believe these are missing.

Additionally, a short discussion on some experiments are included, but to me this doe snot constitute a benchmarking suite, as is claimed in the introduction.

For example:\n- Logarithmic distribution for repeated laundering participation\n- Spending probability based on sigmoid function\n- Why use truncated Gaussian distributions for transaction amounts?\n- Fan-in and fan-out patterns appear in both normal and alert categories (Figures 8-9).

The agent-based simulation largely extends AMLSIM with more typologies and better accounting; the Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning is standard practice; Feature engineering (Table 1) involves straightforward aggregation of transaction statistics. Currently, the contribution is primarily a software tool, which may be more suitable for domain-specific conferences, or applications tracks.\n\nMinor issues:\n\n- In fig. 7, colors are too similar across models, making visual comparison difficult. No error bars or confidence intervals are shown despite averaging over 10 seeds.\n\n- The framework has numerous hyperparameters (degree distribution parameters, transaction amount distributions, typology frequencies, timing schemes). How sensitive are the experimental results to these choices?\n\n- Real money laundering often involves tight timing constraints (rapid movement of funds to avoid detection) and amount conservation principles (money placed ≈ money integrated).
