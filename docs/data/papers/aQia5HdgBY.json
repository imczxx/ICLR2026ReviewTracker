However, conventional zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) paradigms, which reset memory after each task, are inherently non-collaborative and inefficient for such long-term operations as they lead to redundant exploration. \nTo bridge this gap, we introduce a Persistent Shared Memory (PSM) mechanism that allows single or multi-agent systems to accumulate and reuse semantic knowledge across tasks and agents. Our approach builds an Temporally Consistent Semantic Map (TCSM), decoupling scene memory from task-specific information and maintaining semantic consistency via weighted confidence updates. On top of this memory, we design a beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) navigation strategy that propagates stored semantics into nearby navigable areas and performs line-of-sight checks for waypoint selection, enabling reasoning about objects that are currently occluded or distant. Experiments on public benchmarks, including HM3D and MP3D, have shown that our framework avoids redundant scene re-exploration and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Insufficient Contribution & Lack of Practical Validation: The paper's contribution to the robotics community, which it targets, is undermined by a lack of practical validation. To the ICLR community, its novelty from a learning perspective is limited; it does not introduce a general-purpose learning principle, but rather a specialized application. I would focus to emphasis its to robotics community by following the weakness points:\n- Simulation-Only: The entire evaluation is performed in a simulator. For a method claiming to solve a key problem in \"home robotics,\" the absence of any real-world experiments, even a simple demonstration video on a physical robot, is a major omission. Without even small-scale physical validation, the claim of “practical efficiency” is overclaimed and the paper’s contribution is limited.\n- Missing Runtime Analysis: The paper claims to improve \"efficiency\" (SPL), but this metric is about path length, not computational cost. Table 1 is conspicuously missing inference time / runtime analysis. A \"persistent\" system that is computationally too slow to run in real-time is not a practical solution.\n2. Implicit Static Environment Assumption: The method appears to fundamentally assume a static world. The paper does not discuss how the TCSM would handle dynamic objects, changing furniture, or even opening/closing doors. This is a critical limitation that sidesteps one of the hardest challenges of long-term operation in real environments.\n3. Parameter explanation missing: The parameter γ (used in Eq. 2) is not explained conceptually, only given as a constant in experiments. Since γ determines the memory update dynamics, its role and sensitivity should be analyzed through an ablation study.\n4. Section 3.4 (BLOS strategy) lists procedures but lacks intuitive explanations or reasoning behind design choices. It feels more like code documentation than scientific exposition.\n5. Superficial Handling of \"Uncertainty\": The paper claims to handle \"prediction uncertainty\" (Line 70), but the proposed solution (Eq. 2) is just a temporal smoothing of confidence scores. The downstream navigation (Sec 3.4) then appears to just take the argmax (highest confidence), rather than truly incorporating the uncertainty distribution into the decision-making policy.\n6. Inherited Model Biases: The system's long-term reliability is entirely dependent on the upstream foundation models. The paper does not convincingly address how the map would defend against gradual degradation from systematic biases or errors from these models."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Would it be possible to include a qualitative or real-robot demonstration video to validate the method’s practical relevance?\n2. Could you provide a quantitative analysis of the memory (GPU) and computational (update/query time) costs of the TCSM? How do these costs scale with the size of the explored environment and the map resolution?\n3. How different is TCSM conceptually from VLMaps or ConceptGraphs, apart from the weighted update rule?\n4. Minor Clarifications & Typos:\n- In Figure 3, the caption mentions \"PSSM.\" Is this a typo for PSM?\n- To better highlight the benefit of persistence in Figure 3, would it be possible to add the performance of a strong stateless baseline? Its performance should be a flat line, which would make the cumulative benefit of your method much clearer.\n- Line 28 (\"Object navigation challenges embodied agents...\") is grammatically confused because it treats object navigation as an active subject that “challenges” the agents. This makes the sentence sound unnatural. A clearer phrasing would be: “Object navigation is a task in which embodied agents follow natural language instructions to locate a specified goal.”\n- Please add a brief one-sentence explanation for \"beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) cues\" on its first use (Line 43).\n- Please fix the non-standard quotation marks (e.g., L267, L280).\n\nI am open to adjusting my evaluation based on the authors' responses during the rebuttal phase."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "0Ih2MDxJi3", "forum": "aQia5HdgBY", "replyto": "aQia5HdgBY", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1900/Reviewer_5JYw"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1900/Reviewer_5JYw"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1900/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761546666941, "cdate": 1761546666941, "tmdate": 1762915936738, "mdate": 1762915936738, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a Persistent Shared Memory (PSM) framework for Zero-Shot Object Navigation (ZSON), enabling agents to accumulate and share semantic knowledge across tasks and collaborators instead of resetting memory after each episode.

From a conceptual perspective, the authors appear to conflate the notion of zero-shot navigation with that of map-augmented exploration. By introducing cumulative spatial priors, the proposed setting fundamentally alters the nature of the standard ZSON problem, blurring the line between zero-shot navigation and pre-mapped exploration. As a result, claims of zero-shot generalization become less well-grounded, and direct comparison with stateless baselines may not be methodologically sound. A clearer articulation of the problem definition and its distinction from prior-knowledge-based paradigms (see Questions 1, 7). Moreover, despite the proposed enhancements, the method’s performance remains suboptimal and lacks comparison with more recent state-of-the-art approaches, limiting the credibility of its empirical claims. (see Questions 2, 4)"}, "questions": {"value": "1. The proposed setting fundamentally redefines the standard zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) problem. Unlike conventional ZSON, which assumes navigation in entirely unfamiliar environments without any prior knowledge, the proposed setting transforms the task into a map-augmented, long-horizon exploration problem. Consequently, direct comparison with stateless ZSON baselines under identical evaluation protocols is methodologically unfair. It is recommended to compare with prior-knowledge-based methods such as HOV-SG.\n\n2. The method’s performance remains suboptimal. For example, “FiLM-Nav: Efficient and Generalizable Navigation via VLM Fine-tuning” reports 61.7% SR / 37.3% SPL on HM3D, surpassing this paper’s results. The authors are encouraged to conduct comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art methods and provide a deeper analysis of the proposed framework’s strengths and potential advantages.\n\n3. The paper states that an off-the-shelf segmentation model is used, but the specific model and configuration are not disclosed. The authors should specify the employed model and include an ablation study to evaluate how different segmentation backbones influence overall performance.\n\n4. I notice that the paper does not include any real-world experiments. Could the authors clarify whether this omission is due to the framework’s current implementation constraints? If so, what are the main limitations that prevent the proposed system from being deployed or tested on real robotic platforms?\n\n5. The reference list contains several issues. For example, some entries (e.g., “Shuaihang Yuan et al., GAMap: Zero-shot Object Goal Navigation with Multi-scale Geometric Affordance Guidance, 2024”) lack publication venue information and proper formatting. The authors should carefully revise and standardize all references.\n\n6. How many samples or episodes were used in the main experiments, only validation splits, or the full dataset?\n\n7. The performance gain mainly arises from the gradual expansion of explored regions rather than intrinsic model improvements. As shown in Figure 3, with more time and prior tasks, the unexplored areas decrease, and the performance saturates—essentially approaching a fully prior-informed setup. This makes the task setting closely resemble the map-first-then-navigate paradigm, in which a complete map is built before executing the navigation task. In fact, such pre-mapped methods would likely outperform the proposed approach.

Did you ablate on this? \n4. In both HM3D and MP3D ObjectNav datasets, the objects would be easy to capture in a 2D semantic map? Why did you choose a voxel map over a 2D map? Did you ablate on this?\n5. Do you consider a depth based confidence to update the map (as in OneMap[1])? For example, this would be beneficial for occluded objects viewed from a distance.\n6. For objects that span across multiple voxels, do you collate the information in some way? \n7.

Questions on Novelty and Connections to Prior Work  \n- Given that mapping and the exploration-exploitation trade-off are well-established topics in navigation research, could you explicitly contrast your **PSM/TCSM framework** with 2–3 most relevant prior works (e.g., semantic mapping with long-term memory, multi-agent exploration strategies)? Specifically, what unique technical choices (not just combinations of existing ideas) make your approach distinct from these baselines?  \n- The paper mentions the framework addresses \"redundant exploration\" in ZSON, but prior works (e.g., [cite a relevant paper on memory-augmented ZSON]) also tackle similar inefficiencies. How does your method’s performance or scalability (e.g., with more agents/tasks) outperform these works beyond incremental gains?  \n\n\n### 2. Questions on Perception Robustness and Sim-to-Real Gap  \n- All experiments are conducted in simulated environments (HM3D/MP3D) with controlled sensory inputs. If deployed on a physical robot, how would your framework handle real-world perception noise—such as varying lighting, partial occlusions, or dynamic objects (e.g., a moved chair)? Are there any modifications planned for the perception pipeline to bridge this sim-to-real gap?  \n- The **TCSM** relies on accurate semantic labels to update confidence weights. If the upstream perception model (e.g., Qwen-VL-Max) misclassifies objects (e.g., confusing a \"sofa\" with a \"couch\"), how does the framework prevent cumulative errors in the shared memory? Is there a mechanism to correct such mislabeling over time?  \n\n\n### 3. Questions on Memory Design and Scalability  \n- The **PSM** is described as a \"shared cloud盘\" for multi-agent collaboration. As the number of agents or accumulated tasks grows, how do you manage memory storage and retrieval efficiency? For example, would a large memory bank slow down real-time navigation planning, and if so, what optimization strategies (e.g., pruning redundant entries) are in place?  \n- The paper notes performance \"saturates as the map nears completeness.\" Could you clarify: What defines \"map completeness\" in your framework (e.g., coverage of all rooms, all object categories)? And once saturated, does the framework still adapt to minor environmental changes (e.g., a shifted table), or does it require a full memory reset?  \n\n\n### 4. Questions on Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Strategy  \n- The BLOS strategy uses \"proxy goal regions\" to navigate to occluded targets. How does the framework select these proxy regions when multiple potential points exist (e.g., two doorways that both overlook a target)? Is there a cost function (e.g., distance, navigation safety) to prioritize more optimal proxies?  \n- In simulated tests, are there cases where the BLOS strategy fails (e.g., no accessible proxy regions for a fully enclosed target)? If so, how does the framework recover—does it fall back to exploration, or is there a contingency plan?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "1dq0cePECE", "forum": "aQia5HdgBY", "replyto": "aQia5HdgBY", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1900/Reviewer_8F5g"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1900/Reviewer_8F5g"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1900/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762161168235, "cdate": 1762161168235, "tmdate": 1762915936248, "mdate": 1762915936248, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
