Current benchmarks focus on functional motifs, leaving general geometric preservation capabilities largely untested. We introduce GeomMotif, a systematic benchmark that evaluates arbitrary structural fragment preservation without requiring functional specificity. We construct 57 benchmark tasks, each containing one or two motifs with up to 7 continuous fragments, by sampling from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to ensure a ground-truth, solvable conformation for every problem. The tasks are characterized by comprehensive structural and physicochemical properties: size, geometric context, secondary structure, hydrophobicity, charge, and degree of burial. These features enable detailed performance analysis beyond simple success rates, revealing model-specific strengths and limitations. We evaluate models using scRMSD and pLDDT for geometric fidelity and clustering for structural diversity and novelty. Our results show that sequence-based and structure-based approaches find different tasks challenging, and that geometric preservation varies significantly with structural and physicochemical context.

As most functional protein design now relies heavily on preserving specific motifs, the creation of a standardized benchmark to rigorously compare the performance of different scaffolding methods is both timely and important for the community.\n\n2.  **Well-Designed and Comprehensive Evaluation Protocol:** The evaluation protocol is a key strength of this work. It is both reasonable and thorough. The introduction of the **SUN (Successful, Unique, Novel)** metric is particularly noteworthy, as it provides a single, well-motivated score that elegantly integrates the three most critical aspects of generative design performance, moving beyond simplistic success rates.\n\n3.  **Thorough and Diverse Benchmark Construction:** The construction of the benchmark itself is exemplary. The selection and analysis of the motifs are highly detailed and thoughtfully curated to cover a wide and representative range of application scenarios. This comprehensiveness ensures that the benchmark can effectively probe the strengths and weaknesses of different models across various structural and physicochemical contexts."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "### Weaknesses:\n\n1.  **Exclusion of Small Motifs Limits Scope and Practical Relevance:** The benchmark's decision to exclude motifs with fewer than 30 residues is a notable limitation. In many real-world design scenarios, particularly for active sites or epitope engineering, the critical functional motifs are often very small, sometimes comprising just a few key residues. These small, and often non-contiguous, fragments are notoriously difficult for current models to constrain geometrically. Including a dedicated set of small-motif tasks would not only better reflect practical challenges but also provide a more stringent test of model capabilities, significantly enhancing the benchmark's overall utility.\n\n2.  **Evaluation Could Be Extended to More Recent Methods and Tasks:** While the paper provides a solid comparison of established models, the field of protein generation is advancing rapidly. The benchmark would be more impactful and have greater immediate relevance if it included an evaluation of more recent state-of-the-art models, such as Protpardelle-1c, RFdiffusion2, or Proteina. Additionally, exploring performance on more nuanced motif-scaffolding tasks, like unindex motif-scaffolding, would provide a more comprehensive picture of model capabilities.\n\n3.  **Lack of Focus on Side-Chain Preservation:** The current evaluation protocol is centered on backbone geometry (Cα atoms). However, for most functional applications of motif scaffolding (e.g., designing binders or enzymes), preserving the precise 3D conformation of the motif's *side-chains* is as crucial as preserving the backbone. Many of these functionally critical motifs are the very small ones mentioned in the first point. While the evaluated models are primarily backbone-focused, the benchmark itself would be more forward-looking and comprehensive if it included metrics for side-chain fidelity. Reporting on heavy-atom RMSD for the motif region, for instance, would better assess a model's ability to preserve function and encourage the development of all-atom scaffolding methods."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  **On the Solvability Criterion and Benchmark Scale:** Regarding the construction of the benchmark, the paper employs a strict criterion for solvability (ESMFold prediction RMSD ≤ 1.0 Å to the PDB structure), which yields a final set of 107 structures. Could the authors comment on the rationale for this strictness? While it guarantees high-quality, predictable scaffolds, it also significantly constrains the diversity and scale of the benchmark. Have the authors considered an alternative definition of solvability more local to the motif itself—for instance, requiring only that the *motif region* is accurately predicted by a structure prediction model? This might allow for a much larger and more diverse set of benchmark tasks while still ensuring that the core scaffolding problem is well-posed.\n\n2.  **Incorporating Functionally Relevant Motifs:** The paper makes a strong case for a benchmark focused purely on *geometric* preservation, distinct from function-focused benchmarks. As a complementary direction, have the authors considered creating a subset of tasks within GeomMotif where the geometric fragments are specifically chosen from known functional sites (e.g., catalytic residues, binding interfaces, or other hotspots)? This could help bridge the gap between geometric and functional challenges, providing valuable insights into whether current models are better or worse at preserving fragments that are known to be functionally important, even when evaluated on purely geometric metrics."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "mtjR8en4uU", "forum": "b4C3zAzRgH", "replyto": "b4C3zAzRgH", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17589/Reviewer_aTcU"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17589/Reviewer_aTcU"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17589/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761756518937, "cdate": 1761756518937, "tmdate": 1762927446565, "mdate": 1762927446565, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors construct a motif scaffolding benchmark through selecting diverse proteins from the PDB and computationally selecting motifs.

This means they can compare structure-based and sequence-based models on the same benchmark. In doing so the authors reveal a significant difference between these two styles of model. Given that all models were run on the same benchmark by the same authors without bias as to a specific model, I believe these kinds of unbiased results are quite beneficial to the research community.\n\nI also appreciated the analysis into which kinds of motifs are difficult for different models. For example the relative ease of scaffolding high helical content motifs and the difficulty with low helical content motifs is something that could be considered part of the folklore of protein design but not has evidence backing up this claim. The difficulty with buried motifs is also interesting and perhaps a new perspective for which motifs can be challenging to scaffold in practice."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I believe the motivation for the benchmark given in the introduction is unclear. It is claimed that MotifBench has a diagnostic blindspot in that it conflates geometric preservation with maintenance of function. I think what the authors mean here is that MotifBench requires both motif preservation and a low scRMSD to be a success whereas their benchmark only requires motif preservation and a high pLDDT of the folded structure. I don't see how low scRMSD equates to a test of 'function' for MotifBench. In my mind the main difference is that GeomMotif doesn't require a starting structure so can compare a wider array of models. I  think this should be made clearer.\n\nWith regards to comparing structure based and sequence based models, there seems to be quite an unfair advantage given to structure based models because they are allowed 8 MPNN sequences to attempt to find a good sequence that meets the success criteria. However, sequence based models only have 1 sequence to try to find success. It would therefore seem more appropriate to compare 100 structure samples with 8 MPNN sequences each with 800 sequence samples from the sequence generative model i.e. they have the same number of allowable calls to ESMFold to find a success.\n\nI also believe this benchmark missed an opportunity to reduce the noise in the evaluation criteria. The authors use purely computational filters to finally select 57 motif scaffolding tasks from the entire PDB. This seems like quite a small number of tasks given that the hand selected MotifBench benchmark has 30 problems. Computationally selecting tasks opens the possibility of selecting a very large number of tasks. I believe a more comprehensive and lower noise evalauation of different methods could have been achieved with a much large number of motif scaffolding tasks but with fewer attempts at each task. For example, you currently have 100 attempts at each task for a total of 5700 designs. You could have instead picked 5700 motif scaffolding tasks with 1 attempt each which would have covered a much broader array of problems.\n\nThis problem is exemplified in Table 2 where the authors attempt to interpret drops in performance at certain numbers of fragments in the motif with some property of a model e.g. stating that Genie2 has a drop in performance at 4-5 fragments but good performance at 1-3 and 6-7 fragments. They then conclude that 'intermediate' complexity is difficult for the model. I personally am unconvinced by this explanation as I see no fundamental reason as to why intermediate numbers of segments should be harder than a large number of segments. I would offer an alternative explanation that simply the 5 tasks with 5 fragments happened to be harder than the other tasks because there is such a small number of tasks per number of fragments bin and the random sample of tasks that had 5 fragments happened to be hard. I think this is to be expected when the total number of tasks is small. If the authors wish to make general conclusions about task difficulty versus number of fragments I think many more tasks should be included in the benchmark.\n\nIn terms of writing, I think the clarity of section 4.4 could be improved with a figure since it is hard to make conclusions as a reader just reading stated numbers in the main text.\n\nOverall, I believe the analysis of different models is of interest to the community more so than the benchmark itself due to the aforementioned issues. I am leaning towards a weak accept."}, "questions": {"value": "Why not include some small motifs in the benchmark?
