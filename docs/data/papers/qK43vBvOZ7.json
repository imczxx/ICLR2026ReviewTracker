Although existing methods demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their effect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains largely unexplored.  In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on long-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in modern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more computation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that pruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when performance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable. Furthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to recover lost test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses, we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to reasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the robustness of reasoning.", "tldr": "We systematically study the effect of layer pruning on test-time scaling, unveiling its negative influence on test-time scaling, which is hard to be repaired by standard SFT.", "keywords": ["LLMs", "layer pruning", "test-time scaling", "model compression", "long-context reasoning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ac1e059ded931c17efcfabfa15fd1376c64cb7a7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a2d298c2dc362dbf8ab4f6807b014de895cf2a39.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper experimentally demonstrates that Layer Pruning, a mainstream technique for improving model efficiency, causes LLMs' performance to collapse on complex reasoning tasks reliant on long sequential Chains-of-Thought.

The paper only validates training-free pruning techniques and does not incorporate mainstream training-based pruning methods. This makes it impossible to verify whether such methods can alleviate the fragility of test-time scaling. While the paper makes certain contributions, the generalizability of its conclusions is limited.\n\n2. The paper explicitly states that it studies both sequential and parallel test-time scaling. However, most of the content and core analysis focus on sequential scaling. Regarding the performance collapse mechanism of parallel scaling methods, the paper's analysis is relatively weak and fails to provide in-depth mechanistic insights like those for sequential scaling.\n\n3. The s1K-1.1 dataset used for fine-tuning is not introduced, and only this single dataset is employed in the fine-tuning experiments. Consequently, the conclusion that 'fine-tuning has limited effect' is questionable."}, "questions": {"value": "1. As mentioned in the Weaknesses, if more complex methods such as training-based pruning methods are used, can the damage to test-time scaling ability be effectively alleviated?\n\n2. Since the effect of standard fine-tuning is limited, does there exist or is it considered to design a customized fine-tuning scheme targeting reasoning trajectory loss? Can it repair the structural damage caused by pruning from a mechanistic perspective?\n\n3. It is suggested that the authors supplement some comparison charts of the model evaluation indicators before and after fine-tuning in Section 4, so as to intuitively demonstrate the limitations of supervised fine-tuning methods in restoring the reasoning ability of models after layer pruning.\n\n4. Is there a mistake in the introduction of ShortGPT in Appendix B? As far as I know, a lower Block Influence (BI) score indicates a higher cosine similarity between two layers, which means that the layer has minimal transformation on the hidden state and low importance, so it can be pruned with limited performance loss [1]. If so, please correct it; if not, please ignore this comment.\n\n[1] Xin Men, Mingyu Xu, Qingyu Zhang, Bingning Wang, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, and Weipeng Chen.

As a follow-up of 1, I think there should be trends of non-reasoning models on the same experimental setting for Figure 2,3,4.

Large scale pretraining / post-training aims to improve the reasoning performance, while minimum pruning would severely hurt the performance, which deviates from the original target. Why would people need layer pruning anyways? It is not a principled way in any sense. Even in terms of efficiency, pruning 1 or 2 layers would only bring marginal acceleration, while other methods such as distillation or quantization would significantly improve the efficiency without sacrificing much performance.
