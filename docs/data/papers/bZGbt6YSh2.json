This limitation could arise from reliability degradation in value models in unseen reasoning paths. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware search framework that includes two key components: (1) uncertainty-aware value models that incorporate uncertainty into predictions, and (2) an uncertainty-aware selection process using the proposed efficient Group Thompson Sampling algorithm. Experiments on two In-Distribution (ID) settings (GSM8K and MATH) and three Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) settings (e.g. AIME25 and Minerva Math) show that our method mitigates verifier failures.

Clear and Important Problem Definition: The paper clearly identifies a core flaw in current value model-guided search—\"verifier failures,\" where the value model may incorrectly prune valid solutions due to not having seen certain reasoning paths. This is a very practical and important problem in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). \n2.

By borrowing from and extending the Ensemble++ architecture, the model can learn a posterior distribution instead of a single value score, thus quantifying the unreliability of evaluating unseen paths."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited Novelty: The method primarily combines existing Ensemble++ techniques with OVM. Its core highlight lies more with Ensemble++ itself rather than the UVM framework, thus it is an incremental innovation.\n2. Core Assumption is Questionable: The experimental results (Tables 1 and 2) show that the improvement in coverage did not lead to a significant increase in accuracy, and even caused a decrease in accuracy on in-distribution datasets. This diminishes the practical significance of the paper's core motivation to \"improve performance by increasing coverage\".\n3. Insufficient Experimentation: The paper claims that UVM is suitable for larger beam sizes, but the experiments only went up to 32. To fully validate its effectiveness, experiments should be conducted on larger beam sizes (e.g., 64 or 128). The current experiments only show that UVM is not suitable for small beam sizes. \n4. Lack of Parameter Analysis: The paper does not provide an analysis of key hyperparameters, such as the length of the index vector m and other trade-off parameters. This raises doubts about the reproducibility and robustness of the results.\n5.

Why were tests not conducted on larger beam sizes (e.g., 64 or higher) to support this claim?  \n3. The model introduces new hyperparameters (like the index vector length m).
