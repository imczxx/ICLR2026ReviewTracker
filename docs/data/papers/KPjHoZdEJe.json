The recent introduction of Diffusion Models has enabled OSFL to synthesize client-like data on the server. However, these methods typically require fine-tuning a foundation model or a shared feature extractor on clients, which undermines practicality under the heterogeneous scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose $\\textbf{FedLD}$, a one-shot $\\textbf{Fed}$erated learning method with $\\textbf{L}$ocal $\\textbf{D}$istribution-conditioned image synthesis. We fit a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the local distribution of each client and upload the model parameters to the server. The server samples initial noise from these client-specific models to guide a Diffusion Model to generate data aligned with the client distributions, enabling OSFL without any client-side model training and significantly reducing both computation and communication costs. Quantitation and visualization experiments conducted on three large-scale real-world image datasets demonstrate the initial noises sampled from the GMMs can effectively transfer the knowledge of client distributions, further validating the potential of Diffusion Models in OSFL.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Federated Learning", "Diffusion Models"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2a47c5e0f4090658bc8d86c9fbeb86163157d67b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a method for One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL), called FedLD.

Fitting per-client GMMs and sampling x_T to steer a pre-trained diffusion model is a straightforward combination of standard components; there is no new learning principle, estimator, or algorithm with provable properties.\n- The work argues initial-noise conditioning is the key insight, but closely related conditional or prior-based controls already exist; the paper does not articulate what is fundamentally new beyond “use a GMM for initial latents.”\n- The paper compares to some diffusion-OSFL baselines, but the broader FL/KD literature and alternative lightweight client summaries are under-covered, weakening claims of originality.\n\nObjective and conceptual clarity\n- The formal objective (Eq. 1) is a standard global FL objective over a single aggregated model F_g, yet the text frequently speaks about “adapting to each client distribution.” There is no explicit personalization step, so the target seems global—even as the pipeline is per-client conditional during data synthesis. This mismatch should be clarified and reflected in metrics.\n- The description of Stable Diffusion is inaccurate: the paper says “Stable Diffusion first maps the initial noise into the latent space via E.” In SD, E encodes images to latents; initial noise is sampled directly in latent space. This is not a minor wording issue because the client-side “distribution extraction” depends on how latents/noise are conceptualized.\n- The link from a GMM over highly noised latents to downstream class-conditional image fidelity is argued mostly by intuition and visuals; no analysis of when/why initial-noise matching preserves client style/background while maintaining class semantics.\n\nPrivacy and security\n- Privacy claims are weak. Uploading per-client GMM means and covariances of noised latents can leak information about client distributions; no formal threat model, differential privacy, secure aggregation, or attack evaluation (membership/attribute inference, reconstruction) is provided. The paper itself acknowledges a non-zero chance of sampling near-original content and leaves quantification to future work. Calling this “strong privacy protection” is not supported by evidence.\n\nExperimental rigor and fairness\n- The main results claim to “often outperform” centralized training (the “Ceiling”). But FedLD trains on images synthesized by a powerful, web-scale pre-trained diffusion model with class prompts—i.e., it injects external prior knowledge the centralized baseline does not use. This is not an apples-to-apples “upper bound” comparison; it demonstrates the benefit of external generative priors, not superiority of OSFL per se.\n- The multi-round FL baselines are capped at 20 rounds, which is a modest budget for heterogeneous, medium-resolution vision and may under-serve strong optimizers; tuning parity and convergence diagnostics are not shown.\n- Heterogeneity choices are specialized (strict domain non-overlap). While interesting, this setting advantages style-transfer-like synthesis; results under other realistic partitions (e.g., Dirichlet label skew with partial domain overlap) are missing.\n- Communication/computation accounting mixes one-shot costs for FedLD with multi-round totals for FedAvg-style methods; units are inconsistent across tables (MB vs GB), and it is unclear whether all one-time costs (e.g., distributing the SD encoder) are counted equivalently.\n- Ablations mainly vary the number of generated images (R) and choice of diffusion model; they do not probe the core design (e.g., effect of GMM component count, covariance tying vs full, robustness to GMM misfit, or the necessity of per-client GMM vs a global prior).\n- Reporting lacks uncertainty estimates (CIs, seed spread) for many tables; statistical significance is not established.\n\nMathematical/notation issues\n- Notation around the forward process uses a single \\(\\bar a_T\\) constant; schedules typically depend on t with \\(\\bar\\alpha_T\\). If the intent is to simulate x_T, say so precisely; otherwise the definitions are ambiguous.\n- Equation (8) blends variables/constants from different sampler variants without a self-contained derivation or references; as written it is hard to verify correctness.\n\nPresentation\n- Figure 1 helps, but key roles (what is encoded where, what is sampled where) could be clearer; the “Local Distribution Fitting” box implies uploading GMM stats but not the encoder-distribution step.\n- Minor language and caption issues (e.g., “Visualization pf privacy-sensitive…”).

Can you analyze the sensitivity to the noise level and to the number/shape (full vs diagonal) of mixture components?\n3) Please fix the Stable Diffusion description (encoder role) and clarify the client-side pipeline mathematically.\n4) Provide a formal privacy threat model and at least basic attack evaluations (membership/attribute inference) against uploaded GMMs and generated images; consider DP on uploaded statistics and assess the utility-privacy trade-off.\n5) Revisit the “Ceiling” comparison: train a centralized model that is allowed to augment with the same diffusion prior and prompts, or avoid calling centralized supervised training an “upper bound.”\n6) Add core ablations on the proposed mechanism: (i) vary mixture count and covariance tying, (ii) replace per-client GMM with a single global GMM, (iii) replace GMM with simple Gaussian, (iv) use text-only prompts vs prompts + GMM, to isolate where gains come from.\n7) Report seeds and confidence intervals; expand training budgets for the multi-round baselines and show convergence curves; strengthen heterogeneity settings beyond strict domain non-overlap."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "d0jkhiyFJj", "forum": "KPjHoZdEJe", "replyto": "KPjHoZdEJe", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23854/Reviewer_jKS7"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23854/Reviewer_jKS7"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23854/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762226457645, "cdate": 1762226457645, "tmdate": 1762942830895, "mdate": 1762942830895, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
