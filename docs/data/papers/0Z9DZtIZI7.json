Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation, as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization to improve model alignment to human values.", "tldr": "In this work, we introduce value drifts to trace how and when LLMs acquire values during post-training.", "keywords": ["value drifts", "llm alignment", "post-training", "training dynamics", "human values"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/40bbbfdb18c5d9d3ed6fbdde26b4d3e7f56ba8ba.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper traces value alignment throughout different parts of an LLM’s lifecycle.

However, in this paper, you approach this problem mainly from the perspective of the methods used for value alignment. To me, what matters most is the interaction with the data, and you only cover a bit of that at the end in Section 6.\n\nIn Section 4, you show the effects of SFT with two different datasets and models. Using Wildchat and Alpaca leads to different values, but you don’t explore the prior distribution of these datasets, even though you mention that as a possible explanation. Aren’t you just showing that SFT works? That doesn’t seem surprising to me, and you also acknowledge that this is known (line 300).\n\nIn Section 5, you show the value drifts after SFT with three algorithms (DPO, PPO, SimPO) and show that there are no significant shifts. Once again, you don’t show the prior distribution of the datasets used, even though later you mention this might be an issue.\n\nFinally, Section 6 deals with data biases and the effects of the above-mentioned algorithms. You find very little change from PPO, but as you say, there’s a penalty for separating from the SFT. SimPO suffers from no shifts as well, but DPO shifts values considerably. Once again, I feel like you’re just showing whether these algorithms work or not, and that without saying much about the data doesn’t show anything that we shouldn’t already know.\n\nFrom my perspective, it’d be better to study this problem mostly from a data x algorithm point of view. For example, you could generate different datasets with different distributions, such as bimodal, and see how those affect post-training. Do models just align with the mode that skews it more? Does it result in a neutral-value model? Does it overfit to support or oppose with each specific mode?

Overall, the paper is more like an empirical study of model value alignment. It did not propose novel algorithm or framework to perform better model human value alignment, neither construct new dataset or benchmark to perform model human value evaluation. The contribution of the paper is somewhat limited. Seems to be a preliminary work that needs deeper study on this topic, for example, how to efficiently (with less compute/less data points) align model with human value? Does different value affect each other during post-training? Can one alter the model output’s value by performing another round of SFT/RL, if so, how to achieve it in a more effective way?\n2. It would be interesting to check if any of the dataset used in the SFT and RL stages actually contain data points that are related to the topic/values examine in the evaluation phase. If they do contain data points, say related to immigration, then does any of the data points indeed represent a negative/neutral/positive viewpoint which later on pick-up by the model? This is not clear to me. I think the proportion of related data in the training datasets are more important than algorithm used for the post-training phases, however, this is not examined thoroughly by the authors.\n3. The coverage of datasets/model/post-training algorithm is not comprehensive, which make the conclusion/observations in the paper not very convincing. Even though there are compute constraints, there should be explanation on why only examining two model family and small size model on limited datasets will be enough to draw the conclusion."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

All results are discussed empirically, which are also limited. Additionally, there is limited discussion on how different datasets used during SFT result in varying magnitudes of drift during the preference optimization.\n- The study fails to offer practical recommendations for mitigating value drifts during preference optimization for algorithms such as DPO. This results in increased drifts compared to PPO and SimPO, or when an oppositely aligned dataset is employed to maliciously manipulate the alignment of LLMs. \n- I am not sure about the reasoning behind studying the drift for PPO, as it has a KL-divergence term in its formulation to mitigate the same issue. The paper also mentions that PPO has the lowest drift with this explanation. The contributions would be much higher if other algorithms like DAPO had been studied that do not include the KL divergence terms.\n- The stance is only limited to 3 options. It does not tell how much the model is in support or opposition to a topic. Furthermore, measuring the stance of a language model using an LLM (GPT-4o) is not a robust way to do so, as the LLM will have its biases. A better approach would be to get stances from multiple LLMs or incorporate human evaluation.\n- The rationale behind employing the oppose-aligned dataset remains unclear. Preference optimization aims to align the model’s behavior with desired preferences. Consequently, utilizing the opposing-aligned data to widen the gap will undoubtedly lead to a shift in value."}, "questions": {"value": "What is the reason behind selecting Llama3 and Qwen3?
