While existing methods achieve good results on continuous variates, they struggle when having to learn both continuous and discrete dynamics across continuous time. Further, existing methods simply sum up reconstruction or contrastive errors from each variate to obtain final anomaly scores without recognizing differences in importance of variates with different measurement units. To overcome these limitations, we propose TAD-UP that learns both continuous and discrete dynamics for Time series Anomaly Detection via Unified Probabilistic modeling. First, we propose two co-dependent branches of efficient neural ordinary differential equations with the compound Poisson process to learn both continuous and discrete dynamics for different variates. We also propose a gate mechanism to learn correlations among different dynamics. Second, we propose to model a joint probability distribution for anomaly detection. The resulting model is optimized using Maximum Likelihood Estimation on joint variates, instead of using reconstruction or contrastive losses on each variate. We detect anomalies using joint probabilities, which take the marginal probabilities of different variates into account. Experiments on nine real-world datasets from different domains offer evidence that TAD-UP is capable of state-of-the-art accuracy and better efficiency tradeoff.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Time Series Anomaly Detection", "Continuous and Discrete Dynamics"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e0d29f1db9259fbb656e751b2b2817717956f7f7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a probabilistic framework for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that separately learns continuous and discrete dynamics through two co-dependent neural ODE branches.

Lack of design motivation. The paper introduces several components, continuous co-ODE, discrete co-ODE, and gated TCN, but does not sufficiently explain why these particular designs are chosen.\n2. Limited novelty in model architecture. The proposed framework appears to be a direct combination of existing elements: standard embeddings for continuous/discrete variables, TCNs for temporal modeling, and ODE formulations. The overall contribution lies more in integration than in new methodological innovation.\n3. Modeling of discrete dynamics. The discrete branch relies on a Poisson-process-based formulation (Eq. (5)), which inherently models binary “jump/no-jump” events. It is unclear how this approach generalizes to multi-valued discrete states, which are common in categorical time-series data.\n4. Expressiveness of Gaussian mixture assumption. The joint probability of all variables is modeled by a (mixture) Gaussian distribution, whose representational capacity is limited for complex, high-dimensional time series.\n5. Loss formulation ambiguity. In Eq. (11), the latter term of L_c seems to include  the L_{MLE} term already present in the first half, raising doubts about whether both parts are necessary or if redundancy exists.\n6. Weak theoretical contribution. Theorems 1 and 2 in the Appendix are standard linear-algebra results (positive semi-definiteness of covariance matrices) and do not provide theoretical insight specific to the proposed model.\n7. Unclear inference mechanism. The paper emphasizes that marginal probabilities help identify important variables in anomaly scoring, but the inference section does not explain how this importance is actually utilized or interpreted during detection.\n8. Missing baselines. The experimental comparison omits recent diffusion-based methods such as ImDiffusion, which are relevant and often strong baselines for time-series anomaly detection."}, "questions": {"value": "See the weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "DqwoUuyhiO", "forum": "AAT3rwlR4r", "replyto": "AAT3rwlR4r", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1761/Reviewer_NV9B"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1761/Reviewer_NV9B"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1761/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761488991687, "cdate": 1761488991687, "tmdate": 1762915881984, "mdate": 1762915881984, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a method that learns both continuous and discrete dynamics for time-series anomaly detection and uses these dynamics to estimate correlations among continuous and discrete variables.
