Current models—statistical, classical deep learning (e.g., TCN, GCN), and large-scale methods—struggle with noise, complexity, high dimensionality, and dynamics, with static TCN/GCN structures limiting performance and large models facing high computational costs, keeping classical methods relevant. This paper proposes a \\underline{s}patio\\underline{t}emporal prediction framework based on \\underline{d}ynamic and \\underline{a}daptive \\underline{c}onvolution \\underline{n}etworks (STDACN), which overcomes weight-sharing limits, featuring a high-order gated TCN with recursive causality to capture temporal dependencies and an adaptive GCN for spatial topologies, boosting efficiency and generalization.
