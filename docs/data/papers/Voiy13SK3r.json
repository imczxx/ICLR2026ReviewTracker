The need to select, combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck, resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a principled research and development workflow through three collaborative phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with, and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized AI systems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multi-agent System", "Federated Learning", "LLM-based Agent"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f9a5bfee9fed28b1a21619efdefdcdc01392ba92.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce Helmsman, a multi-agent framework that aims to automate the design, implementation, and evaluation of federated learning systems.

The pipeline itself demonstrates seemingly good software engineering. The benchmark itself is a useful addition as AgentFL-Bench gives a controlled setting for evaluating end-to-end FL code synthesis and could be useful for reproducibility studies. The paper is well written and documents the workflow, examples, and failure handling pretty clearly."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The architecture which is developed doesn't seem to have anything intrinsically to do with federated learning. The architecture, multi-agent planning, code generation, and testing is generic and could apply to any modular ML task . The FL focus seems to come about only from the chosen templates and evaluation tasks, not from algorithmic design. This raises the question of why the problem is framed as FL rather than general code-synthesis automation.\n\nBecause of this, it should be compared with other code-synthesis automation pipelines, which have been left out. The system is pretty similar in philosophy, and at times details to previous frameworks such as SWE-Agent, AutoGPT, Voyager, and CodeAct, all of which perform multi-agent planning, code writing, and iterative debugging. Helmsman introduces no new learning mechanism or reasoning algorithm beyond applying this template to FL code. The paper doesn't compare against or even reference these lines of work, making the claimed novelty really difficult to justify.\n\nThere's also a real circularity in the evaluation and fragility in the prompt design. All tasks in AgentFL-Bench follow the same structured Problem–Task–Framework schema that Helmsman is designed specifically to take. Because of this, the benchmark measures success within a self-aligned template rather than general robustness to unstructured or underspecified prompts. There is no test of whether the system works if prompts are paraphrased, incomplete, or out of schema, which severely limits claims of autonomy and generalization.\n\nThe results given of 62.5 % automation rate and 5–10 % improvements over FL baselines lack any statistical grounding. No confidence intervals, standard deviations, or number of runs are reported. It has to be presumed that this number is from a single run, with presumably hand-tuned prompts, so without checking for robustness from prompt design, these results are really not meaningful. In addition, because of the inherently stochastic nature of LLM generation, there must be some considerable variance in results which are never specified. Again, this makes the claimed improvement of a few percent impossible to judge.\nIn addition, the baselines (FedAvg, FedProx) measure learning accuracy, not system-synthesis performance, so these comparisons are not really comparable at all.\nThe empirical results should then be viewed as illustrative demonstrations, not evidence of reliable performance gains.\n\nIn addition to all of this, for around 40% of tasks, human verification was required. Given this, it is unclear what advantage Helmsman offers over ready-made tools such as GitHub Copilot or Cursor, which already provide interactive code completion, conversational debugging, and execution feedback. Without quantitative comparison to really simple baselines such as these, the added complexity of the multi-agent architecture is not justified.\n\nFinally, the paper has no ablation experiments testing sensitivity to prompt wording, number of agents, or LLM choice, nor anything focusing on the value of planning vs. coding agents. Again, because of this it is unclear which components, if any, are responsible for the reported successes."}, "questions": {"value": "The questions are all about the weaknesses, and so each weakness should be seen as a question about the paper."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "J8NqVkZ4cl", "forum": "Voiy13SK3r", "replyto": "Voiy13SK3r", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission340/Reviewer_VyT8"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission340/Reviewer_VyT8"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission340/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761471930433, "cdate": 1761471930433, "tmdate": 1762915497753, "mdate": 1762915497753, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Helmsman, a multi-agent system for synthesizing a federated learning system through user specifications.

Could the authors provide explicit criteria or real-world examples delineating when and to what degree HITL is invoked, and how its frequency impacts system autonomy and scalability? Understanding the precise role and burden of human intervention is important for assessing Helmsman’s autonomy and practicality.\n\n- The choice of agent specialization (planning, coding, debugging, etc.) is motivated by division of labor, but could the authors elaborate whether alternative agent decompositions were explored? For instance, would a two-agent system (planner+debugger) suffice, or are the current modular teams truly necessary for observed performance? This helps validate the necessity and impact of the multi-agent structure versus simpler alternatives.\n\n- Could you provide more explicit detail on the communication and coordination protocols among agents (Supervisor, Planning, Reflection, Evaluator, Debugger, etc.), especially in cases of conflicting suggestions or persistent failures? Understanding the orchestration mechanics and how conflicts or deadlocks are resolved is crucial for reproducibility and for assessing the practical reliability and scalability of the system.\n\n- What is the impact of key hyperparameters (e.g., T_max, agent model choice, number of local updates, communication rounds) on system performance, and is there an automated or principled tuning mechanism in Helmsman? The methodology relies on several non-trivial, possibly task-sensitive settings; transparency around their selection, sensitivity, and potential for automation is necessary for adoption and rigorous evaluation.\n\n- Could you clarify the computational resources (runtime, memory, LLM API usage) required for typical benchmark runs, and to what extent does Helmsman facilitate fully reproducible experiments on AgentFL-Bench? Resource efficiency and reproducibility are essential aspects for practitioners and for fair comparison to baselines; disparities here might hinder wider use or interpretation of results.\n\n- Could you clarify whether the reported results (in Tables 2–5) are averaged over multiple runs, and if so, how many runs and what the variance or confidence intervals were? Assessing consistency and statistical significance is critical for experimental rigor in FL, where stochasticity can meaningfully affect outcomes.\n\n- Are the baseline methods (both standard and specialized) reimplemented under identical data splits, model architectures, and hyperparameter configurations as Helmsman, or are external numbers reported?
