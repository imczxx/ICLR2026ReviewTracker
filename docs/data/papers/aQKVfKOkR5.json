Existing solutions for this problem often struggle to effectively navigate exponentially large combinatorial space of synthesizable molecules and suffer from poor coverage. To address this problem, we introduce ReaSyn, an iterative generative pathway refinement framework that obtains synthesizable analogs to input molecules by projecting them onto synthesizable space. Specifically, we propose a simple synthetic pathway representation that allows for generating pathways in both bottom-up and top-down traversal of synthetic trees. We design ReaSyn so that both bottom-up and top-down pathways can be sampled with a single unified autoregressive model. ReaSyn can thus iteratively refine subtrees of generated synthetic trees in a bidirectional manner. Further, we introduce a discrete flow model that refines the generated pathway at the entire pathway level with edit operations: insertion, deletion, and substitution. The iterative refinement cycle of (1) bottom-up decoding, (2) top-down decoding, and (3) holistic editing constitutes a powerful pathway reasoning strategy, allowing the model to explore the vast space of synthesizable molecules. Experimentally, ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway diversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization performance in synthesizable goal-directed molecular optimization, and significantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in synthesizable hit expansion. These results highlight ReaSyn's superior ability to navigate combinatorially-large synthesizable chemical space.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["drug discovery", "molecule generation", "synthesizable molecule design"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7af0d916383278a9505b507dfc6b39483dfb658b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "- This paper addresses the problem of synthesizable molecule generation, which aims to generate molecules that are synthetically accessible.\n- The authors propose ReaSyn, an iterative generative pathway retirement framework based on reaction trees.

When plugged into Graph-GA as a projection/mutation step, ReaSyn maintains strong goal-directed optimization performance while ensuring synthesizability, and it outperforms prior synthesis-aware methods on TDC oracles, an sEH proxy (with improved SA/QED and AiZynth success), and JNK3 hit expansion (higher analog, improve, and success rates)."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "Unification of BU and TD in one policy.
