This raises a fundamental challenge: how should we design robot manipulators that are optimized for dexterity? We present a co-design framework that jointly learns task-specific hand morphology and dexterous control policies. The framework supports 1) an expansive morphology search space including joint, finger, and palm generation, 2) scalable deployment across the wide design space via morphology-conditioned cross-embodied control, and 3) real-world fabrication with accessible components. We evaluate the approach across dexterous tasks, including in-hand rotation with simulation and real deployment. Our framework enables an end-to-end pipeline that can design, train, fabricate, and deploy a new robotic hand in under 24 hours. The full framework will be open-sourced and available on our website.", "tldr": "A fast method for sim-to-real co-design of robot hands for dexterous manipulation through cross embodied policy training and physicially realistic grammars", "keywords": ["Co-Design", "Manipulation", "Robotics", "Cross Embodiment", "Robot Hands", "Robot Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Hardware Design"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/30a79b34bac8f53200591ed7e530d92d8ef95e79.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper explores the problem of the morphology-policy co-design in dexterous in-hand rotation.

How to increase the optimization space from pure control policies to both the control policy and the robot morphology is an important problem in robot learning.

Bi-level optimization is a reasonable formulation for the co-design problem.

Object-in-hand rotation is a widely explored problem in the dexterous manipulation community. This work presents a research direction where the control policy and the hand morphology are co-designed. However, how does its effectiveness compare to prior in-hand rotation works, like Hora or Leap hand rotation (from Kenny Shaw). I cannot see improvements solely from the results achieved by this paper compared to prior in-hand rotation works.\n- Limited analysis of the design space. The paper lacks a thorough in-depth analysis of the morphology design space, e.g., using what designs lead to satisfactory performance, and using what designs is not sufficient for a good optimization? \n- Unclear methodology. How do authors iterate between the morphology design space optimization and the cross-embodiment policy training?

This universal policy is pre-trained on a diverse set of robot hand designs generated by a procedural grammar.

(2)-(4) implies a joint optimization, but the described method involves first pre-training a general policy and then using it for evaluation. The connection between the formal problem and the practical algorithm is not well-established, making the algorithm feel more like an effective heuristic than a direct solution to the stated objective.\n- The real-world validation does not compare the co-designed system against a sufficiently strong, specialized baseline, making claims of overall system superiority difficult to substantiate. The experiment compares the optimized 3-fingered hand and the baseline anthropomorphic hand by deploying the same morphology-conditioned cross-embodiment policy on both. This effectively tests which morphology performs better given the proposed adaptive control framework. This comparison does not rule out the possibility that a state-of-the-art policy, trained specifically for the anthropomorphic hand, could outperform the co-designed system. The anthropomorphic hand's failure could stem from the universal policy's inability to master its higher-DOF control space, rather than a fundamental flaw in the hand's design for the task. To make a stronger claim about the superiority of the final co-designed system, the baseline should be a strong, existing design/policy pair (e.g., an anthropomorphic hand with a dedicated, highly-tuned policy), not just a standard design controlled by the paper's own universal policy.\n- Table 1 should be split into two tables.
