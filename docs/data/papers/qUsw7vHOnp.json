We introduce NEXUS (Neighborhood-Enhanced Correspondence Optimization Strategy), a novel framework that integrates local and global optimization to address the shape correspondence problem effectively. Our primary contribution is the Local Neighborhood Consistency (LNC) metric, a computationally efficient and robust measure for assessing correspondence quality using mesh connectivity rather than geodesic distances. Unlike prior metrics like Local Map Distortion (LMD), LNC is faster to compute (linear in number of edges in mesh adjacency), and is more resilient to non-isometric deformations. We couple LNC with a seeded graph matching approach to refine correspondences, achieving superior accuracy and speed compared to existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate NEXUS's effectiveness across diverse datasets, including near-isometric, non-isometric, and topologically noisy shapes. We also address implementation errors in prior LMD-based methods and highlight NEXUS's limitations, such as sensitivity to significant mesh connectivity discrepancies. Our work simplifies and accelerates shape correspondence pipelines while maintaining or improving accuracy.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Shape Correspondence"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a3cae2f1b1a2d20814df41216130e8b6bf512e28.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/5b510fa181e24fac1d3123b11c31ea7165d5e3fd.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes an optimization-based technique for solving non-rigid shape matching on meshes.

The paper's main novelty lies in a metric for neighborhood preservation in terms of connectivity, which is then integrated into previous approaches. However, neighborhood preservation is a well-known property to enforce. The paper does not discuss the line of work in combinatorial matching, such as [1,2,3,4], where neighborhood preservation and connectivity play an important role. Its improvement is not particularly notable compared to the baselines. Finally, since the method highly relies on topology, it suffers from remeshing. From Figure 2, the method seems to perform worse than HOPE, the baseline that inspires NEXUS. \n\n- Comparison provided by the paper in terms of curves makes it difficult to analyze the actual values, which could be useful to check that previous methods have been replicated consistently with previous works. I also believe that comparison with recent combinatorial methods listed above would be meaningful and in line with the approach proposed by the paper. It would also be interesting to compare on more recent datasets, like DT4D [5] (largely used in the shape matching community) and BeCoS [6] for partial shapes.\n\n- The paper presentation does not meet ICLR standards. The method discussion does not provide intuitions, and it is overcrowded with heavy notation. Related works are quite packed, and look like a list of methods without providing a positioning of the current work. Figures are not well-curated; for example, the curves in Figure 1 are crowded by methods that are particularly old (e.g., BIM), and every plot contains a legend in a different order. The text contains typos (e.g., line 301, missing square; Tab. 1 \"SHRECK\" instead of \"SHREC\" and \"ULRSS\" instead of \"ULRSSM\", also some entries are reported as \"0.61\" and others just \".61\"), and there are duplicated references (the paper \"Unsupervised learning of robust spectral shape\nmatching\" appears twice, and also \"Diffusionnet: Discretization agnostic learning on surfaces\"). Section 5 discusses a toy example to give an intuition of the proposed approach. While I appreciate the intent, I found it more suited for supplementary material, and maybe decorated with a visualization figure.

Section 2 uses a lot of acronyms, and key objects are not introduced before being used. In particular, Section 3 introduces several variables  ($f(P_{t-1})$, $lks$, $D_P$) without clear definitions or context.  Important properties of LNC are deferred to the appendix (\"Properties: Due to space, please see Appendix A\").\n\nSection 5’s toy example relies on showing fulll adjacency matrices without a clear visual. It also only works in the identical-triangulation setting and doesn’t reflect nor discuss the sensitivity to remeshing here. I think there is a deeper question to ask about using graph matching for geometric shapes (see below).\n\n**Framing and Scope**\n\nIn essence the approach is a seeded graph matching algorithm: computing per-vertex score from connectivity (LNC) to pick seeds, then refine the map by seeded GM. The paper should state this plainly and position itself within the seeded-GM literature, rather than presenting it primarily as a new geometric-matching principle.\n\n- The paper suggests that **discarding geometry is better for geometric matching** (\"LNC relies on connectivity, not geometric properties, making it resilient to non-isometric deformations\", Section 4). There is no consensus that throwing away geometric information improves shape matching. I'd even say that generally, high sensitivity to the triangulation is seen as a major issue in the literature. As written, the claim is way too strong and not backed by the experimental results.\n- Methodologically, the framework appears to mirror existing graph matching baselines (e.g. HOPE), with the main change being to swap the geodesic distances with h-hop adjacency matrices. That’s a fine idea, but it should be stated explicitly, with a clear positioning with similar baselines.\n\n**Results**\n\nMost figures are correspondence curves with many overlapping lines, which makes it hard to read off improvements. The claim of outperforming the closest baseline (HOPE) is difficult to verify from the plots alone.\n\nInclude quantitative numbers, and qualitative comparisons for multiple methods, not just the proposed one.\n\nThere is a mention of sensitivity to triangulation, but no discussion or results regarding matching fixed geometry with varying triangulations.\n\n\n**Technical Precision**\n\n- The paper treats the matrices $P$ as permutation matrices (Section 3, Section 4) which is not the case in practice with varying number of vertices. It is unclear what kind of matrix $P$ is used in practice.\n- Section 4 mixes dimension: $P^\\top A_2 P$ works if $P$ is $n_2 \\times n_1$, but $P$ is the opposite size as per Section 3\n- Eq (5) is internally not consistent: The paper defines $M$ as a diagonal mass matrix earlier, then uses $M_{ij}$  in a neighbor average in Eq(5) . If $M$ is diagonal, off-diagonals vanish, and the formula collapses. Please clarify whether you intended $M_{ii}$, and fix the equation accordingly.\n- It is unclear what Def 4.1 actually defines. It seems to be a mix between notations and definitions\n- Theorem 4.1 is not introduced nor discussed. It is unclear what its assumptions require, and how results on ER graph can relate or translate to shape meshes. I am also suspecting that there might be a typo: since $\\beta = \\frac{|B|}{n}$ already, I think the \"seed requirement\" part in Thm 4.1 concerne $|B|$ rather than $\\beta |B|$\n- \"Modified SHOT\" is mentioned but never defined\n- Original dataset papers for all datasets used **are not cited** (only one work that used them).\n- There are multiple typos that add friction."}, "questions": {"value": "1 - In what precise ways does your pipeline differ from HOPE beyond swapping LMD for LNC and the \"modified SHOT\" init?\n\n2 - Are you optimizing over a binary assignment, a doubly-stochastic relaxation, or a true permutation ?\n\n3 - What is \"Modified SHOT\" ?\n\n4 - Please restate Theorem 4.1 with precise assumptions and consequences. Also please provide a short explanation of how the ER-graph model informs shape graphs. I believe there is very little to share between the two. \n\n5 - Concretely, what should a practitioner take away from Theorem 4.1?\n\n6 - Do you believe that a connectivity-only graph-matching approach is the right general strategy for shape correspondence?

However, this is simply not true. Why make the entire paper focused on addressing this metric? There is a large class of shape correspondence algorithms that do not use it.\n- The authors emphasize the computational efficiency of LNC, claiming that it is linear in complexity. However, the metric is O(nv), where n is the number of nonzero entries in the adjacency matrix (basically the number of edges), and v is the number of vertices. How is this not a quadratic complexity?\n- The authors claim that deep learning-based mapping methods would need to be retrained. However, many DL-based works generalize quite well to a diverse class of shapes. There are even works that propose zero-shot matching (by test-time optimization, see [1], for example).\n- The claim that deep learning methods do not do well on partial shapes is also not true. \n- The improvement in computational wall clock time seems overblown. There is only 2 time numbers reported for pairs of meshes, and that is not enough to make a conclusion. Further, the paper does not even mention the speed of the deep learning-based shape matching methods. There are other classical methods, such as [2], that are somewhat fast and provide strong maps.\n\n### Limited Evaluation\n- The authors only report the geodesic error in their experiments. Additional metrics, for example, conformal distortion, looking at overlap in segmentation (when available)\n- Why are there so many blank entries on Table 1?\n- There are more works on deep learning-based matching that is not include. For example, [3]. \n- Can you also include figures of the lower quality meshes and partial shapes?\n- Overall, the evaluation is far too limited. The authors only picked a handful of meshes and claim that this method is superior to other mapping approaches. \n\n### Methodological concerns\n- Why is Equation (9) the right optimization problem to solve? As far as I see, this metric does not take any information about the mesh into account, and converts the mesh into a graph. \n\n\n### Clarity of Writing\n- Can the authors provide intuition behind equations (5) and (6)? What exactly are these trying to measure? What would minimize this metric? \n- Is there supposed to be a term Pt in Equation 3? P is not an optimization variable, and P is typically derived from C. \n\nOverall, I feel that there are too many dubious claims, that the author are not solving a major problem in shape matching, and that evaluation is limited.\n\n## References\n[1] Attaiki, Souhaib, and Maks Ovsjanikov. \"NCP: Neural correspondence prior for effective unsupervised shape matching.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 28842-28857.\n\n[2] Ezuz, Danielle, Justin Solomon, and Mirela Ben-Chen. \"Reversible harmonic maps between discrete surfaces.\" ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG) 38.2 (2019): 1-12.\n\n[3]Cao, Dongliang, et al. \"Spectral meets spatial: Harmonising 3d shape matching and interpolation.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2024."}, "questions": {"value": "- How would this work extend to soft mapping problems (i.e. where you compute a vertex-to-face or vertex-to-tet map), rather than a permutation matrix?
