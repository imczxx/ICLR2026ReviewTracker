Prior acceleration methods mainly reduce sampling steps or reuse intermediate results. Leveraging the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to handle variable token counts, we propose RAS, a training-free sampling strategy that dynamically assigns different update ratios to image regions based on model focus. Our key observation is that at each step, DiTs concentrate on semantically meaningful areas, and these regions exhibit strong continuity across consecutive steps. Exploiting this, RAS updates only focused regions while reusing cached noise for others, with focus determined from the previous step’s output. Evaluated on Stable Diffusion 3 and Lumina-Next-T2I, RAS achieves up to 2.36× and 2.51× speedups, respectively, with minimal quality loss. This demonstrates a practical step toward more efficient diffusion transformers for real-time generation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diffusion Transformer", "Dynamic Sampling Strategy", "Efficient Diffusion Sampling"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/78bbe435d90bcb24c78b6ec65922447af3cd0e9f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a training-free sampling strategy that dynamically assigns different update ratios to image regions based on model attention, thereby improving generation efficiency while preserving output quality.

Heuristic Nature and Limited Theoretical Justification.\nWhile the proposed method is empirically effective, its design is primarily heuristic. The use of noise standard deviation as an indicator of regional importance lacks strong theoretical grounding or formal justification. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the approach to different architectures, datasets, or diffusion formulations.\n\n2. Sensitivity to Hyperparameters and Stability Issues.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed Region-Adaptive Sampling (RAS) relies on several critical hyperparameters, such as the sampling ratio, the smoothing factor for patch-level statistics, and the starvation penalty coefficient. However, the paper does not provide a systematic analysis of their influence. The potential sensitivity of these parameters may affect both stability and reproducibility in practical deployments.\n\n3. Lack of Semantic Awareness in Importance Estimation.\nThe current method determines regional importance solely based on noise variance, which does not necessarily correlate with semantic significance. As a result, the model might focus excessively on low-level texture regions while overlooking semantically meaningful areas, particularly in multimodal or text-guided generation tasks.\n\n4. Optimization Restricted to Intra-step Efficiency.\nThe proposed method reduces computation per diffusion step but does not fundamentally shorten the diffusion trajectory or reduce the total number of sampling steps. Consequently, the overall acceleration remains bounded by the inherent diffusion process length."}, "questions": {"value": "None."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "PoFSI3ifUy", "forum": "gCZYei3PLL", "replyto": "gCZYei3PLL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7697/Reviewer_2sgM"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7697/Reviewer_2sgM"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7697/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761414120230, "cdate": 1761414120230, "tmdate": 1762919755825, "mdate": 1762919755825, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "UcaQ8A30FW", "forum": "gCZYei3PLL", "replyto": "gCZYei3PLL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7697/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7697/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762945367208, "cdate": 1762945367208, "tmdate": 1762945367208, "mdate": 1762945367208, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new sampling method called Region-adaptive sampling, which dynamically assigns different update ratios to image regions based on model foucs.

One awkward point is that RAS seems to achieve comparable quality to standard methods only at lower step counts, while outperforming them in speed.
