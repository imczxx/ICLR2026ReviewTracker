Identifying which reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By analyzing both the extent and temporal course of latent representational change, as well as its alignment with the final state, we show that these signals are strong predictors of solution accuracy, outperforming conventional output-based confidence measures. We use latent-trajectory signals to guide answer selection across multiple sampled generations, demonstrating that they make test-time scaling more effective and efficient, reducing token usage by up to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average in comparison with majority voting. Finally, we show that these signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace, which enables early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising candidates during generation. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Test Time Scaling", "Reasoning", "Interpretability", "Representational Analysis"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6c36265607c2d4fcd78f2668a6888ba1415b5b61.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this work, the paper explores whether through intermediate activations we can identify chains of thought that are unlikely to lead to a correct answer and, if so, leverage these signals to guide the selection of more promising reasoning paths.

They find the signals can predict solution correctness across various science, math, and algorithmic benchmarks on several reasoning models, consistently outperforming baselines like cross-layer signals and output-distribution metrics.

The evaluation is restricted to three models of a similar size from only two architectural families (Qwen and Phi). This lack of extensive analysis across different model types and, crucially, different model sizes (e.g., 7B, 70B, or larger) makes it unclear if these signals are a fundamental property of scaled reasoning or an emergent artifact of the specific models tested. Without this verification, there are significant questions about whether the method will \"survive scaling\" and generalize to future, more capable architectures.\n\n2.  **Insufficient Discussion of Training Alternatives**: The work positions itself as a necessary inference-time intervention without adequately addressing why modern training methods, such as reinforcement learning (e.g., GRPO-style approaches), are not already solving this problem. A key question left unanswered is why models cannot be trained to inherently favor productive reasoning strategies, which would be a more robust and fundamental solution than applying a post-hoc heuristic. This omission weakens the justification for needing such an inference-time fix.\n\n3.  **Narrow Domain Scope**: The experiments are confined to three specific and relatively structured reasoning domains: scientific multiple-choice (GPQA), contest math (AIME 2025), and algorithmic optimization (TSP). The paper does not evaluate the signals on more diverse or open-ended tasks, such as commonsense reasoning, creative problem-solving, or multi-hop question answering over text.

Moderate correlation and robustness: The reported correlations (Spearman's r in Table 3) are moderate, often falling in the 0.3-0.7 range. While the authors show this is sufficient for the tested datasets, this moderate correlation suggests the signal is somewhat noisy and raises concerns about the method's robustness when applied to different models, domains, or tasks.\n\n2. Heavy reliance on unjustified hyperparameters: The methodology is built on several ad-hoc, empirical settings that lack strong theoretical or intuitive justification. For example, segmentation (k=500), averaging (across-layer), or checkpoint (t=2000) in early pruning experiment. This work does not provide a guide on how to set this parameters when applied to other tasks.\n\n3. Missing Comparison to Key Related Work: A critical weakness is the lack of experimental comparison to highly relevant, concurrent work. Specifically, the paper does not compare ST-BoN [1], which shares an identical motivation (efficient Best-of-N) but uses a competing approach (spatial/layer-wise trajectory analysis). Given the strong overlap in goals, a direct comparison is necessary to properly situate this work's contribution.\n\nReference:\n[1] Wang Y, Zhang P, Huang S, et al.

The method's reliance on calibration on a labeled (correct/incorrect) dataset seems to limit its application.
