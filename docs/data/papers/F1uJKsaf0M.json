However, existing methods extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities. Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold. Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines under few-shot and cross-domain settings.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["hyperbolic geometry", "modality alignment", "multimodal learning"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/846e202e7d6aa5b6683128203bcaa976c7c83c15.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes \"Alignment across Trees,\" a novel method for aligning vision and language modalities by constructing symmetric, hierarchical feature representations for both.

The paper’s literature review, while good, overlooks several relevant lines of work. It would be stronger if it discussed the concept of emergent alignment in models, and positioned the proposed \"intermediate manifold\" with respect to related concepts such as:\n    - The idea of a universal or shared latent space, as explored in work on relative representations [1,2]. The proposed \"intermediate manifold\" seems to be a generalization of this concept to heterogeneous hyperbolic spaces.\n    - The general problem of identifiability in representation learning (e.g., [3]), as the proposed work is implicitly trying to learn an identifiable hierarchical structure\n\n\n2.  Some of the visual results used to support the paper's claims are difficult to interpret without further evidence. For instance, the qualitative improvement in clustering in Figure 5 is not immediately obvious, and the attention map visualizations in Figure 6 lack a crucial comparison to the baseline.\n\n3. While the paper includes ablations, further analysis would strengthen the claims. For example, an ablation on the novel manifold distance definition and an analysis of the learned curvatures would provide deeper insight into the method's behavior.\n\n--- \n\n[1] Moschella, et al, \"Relative representations enable zero-shot latent space communication,\" in ICLR, 2023.\n\n[2] Cannistraci, et al, \"From Bricks to Bridges: Product of Invariances to Enhance Latent Space Communication,\" in ICLR, 2024.\n\n[3] Kivva, et al, \"Identifiability of deep generative models without auxiliary information,\" NeuriIPS 2022."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The manuscript introduces a new function D to measure the distance between hyperbolic manifolds. Is this function a formal distance metric (i.e., does it satisfy non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry, and the triangle inequality)? A brief discussion on this would be helpful.\n\n2. The learnable curvatures are an interesting component. Could the authors provide some analysis on the learned values? For instance, do textual and visual manifolds for semantically similar/distinct data end up with correspondingly similar/distinct curvatures? This could provide valuable insight.\n\n3.  Figure 5: The claim that the method achieves \"improved feature separability\" is hard to verify by visual inspection alone, especially for the \"Order\" and \"Class\" levels. Could it be supplemented with a quantitative clustering metric (e.g., Silhouette Score or Calinski-Harabasz Index) to more formally support this claim?\n\n4. Figure 6: These attention maps are very compelling. However, to demonstrate that the method is responsible for this hierarchical attention, it is essential to show the corresponding attention maps from the baseline. Does the regularization and alignment strategy actually cause the model to shift its attention in this structured way compared to the baseline?\n\n5.

Furthermore, the utilization of intermediate features is a well-established technique, diminishing the perceived novelty of this part of the proposed framework.\n- Concern about sensitivity to hyperparameters. The proposed method introduces a non-trivial number of hyperparameters, and its performance is likely sensitive to their careful tuning. Key hyperparameters include the choice of intermediate transformer layers, the initial values for the learnable curvatures, and the loss weighting factor α.

This seems to massively alter the nature of the task, as now the parent hierarchy is already given in each textual label. If the motivation for this step, as claimed by the authors, is just to deal with ambiguous labels, then why not add a small extra term just to ambiguous labels?\n\n- The paper currently lacks a larger discussion of methods for hierarchy/taxonomy alignment.

The relationship to the broader field of hierarchical/taxonomy alignment could be explored further.\n\n- The alignment occurs in multiple phases rather than a single one, in particular it occurs via the Heterogeneous Manifold Alignment Algorithm but also earlier via cross-attention in the Semantic-Aware Visual Feature Extraction Framework. This cross-attention between image and text in the Semantic-Aware Visual Feature Extraction Framework (Eq. 5) appears to allow information to be copied over between modalities.
