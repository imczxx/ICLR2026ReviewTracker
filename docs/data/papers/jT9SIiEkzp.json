Although initially BART was proposed for predicting only continuous and binary response variables, over the years multiple extensions have emerged that are suitable for estimating a wider class of response variables (e.g. categorical and count data) in a multitude of application areas. In this paper we describe a Generalized framework for Bayesian trees and their additive ensembles where the response variable comes from an exponential family distribution and hence encompasses a majority of these variants of BART. We derive sufficient conditions on the response distribution, under which the posterior concentrates at a near minimax rate. Our results provide theoretical justification for the empirical success of BART and its variants. In addition, the sufficient conditions provide important insights into practical model specifications such as the choice of link functions.", "tldr": "We derive sufficient conditions under which Bayesian Additive Regression Trees achieve minimax convergence rates for general response variables in the exponential family.", "keywords": ["Bayesian additive regression trees", "BART", "Posterior concentration", "Minimax rate", "Exponential family", "Generalized linear models"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8baf1e340d2e74735ab95b659a7da39c2efd7de5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "BART is a Bayesian ensemble tree model that is widely used as a method for flexibly estimating nonlinear functions while quantifying prediction uncertainty.
