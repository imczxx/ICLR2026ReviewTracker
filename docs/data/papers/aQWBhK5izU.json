In this paper, we introduce the first credal graph neural networks (CGNNs), which extend credal learning to the graph domain by training GNNs to output set-valued predictions in the form of credal sets. To account for the distinctive nature of message passing in GNNs, we develop a complementary approach to credal learning that leverages different aspects of layer-wise information propagation. We assess our approach on uncertainty quantification in node classification under out-of-distribution conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the graph homophily assumption in shaping the effectiveness of uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGNNs deliver more reliable representations of epistemic uncertainty and achieve state-of-the-art performance under distributional shift on heterophilic graphs.", "tldr": "We introduce credal graph neural networks (CGNNs), the first GNNs that output set-valued predictions to better capture epistemic uncertainty, and show they achieve state-of-the-art robustness to distributional shift on heterophily graphs.", "keywords": ["graph neural networks", "credal learning", "uncertainty quantification"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/acea5f66bbc0663e8946a4da07669f717020654e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes to predict credal sets for node classification from the concatenated embeddings of a node in a GNN.

There are also no novel theoretical insights for applying credal learning to GNNs using the embeddings from all layers to compensate.\n\n- The empirical performance of the approach is not convincing: The proposed epistemic uncertainty only performs well on 2/6 graphs. Additionally, the predictive performance of `CredalLJ` deteriorates notably on many datasets (see Table 3). This makes the method impractical. \n\n- The evaluation misses several relevant baselines: Graph PostNet [2] is a well-established method for UQ, and also recent advancements like GEBM [3] or (ICML paper)[4] are not considered.\n\n- For a paper whose contribution is limited to combining existing methods, the experimental studies are limited. The authors ablate three variants of their approach. Following [4], it would be interesting to see if there are certain layers beyond the final one that drive UQ performance. Additionally, it could be studied if the credal GNNs capture homophily / heterophily patterns for the respective graphs by predicting smooth / unsmooth credal sets between neighbours. There is also no study on using different GNN backbones to validate the applicability of the approach beyond GCN and SAGE -- and even for these two, there is no comprehensive study on if there are performance differences between the backbones.\n\n- The structure of the paper, especially regarding related work, can be improved: The related work section extensively discusses UQ in general but neglects both credal learning as well as works that focus on UQ for GNNs [GPN, GEBM, The recent ICML paper]. Some other references are spread throughout other sections (like JLDE [5] or some prior work on CL), but a bit misplaced. For example, the section starting at L. 198 ff. elaborates on theoretical concepts that have little impact on the proposed approach, which just concatenates latent embeddings. \n\n- The evaluation misses some well-established datasets in node classification, like CoraML, PubMed, Citeseer, as well as recent heterophilic benchmarks like Roman Empire and Tolokers [1]. \n\n## References\n[1] Platonov, Oleg, et al. \"A critical look at the evaluation of GNNs under heterophily: Are we really making progress?.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.11640 (2023).\n[2] Stadler, Maximilian, et al. \"Graph posterior network: Bayesian predictive uncertainty for node classification.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 18033-18048.\n[3] Fuchsgruber, Dominik, Tom Wollschläger, and Stephan Günnemann. \"Energy-based epistemic uncertainty for graph neural networks.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 37 (2024): 34378-34428.\n[4] Fuchsgruber, Dominik, et al. \"Uncertainty Estimation for Heterophilic Graphs Through the Lens of Information Theory.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2505.22152 (2025)."}, "questions": {"value": "- The interval SoftMax is typically proposed in terms of $0.5 (a_v^{U_k} + a_v^{L_k})$ [5].
