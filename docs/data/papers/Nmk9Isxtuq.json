Current approaches like chain-of-thought prompting offer limited reasoning capabilities that fail when precise step validation is required. We propose Environment Augmented Generation (EAG), a framework that enhances LLM reasoning through: (1) real-time environmental feedback validating each reasoning step, (2) dynamic branch exploration for investigating alternative solution paths when faced with errors, and (3) experience-based learning from successful reasoning trajectories. Unlike existing methods, EAG enables deliberate backtracking and strategic replanning through tight integration of execution feedback with branching exploration. Our a1-32B model achieves state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models across all benchmarks, matching larger models like o1 on competition mathematics while outperforming comparable models by up to 24.4 percentage points. Analysis reveals EAG's distinctive scaling pattern: initial token investment in environment interaction yields substantial long-term performance dividends, with advantages amplifying proportionally to task complexity. EAG's theoretical framework demonstrates how environment interactivity and systematic branch exploration together establish a new paradigm for reliable machine reasoning, particularly for problems requiring precise multi-step calculation and logical verification.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Scaling Law", "LLM as Agent", "Tool-integrated LLM"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6f195638683a45eec68d8db669f0409c16e1cff4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces EAG, a framework designed to enhance reasoning through three components:\n1.

The model was trained on EAG-2K, a curated dataset of 2,000 interactive reasoning traces derived from the s1 dataset by converting natural language reasoning into executable Python code blocks using few-shot prompting with `claude-3.7-sonnet`.

This seems to be a practically useful improvement to the \"internal-reasoning only\" approaches that most reasoning works focus on today.\n- The EAG framework is an intuitive and well-designed scaffold for enabling search and backtracking with environment feedback."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "My main concern with this paper is the lack of experimental evidence supporting the two central claims of the paper: (1) that EAG is an effective scaffold for enabling inference-time search with environment feedback and (2) that SFT on the EAG-2K dataset is an effective training strategy for enabling inference-time search with EAG.\n\nIn order to prove claim 1, I believe the authors need to show that EAG is more effective than baseline methods, given a fixed inference compute budget AND given access to the same set of environments: the latter point is important because the contribution of this work is that EAG is a good way to leverage environment feedback for reasoning, rather than that leveraging environment feedback for reasoning is useful, as this is well-known from prior work (many cited in this paper). At minimum, the authors should show that EAG is more effective than a naive prompting baseline, and ideally they should also compare their methods against other interaction-enabled methods for reasoning (e.g. Gao et. al 2023, Chen et. al 2023). \n- From their experiments, it appears that the authors only compare a1-32B + EAG against other models + standard CoT generation and without access to a code interpreter, with the exception of START, where performance is similar (please let me know if I have misinterpreted your baseline settings). I believe there is a very strong possibility that many of these models have some innate ability to use code interpreters to assist in mathematical reasoning even with only naive prompting, and so I am unable to assess how much of the performance gain we see is due to EAG and how much is due merely to the fact that the a1-32B model has access to a code interpreter.\n- The only compute-controlled experiment (Figure 6) shows that a1-32B demonstrates better inference-compute scaling than s1-32B when reasoning beyond 8k tokens. However, s1-32B is only scales with sequential compute up to 8k tokens due to its training (see Figure 1 of the s1 paper), so it is unclear if this comparison provides any meaningful information on the effectiveness of a1's compute scaling beyond 8k tokens. I believe it would be preferable instead to compare a1's compute scaling properties with that of models that are trained to scale beyond 8k, so that we can directly compare, on a per-token basis, whether it is better to train models to spend their reasoning budget thinking internally or soliciting external feedback. I suspect that a1 should demonstrate superior per-token scaling, and hope to see updated results confirming this.\n\nIn order to prove claim 2, I believe the authors need to show that training on their EAG-2K dataset is necessary for EAG to work. As of now, it is unclear (due to a lack of ablation studies) whether (1) a base model prompted correctly can still function within the EAG framework and (2) how SFT changes the base model to enable it to function within EAG. These questions should be easily answerable given the correct ablation studies.\n\nFinally, it is currently unclear how the design choices within EAG affect performance, largely due to a lack of documentation on important hyperparameters (e.g. `alpha`, `w`, `\\lambda`, `D_max`, `C_max`, `tau` etc.), ablations over various design features and hyperparameters, and qualitative analyses on EAG outputs. This makes it difficult to understand how EAG exactly contributes to performance gains beyond merely enabling environment interaction (e.g. how often does EAG facilitate correct backtracking? how important is the hybrid policy? how accurate is the value estimate `V_b`?). Without such understanding it is difficult to assess its potential impact on future work and the community at large.\n\nChen et. al 2023: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12588\nGao et. al 2023: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10435"}, "questions": {"value": "For me to increase my score, I would like to see my point about limited experimental evidence addressed through new experiments.
