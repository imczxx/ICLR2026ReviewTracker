The parameters of these logistic components are identified using the Continuous Wavelet Transform with logistic wavelets. \nThe approximation achieves a very close numerical approximation (Rsquared approx 0.999985) for a specific Gompertz trend with fixed parameters.

Using logistic wavelets to approximate a Gompertz trend is, as dar as I can see, original.\n2. The exposition is well structured and easy to follow.\n3. I agree that the result that three logistic terms yield such a high-quality approximation could be useful for applied modeling.\n4. The approach might extend to other S-shaped growth models or data-driven growth processes. So this example could be the basis for a more comprehensive project."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The scope is limited. Only one specific Gompertz function is tested. The method’s behavior for general parameters or noisy data is not explored. It is vaguely claimed that the approach generalizes, but a formal statement is missing.\n2. No mathematical guarantees are given, e.g., no proof that three logistic terms are needed for such an error, or, more interestingly, how the approximation error behaves as more terms are added.\n3. It is unclear if the wavelet based approach finds the best three teem approximation.\n4. The “interpretation” of the three logistic waves (growth, inhibition, boost) is speculative rather than analytically grounded.\n5. No concrete application, where the three term approximation is used to some advantage, is presented.\n6. The work seems too narrow and descriptive for a top-tier conference like ICLR."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can the authors provide theoretical guarantees or error bounds for approximating a Gompertz function with n logistic terms?\n2. Is the three-term representation optimal in some sense?\n3. How does the approximation quality scale with the number of logistic components? (For more than 3.)\n4. Can the method be generalized to Gompertz functions with arbitrary parameters or to noisy empirical data?\n5. What would be the advantage of the wavelet-based parameter identification compared to a direct regression fit (e.g., LASSO)?\n6.
