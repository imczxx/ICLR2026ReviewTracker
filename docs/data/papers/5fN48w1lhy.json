The front‑door (FD) adjustment identifies causal effects through mediators even with unmeasured confounding. However, most estimators focus on *average treatment effects*, and work on *heterogeneous treatment effect* (HTE) estimation remain scarce. We address this gap with two *debiased* learners for heterogeneous FD effects: *FD‑DR‑Learner* and *FD‑R‑Learner*. Both attain fast, quasi-oracle rates (i.e., performance comparable to an oracle that knows the nuisances) even when nuisance functions converge as slowly as $n^{-1/4}$. Beyond theory, we demonstrate fast convergence and debiasedness in synthetic and real-world evaluations. Our results show that the proposed learners deliver robust and debiased HTE estimates under the FD scenario.", "tldr": "We developed debiased estimators for heterogeneous front-door causal effects.", "keywords": ["front-door", "heterogeneous-treatment-effect.orthogonal-statistical-learning"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f23d48b7194cbbf1f81b45d901401c149f4a2d53.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6defe7cc0c8eb217b1b0115a274546b9e6d4002d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose an adaptation of the R-learner for CATE estimation using a front-door structure with a binary mediator (instead of a back-door adjustment which the R-learner was developped for).
