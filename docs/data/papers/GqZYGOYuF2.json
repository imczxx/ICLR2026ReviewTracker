Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this ability, test-time scaling methods such as Best-of-$N$ drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation. Worse, the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide such confidence estimates, but these add substantial inference cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token during generation, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length—no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that include choosing the number of initial samples, immediate pruning, and planned future pruning. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward–cost introspection, ZIP-RC allows models to reason more adaptively, producing outputs that are faster, cheaper, and more trustworthy.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Model", "Test-time compute", "Value Function", "Sampling"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bd548d1dce33881f557e1e4b711ea50c0236ff7b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work is in the context of autoregressive Language Models with a finite vocabulary (i.e. popular transformer-based LLMs).\nThe paper aims to improve the model's introspective ability (e.g., predicting at each token, prediction final\nreward and remaining length) without increasing the test time inference cost.\nTo enable this, the paper proposes to use a reserved or unused set of logits and thus claims to require no additional compute at inference time.\nThe paper examines this within the framework of test-time scaling, i.e., using test-time compute for improved performance."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The paper's clarity in the main approach section is limited. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 are difficult to parse and would benefit from more careful dissemination, including model/approach figures.\n2. The paper claims **zero** inference time overhead. However, computations described in Section 4.2, paragraph \"Sampling utility.\" suggest that additional computations and parameters (alpha, beta, ...) are required (even though they may be small compared to the overall computation and parameter requirements of the LLM). It would be important to clarify this.\n4. The paper's approach heavily relies on a reserved set of logits but does not describe where they come from. Would we save compute if we are not using these \"reserved\" logits? This also relates to the previous point: Do these reserved logits basically represent additional computation needed for this approach\n3. I think the paper is missing an important baseline, which does not change the underlying LLM (i.e. one does not need the KL term), but just optimizes the same reward and cost (ZIP-RC) using a small MLP (one? or two layers), which has access to the same logits used for the proposed approach.\n\n\n## Minor weaknesses\n1. all formulas should be numbered so one can refer to them"}, "questions": {"value": "Please comment on / address the weaknesses above.\n\nAdditionally:\n1. line 267: \"ZIP-RC modifies only the sampling policy at inference-time.\" This seems misleading as the model does train and thus changes the parameters of the original models.\n2.

The idea of using reserved vocabulary positions to produce auxiliary predictions with truly zero overhead is novel and elegant.

The mathematical formulation of the sampling utility in Equation 1 provides an interpretable framework for balancing competing objectives through the α and β hyperparameters.\n\n3.

The evaluation focuses exclusively on mathematical reasoning tasks. It's unclear whether ZIP-RC's benefits extend to other domains like creative writing, coding, or open-ended question answering where the reward structure and token length distributions may be very different. Mathematical problems have clear correctness labels and relatively predictable structure, which may make reward/cost prediction easier than in other domains.\n\n2. The authors acknowledge that their method relies on having sufficiently diverse samples from the initial pool, but they don't actually address this limitation. If doubling the number of samples doesn't produce qualitatively different reasoning paths, ZIP-RC cannot improve performance. This is a fundamental constraint that limits when the method can be applied effectively. Some analysis of sample diversity in their experiments would strengthen the work.\n\n3. The paper doesn't clearly specify how many vocabulary positions are reserved, how this impacts the model's generative capabilities, or what the training cost is.
