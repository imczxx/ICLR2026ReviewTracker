However, its standard formulation treats signals on structured spaces---such as fMRI data on brain graphs---as points in Euclidean space, overlooking the rich topological features of their domains. To address this, we introduce \\emph{topological flow matching}, a topology-aware generalization of flow matching. We interpret flow matching as a framework for solving a degenerate Schrödinger bridge problem and inject topological information by augmenting the reference process with a Laplacian-derived drift. This principled modification captures the structure of the underlying domain while preserving the desirable properties of flow matching: a stable, simulation-free objective and deterministic sample paths. As a result, our framework serves as a plug-and-play replacement for standard flow matching. We demonstrate its effectiveness on diverse structured datasets, including brain fMRIs, ocean currents, seismic events, and traffic flows.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Flow Matching", "Generative Models", "Topological Deep Learning", "Geometric Deep Learning", "Graphs", "Simplicial Complexes", "Schrödinger Bridge", "Optimal Transport"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a61dc9d012d0c2f4066959c75af77ddd088e50ce.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors then derived topological flow matching based on the following two ideas or framework:\n1. the unifying framework between the popular flow matching and Schrodinger bridge matching methods in terms of optimal transport (OT).\n2. a piece of recent work generalizing the classical schrodinger bridge matching to the topological setting ---- where a brownian motion reference process is generalized by a topological diffusion driven reference process."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "This paper studied the flow matching method in the topological setting and the experiments are diverse."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. In my opinion, both methods, flow matching and bridge matching, have their pros and cons, where the former is more straightforward and efficient in terms of training, whereas the latter is more detailed in terms of modeling the intermediate distributions. Intermediate states modeling and learning are quite important in many engineering and science problems, e.g., single-cell dynamics, or the other trajectory related problems in this paper. For this reason, I think the paper can be improved by considering trajectory related tasks in topological settings, otherwise, it's hard to capture the advantage of flow matching besides improving the numbers. \n2.

In experiments, how do you optimize the diffusion coefficient $\\kappa$? Could you elaborate experiment findings, in terms of, e.g., topological diffusion? Moreover, could we measure the training efficiency of flow matching compared to bridge matching? Without this, it's hard to see the advantage of flow matching besides improving the numbers.

Especially,  \n\n* The word \"topology\" is not precisely defined in the paper. I could only guess from the context that it is related to the graphical structure of the data, which does not seem to be a standard definition for me (For me, the standard definition of topology refers to a topological space in analysis).\n  \n* It is not clear to me where does the matrix $L_k$ come from and how the data $X_1$ is related to the matrix $L_k$. From the context, I can only infer that $L_k$ is determined by some domain experts or auxiliary knowledge and is independent from data $X_1$.\n\n* As a consequence of 1 and 2, it is not clear to me on how the flow ODE ignores the topology while the proposed method retains it around line 247, which seems to be an important advantage of the proposed method.\n\nOn the other hand, I think the empirical validation is insufficient. While this work claims standard FM in Euclidean space ignores the rich graph structure on data, it does not empirically compare the proposed method against generative models in Euclidean space. \n\nAdditionally, the equation on line 220 seems to suggest that we can diagonalize the flow with a change of coordinates. If so, what is the advantage of the proposed method against  1. performing change of coordinates 2. then applying generative models in Euclidean space. 3. transforming the generated data back to the original coordinates when sampling.\n\nFor the ACs and the authors to better understand my position, I'm familiar with SDE, diffusion, and flow models and I have some exposure to Schrodinger Bridge literature. But I have no working knowledge on data with a graph structure. \n\nI'm happy to increase the score if the authors could help me better appreciate their work."}, "questions": {"value": "1. how should I interpret the SBP when $\\sigma \\to 0$? It seems like the reference process then becomes an ODE? What if you just solve the SBP with zero-noise? Would it still be a well-posed optimal transport problem? If so, will it lead to the same vector field on line 246?\n\n2. What motivates the particular form in (11) and $H_t$ as a polynomial? \n\n3. The form of (11), the change of coordinate interpretation (around line 220), and the infinite dimensional generalization (line 781-795) in the appendix altogether present significant resemblance in form with some recent works on diffusion/flow models on functional space, like [1, 2, 3, 5]. Do you think there is any potential connections? Maybe the functional models can be deduced from the SBP perspective or your proposed model can be considered as a special instance of functional model on non-Euclidean space?\n\n4.

The paper presents the flow matching as the variance0  limit of the Schrodinger bridge, and extends it to the Simplicial complex in a computable form by changing the reference process that acts as the regularizing anchor from which the solution flow can not diverge too greatly. The reference process is changed from the usual Wiener process to a process with Laplacian drift. \nMost importantly , the paper's proposed loss objective maintains that the solution of their topological analogue of the Schrodinger bridge problem can be computed with the coupling that can be optimized with the loss of the closed form. \nThe method is shown competitive on various datasets."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "This paper not only tackles an important problem of extending FM to general geometry (not necessarily Riemannian), it showcases a beautiful analogue between the propositions and the classical results.

From place to places, the conditions of the theoretical results are \"embedded\" in the paragraphs, for instance, in the first subsection of 3.1 (1. Conditional vector field ....  The diffusion briged in Eq 7 simplifies to)... shall, at least in my understanding, read as \"when $b=0$ and $\\sigma_t=\\sigma_0$, the diffusion bridge SDE in equation 7 simplifies to\".  Indeed, this is stated at the head of the 3.1, but it is separated by the section header and it took a while for me to make the connection.  I got lost several places through out, I would very much appreciate if the preambles of the theoretical statements are more complete and self contained inside each \"thm environment\". \n\n2. Also, the reason of using the reference process of the proposed form seem to lack strong enough motivation.  I buy that this choice leads to very clean results and introduces a topological heat equation flavor, but why this choice, more precisely?   Using a refernece process \"with drift\" seems like a wild card that I have never seen out of finance. The effort  of the justification seems to be made in 3.2 but it did not click with me----why mix Wiener with (11) instead of completely replacing it with, say, a  corresponding stochastic analogue of heat equation in the topological space (maybe a one driven with an ensemble of random walk)?  Is additive mix with standard wiener process a logical choice?  What extreme case is this choice supposed to resolve? \n Because the paper is presenting a method that I believe, is intended to merit the applied community of wide range, I believe that the audience deserves further elaboration.   Correspondence table of comparison against standard Schrodinger may also be helpful. \n\n\n3. In a related note with 2, a demonstrative extreme case experiments produced by synthetic data might have been helpful. \n\n\n4.
