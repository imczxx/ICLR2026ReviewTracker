The core premise is that task vectors, which represent the difference between a fine-tuned model and a pretrained model, often contain redundant and noisy components that degrade performance when multiple models are merged. PAVE addresses this by employing a knowledge-aware subspace analysis. It computes a task-specific covariance matrix using data from the target task and then performs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the task vectors. This process allows for the isolation and pruning of task-irrelevant, low-rank components, thereby retaining only the most salient, high-rank information. A key advantage of PAVE is its modular, plug-and-play design, enabling its integration with various existing model merging methods, such as EMR-Merging, Ties-Merging, and Task Arithmetic. The authors demonstrate that this purification step leads to improved performance across a range of tasks and models."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "PAVE is presented as a plug-and-play method, which can benefit various existing model merging methods.\nThe paper is well-organized and easy to follow."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The strategy of retaining high-rank components is quite similar to the approach used in the TSV method [1], which also focuses on keeping the high-rank components of task vectors. It would be beneficial to compare PAVE with TSV through an ablation study, such as replacing the SVD approach with WC by directly performing SVD on the task vectors T, where T represents the task vectors.\nAlthough the pruning strategy that selectively retains high-rank components is reasonable, the paper does not fully justify the choice of rank for each model and each layer. Further explanation of how the rank is chosen or how it varies across tasks and layers would strengthen the argument.\nThe theoretical grounding for the minimization objective in Equation 7 is weak. The paper fails to provide a clear justification for why minimizing this objective correlates with improved final performance. Consequently, its use as a greedy metric for selecting task parameter ranks seems arbitrary, as there is no guarantee that a larger objective value for a specific subspace corresponds to its greater importance for the task.\nThe performance improvements with PAVE are not consistent across methods. While it shows significant improvement with EMR-Merging and Ties-Merging, the gains with Task Arithmetic are relatively small. This variability in adaptability reduces the robustness of PAVE as a plug-and-play solution, which is a critical characteristic for practical deployment.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the method relies heavily on the availability of task-specific data for the decomposition process. This could be a limitation in scenarios where only limited samples or no task-specific data are available, making the method less flexible and potentially unsuitable for some use cases.\n Also, the computational cost of performing SVD on high-dimensional task vectors for large-scale models can be significant. For models with many layers and parameters, this could lead to high memory and processing requirements, which may limit the scalability of the method in practical applications.\n\n[1] Gargiulo A A, Crisostomi D, Bucarelli M S, et al.
