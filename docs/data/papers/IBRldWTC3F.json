In fact, the use of a limited number of data samples is not only widely accepted but also integral to several established merging techniques.** For example, Fisher-Merging [1] and RegMean-Merging [2], RegMean++ [3] explicitly rely on data samples, as evidenced by Equation 2 in [1], Equation 1 in [2], and Algorithms 1 in [3],  while test-time adaptation methods like AdaMerging [4] and Concrete Subspace Learning [5] even require test data to optimizes an entropy-based objective, as shown in Section 3.2.2 in [4] and Algorithm 1 in [5].\n\n\nWe also quote some sentences from these paper here as evidence:\n\nFisher-Merging, page 4:\n\n\"\"\nIn our experiments, we estimated the diagonal of the Fisher matrix via Equation 2, where $x_1, \\ldots, x_N$ are drawn i.i.d. from the dataset that was used to train the model.\n\"\"\n\nRegMean-Merging, page 16: \n\n\"In our main experiments, we use N = 1000 batches (of size 16) for computing inner product matrices. We present additional analysis about the effect of N and summarize results in Table 6. In general, performance improves as we increase N, but the performance soon saturates around N = 100.\" \n\nRegMean++, page 7:\n\n\"In this section,we investigate the effects of data characteristics on merging performance with three different experiment settings: (1) number of samples: we randomly select samples from the training set of each task, (2) class imbalance: we randomly select samples from a random class in the training set of each task, and (3) OOD samples: we randomly select samples from the ImageNet database as an OOD dataset for all tasks.\"\n\nAdaMerging, page 2: \n\n\"In this paper, our inspiration comes from test-time adaptation schemes aimed at optimizing model generalization when faced with previously unseen test data. Building upon these concepts, we introduce an innovative automatic unsupervised multi-task model merging scheme. This scheme leverages the minimization of prediction distribution entropy on unlabeled multi-task test data as a surrogate objective to adaptively learn model merging coefficients\"\n\n\nConcrete Subspace Learning, page 6:\n\n\"In this section, we discuss a situation wherein the target dataset is exclusively composed of unlabeled test data. This\nimplies that our objective is centered around the concept of test-time adaptation, where the focus is on adapting\nand refining the merged model’s performance specifically during the testing phase.\"\n\n\nOur method PAVE similarly relies on a small number of task-domain samples to compute the covariance matrix. Importantly, our approach does not require full access to the training set. As demonstrated in Figure 4, as few as 256 samples are sufficient to achieve strong performance and induce minor variance. To further address the reviewers’ concerns about strictly data-free settings, we additionally provide two alternative solutions that do not rely on the original training data.\n\n\n\n**1. Using data from a related domain**\n\nThe samples we use serve only to activate the model’s weights during decomposition. If the original training data is no longer accessible, it is sufficient to use data drawn from a similar knowledge domain. Such insight has been shared in the prior study [6]. For instance, Table 7 in [6] presents an experiment where WizardLM-Evol-Instruct and Alpaca are used to collect covariance matrices, which are then evaluated on MTBench. Following this principle, we can also use data from a similar domain without access to the source training data. Concretely, in our generative task experiments under the previous setting, the covariance matrix is generated by samples from the training set of GSM8K and MATH (for math reasoning) and CodeFeedBack (for code generation). In the following experiments, we show that Lila-Math (for math reasoning) and OpenCodeInstruct (for code generation) can effectively replace samples from the original training sets. We include numerical results below to demonstrate this."}}, "id": "UtdfOL9d0q", "forum": "IBRldWTC3F", "replyto": "IBRldWTC3F", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2421/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2421/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2421/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763734081396, "cdate": 1763734081396, "tmdate": 1763734081396, "mdate": 1763734081396, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces PAVE (Purifying and Amalgamating Task Vectors), a novel method designed to enhance model merging performance by purifying task vectors. The core premise is that task vectors, which represent the difference between a fine-tuned model and a pretrained model, often contain redundant and noisy components that degrade performance when multiple models are merged. PAVE addresses this by employing a knowledge-aware subspace analysis. It computes a task-specific covariance matrix using data from the target task and then performs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the task vectors. This process allows for the isolation and pruning of task-irrelevant, low-rank components, thereby retaining only the most salient, high-rank information. A key advantage of PAVE is its modular, plug-and-play design, enabling its integration with various existing model merging methods, such as EMR-Merging, Ties-Merging, and Task Arithmetic. The authors demonstrate that this purification step leads to improved performance across a range of tasks and models."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "PAVE is presented as a plug-and-play method, which can benefit various existing model merging methods.\nThe paper is well-organized and easy to follow."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The strategy of retaining high-rank components is quite similar to the approach used in the TSV method [1], which also focuses on keeping the high-rank components of task vectors. It would be beneficial to compare PAVE with TSV through an ablation study, such as replacing the SVD approach with WC by directly performing SVD on the task vectors T, where T represents the task vectors.\nAlthough the pruning strategy that selectively retains high-rank components is reasonable, the paper does not fully justify the choice of rank for each model and each layer. Further explanation of how the rank is chosen or how it varies across tasks and layers would strengthen the argument.\nThe theoretical grounding for the minimization objective in Equation 7 is weak. The paper fails to provide a clear justification for why minimizing this objective correlates with improved final performance. Consequently, its use as a greedy metric for selecting task parameter ranks seems arbitrary, as there is no guarantee that a larger objective value for a specific subspace corresponds to its greater importance for the task.\nThe performance improvements with PAVE are not consistent across methods. While it shows significant improvement with EMR-Merging and Ties-Merging, the gains with Task Arithmetic are relatively small. This variability in adaptability reduces the robustness of PAVE as a plug-and-play solution, which is a critical characteristic for practical deployment.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the method relies heavily on the availability of task-specific data for the decomposition process. This could be a limitation in scenarios where only limited samples or no task-specific data are available, making the method less flexible and potentially unsuitable for some use cases.\n Also, the computational cost of performing SVD on high-dimensional task vectors for large-scale models can be significant. For models with many layers and parameters, this could lead to high memory and processing requirements, which may limit the scalability of the method in practical applications.\n\n[1] Gargiulo A A, Crisostomi D, Bucarelli M S, et al.
