Leveraging their complementarity, an emerging direction is to synthesize fMRI from EEG, enriching EEG with spatial information while retaining its efficiency. However, existing EEG to fMRI generation methods often lack designs to preserve information completeness and neglect neurophysiological priors, leading to reconstructions that may appear plausible but fail to ensure neuroscientific validity. We introduce NeuroCycle, a cyclic EEG–fMRI generation framework that enforces information completeness and neuroscientific plausibility. It incorporates two neurophysiological priors: (i) a Cross-Modal ROI-wise Structural Module that aligns fMRI embeddings with EEG-derived correlation patterns to preserve regional organization, and (ii) an R2E Physiological Connectivity Guidance Module that supervises covariance matrices via Riemannian-to-Euclidean mapping to maintain functional connectivity. The bidirectional cycle (EEG$\\rightarrow$fMRI$\\rightarrow$EEG) further enforces information completeness and cross-modal alignment, ensuring that synthesized fMRI retains key neural information.

The first one (named cross-modal ROI-wise structural module) is meant to preserve the functional connectivity observed in the GT-EEG data in the learned fMRI embeddings (which are used to reconstruct EEG data in the next step).

Without signal-level regularization or spatial alignment, the model is likely to reconstruct averaged brain structures or anatomically inconsistent brain volumes for unseen subjects (Since every individual’s brain anatomy is unique, it would be impossible for a model trained on unregistered brains to accurately reconstruct a new subject’s brain structure), resulting in unrealistic ROI-level signals after parcellation. Consequently, when voxel-wise volumes are parcellated into ROI-level time series, the resulting signals may no longer reflect physiologically meaningful BOLD fluctuations, as the defined ROIs might not correspond to their true anatomical locations. This can lead to (1) distorted functional connectivity estimation and (2) reduced reliability in downstream analyses.\n    - In short, without appropriate preprocessing and careful consideration of fMRI-specific characteristics, the model risks generating anatomically plausible but functionally meaningless fMRI volumes, thereby undermining both the biological validity and generalizability of its results. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that paired EEG–fMRI datasets are typically small and scarce, making the model prone to overfitting and less capable of reconstructing realistic brain structures and shapes or neural activity patterns for unseen subjects (and there would also would be potential domain shifts across different demographics or MRI scanners/sites), raising concerns about the physiological validity of the approach. \n\n2. The paper evaluates the generated fMRI only in terms of spatial reconstruction quality, without further analyses such as temporal reconstruction assessment, which is crucial for validating the reliability of fMRI signals used in functional connectivity estimation or ROI time-series extraction. Also, the capability of the reconstructed fMRI volumes to support higher-level tasks, such as behavioral decoding, cognitive task analysis, or other downstream applications, remains unknown, making it difficult to demonstrate the practical utility of the generated fMRI signals.\n\n3. Unless I missed it, the paper does not clearly specify the training and test set details, making the data usage somewhat non-transparent. Since the authors mention that their preprocessing follows Lanzino et al., it would be important to clarify whether the same data-splitting strategy was adopted. In Lanzino et al., both fixed-split and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation were performed - which of these approaches (or any other) was used in this work?\n\n4. It is interesting to observe that during training, the model appears capable of preserving realistic EEG characteristics, such as spectral component distributions and EEG connectivity patterns. However, since the main objective of the paper is to reconstruct fMRI signals, there are no experiments or results demonstrating that the reconstructed fMRI preserves its own physiological priors or can accurately reproduce the corresponding fMRI connectivity matrix (so the last sentence in the abstract is a bit overstated).\n\n\n**Minor issues**\n1. The paper does not include ablation studies on key loss components (e.g., the alignment loss)\n2. Standard deviations are not reported.\n3. In the Dataset section, the paper states that the Oddball EEG dataset contains 43 channels, and the experimental setup section mentions 34 channels."}, "questions": {"value": "1. In Figure 5(b), why are only channels 3 and 7 shown? What do these channel indices correspond to in terms of channel names (like Fz, F1…), and how does the model perform on average across all channels?\n\n2. What does the x-axis in Figure 5(c) represent? Does it correspond to the temporal variation of the band-filtered topology maps?\nWhich dataset does Figure 5 correspond to? i.e., Is subject 46 from the NODDI dataset or the Oddball dataset?\n\n3. It is not entirely clear how the 4D fMRI volumes are projected into ROI-level representations in the F→E branch. Is this accomplished through anatomical parcellation based on registered structural scans + encoder, or directly via a learnable projection module within the network to project it to the ROI embedding space?\n    - If the former is the case, it contradicts the claimed applicability to scenarios where no MRI scan is available (e.g., when using EEG alone), since anatomical parcellation would be infeasible.\n    - Conversely, if the projection is learnable and produces ROI-level embeddings, it remains unclear how realistic ROI time series can be recovered from these embeddings or from the generated fMRI volumes. Given that fMRI data are considerably blurrier than T1-weighted anatomical scans, reliable ROI parcellation from such synthetic volumes would be highly challenging, as mentioned above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "MUVv7zaWmg", "forum": "s8SwD5a2VG", "replyto": "s8SwD5a2VG", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10230/Reviewer_Xr13"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10230/Reviewer_Xr13"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10230/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761967629125, "cdate": 1761967629125, "tmdate": 1762921589261, "mdate": 1762921589261, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
