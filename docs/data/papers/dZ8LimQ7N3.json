Bio-Foundation Models Are Not Yet Robust to Biological Plausible Perturbations and ML Transformations", "abstract": "Biological Foundation Models (Bio-FMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse biomedical domains, enabling advances in drug discovery, protein design, and molecular analysis. However, the robustness of Bio-FMs remains underexplored, particularly in terms of the unique risks and perturbations they may encounter in real-world deployment and how these challenges impact their utility. In this work, we characterize the robustness of Bio-FMs from both biology and machine learning (ML) perspectives, and we observe that Bio-FMs are not yet robust to biological data curation and ML transformations. Specifically, (i) from the biological data curation perspective, we design biologically plausible perturbations that mimic corruptions commonly observed in biological experiments, and assess their impact on Bio-FMs; (ii) from the ML perspective, we probe how data transformations, preprocessing, and embedding affect model performance. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art Bio-FMs on a spectrum of protein-related downstream tasks, spanning protein design, generation, function prediction, cryo-EM reconstruction, and structure classification, over structure, sequence, and image modalities. Our results reveal that most Bio-FMs are vulnerable to both ML transformations and biological perturbations; however, cryo-EM reconstruction models (e.g., CryoDRGN) exhibit a surprising robustness, which maintains stability even under worst-case adversarial scenarios. Notably, we also find that subtle biological perturbations, which are often imperceptible to current measurement tools, yet induce severe discrepancies in Bio-FM outputs, leading to critical failures. Our work highlights underappreciated vulnerabilities and provides a new perspective for evaluating and improving the trustworthiness of Bio-FMs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["bio-foundation models", "trustworthy foundation models", "robustness"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7e150e46b4b8ecea4261362a58671c0b51b43322.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates how sensitive Biological Foundation Models are to both ML and biological perturbations during inference time.

I believe that the paper is overall strong in its content, with one substantive difficulty. Namely, it exclusively evaluates BioFMs and does not compare to traditional baselines or linear models or standard tools. For example, the authors mention both in the abstract and in lines 206-207: \"Tiny biological perturbations [...] may be invisible to standard tools but can catastrophically alter Bio-FM outputs\". This claim, which I presume is true, is however not substantiated by evidence in the paper (as well, what are these standard tools exactly is not discussed). I believe that the work would be significantly strengthened to a clear Accept if it were possible, for each of the experiments and figures in question (or at least for a subset), to include how the performance of a standard tool or method would change in these benchmarks, under those perturbations. This would be a majorly helpful baseline and point of reference, as we (the community, readers, and the authors) would then have an improved understanding of under what perturbational conditions and at which points (i.e. at what level of perturbation severity) when BioFMs start to underperform compared to standard tools; e.g., for tasks such as function and property prediction. This would also substantiate the claim that the standard tools / non-FM methods are not in fact vulnerable to such perturbations. \n\n1. While not a weakness per-se, but an opportunity for strength (although arguably beyond the scope of a benchmarking paper) would of course be to leverage these insights to design an improvement to the bio FM regime (or perhaps a more simple finetuning methodology) that can attempt to address these issues of robustness.\n\n1. The other primary weakness is of secondary importance, and I believe could be addressed by the camera-ready deadline. This is the overall presentation and quality of the figures and layout, which could be substantially improved:\n   - Figure 1: is it not more standard to have the abstract above the first figure?\n   - Figure 1 and 2: why use comic-sans font for parts of these figures? It appears somewhat unprofessional. \n   - 197-198: the use of the plural \"questions\" is immediately followed by only one question, consider rephrasing.\n   - The section titles (3, 4, 5) are rather long, normative claims, and atypical. The rest of the paper includes claims and arguments, I am not sure if section titles should also repeat those (rather than simply being: \"Assessing Robustness\" / \"Robustness to ML transformations\" / \"Robustness to Biologically Plausible Transformations\"\n   - Lack of figure standardization in results. Some figures are PNGs and some are PDFs with highlightable text -- typically it is preferred to have all figures be PDFs with highlightable text. Furthermore, various figures have different fonts, font sizes, and coloring standards.\n   - The use of in-text Figures may not be standard formatting for ICLR, and it is overall confusing with Figure 8 being referenced before Figure 7 but both being on separate pages. I think figures should not be in-line and instead should be across the page as is done for Figures 3 and 4.\n   - Appendix section E repeats the same sentence 3 times (in the section title, in the 1 sentence paragraph, and in the figure caption)"}, "questions": {"value": "- The figures can be confusing -- why does Figure 6 have different y-axis labels for the different models under question?

When analyzing the machine learning transformation perturbations, the authors conduct the experiments by changing the parameters of the models.

Changing the parameters in the Bio-FMs is not a good perturbation method. This shows that the models' performance is sensitive to the parameters.
