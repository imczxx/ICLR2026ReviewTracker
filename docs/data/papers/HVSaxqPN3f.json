Such scenarios often arise in real-world such as economics and healthcare modeling.  Unlike existing approaches that predict one system at a time, ESE forecasts all systems in a single pass.  It first estimates the equilibrium state across systems, then generates holistic forecasts based on the difference between the current state and the estimated equilibrium.  Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including currency exchange and COVID-19 spread modeling, demonstrate that ESE is at least as accurate as state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while being significantly faster.  In addition, ESE integrates seamlessly with conventional predictors, combining their accuracy with its exceptional efficiency and delivering a 10–70× speedup. With linear-time complexity, ESE scales far better than SOTA methods as the number of systems increases. Moreover, it remains accurate under diverse perturbations, establishing ESE as a fast, generalizable, robust, and scalable multi-prediction method.

Each system is characterized by a set of attributes whose evolution over time serves as covariates in the prediction process. The objective is to predict a quantity of interest across multiple systems by leveraging the dynamics of these covariates.\n\nThe prediction task is decomposed into two components:\n1. Total quantity prediction – estimating the overall magnitude of the quantity of interest across all systems.\n2. Equilibrium ratio estimation – predicting the relative contribution (ratio) of each system to the total quantity.\n\nThe central idea is that while the total quantity may vary dynamically, the relative ratios between systems tend to exhibit greater stability and may evolve toward an equilibrium state. By separating the modeling of the total quantity and the equilibrium ratios, the method aims to achieve more stable and interpretable predictions.\n\nA key aspect of the approach is the use of cointegration to calibrate the equilibrium estimation. The algorithm begins with an initial prediction and iteratively updates or biases the estimates through a correction term L until cointegration is achieved in the predicted signals.\n\nAnother noteworthy feature of the method is its agnosticism to the specific model used for predicting the total quantity. While the paper describe as default a simple linear predictor for that component, the framework is flexible and can incorporate any time series prediction model, as shown in the experiments. \n\nThe authors evaluate their method on both synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including currency exchange rates and COVID-19 spread modeling, and analyze the computational complexity of the approach."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The primary strength of the paper is that the proposed method works effectively in practice. The results demonstrate good predictive performance, achieving both reduced computational cost and improved accuracy, which supports the soundness of the approach.\n\nAnother strong point is the use of real-world data in addition to synthetic experiments. This empirical grounding gives credibility to the method and shows that it can handle complex, practical scenarios.\n\nThe idea of incorporating equilibrium information into the prediction process is particularly interesting. In contexts such as currency exchange rates, equilibrium relationships are known to exist, and explicitly modeling them is conceptually appealing. While one might question whether such equilibria are stable only in the short term, the decision to include this additional information is well-motivated and insightful.\n\nOverall, the framework provides clear benefits: by leveraging equilibrium structure, the method delivers higher accuracy and shorter computation times. The underlying idea is both sound and potentially impactful, with evident relevance for applications where interacting systems evolve toward some form of equilibrium."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Presentation and Clarity\n\nThe most significant weakness of the paper is its presentation. The text is filled with typos and inconsistencies (e.g., line 179: “twp” instead of “two”). The notation used in Algorithm 1 is also problematic: line 166 defines the all-ones vector using np.ones, mixing a pseudo-algorithm written in mathematical notation with Python-specific syntax. This not only assumes familiarity with Python but also breaks the consistency of presentation. Such initialization should be expressed purely mathematically.\n\nThere is also significant notation confusion. The paper alternates between A, α, and lowercase a, sometimes apparently referring to the same quantity. In particular, α seems to appear without ever being introduced, leading to unnecessary ambiguity. Variables and concepts often appear before being properly defined. Key terms such as cointegration or even the predictor are introduced abruptly, with unclear formulations. For instance, the description of the predictor as using “log-maximum likelihood” and residuals is either somewhat vague; it would be clearer to describe it as a linear predictor, or define clearly each term in equation 7 and the training procedure.\n\nIn general, the mathematical writing and textual explanations are weak. Some sentences are simply ill-formed (e.g., line 212: “which would not work without them”), which undermines the paper’s readability. The result is that a first reading generates many unanswered questions and leaves the reader struggling to follow the logic.\n\n2. Structure and Conceptual Consistency\n\nBeyond language, the paper suffers from structural and conceptual inconsistencies. The first three pages, in particular, introduce several ideas, equilibrium state, utility function, deltas, that are poorly connected to the actual method presented later. Section 2 on equilibrium state feels like filler: it could be merged into the introduction without loss of substance. Many of the definitions provided are trivial observations, such as the fact that the ratios sum to 1, implying that their changes sum to 0. While potentially insightful if leveraged, these points are not exploited in the actual method, which ultimately reduces to linear regression.\n\nAs a result, there is a disconnect between the theoretical narrative and the implemented algorithm. The “equilibrium state” terminology seems overemphasized relative to what is mathematically demonstrated.\n\n3. Incorrect or Confusing Derivations\n\nThe proof in Appendix E seems wrong or underexplained, as it looks like a circular argument. Either the reasoning is incorrect, or it is poorly explained. In both cases, clarification is needed.\n\nAdditionally, the proof title includes the independence sign, which is poor formatting.\n\n4. Missing or Undefined Key Concepts\n\nCrucial concepts such as cointegration are introduced without definition or explanation. The equilibrium estimation process itself is described through an algorithm that updates L and converges when cointegration is achieved, but the mechanism and intuition behind this convergence remain obscure. There is no explanation of why such an iterative correction should work or what motivates its structure.\n\nOverall, the paper spends excessive time on an overextended introduction while neglecting to introduce and justify the most central concepts. The result is a confusing read that obscures what is otherwise a potentially interesting and well-motivated method.\n\n5. Mathematical and Notational Ambiguities\n\nMathematical definitions lack precision. For instance, the state s is never explicitly placed within a space (e.g., ℝⁿ or a manifold). Similarly, the upper and lower bounds U and L are introduced,should they not simply be denoted as min and max.\nThe notation with sometimes 4 indices ($\\alpha'_{1:n,k,t}$ line 197) is heavy and hard to parse. I would recommend using vector notation and denote time dependence in a functional way, i.e. $\\alpha_k(t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^n,\\ k\\in ${$1,..,m$} etc. \n\n\nOverall, manuscript is currently not fit for publication. Significant effort to improve the presentation and properly introduce the necessary concepts is needed. This poor presentation makes the evaluation of the method itself difficult. The current evaluation will mostly reflect the quality of the presentation rather than the work in itslef. I am willing to revise my rating if the writing improves significantly."}, "questions": {"value": "It is unclear whether this work is the first to leverage this decomposition between total quantity and contribution between the different ratios. Are there other methods that use similar assumption? In such case benchmarking should also compare with this other methods that also incorporate equilibrium-like assumptions.\n\nWhy was this specific formulation chosen for the state estimation? There are some elements of linear regression, as well as the iterative refinement of the correction L. As you mention later, any method can be used as predictor, why wouldn't it be the same for the equilibrium state estimation? For instance an LSTM with a softmax on the last layer? \n\nWhat is the use of introducing utility functions and overall section 2, that could not be done by the introduction? \n\nIn computational complexity, you assert linear complexity, which is achieved because you limit the while loop to E iterations. Potentially, the E necessary to achieve good results could scale poorly with dimension, especially in difficult instances. Do you have guaranties, results, empirical evidence, that this is not the case? \n\nWhile the idea of an equilibrium for currency exchange is straightforward, what is your justification for COVID data? In general, do you have a framework for when your method would work, beyond the idea of interracting systems. You mention that definitions 1,2,3 must be satisfied, however as I mentioned it hard to connect these to the ESE framework mathematically, beyond general motivation."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "PfmR8Vi2yf", "forum": "HVSaxqPN3f", "replyto": "HVSaxqPN3f", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11874/Reviewer_kPHS"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11874/Reviewer_kPHS"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11874/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761242311206, "cdate": 1761242311206, "tmdate": 1762922892694, "mdate": 1762922892694, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes **Equilibrium State Estimation (ESE)** for simultaneous forecasting across many interacting systems (e.g., currencies or regions).

However, the attributes are also the primary drivers of the system's evolution. There is a risk of a circular argument where the model is effective simply\n\nbecause it's using the attributes to create a target (the equilibrium) and then predicting towards it.

The constraints (Definitions 1-3) are quite strict: all systems must have the same attribute set, and the sum of proportions must be 1. This limits the applicability of ESE.
