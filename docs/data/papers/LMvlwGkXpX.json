Recent data, for example, shows that neurons in mouse visual cortex go into a \"low power mode\" in which they maintain firing rate homeostasis while expending less energy. This adaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in response to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding framework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple constraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our contribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework that generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our simulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on the assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the least-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each state along this optimal path is associated with properties (resting potential and leak conductance) which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments and have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation. We analytically derive the optimal coding strategy for neurons under varying energy budgets and coding goals, and show how our method uniquely captures how populations of tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis, as has been observed empirically.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Efficient neural codes", "neural computation", "metabolism"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9551503a3df15788f9ded4a9de627b8c29d2dc0a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6f5960d48ffb0d07079fbe50a66b4cad06c13494.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce a new method for modelling the interaction of metabolic stress and tuning curves.

This is the main difference between previous models and the proposed one, leading to alpha = 1 (which has also been used in Ganguli & Simoncelli, 2010), and a functional relationship for eta.\n4.

Some of the used variables have to be explained better, as it is not evident what they are or how they are determined (see questions)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. As far as I can see, the main novelties are: 1) The activity and energy-dependent dispersion, 2) The generalised energy constraint, although in the derived model, alpha = 1 is used which aligns with previous models. 3) The fit to simulated results (with energy estimates tying neural activity to ATP needs) to  obtain alpha and eta. Is that correct?\n2. Eq. (1) is for Poisson neurons? A citation would be helpful.\n3. What exactly is kappa? How is it related to R(s), R_n, R, etc.? Also, how is R(s) determined?\n4. Eq. (7): E is stated to be energy. However, since this expression is valid for any alpha >= 1, this is weird unit-wise (and in fact, for alpha = 1, the authors identify E as the mean rate R). \n5. The final model is more complex than the two comparison models (Ganguli & Simoncelli; Wang et al.), and parameters are actually fit - not on experimental data, but using simulations. So it seems like increased expressivity is paid for by an increase in complexity. Could you comment on how well you expect this to generalise to other experimental setups? In particular, does your model predict any other effects?\n6. If I understand correctly, eta_k is obtained for different combinations of v_rest and g_leak. For activity kappa and a given energy level, you then determine the values of (v_rest, g_leak) that minimise eta_k (which is later used to fit a function for eta_k)?

Cortex, including the visual cortex of the mouse, consists of highly recurrently connected networks of Excitatory and inhibitory neurons that have strong influence on each-other's activity (see for example Chettih and Harvey, Nature 2019). I am not convinced that the assumption of independent neurons can bring crucial insights about the neural code in the cortex, including the study of tuning curves. Can authors comment why do they think that a model with independent neurons is relevant?\n\n2) There is a lack of citations on several occasions. \nExamples:\n[line 50 ] Authors mention \"Simple models of energy constrains\" but not cite any so it remains unclear which models they are referring to. \n[line 54] ...\"previous population coding models capture either the shortening or the widening of energy-limited tuning curves, but not both\". Which previous models show this and why are they not cited at this point? \n\n3) Authors situate the current work among the existing literature in a way that seems rather problematic. In line [122] authors comment on the importance of the activity of the sodium/potassium pump for the metabolic expenditure of neurons. The activity of the sodium/potassium pump seems to be a direct consequences of spiking activity, and the maintenance of the reversal potential also depends on neuron's firing rate. It can be argued that models that formulate the metabolic cost that is dependent on the firing rate or the number of fired spikes nevertheless capture, even though indirectly, sources of metabolic expenditure that are biologically highly relevant. Such efficient models simply do not model the situation of important metabolic stress, but instead use the metabolic cost as a means to regulate the activity levels in the network and constrain the solution appropriately (in a general situation without energy deprivation). While a state of energy deprivation seems an important constraint from the  evolutionary perspective, I am not convinced that neural coding would only adapt to this particular constraint.\n\nRecent research (Gutierrez and Deneve, eLife 2019, Koren et al., eLife 2025) has discussed the role of metabolic efficiency in optimal spiking networks. Both studies use a metabolic constraint that is formulated as a cost on the number of spikes fired. The first study (Gutierrez et al.) found a formulation of efficiency that gives rise to a transient adaptation in single neurons on a time scale of seconds. The second study (Koren et al.) found that a number of biophysical parameters in primary cortex can be captured when the metabolic efficiency is taken into account, and that metabolic efficiency was shown to have an important effect on optimal coding solutions. Can authors comment on their results in light of these two studies and also touch on the difference in the use of the metabolic efficiency in their model compared to the one in papers mentioned above? \n\n4) The paper is difficult to read and could use a rewrite with focus on clarity. I believe bringing in some more simplicity when possible would make the paper much more appealing. In particular, the first paragraph of discussion gives a good intuitive motivation for the model and I suggest to move this part earlier in the paper, possibly to the introduction."}, "questions": {"value": "1) What kind of neuron model is used in simulations?
