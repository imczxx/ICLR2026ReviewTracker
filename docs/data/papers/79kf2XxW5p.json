While explainability methods exist for supervised machine learning, they are not directly applicable to clustering, making it challenging to understand cluster assignments. This interpretability gap is evident in the popular density-based method DBSCAN, which assigns points as inliers (cluster members in dense regions) or outliers (noise points in sparse regions). DBSCAN does not provide insight into why a particular point receives its assignment or if it is robust to small changes in the data. To address the challenges, we introduce ExDBSCAN, a density-aware, post-hoc explanation method. ExDBSCAN offers actionable counterfactual explanations, with theoretical guarantees for validity. It generates multiple counterfactuals using a density-connected weighted graph while adopting a physics-inspired model that repels counterfactual candidates from one another (diversity) while pulling them toward the instance to explain (proximity). Empirical evaluation on 30 tabular datasets, confirms that ExDBSCAN attains perfect validity and shows that it retrieves diverse, proximal counterfactuals.", "tldr": "We propose a novel method for obtaining counterfactual explanations for DBSCAN clustering, ensuring proximity, validity, diversity and actionability.", "keywords": ["Explainability", "Density-Based Clustering", "Interpretability", "Unsupervised Learning", "Counterfactual Explanations"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/df4954bdee7693c508480ab1002353e68fb46b5f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces ExDBSCAN, a method for generating counterfactual explanations tailored to the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.

The contribution is narrowly focused on one specific clustering algorithm (DBSCAN), which limits its broader impact compared to more generalizable explainability frameworks.\n\nThe novelty primarily lies in combining these physics-inspired forces with the density-connected weighted graph representation. While this combination is tailored to DBSCAN, the individual components (repulsion for diversity, attraction for proximity, graph-based distances) are not novel. Graph representation is domain-appropriate but not novel: Using shortest-path distances in weighted graphs to measure similarity is standard in graph-based algorithms. The contribution here is recognizing that DBSCAN's density-connectivity should be modeled this way which is insightful but somewhat obvious given DBSCAN's definition. \n\nGuaranteed by construction, not theory: Theorem 3.1 states that counterfactuals are valid because they're placed within ε-neighborhoods of target core points. This is essentially guaranteed by the algorithm's design (Equation 4) rather than being a non-trivial theoretical result. The \"proof sketch\" simply restates the assignment definition.\nCircular reasoning: The paper defines the assignment function (Section 3.1) specifically to make this guarantee possible, then claims the guarantee as a contribution. This is somewhat circular—the validity is built into the definition rather than being a surprising theoretical property. \nNP-hardness result (Proposition 2) is expected: Showing that the energy minimization is NP-hard connects to known results about maximum diversity problems. While formally establishing this is useful, it's an expected rather than surprising result, and the proof essentially reduces to known MDP hardness.\nProposition 1 is trivial: The observation that minimizing spring energy alone selects k-nearest neighbors is straightforward and requires minimal proof."}, "questions": {"value": "Does the method's complete specificity to DBSCAN limit its scientific contribution?

You mention this approach in Section 2 but dismiss it without empirical evaluation. Wouldn't this be the most obvious baseline?\n\nYou prove NP-hardness then use a greedy approximation. How much better is this than simply selecting k diverse points from the nearest neighbors? Have you ablated against simpler baselines like: (a) k-nearest core points, (b) farthest-first traversal on the graph, (c) random sampling from nearby core points?\n\nYou state \"fixing the clustering\" and defining assignment via ε-neighborhoods ensures validity, then claim guaranteed validity as a contribution.
