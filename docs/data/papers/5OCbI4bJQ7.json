Non-standard function specification in the system prompt:**\n\nLooking at the submitted data, I found that the system prompt contains the function definition (see example below) instead of a separate tools key.  This prevents the tokenizer from applying the appropriate chat template, which in turn negatively affects the model's performance. I suspect that due to this formatting, some of the models have lower-than-expected performance numbers, thus making the evaluation numbers unreliable in my opinion.\n\nAdditionally, the function specification is not standard, such as the use of key `api_name, api_description, api_parameters` instead of `name, description, and parameters`. It would be beneficial if the authors could clarify both of these points, and why these formatting decisions were made.\n\n```\nYou are an advanced AI assistant with expertise in:\n1.

Calling it “proprietary/inaccessible” is misleading and internally inconsistent with the prior praise.\n   \n    - The “US-centric” generalization + Yahoo-Weather example doesn’t follow. The authors argue “most existing benchmarks are US-centric,” then support it with an API coverage example (Yahoo-Weather not giving district-level data in Shenzhen). That’s a mismatch: API geographic coverage ≠ benchmark design bias. Also, Yahoo Weather is a weak example here (coverage varies and the API itself is not a common tool-use benchmark).\n\n    - Taxonomy inconsistency. The authors say API-BLEND/APIGen/ToolACE “focus on API-based function calling across a variety of use cases,” then say Gorilla/ToolLLM “address real-world tool invocation.” In practice, all of those target real-world API/tool use to some degree; the presented dichotomy isn’t coherent. If the authors intend “closed-loop execution with real endpoints” vs. “static function-calling,” that distinction needs to be made explicit.\n\n    - The authors broadly claim accessibility is hindered because datasets “are not publicly available.” Some well-known tool-use resources are public or partially public (even if keys/quotas are needed). The statement needs narrowing and concrete examples.\n\n- Related Works Section:\n\n    - Inconsistent definitions for “# Tools” and “# Tasks” in Table 1, different works count very different things (API endpoints vs. functions vs. skills vs. trajectories vs. conversations). Numbers like “ToolBench 16,464” and “StableToolBench 16,464” almost certainly refer to instances/trajectories, not distinct tools. Without a unified definition, the column is misleading.\n\n    - In Table 1, at least some items marked × are publicly released (often with keys/quotas). “Publicly available” must be defined (open data files? code + scripts to re-generate? requires API keys?). Paid-key access ≠ “not accessible.”\n\n    - In Table 1, “Primary language = English” is overstated for several rows (many include Chinese/multilingual content). Conversely, the authors' own row uses “Multi-languages” (grammatically odd and inconsistent). Provide explicit language codes (e.g., en/zh-CN) and percentages.\n\n    - In Table 1, there’s no citation or footnote tying each number to a release/version. For volatile corpora, this is essential (and prevents accusations of cherry-picking).\n\n- DATASET CURATION Section:\n\n    - Figure ↔ text stage mismatch. The flowchart labels/query steps don’t match the narrative stages (e.g., Stage 1 says API collection, but the figure’s top-left block is “Query Generation” and there is no explicit “GPT-4o doc supplementation” box).\n\n    - “Minimal human intervention” vs “Checker.” The figure includes a “Checker,” while the text claims minimal human involvement. If the checker is human, say so and quantify; if it’s an LLM, call it that.\n\n    - Evaluation leakage risk. GPT-4o (and Claude/Gemini) are used to author API instructions, refine queries, and generate QA pairs, and later are used for testing. That creates obvious information leakage / contamination and undermines fairness unless strict model isolation is enforced.\n\n    - “Real API” claim vs. LLM-rewritten specs. The authors say the corpus contains real APIs but also that GPT-4o “completes/refines incomplete specs.” That means parts of the specification are synthetic; it weakens the “real-world spec” claim unless these portions are marked and excluded from evaluation.\n\n    - Unclear feasibility of large-scale execution. Testing ~49,937 APIs with scripted calls (3–5 calls each × two stages, over 48 hours) is logistically dubious—most endpoints require authentication/keys, quotas, captchas, or payments. The text does not explain how keys were provisioned or how auth-gated APIs were handled (biasing toward no-auth endpoints).\n\n    - “Update frequency (inactive >12 months)” is poorly defined. Many stable APIs don’t publish update timestamps; marketplaces’ “last updated” fields are not standardized. It’s unclear how the authors measured this and whether it’s a valid quality criterion for endpoint usability.\n\n    - Stability inference from 3–5 calls/48h is weak. That sampling can’t establish reliability; it also can’t capture diurnal/weekly variability or rare failure modes. Calling this “stability” is overclaiming.\n\n    - Source list is shaky/ambiguous. Names like “Free-api,” “Public-apis,” “XiaRou,” etc., are not standard identifiers; some are lists, not providers. The authors need precise, citable sources and versions. Otherwise the “49,937 APIs” figure lacks provenance and is likely inflated or double-counted.\n\n    - Executability vs. documentation quality conflation. The authors verify “correctness through sample executions” yet also rely on LLM-completed specs; a spec can be “consistent” but wrong while the sample call coincidentally works. The authors need stronger validation.\n\n    - Claim of “enhanced usability for developers.” If specs are partly LLM-generated, that claim is unsupported unless the authors ran human-dev usability studies.\n\n    - Unclear separation between training data and eval. The authors say the pipeline “generates high-quality QA pairs” (used later for testing). If the same LLM family authored both instructions and QA, eval becomes self-generated rather than independent ground truth.\n\n    - Coverage thinness / unclear multilinguality. “Three user queries per API (or set)” is unlikely to cover API functionality or edge cases, and “multilingual repository” is not defined (which languages? how ensured per-API support?).\n\n    - Overclaims about human review. “Exhaustive human review” of 18,368 queries with five annotators (each query double-checked on five criteria) is a very large workload, yet no inter-annotator agreement (κ/α), time per item, or quality control is reported. That weakens the reliability claim.\n\n    - Arbitrary thresholds w/o justification. Keeping only items “scoring >4 from both models” (1–5 scale) is an extremely aggressive precision-oriented cut that likely destroys recall and language diversity; no analysis shows why this is appropriate.\n\n    - Human–LLM role ambiguity. “Checker” is used again in section 3.4 but not defined (human or LLM?). You also say “low-complexity issues were corrected directly by humans,” but the bulk acceptance rate (only 6.9% modified) after heavy LLM involvement suggests circular validation rather than independent adjudication.\n\n- Experiments Section:\n\n    - Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o were used during dataset construction and again during testing, which may introduce information leakage and unfair comparisons, thereby biasing the experimental conclusions (as I mentioned above).\n\n    - Judging from Figure 7, the paper’s touted multilingual support is extremely imbalanced—many regions have only single-digit tools—so it would be more practical to just add a translation layer."}, "questions": {"value": "The specific issues are listed in the Weaknesses section. Overall, the paper reads as mediocre: many design choices in dataset construction lack experimental validation. The multilingual motivation appears overstated; based on the data distribution, performance in many languages may be worse than simply adding a translation layer, which would also cover more APIs across languages. Moreover, there are signs of information leakage between training and testing, making the results unreliable.
