Neuromorphic hardware can realize this efficiency by exploiting high temporal resolution, as precise spike timing supports compact and sparse information processing. Yet, training SNNs under fine temporal discretization remains a major challenge. In state-of-the-art approaches, spiking neurons are modeled as self-recurrent units, embedded into recurrent networks to maintain state, and trained with BPTT or RTRL variants based on surrogate gradients. We show that these methods scale poorly with temporal resolution, while online approximations methods are inherently unstable. We solve this problem by developing recursive memory structures combined with a linear–nonlinear interpretation of spike-train generation in spiking neurons: the SpikingGamma model. We show that SpikingGamma models support direct error backpropagation without surrogate gradients, can learn fine temporal patterns with minimal spiking in an online manner, and scale feedforward SNNs to complex tasks with competitive accuracy, all while being insensitive to the temporal precision of the model. Our approach offers both an alternative to current recurrent SNNs trained with surrogate gradients, and a direct route for mapping SNNs to neuromorphic hardware.", "tldr": "The SpikingGamma model enables exact online training of feedforward SNNs that can capture precise temporal patterns and achieve competitive accuracy on complex tasks while being insensitive to the temporal precision of the simulation.", "keywords": ["spiking neural network", "online learning", "delay learning", "energy-efficiency", "feedforward"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9d784d69cbbb10c18a183d5507e56f469141fcb1.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/73b7982ad7ed36830cbd2c5ca213ed3a93019456.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces SpikingGamma, a temporal-coding training framework for SNNs using adaptive recursive memory and sigma-delta spike generation.

The method computes a gradient at each timestep $t$ based on a loss $L(t)$ available at that same step. This is effective for the chosen benchmarks, which allow for dense or accumulated loss signals.\n\nHowever, it is unclear how this framework applies to tasks with sparse, delayed rewards or a single classification label available only at the end of a long sequence (e.g., $T=3000$). These scenarios are a primary motivation for using SNNs.\n\n If the loss is only available at the final timestep $T$, does the model need to store the intermediate \"bucket\" states ($\\hat{y}_i^k$) from all preceding timesteps to compute the gradients?\n\n If so, this would seem to negate the \"constant memory\" advantage, as it would reintroduce a memory cost that scales linearly with sequence length, similar to BPTT.\n\n Alternatively, if gradients are computed at each step, accumulated, and applied at the end, how does this fit the definition of \"online\" learning?
