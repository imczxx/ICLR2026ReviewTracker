Prior research has predominantly focused on the vanilla SGD, where the server or an eavesdropper can directly observe true gradients. In practical deployments, however, models may be trained with adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, and AdaGrad), for which the observable signal is not raw gradients but momentum-based parameter updates. This setting remains underexplored and undermines traditional gradient-matching strategies, which struggle to recover labels and images from non-gradient updates. To address this gap, this paper explores attacks tailored to modern adaptive optimizers. We present an analytical rule for recovering labels from optimizer updates and propose an update-matching objective that optimizes dummy inputs to reproduce the observed updates. The proposed approach is general and can be directly applied to various optimizers such as Adam, AdaGrad, and RMSProp. Furthermore, we find that, despite being introduced for adaptive optimizers, the proposed objective function also yields stronger attacks in the standard SGD setting. Experiments on datasets such as ImageNet and PACS highlight the effectiveness of our method over existing gradient matching techniques.", "tldr": "This paper presents new gradient inversion attacks tailored to optimizers beyond SGD.", "keywords": ["Gradient Inversion Attack", "Federated Learning", "Privacy Leakage", "Adaptive Optimizer"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fd7a543e4722070b8963885311dca55b448a31dd.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates an interesting problem in federated learning, where the authors propose the first attack approach towards FL systems with various optimizers, such as Adam.

The attack's success is predicated on a very specific and powerful threat model that may not always hold in practice. The attack requires the attacker to know the exact initial state (e.g., $m_{t-1}$, $v_{t-1}$) of the client's optimizer at the start of the local training round. While the paper justifies this by citing FL algorithms that synchronize this state, many practical and privacy-preserving implementations do not. If a client uses a locally maintained, non-reset state unknown to the server, the entire analytical label recovery method, which is the cornerstone of the attack, would fail.\n2. The attack is demonstrated on a single local update step. In real FL, clients typically perform multiple local steps before sending an update. It is unclear how the attack would perform when the observed update is an aggregate of multiple optimization steps, which would significantly obfuscate the relationship between the final update and the data from the first step.\n3. All main experiments are conducted on ResNet-18. It is unclear how the attack would fare against architectures without a traditional fully-connected final layer (e.g., Transformers using a linear projection, or models with heavy use of GroupNorm) where the derived gradient constraints may not hold.\n4. The attack is exclusively validated on image data. A discussion on the potential applicability to other modalities like text (where labels might be sequences) or tabular data is absent."}, "questions": {"value": "1. How would your attack perform in a more challenging and realistic scenario where the local optimizer state is not reset and synchronized by the server at the beginning of each round, but is instead maintained privately by the client? Would the attack still be feasible without precise knowledge of $m_{t-1}$ and $v_{t-1}$?\n2. The attack is demonstrated for a single local training step. What is the expected degradation in reconstruction quality if a client performs K>1 local steps, and the server only observes the aggregated parameter update? Could your method be extended to this more common FL setting?\n3. The label recovery method in the \"post-initial\" phase relies on the observation that ambiguous gradient elements cluster in specific rows. Can you provide a theoretical intuition or more rigorous empirical analysis for why this clustering occurs? Is this a general phenomenon or something dependent on the specific dataset and model?\n4. The \"initial phase\" label recovery critically depends on Approximation 1 (Inter-class Low Entanglement). Can you quantify the sensitivity of your attack to the validity of this approximation? How does the reconstruction quality degrade as the model moves away from this \"initial\" state and the approximation becomes less valid?\n5. You mention secure aggregation as a defense, but do not show results. Have you tested your attack in a setting where updates from even a small number of clients (e.g., 2-10) are aggregated? Furthermore, how does your method perform against other standard defenses like the addition of differential privacy noise or aggressive gradient compression?\n6. Your gradient constraints are derived for a standard fully-connected final layer. Can your label recovery method be directly applied to models with a different final layer structure, such as a Vision Transformer (ViT) which uses a single linear layer on the [CLS] token?

The paper's overall contribution is trivial, as the image optimization objective (Eq. 3) is an incremental change, substituting gradients with optimizer updates in an established cosine similarity loss similar to IG (Geiping et al., 2020). Moreover, the analytical label recovery relies on existing techniques, drawing foundational principles from GIAs (Eq. 6) and assumptions (Approximation 1 and Assumption 1) previously proposed in iLRG (Ma et al., 2023) and GradientInv (Yin et al., 2021), respectively. Consequently, the main technical novelty is confined to the specific derivation that infers the final-layer gradient information exclusively from the Adam-like optimizer's update parameters.\n\n2. The paper overstates its first challenge (Objective Function) since the optimizer update $\\mathcal{U}(\\nabla\\theta, s)$ shares the same dimensionality as the raw gradient $\\nabla\\theta$ and model parameters $\\theta$. Although it is not the exact gradient $\\nabla\\theta$, $\\mathcal{U}(\\nabla\\theta, s)$ differs only by a further step of computation. Hence, it is very straightforward for gradient matching.\n\n3. The attack is significantly constrained as its high efficacy is primarily limited to the initial training phase, with performance severely degrading thereafter.

If clients perform multiple local training updates before sending the final aggregation, how does this process of local averaging affect the overall effectiveness of the proposed attack?\n\n4.
