Guided by the information bottleneck principle, our method introduces a differentiable loss that minimizes mutual information with the known I-frames, enabling joint optimization of compression and generation within a unified framework. This design allows the generative model to faithfully reconstruct intermediate frames at extreme compression rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms both traditional codecs and recent deep learning–based schemes across standard rate–distortion metrics. Moreover, the reconstructed videos deliver comparable performance to state-of-the-art semantic communication methods across multiple downstream tasks, demonstrating the strong potential of generative compression as a practical alternative to conventional coding.", "tldr": "We propose Flow-IB, a generative video compression framework that compresses videos 32,768× by combining information bottleneck and flow matching, outperforming existing codecs.", "keywords": ["Video Compression", "Diffusion Transformer"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e5f7dcef7474073702cc1a6055ecac5f41fcf6ad.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c5a4210bf013e655ea45a40089d90d44d6008c33.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes FLOW-IB, a generative video compression framework that transmits only the first and last frames and reconstructs intermediate frames with a flow-matching video diffusion model guided by a conditional information bottleneck objective.

No full rate–distortion characterization; bpp is approximate. The paper evaluates at (or near) a single bitrate and does not provide RD curves. The reported bitrate is compiled from components and described as “approximately 0.01 bpp,” with Multi-C evaluated at 0.0067 bpp, which complicates a clean, controlled comparison across varying rates. A thorough RD study (multiple operating points with precise bit accounting, including I-frames and side information) is essential for compression claims at this level.\n\n2. Overstated language. The manuscript repeatedly uses terms like “unprecedented” (e.g., “unprecedented 32,768× compression ratio” in the abstract). Such superlatives should be minimized in a technical paper; the results should stand on measured evidence and comprehensive comparisons (including RD curves).\n\n3. Relation to relay/latent-conditioned diffusion is under-analyzed. The paper’s “reformulated flow matching” replaces noise-to-data sampling with a latent-to-data trajectory from 𝑧 (compressed code) to 𝑥. While empirically effective, the work does not provide a rigorous theoretical treatment of equivalence or conditions under which latent-initialized sampling matches (or upper-bounds) noise-initialized diffusion. Prior work such as RDEIC: Accelerating Diffusion-Based Extreme Image Compression with Relay Residual Diffusion (TCSVT’25) explicitly analyzes and motivates relay/latent decoding and discusses its theoretical grounding. Here, beyond the observation that the pathwise objective reduces to an MSE between 𝑧 and 𝑥, the manuscript lacks formal results connecting the proposed objective to maximum-likelihood training of the generative model and to the behavior of standard diffusion samplers. A deeper theoretical comparison (e.g., equivalence, bounds, convergence behavior) to relay diffusion (RDEIC) would strengthen novelty and clarity.\n\n4. Presentation issues. There are several minor but distracting writing/formatting problems (e.g., equation numbering continuity around Eq. (8), typos/notation consistency). For instance, the reparameterization form for 𝑧 is labeled as Eq. (8), but numbering and transitions around this section are untidy, suggesting the need for careful proofreading."}, "questions": {"value": "see the weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "8PPtabQAdO", "forum": "iDdyA8nxgO", "replyto": "iDdyA8nxgO", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2885/Reviewer_yjx3"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2885/Reviewer_yjx3"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2885/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761814606677, "cdate": 1761814606677, "tmdate": 1762916430515, "mdate": 1762916430515, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}, "comment": {"value": "We appreciate the reviewers’ efforts and constructive comments, and we would like to withdraw the submission."}}, "id": "WwR7jQGjiq", "forum": "iDdyA8nxgO", "replyto": "iDdyA8nxgO", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2885/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2885/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763020739805, "cdate": 1763020739805, "tmdate": 1763020739805, "mdate": 1763020739805, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes FLOW-IB a generative video compression framework that achieves an extreme claimed ratio of compression (x32,768) by transmitting only the first and last frames plus a tiny latent, and reconstruct all intermediate frames with a flow-matching video generator.

The idea of masking out/generating all frames but the first and last ones is more of a design choice in my opinion, and the adoption of flow matching for video compression has also been proposed in [4]. So I am not fully agreeing with the statement \"first end-to-end video compression framework that integrates generative models with information bottleneck principles\".\n- **Issue with framework.** The claim of \"unprecedented compression ratio of x32,768\" is a bit of a overselling because this should not be applicable in real-world applications, simply due to the almost definitely unavoidable loss of distortion/fidelity, drifting, or forgetting caused by only having two references for conditioning. That is, I am challenging the setup and advocating more of a hierarchical bidirectional coding structure or at least more I-/P-frames interleaved in between. \n- **Unfair comparison.** First I think the authors should report BD-rate and provide for RD curve comparisons over a wide enough bitrate range, which is more standard in video compression literatures. Further, the comparison against H.265 or DCVC families, which are distortion-oriented, also does not reflect the competence of the proposed model at all due to the totally different focus in reconstruction quality measures. Though I understand that there are much fewer generative video codecs available for comparison, the authors should 1) still report PSNR/MS-SSIM or some other metrics like VMAF which is has a better balance over human perception and content fidelity, and 2) perform more detailed ablations to better demonstrate the superiority of the proposed novelties. \n- **Decoding speed.** Decoding speed is particularly important for modern neural video codecs due to how slow they tend to be. Despite the considerable reduction in sampling steps, the base generative model (Wan) should be fairly large and slow, especially on consumer / mobile NPUs/GPUs. The comparison against the baselines would not be fair if the difference in model size is too large, and the decoding speed (on which computing platforms) should also be reported for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\nOverall, I think the paper is of good quality, well-written, and in general heading towards a right direction of being more perceptual-oriented. However, I do challenge its novelty, and I do not agree with its very aggressive masking strategy, which, might be okey for generative/machine vision tasks, but would most certainly fail in terms of reference-based fidelity checks. Further, there are issues with how the experimental results are presented and compared against benchmark codecs. However, I am will to raise my score based on the authors feedbacks and other reviewers' opinions.\n\n[1] Video Compression With Rate-Distortion Autoencoders, ICCV'19\n\n[2] Variational Lossy Autoencoder, ICLR'17\n\n[3] Deep Generative Video Compression, NeurIPS'19\n\n[4] GIViC: Generative Implicit Video Compression, ICCV'25"}, "questions": {"value": "Refer to **Weaknesses**."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "JVwmqEWpk4", "forum": "iDdyA8nxgO", "replyto": "iDdyA8nxgO", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2885/Reviewer_aqyT"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2885/Reviewer_aqyT"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2885/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761828252965, "cdate": 1761828252965, "tmdate": 1762916430367, "mdate": 1762916430367, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work proposes a generative video compression framework that uses the first and last frames as conditions for the reconstruction process.

It is not a prior that the decoder has access to, and so not a prior you could leverage for compressing/reconstructing a sample from q(z|x).
