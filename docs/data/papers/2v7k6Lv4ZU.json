The core idea of modeling GDA as a continuous, time-driven generative process is novel and compelling. It directly addresses a clear limitation of existing data-oriented methods, which often assume a discrete or linear transformation between domains. The argument that real-world graph evolution is continuous and nonlinear provides strong motivation for this diffusion-based approach.\n\n2. The method is thoroughly evaluated against a wide array of recent GDA baselines (both model-oriented and data-oriented) across 8 datasets and 14 transfer tasks. The results in Tables 1 and 4 show that DiffGDA achieves state-of-the-art performance, often by a significant margin.\n\n3. The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for its proposed guidance mechanism. Theorem 1 connects the optimal reverse SDE for the target domain to the source domain's score function plus a guidance term based on the density ratio $q(G_0^{\\mathcal{T}})/p(G_0^{\\mathcal{S}})$. This provides a principled basis for the guidance network's objective."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The primary concern is the practical efficiency and scalability of the proposed method. The framework involves training multiple components: a score network $\\mathbb{P}(l)$, a guidance network $\\mathbb{Q}(\\delta)$ (which itself relies on a pre-trained domain classifier $\\mathcal{C}_{gnn}$ for density ratio estimation), and a final GNN classifier. This represents a significant increase in complexity over simpler GDA methods. The \"Discussion on Computational Cost\" remark and the complexity analysis $\\mathcal{O}(T\\cdot n^{2} + L\\cdot(|\\mathcal{V}^{\\mathcal{S}}|+|\\mathcal{E}^{S}|))$ reveal a quadratic dependency on the number of sampled nodes $n$. This scalability issue is confirmed in the hyperparameter analysis for $\\alpha$ (Figure 3), where the authors report running \"out-of-memory\" on tasks $D\\rightarrow A$ and $D\\rightarrow C$ for sampling ratios above 50%. This practical limitation seems to contradict the claim that the method is efficient and suitable for \"modest computational resources.\"\n\n2. The implementation of the guidance network depends on estimating the density ratio $q/p$ by training a GNN classifier $\\mathcal{C}_{gnn}$ and using the approximation $(1-y)/y$. The stability and accuracy of this estimation, especially in the high-dimensional, sparse space of graphs, is a potential weak point that is not fully explored. The paper could be more explicit about the generation process. It appears the model generates a \"labeled graph\" $G'=(X', A', Y')$ by diffusing and reversing the concatenated input $\\tilde{X}^{\\mathcal{S}}=[X^{\\mathcal{S}}||Y^{\\mathcal{S}}]$. This is a key detail and implies that the model is learning to generate node labels as part of the diffusion process, which is an interesting but non-trivial aspect of the design."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "1FmQgvhkZQ", "forum": "2v7k6Lv4ZU", "replyto": "2v7k6Lv4ZU", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11948/Reviewer_eQUv"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11948/Reviewer_eQUv"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11948/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761952159537, "cdate": 1761952159537, "tmdate": 1762922950728, "mdate": 1762922950728, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies the problem of graph domain adaptation, where a model trained on a labeled source graph is expected to perform well on an unlabeled target graph with different structures and semantics.

Applying the diffusion model (Diff) to the Graph scene is interesting,the author did not discuss in depth the advancement and challenges of symmetric diffusion processes, as well as the key differences with the advanced methods of Diff applied in Graph scenarios; at the same time, the difference between the diffusion model in the image/video generation field and GDA has not been deeply discussed, which makes me doubt the innovation and contribution of this paper.\n2. Lack of cross-domain (inter-domain) experiments: Current experiments focus on intra-domain transfers (e.g., citation → citation, airport → airport), where the data distribution has a similar pattern. Cross-domain transfer (e.g., citation → airport, social → citation) is more challenging and better reflects generalization, but it was not included, limiting the validation of the method's robustness to large distribution changes.\n3. Incomplete hyperparameter analysis of diffusion steps: The number of diffusion steps is a very important parameter. In image generation, the number of diffusion steps often exceeds 3,000, but the paper only tested up to 100 steps (is the node representation in the graph less difficult to learn than the pixel representation in the image?).\n4. The results do not clearly indicate whether the model has converged, and the impact of larger diffusion step sizes (e.g., 500, 1000) on performance and efficiency has not been explored. (If the author's GPU supports it)\n5. The necessity of using MLP is not explored: in image diffusion, UNet has been shown to effectively capture spatial dependence. The paper uses MLP for scoring and guiding networks, but does not discuss why MLP is superior or necessary for graph data, nor does it compare it to graph-specific architectures such as GNN-based scoring networks."}, "questions": {"value": "I hope the author can provide in-depth responses to the weaknesses and questions raised."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "h3otdzoNzP", "forum": "2v7k6Lv4ZU", "replyto": "2v7k6Lv4ZU", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11948/Reviewer_h5bX"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11948/Reviewer_h5bX"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11948/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762000988043, "cdate": 1762000988043, "tmdate": 1762922949635, "mdate": 1762922949635, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"title": {"value": "Overall Response to Reviewers"}, "comment": {"value": "Firstly, sincerely thank all the reviewers for their efforts in reviewing our paper and providing constructive suggestions.
