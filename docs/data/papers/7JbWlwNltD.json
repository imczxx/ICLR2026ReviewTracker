However, existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches often fall short in domains that demand complex reasoning. Judgment is inherently reasoning-intensive: beyond surface-level scoring, it requires verifying evidence, identifying errors, and justifying decisions. Through the analysis of evaluation tasks, we find a negative correlation between SFT performance gains and the proportion of reasoning-demanding samples, revealing the limits of SFT in such scenarios. To address this, we introduce JudgeLRM, a family of judgment-oriented LLMs, trained using reinforcement learning (RL) with judge-wise, outcome-driven rewards to activate reasoning capabilities. JudgeLRM consistently outperform SFT-tuned baselines in the same size, as well as other RL and SFT variants, and even surpass state-of-the-art reasoning models: notably, JudgeLRM-3B/4B exceeds GPT-4, while JudgeLRM-7B/8B/14B outperforms DeepSeek-R1 by over 2\\% in F1 score, with particularly strong gains on reasoning-heavy tasks. Our findings underscore the value of RL in unlocking reasoning-aligned LLM judges.

Authors show the negative correlation between the performance gains from SFT and proportion of reasoning-demanding samples in a given domain. To fix this gap, they propose a family of models -- JudgeLRM -- which were trained using GRPO method with \"judge-wise, outcome-driven\" reward function. This reward function was designed to optimize for structural correctness, relational accuracy, absolute score accuracy, and judgment confidence. Their results show that 3B JudgeLRM model is more accurate than GPT-4 on the human-annotated PandaLM benchmark, and 7B outperforms DeepSeek-R1 model.

In the Section 4.3 the authors also mention \"we observe a correlation coefficient of 0.20 between relative improvement and reasoning rate\", which imply $R^2=0.04$. In the Figure 3 caption the $R^2=0.95$ is given.\n- \"Reasoning\" Labeling Methodology: In the two most important figures (Figure 1 and Figure 3) the authors use \"Proportion Requiring Reasoning to Judge (%)\" metric. The process of creating this metric is only revealed in the appendix. While authors did validate this method against human annotators it still creates a potential circularity. The paper essentially uses GPT-4's own definition of \"reasoning\" to motivate the need for a new model. The paper then uses this new model to claim it has surpassed the performance of GPT-4 itself. Given that this metric is so central to the paper's argument, the use of an LLM to generate it should be discussed transparently in the main paper, not just in the appendix.\n- Overstated claims about surpassing GPT-4: JudgeLM dataset used to train JudgeLRM was made entirely from GPT-4 answers. The reward function was design to match the final outcomes from GPT-4 labels. Taking that into consideration, claiming that JudgeLRM \"surpasses GPT-4\" may be too strong. More precise framing, that this specialized 3B model was able to outperform its general-purpose teacher (GPT-4) on a different test (the human-annotated PandaLM benchmark).

How would the framework handle preference data (e.g., pairwise comparisons without numeric scores)?\n2. Can you clarify the motivation and formulation of the confidence reward? Why is it not continuous or calibrating? \n3. I am highly doubtful about the generalizability of the method to different score distributions. For example if the ground truth scores are distributed between 0-100, then reward hyperparameters need to be tuned accordingly. \n4. The claim that these rewards encourage calibrated confidence is probably incorrect as no proper scoring rule [2] was used in the reward function. Can the authors argue why this should be true?\n5. How were the reward hyperparameters chosen, and how sensitive are results to these values?\n6. Since the framework is pairwise by design, how is it adapted for single-response evaluation, and how reliable is that setup? If single-response evaluation is possible, it would be useful to have a baseline trained specifically for that setting to test if relational reasoning is truly necessary. \n7. Could you provide explicit equations for the baselines, especially DPO? Is the DPO implementation just the standard version? It is okay to put these into the appendix if space is a constraint. \n8. Could you compare against pairwise preference models trained explicitly for this setting (e.g., [1] but also used in multiple other works)?\n9. In the “length reward” experiment, why was a threshold-based reward (120 tokens) chosen instead of a more standard continuous reward formulation? Why was 120 tokens picked as a threshold? \n10. Can the authors formally define the training setting and data assumptions—specifically, the use of continuous scores between [0,10]—and discuss how this constrains generalizability?\n\n\n[1]: Munos, R., Valko, M., Calandriello, D., Azar, M.

What, then, is the major difference between the responses produced by the SFT and RL models?\n    - Q2:  What if trajectories from LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 or the Qwen3 series are used to fine-tune the model via SFT?\n2. The ablation study is not comprehensive, so the necessity of the proposed rewards cannot be fully verified.
