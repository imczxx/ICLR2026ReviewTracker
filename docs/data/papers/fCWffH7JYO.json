While prior work has separately explored biologically inspired gait design or deep reinforcement learning (DRL), these approaches face inherent limitations: open-loop gait designs often lack adaptability to unforeseen terrain variations, whereas end-to-end DRL methods are data-hungry and prone to unstable behaviors when transferring from simulation to real robots. We propose a hybrid control framework that integrates Hildebrand’s biologically grounded gait design with DRL, enabling a salamander-inspired quadruped robot to exploit active spinal joints for robust crawling motion. Our evaluation across multiple robot configurations in target-directed navigation tasks reveals that this hybrid approach systematically improves robustness under environmental uncertainties such as surface irregularities. By bridging structured gait design with learning-based methodology, our work highlights the promise of interdisciplinary control strategies for developing efficient, resilient, and biologically informed spinal actuation in robotic systems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Bio-inspired Robotics", "Reinforcement Learning", "Embodied AI"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/73f9edb74b07a4e36126484beeb1a9a7e79dd05e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper investigates how active spinal joint dynamics influence the locomotion performance of sprawling quadruped robots inspired by salamanders. To this end, the authors design a salamander-like quadruped robot with four legs (each with two degrees of freedom) and an optional one-degree-of-freedom spinal joint for lateral bending. The robot’s legs are controlled using a biologically inspired Hildebrand gait, while the spinal joint is adaptively modulated by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policy to improve locomotion efficiency and robustness. The experiments compare four locomotion strategies—Hildebrand-only, RL-only, torque-limited RL (RL*), and the hybrid Hildebrand + RL approach—in both simulation (MuJoCo) and real-world hardware. The results demonstrate that the hybrid Hildebrand + RL framework achieves the best balance between stability and adaptability, outperforming both purely model-based and purely learning-based baselines in reaching the target efficiently."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- Biologically grounded motivation with strong interdisciplinary reasoning.\n- The writing is clear and well-organized, making the technical content easy to follow for readers from both robotics and machine learning backgrounds.\n- The experiments are comprehensive, demonstrating results in both simulation and real-world hardware, which strengthens the paper’s practical relevance and credibility."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Novelty: The paper’s use of a hybrid controller combining a biologically inspired gait (CPG/Hildebrand) with deep reinforcement learning is not clearly novel.

This paper is primarily focused on robotics, not deep learning.  It does use reinforcement learning, but does not define the network architecture of the agent and value function, nor does it analyze their learned representations.  The robot form factor and hybrid controller may be novel, but as far as I can tell, there is no novelty in terms of the deep learning architectures used (assuming they used standard MLPs common in PPO and SAC).\n- The paper reports difficulties with sim-to-real transfer, but does not mention using any domain randomization during training, which is standard practice to improve robustness.  Also, if I understood correctly, torque limits are applied at inference time but not during training, which introduces an unnecessary distribution shift that might negatively impact performance.  This raises a concern that the results may not reflect best practices in RL and might be biased by sub-optimal implementation.\n- The paper reports overall task performance using the actuated spine, but would benefit from a deeper analysis of the spine behavior, since that is the primary novelty of the work.  In particular, it would be interesting to plot the trajectory of the spine over time, quantify its amplitude and periodicity, etc.\n- There are some minor presentation issues that could be improved:\n    - The authors should use \\citep for citations where the author name is not also a noun in the sentence, so that the parentheses enclose the author name\n    - Lines 160-161: The full names of SAC and PPO should be introduced immediately before their first occurrences, with citations for each\n    - For better image quality, Figure 4 should use a latex table and vector graphics image instead of two raster images\n    - Line 217 is missing a space after a comma"}, "questions": {"value": "- The paper mentions that various hyper parameters were \"tuned to optimize performance,\" but not how the tuning was done.
