Its global prevalence has increased markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and heavily reliant on physicians’ expertise, often resulting in delays in early detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed \\PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1) Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior), which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that PD-Diag-Net achieves 86% accuracy on external tests and over 96\\% accuracy in early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than 20%.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Parkinson’s disease", "Brain-Region", "brain-age", "MRI", "Clinical-Priors"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/05df96a47f90d9d282d4c82b7e020aebc145fcdf.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents PD Diag-Net, a clinically prioritized deep learning framework for the early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD).

The Processor steps seem standard to most others (skull stripping, bias correction, normalization, etc.), save for swapping out the tool/algorithm. Recent works like DeepPrep (Nature Methods, 2025, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02599-1) use more sophisticated preprocessing via deep learning and GPU parallelization with confound regression, motion correction, and distortion correction, none of which are addressed here.\n* The assigned clinical-prior weights of 1, 10^-2, and 10^-3 seem arbitrary. The authors state these are “based on clinical expertise,” but do not explain how (e.g., did a clinical expert offer these scores?). The referenced publication by Burciu et al. (line  198, page 4) is focused on the motor cortex, which is not prioritized as a prior/manifestation in this study. For example, Fig. 1(a) categorizes the insular cortex as “potentially associated” (10^-2 weight), yet growing literature findings (Jonkman et al., 2021; Fathy et al., 2019; Criaud et al, 2016) detail significant insular involvement in PD pathology. To mitigate questions about whether assignments were post-hoc fitted to improve performance, it would be helpful for the authors to include how (systematically/objectively) these weights were determined and assigned.\nPerhaps I also missed this, but was any sensitivity analysis conducted for the weights, i.e., what happens with different initial weights? Would (1, 0.5, 0.1) work similarly? The three-order-of-magnitude difference seems extreme.\n* The strength of novelty for ICLR is pretty weak, because the main things proposed were just standard methods (CNN for preprocessed T1w MRI), just different architectures or tools. The other components they proposed like regional-wise-pooling has also been done in the Brain GNNs space often, and it didn’t make sense why they pooled raw vs. learned features… the branching idea was different but is also essentially just separate encoders. The weights seemed like random numbers and were not justified.\n* The authors showed .99 ROC AUC curve (which is impossible to achieve) in the Appendix but didn’t report AUC across all evaluated methods & they mentioned certain components essentially are driving prediction entirely or in a strange way, e.g., deriving their equations shows aging prior has majority signal in most cases so the imaging features are essentially not helpful at all, which is the primary claim for using MRI. \n* Would need further clarity on the novelty claims and addressing the potential aging confounder + metrics."}, "questions": {"value": "* Equation 3 is confusing; the authors extract X_dense (learned features) but then pool raw MRI intensities (X_proc), which lack meaning at this stage, vs. learned. Why not apply pooling to Xdense?\n* For X_up, how did you upsample 2 scalar values (mean and std from Eq. 5, X_agg) to match approximately C*23*27*23?\n* The paper states, “Branch-2 utilizes an identical network architecture (with independently trained parameters)” (line 184, page 4). Why would age regression (1 output, continuous) and PD classification (2 outputs) need identical architectures?\nAUC metric should be moved up to main metrics; also questionable in Fig. 9, which shows near-perfect separation with AUC = 0.9971 for normal internal test (this could be overfitting).\nThe ablation study (Table 2, page 8) shows that removing the aging prior drops accuracy from 86.1% to 77.2%, which is a 9% decrease that represents most of the improvement over baseline. Seeing as age is a known co-variate of PD (high risk factor, as most PD patients are older adults and have certain comorbidities aligned with aging), I question whether the model is simply predicting brain age instead of diagnosing PD? Authors even state that removing aging prior drives prediction probabilities down near chance (line 428-429, page 8).\nTesting things out, given \\alpha=1, \\tau=4.5, a 10-year age gap shifts the PD logit by ~5.5, which could significantly affect a confident prediction. Why not learn the fusion weight here? \nIt would be helpful if the authors could strengthen their argument against the perspective that the model could be learning age-related patterns that correlate with PD incidence rather than PD-specific pathology. For example, report age distributions for “PD vs. Others” groups, show performance stratified by age groups, and validate that brain age prediction in PD-associated regions differs from whole-brain age prediction.\n* Why only aging as a “pathological” prior? What about established quantitative pathological markers like volumetric measures, structural measures like cortical thickness, or even functional connectivity, since the authors leverage a functional-based atlas?\n* The ablation study also indicates that CNN features hurt performance (70.8% for CNN features only vs. 81.5% Regional pooling alone: 81.5% [+10.7% better!] vs. 86.1% for Combined [+4.6% improvement over pooling alone]). So, raw regional averages outperform learned features? I again raise the question of how and where X_dense is appropriately integrated into the framework.\n* I find the Fig. 5 brain maps (page 9) somewhat uninformative. The three orthogonal slices of raw MRI for four outcomes add no interpretability without having MRI expertise. Since the model uses regional atlases, it would be more useful to visualize region-level importance scores, activation maps, or attention weights for interpretability. This could help answer which regions are driving prediction, and whether region-based contributions correlate with original weight assignments vs. learned weights.\n* The hyperparameter values \\zeta=9.5 and \\tau=4.5 create a 5-year gap (9.5 - 4.5 = 5) between minimum PD and maximum non-PD age gaps. How were these tuned? Were these validated clinically?\nAlso, experiments are said to use five-fold CV(line 344, page 7), but only point estimate values are reported. Are these averaged? Standard deviations?\n* Spelling/grammatical errors: “aggragated” should be “aggregated” (line 284, page 6); revise “In simple understanding” (line 316, page 6) to “In simple terms” or “Simply put”."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "e1WVJ9WQ2A", "forum": "nEEWgiu5Ku", "replyto": "nEEWgiu5Ku", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1230/Reviewer_QTEY"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1230/Reviewer_QTEY"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1230/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761715636610, "cdate": 1761715636610, "tmdate": 1762915713592, "mdate": 1762915713592, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes PD-Diag-Net, an end-to-end MRI-based framework for early Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis that integrates two explicit clinical priors—(1) Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (PD-related region weighting via Harvard-Oxford Atlas) and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (age-gap regularization capturing accelerated regional aging).
