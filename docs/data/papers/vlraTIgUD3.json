However, current open multimodal agents still largely fall short on the reasoning aspect that are crucial for real-world tasks like analyzing documents with dense charts/diagrams or navigating maps. To address this gap, we first introduce o3-bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning while attending to visual details. O3-bench features challenging questions that require agents to gather subtle visual information from multiple distinct areas of an image while performing complex, interleaved reasoning using the gathered information. These tasks are highly challenging even for frontier systems like OpenAI o3, which only obtains 42.8% accuracy on o3-bench. To tackle these tasks, we propose InSight-o3, a multi-agent framework that divides labor between a visual reasoning agent (vReasoner) and a visual search agent (vSearcher). As a concrete first step towards o3-like systems, we focus on the latter (i.e., vSearcher) in this paper, for which we introduce the task of generalized visual search---locating relational, fuzzy, or conceptual regions described in free-form language, beyond just simple objects or figures in natural images. We present a multimodal LLM purpose-trained for this task via reinforcement learning. As a plug-and-play agent that can be directly called by other agents, our vSearcher significantly improves the performance of existing frontier multimodal models by empowering them with generalized visual search on a wide range of benchmarks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["thinking with images", "o3", "visual search", "multi-agent framework", "reinforcement learning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/361436aea5932db9290ac28e2787bffd8325d270.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel multi-agent framework that decomposes multimodal reasoning into two agents: a visual reasoning agent (vReasoner) that performs CoT reasoning and provides answers, and a visual search agent (vSearcher) that outputs coordinates given a description.

This suggests the search pattern may be overly reliant on the characteristics of the training data, raising concerns about its scalability and effectiveness in real-world, multi-step search-and-reasoning tasks involving high-resolution images.\n\nThe framework's performance on powerful yet tool-agnostic models like GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 (as seen in VisualProbe-Hard and MME-RW-Lite results) is suboptimal. This indicates a strong dependency on models pre-equipped with tool-calling capabilities trained with multi-turn RL, highlighting a limitation in its general applicability. Further optimization is required to improve its stability and performance across a wider range of model architectures.\n\nThe ablation study on hybrid RL training reveals a trade-off: while combining static and dynamic RL improves performance on the proprietary O3-bench, it results in higher per-step inference latency without a clear balance of their respective advantages (static RL's speed vs. dynamic RL's adaptability).
