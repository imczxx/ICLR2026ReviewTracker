The oracle's responses are governed by a \\textit{transfer function}, which characterizes the relationship between differences in function values and the parameters of the response distribution. For a \\textit{linear} transfer function, we propose an algorithm that achieves an error rate of $O(n^{\\frac{3}{2}}/\\sqrt{T})$, where $n$ is the size of the ground set and $T$ denotes the number of oracle calls. We establish a lower bound: Under the constraint that differences between queried sets are bounded by a constant, any algorithm incurs an error of at least $\\Omega(n^{\\frac{3}{2}}/\\sqrt{T})$. Without such a constraint, the lower bound becomes $\\Omega(n/\\sqrt{T})$. These results show that our algorithm is optimal up to constant factors for constrained algorithms.

The authors propose and analyze algorithms for this setting, establishing error bounds for both linear and sigmoid oracle transfer functions.\n\n**Problem formulation:**\nThe objective is to minimize a submodular function $f:2^{[n]}\\rightarrow[0,1]$, which is a set function satisfying $f(X)+f(Y)\\ge f(X\\cup Y)+f(X\\cap Y)$ for all $X, Y\\subseteq[n]$. Access to the function is restricted to a dueling oracle, which, when queried with two sets $(S,S^{\\prime})$, returns a random binary response $o\\in\\{\\pm1\\}$. The probability of the response is governed by a transfer function $\\rho$ based on the value difference, e.g., $Pr(o=+1)=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\rho(f(S)-f(S^{\\prime}))$. The goal is to minimize the additive error $E_{T}:=f(\\hat{S})-min_{S\\in2^{[n]}}f(S)$ after $T$ oracle calls.\n\n**Main results**\nFor a linear transfer function, the paper provides an algorithm with an error rate of $O(n^{\\frac{3}{2}}/\\sqrt{T})$, which is proven to be optimal for constrained algorithms by a matching lower bound. For a sigmoid transfer function, the authors design an algorithm with an error rate of $O(n^{\\frac{7}{5}}/T^{\\frac{2}{5}})$.\n\n**Technique/algorithm summary:**\nThe algorithms are based on applying Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to the Lovász extention, which is a continuous convex relaxation of the submodular function. In the linear case, an unbiased subgradient estimator for SGD is constructed directly from the dueling oracle's response. Because unbiased estimation is infeasible for the sigmoid function, that algorithm instead employs Firth's method (Firth, 1993) to create a low-bias estimator from the logistic regression model, thereby mitigating error accumulation.\n\n**Experiment summar **\nThe paper includes numerical experiments that implement the proposed algorithms for both linear and sigmoid transfer functions on submodular cut functions. The result empirically validate the theoretical findings by plotting the error's dependence on the number of oracle calls ($T$) and the ground set size ($n$), showing the data falls between the derived upper and lower bounds."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The theoretical results are solid."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Even though this is mainly a theoretical paper, the paper also provides some experimental supports.
