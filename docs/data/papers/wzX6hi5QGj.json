Existing methods typically regularize the learned policy to avoid choosing overestimated OOD actions. However, we argue that this often over-constrains policy improvement or requires sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We restate this challenge as the absence of explicit training signals for the\nvalue function in parts of the state–action space. A more effective approach is to provide explicit training signals across the entire action space to eliminate overestimation. We introduce a surprisingly simple yet effective method: $\\textbf{Action-Space Pseudo-Labeling (ASPL)}$ to resolve this challenge. It completes the value-function’s\nmissing signals by assigning pseudo Q-targets that decrease with distance from\nthe behavior support (i.e., the support of the behavior policy). In practice, ASPL achieves an implicit behavior-aware regularization that strengthens as behavior likelihood decreases. On D4RL datasets,\nwe observe stable training and consistent improvements over strong offline baselines with minor tuning burden.

The novelty of the proposed method is limited. The core idea of applying pseudo-labeling to OOD actions is already established in prior works like MCQ, SVR, and OAC-BVR. The paper lacks a compelling justification for why the specific design of ASPL is superior to these existing approaches.\n2. There appears to be a potential error in Equation (6), which warrants clarification from the authors.\n3. By applying an explicit penalty based on the distance, the proposed method introduces a bias estimation that may also propagate to in-distribution state-action pairs through the Bellman backup. This could systematically depress Q-values across the entire state-action space. The authors should provide Q-value curves for all tasks to investigate this potential issue.\n4. The experimental evaluation is insufficient, as it is conducted solely on the Gym domain. For a comprehensive assessment in offline RL, it is essential to include results on more challenging benchmarks, such as the AntMaze domain, which tests an algorithm's ability to perform long-horizon tasks.\n5. There is a significant discrepancy in the reported results for the baseline method SCAL on the halfcheetah-medium-expert task (44.0 in this work vs. 91.7 in the original paper). This major inconsistency casts doubt on the integrity of the experimental setup and the validity of the comparative analysis.\n6. While the authors cite the most relevant prior works (MCQ and SVR), they conspicuously omit direct comparisons with them. This lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods that share a similar design philosophy is a critical omission and prevents a fair assessment of the method's contribution.\n7.  Given the final performance of ASPL as reported, its overall effectiveness is questionable. A simple comparison with the reported performance of MCQ and SVR would likely confirm this performance gap.\n8. The experimental results report only mean performance without the corresponding standard deviations across multiple seeds. Reporting the variance is essential to properly assess the significance and reliability of the results.\n9. The use of a batch size of 512 deviates from the community-standard value of 256 used in most prior works for fair comparison.

The ASPL method tackles the challenge of sparse coverage in the action space, effectively providing training signals for OOD actions (Sec. 4.1; Eq. 6). This addresses a critical issue in offline RL and improves performance without adding complexity to existing actor–critic pipelines.\n2. The integration of pseudo-labeling into the critic update is minimalistic yet effective, requiring no additional actor-side constraints or auxiliary networks (Sec. 4.3). This simplicity enhances the method's appeal for real-world applications where computational efficiency is important.\n\nEmpirical validation on D4RL benchmarks:\n1. ASPL consistently outperforms several strong offline RL baselines, including TD3+BC, CQL, and IQL, across various D4RL Gym–MuJoCo tasks (Sec. 5.1; Table 1). These results demonstrate the method's robustness and its ability to achieve stable training and competitive performance with minimal hyperparameter tuning.\n2. The paper includes detailed experiments showing the sensitivity of ASPL to key hyperparameters like the number of random actions sampled (N) and the pseudolabeling coefficient (α), highlighting its resilience to hyperparameter changes (Sec.5.2; Fig. 3, Fig. 4).\n\nBehavior-aware weighting mechanism:\n1. The dynamic adjustment of pseudo-label weight based on behavior coverage (Eq. 9) is a unique and promising feature. This ensures that updates are Bellman-dominated in well-supported regions and pseudo-label-dominated in unsupported regions, improving stability and mitigating extrapolation errors (Sec. 4.2).\n2. The simplicity of the behavior-aware weight mechanism—decreasing the weight with increasing behavior coverage—makes the method both effective and easy to integrate into existing RL pipelines (Sec. 4.2).\n\nMinimal tuning burden:\n1. ASPL reduces the sensitivity to hyperparameters, particularly the pseudo-label weight α, which simplifies the tuning process compared to other methods (Sec. 5.2). This is a significant advantage for practitioners who need reliable methods with minimal configuration effort."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Limited theoretical analysis of the behavior-aware weight mechanism:\n1.

Although the paper compares ASPL against several state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, the set of baselines could be expanded to include more diverse approaches, especially methods that use ensemble critics or model-based planning (Sec. 5.1). This would provide a more comprehensive comparison and further demonstrate ASPL's advantages.\n2. The paper mainly focuses on tasks in the Gym–MuJoCo environment. Evaluating ASPL on a broader range of tasks, including those with more complex action spaces or other domains like NLP or robotics, would offer insights into the generalizability of\nthe method (Sec. 5.1). No direct evidence found in the manuscript.\n\nInsufficient discussion of generalization to other action spaces:\n1.

A more detailed discussion on how ASPL could be adapted to different action spaces or other types of\ndecision-making environments would be valuable, particularly for applications beyond Gym–MuJoCo tasks.\n\nClarifications needed for pseudo-labeling process:\n1. The pseudo-labeling process involves sampling random actions from the action space and using distance-based Q-values as pseudo-targets. However, the handling of these pseudo-labels could be explained more clearly, particularly regarding the distance metric and its effects on training dynamics (Eq. 7).
