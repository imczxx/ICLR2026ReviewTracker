However, it still faces significant issues related to the training data, such as training inefficiencies due to numerous low-contribution tasks in large datasets and substantial noise from incorrect labels. Thus, training data attribution methods are needed for meta learning. However, the dual-layer structure of meta learning complicates the modeling of training data contributions because of the interdependent influence between meta parameters and task-specific parameters, making existing data influence evaluation tools inapplicable or inaccurate. To address these challenges, based on the influence function, we propose a general data attribution evaluation framework for meta learning within the bilevel optimization framework. Our approach introduces task influence functions (task-IF) and instance influence functions (instance-IF) to accurately assess the impact of specific tasks and individual data points in closed forms. This framework comprehensively models data contributions across both the inner and outer training processes, capturing the direct effects of data points on meta parameters as well as their indirect influence through task-specific parameters. We also provide several strategies to enhance computational efficiency and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in training data evaluation via several downstream tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Data Attribution", "Influence Function", "Meta Learning"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/46ae11f98249249f38c4ad45a76dc2ccf15d2b94.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a framework for evaluating the influence of training data in the context of MAML, which is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem.

The scope: The proposed IF evaluation method is only applicable for second-order MAML, which is only one specific algorithm among numerous  meta-learning algorithms. A narrowed title and scope, e.g. \"Evaluating data influence in MAML by IF\" would be more proper and accurate.\n\n2. Experimental and practical concern: The burden calculating IF is concerned, though some approximation and acceleration techniques have been applied. It seems there are much more simple and intuitive baselines in the application scenario of IF. For example, for retraining, a simple baseline is taking few gradient-ascend steps on the data to remove (both task/instance (train/valid)) are applicable), but has not been compared. For identifying harmful data, a simple baseline is evaluating  the loss scalar, but also has not been compared.\n\n3.

The proposed method for training instance influence, which models the outer-loss change as a simple additive proxy P, implicitly relies on the sufficiency of local, linear approximations. This two-stage linear approximation (first to compute P, then to compute its influence) may fail to capture the complex, non-linear effects of removing a data point, especially in optimization landscapes with high curvature or when the removal of a point induces a significant shift in the task-specific parameters.\n\n2. The influence functions proposed in the paper are derived reasonably, but multiple approximations may lead to uncontrollable cumulative errors. The influence function is based on a first-order Taylor approximation; to avoid third-order derivatives, the total hessian matrix is simplified. Additionally, the computation of the inverse Hessian-vector products relies on iterative approximations. The paper does not provide an analysis of these cumulative errors.\n\n3. The experiments lack diversity in tasks, as the paper only evaluates few-shot image classification tasks. However, the loss landscapes of different types of tasks can vary significantly, which may affect the performance of Hessian-based influence functions, the core method of this paper."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can you analyze the range of cumulative errors, or compare Task-IF and Instance-IF predictions of \\Delta\\lambda to the true change obtained by removing a task/sample and retraining?\n\n2. In Proposition 4.8, the calculation of the Instance-IF for training data relies on the term D_\\lambda P(\\lambda^*, \\theta_k(\\lambda^*); \\tilde{z}). Given that P is a function of the inner-level Hessian inverse H_{k,in}^{-1}, which itself depends on \\lambda, the full derivative D_\\lambda P would involve third-order derivatives (the derivative of H_{k,in}^{-1} with respect to \\lambda). Could you clarify whether your implementation includes these third-order derivative terms? Did you use the same approximation strategy as Task-IF to ignore these higher-order derivatives?\n\n3.
