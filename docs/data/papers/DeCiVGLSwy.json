It proposes Rex-ODE, a reversible ODE solver that, by applying the McCallum-Foster method in a reparameterized space, inherits its non-trivial linear stability and high-order convergence properties —a clear advantage over prior work.\n\n2. It introduces (to my knowledge) the first practical, algebraically reversible SDE solver (Rex-SDE) that does not require storing the entire $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ Brownian motion path in memory. It cleverly achieves this using splittable PRNGs for noise reconstruction.\n\n3. It provides a deep and valuable theoretical analysis (primarily in Appendix A) demonstrating that recent competing reversible solvers, namely BDIA and O-BELM, are fundamentally variants of the leapfrog/midpoint method and are thus nowhere linearly stable."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The paper is deeply contradictory. The main derivation in Section 3.1 is for the \"data prediction\" parameterization. However, Appendix I (Figs 6, 8) explicitly shows this is pathologically unstable for inversion, with latent variances exploding to $\\approx 10^7$. Appendix I and G.3 state that the \"noise prediction\" parameterization is stable and was used for key experiments. This makes it unclear what method was actually used for the main results in Tables 1 & 2 and invalidates the focus of the main paper's derivation.\n\n2. A key selling point is the ability to achieve \"arbitrarily high order of convergence\". Yet, the empirical results in Tables 1, 2, and 4 consistently show that the high-order Rex (RK4) performs worse than its low-order counterparts (Rex-Euler, Rex-EM). The paper completely fails to discuss or analyze this significant negative finding.\n\n3. For the standard unconditional sampling task (Table 1, FID), the Rex-ODE solvers are not SOTA. They are outperformed by the O-BELM baseline at 10 and 20 steps —the very baseline this paper proves is unstable. This suggests that for pure sampling (not inversion), the theoretical stability of Rex does not necessarily translate to superior FID.\n\n4. What is the computational overhead (i.e., extra latency) of this \"re-compute\" strategy during the backward pass (inversion or gradient back-propagation) compared to the naive approach of simply storing the $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ path? Is there a significant practical trade-off between memory and speed?\n\n5. If an \"unstable\" method can achieve superior FID in a pure sampling task, why should the community adopt Rex-ODE for this purpose? Does this imply that the stability advantage of Rex is primarily relevant for inversion-dependent tasks (as asked in Q3) and offers no clear benefit for standard, forward-pass generation?"}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ixx52GlFLy", "forum": "DeCiVGLSwy", "replyto": "DeCiVGLSwy", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22418/Reviewer_qLBS"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22418/Reviewer_qLBS"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22418/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761488825029, "cdate": 1761488825029, "tmdate": 1762942209756, "mdate": 1762942209756, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a family of reversible SDE solvers named \"Rex\" based on the McCallum-Foster method, which can be reduced to reversible ODE  solvers by proper parameter-setup.

Without the experiment on image editing, it is not clear at all if the proposed method provides any new benefits in terms of stability. \n\n(3) In the original BDIA paper, the authors also perform experiments over Stable Diffusion v1.5, and show that BDIA performs better than DDIM.
