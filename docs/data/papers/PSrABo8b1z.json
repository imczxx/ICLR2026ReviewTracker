However, existing approaches focus primarily on retrieving isolated factual knowledge entities while neglecting the critical reasoning relationships. To address this limitation, Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as an effective solution, which explicitly integrates structured knowledge graphs into LLMs to support complex reasoning tasks. Although diverse corpus retrieval methods have been explored, they typically rely on static, query-agnostic graphs constructed via fixed heuristics. We are thereby motivated to propose a query-centric retrieval framework that adaptively constructs a graph tailored to each query. However, it is challenging to accurately identify these latent relationships from queries to the corpus. Moreover, unifying multiple local-perspective connections into a globally coherent structured corpus introduces additional complexity. To this end, we introduce HyperRAG, a novel framework in the Hyperbolic space that captures both explicit entity-based links and implicit logical connections inferred by the LLM. Our main contributions include: (i) A dual-stage prompting strategy that guides the LLM to identify relevant passages and their implicit relationships based on the query. (ii) A hierarchical graph unification paradigm that models each query-specific graph as a minimal subtree and integrates them into a cohesive graph. (iii) A hyperbolic space embedding approach that effectively preserves the hierarchical structure during graph learning. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three benchmark datasets, where a remarkable improvement on three datasets indicates our superior performance than others.", "tldr": "We build a hyperbolic graph to achieve a better retrieval performance to help LLMs generate the answers.", "keywords": ["RAG; LLMs"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/897164fa89c0ca4729dec3c72da506268e4c29a8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces HyperRAG, a query-centric retrieval system that builds upon traditional RAG architectures.

Since the experimental dataset contains only 1,000 questions, this may present two problems in the context of real-world systems with large amounts of meaningless noise questions: 1. Will meaningless questions be identified as Implicit Connections, thereby degrading the quality of the dynamic knowledge graph? Are there any tests provided for this? 2. If there are a large number of query requests, does the method provide a trade-off between knowledge graph quality and cost? Are there related ablation experiments for this?\n\nW3: The method is unclear (the pseudocode cannot even be considered an algorithm, but rather a process description). The experiments are insufficient and the experimental reproducibility details are not clear enough, lacking ablation experiments with sufficient methodological details, such as the impact of parameters on experiments.

I understand this is not your contribution, but I indeed see this connection with multi-hop QA for the first time. However, your statement \"While desirable in many metric spaces, these metrics universally satisfy the triangle inequality. As the number of hops increases (i.e., $p_1 \\to p_2 \\to \\dots \\to p_k$ ), passages with similar semantic embeddings have endpoints p0 and pk that remain close in the metric space. As k increases, the global semantic distance between distant nodes in the chain is underestimated.\" confuses me. How did you arrive at this conclusion? You have not rigorously stated such assumptions in your theory, nor have you proven the assumptions.

The definition of the dual-stage prompting strategy is vague.

The 3.1.3 section proposes a tree fusion mechanism that merges explicit and implicit knowledge trees, but no algorithmic formulations or pseudo-code are given.\n\n3. The pruning action to prevent cycles in tree merging is questionable in design. This pruning operation may oversimplify the graph and reduce its representational capacity, potentially eliminating important semantic connections or multi-hop reasoning paths, thereby leading to the loss of critical knowledge that could have contributed to more comprehensive retrieval and reasoning.\n\n4. The contribution of retrieval with learned hyperbolic embedding is not given.
