We argue this failure is fundamental to their optimization schedules, as simultaneous or iterative heuristics predictably collapse under a combinatorial explosion of conflicting gradients, leading to entangled geometry or catastrophic divergence. In this paper, we reframe the core challenge of compositional generation as one of optimization scheduling. We introduce DecompDreamer, a framework built on a novel staged optimization strategy that functions as an implicit curriculum. Our method first establishes a coherent structural scaffold by prioritizing inter-object relationships before shifting to the high-fidelity refinement of individual components. This temporal decoupling of competing objectives provides a robust solution to gradient conflict. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on diverse compositional prompts demonstrate that DecompDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fidelity, disentanglement, and spatial coherence.", "tldr": "We introduce DecompDreamer, a Gaussian-splatting-based framework for generating high-quality compositional 3D assets from text.", "keywords": ["text-to-3d generation", "gaussian splatting", "compositional 3d generation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3487c625cac3dfe26a701ca01bca6d4481b9720b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/283304a738f15b3ce3829b631a4ac797d7307946.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes DecompDreamer, a staged optimization framework for compositional text-to-3D generation.

The paper identifies a convincing theoretical bottleneck in compositional generation—gradient conflict arising from naive scheduling. This claim is not just theoretical; it is well-supported by the loss-dynamics analysis in Figure 5, which clearly visualizes the optimization divergence of GraphDreamer (Heuristic 3) versus the stable, two-stage convergence of the proposed method (Heuristic 4).\n2. The method shows a clear and significant advantage as the number of objects and relations increases. As shown in Table 1, the performance of baselines like GraphDreamer collapses when moving from $\\le3$ objects to $>3$ objects. DecompDreamer, in contrast, maintains high semantic alignment and user preference, proving its ability to handle the combinatorial complexity that cripples prior work.\n3. Explicit and Effective Disentanglement: The framework does not treat object disentanglement as a mere by-product of good generation. Instead, it is explicitly engineered through a suite of complementary techniques: object-wise Gaussian tracking, targeted relational optimization, view-aware supervision, and the use of negative prompts. This results in clean geometric isolation of individual components (as seen in Fig. 1, 6, and 13), a major improvement over the blended and entangled geometry common in baselines."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The paper's primary weakness is the difficulty in attributing the final performance gains solely to the novel scheduling. The staged curriculum (Heuristic 4) is introduced concurrently with several other significant improvements (e.g., switching to flow-based guidance, view-aware alignment, negative prompts). The ablation study in Figure 7, while useful, does not fully isolate the scheduling component from these other powerful techniques. It is unclear how much of the gain comes from the \"structure-then-detail\" curriculum versus the other, more localized, improvements.\n\n2. The paper's thesis is about solving optimization failure modes (divergence, conflict, entanglement). However, the main quantitative comparison (Table 1) reports semantic alignment metrics (CLIP, Pick-A-Pic, User Study). While the loss analysis in Figure 5 is excellent, it is relegated to a secondary analysis. The main SOTA comparison would be far more convincing if it included direct metrics for these claimed optimization failures, such as a \"divergence rate\" on complex prompts, a \"geometric entanglement\" score, or a \"relational violation\" metric.\n\n3. The set of baselines is insufficient. The paper omits comparisons to several key state-of-the-art works from 2025, most notably Hunyuan3d 2.0 (Zhao et al., 2025) and STEP1X-3D (Li et al., 2025). Both of these models have demonstrated extremely high-fidelity and controllable asset generation.
