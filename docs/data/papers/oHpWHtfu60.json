Most existing methods rely on single-phase computed tomography (CT), they often suffer from low contrast and incomplete lesion depiction. Contrast-Enhanced CT (CECT) offers multiple imaging phases: arterial (ART), portal venous (PV), and delayed (DL), which provide complementary anatomical and functional information. This study begins with a systematic quantitative evaluation of each enhanced phase using standard segmentation models to investigate their individual contributions and validate phase-specific clinical insights. Guided by this analysis, a Multi-phase Attention Deep Fusion Network (MADF-Net) is proposed to hierarchically integrate ART, PV, and DL features across the input, feature, and decision levels. Experiments on the clinically collected multi-phase liver lesion (MPLL) dataset (the largest and most clinically comprehensive multi-phase liver cancer CECT dataset) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance. MADF-Net achieves a Dice score of 78.65%, which is 9.39 higher than the best single-stage baseline, by deeply fusing information from three phases, and consistently improves across all evaluation metrics.

One of the claimed contributions of this paper is the proposal of a new three-phase lung CT dataset; however, this contribution is not clearly stated in either the abstract or the introduction.\n3. The proposed method lacks novelty. The three-stage fusion framework, whether at the input level, feature level, or decision level, shows little distinction from existing common fusion methods and does not demonstrate substantial innovation.\n4. The experimental setup is insufficient. In Table 3, the compared methods on the single-phase dataset are too outdated, consisting mainly of simple early CNN models. The performance comparison with more recent and competitive methods is missing. Similarly, for the multi-phase fusion experiments, the baseline methods are also outdated, and no comparison is made with recent approaches from 2024 or 2025.\n5. The ablation study is inadequate.

Several clinical and technical aspects remain unclear and flawed. The authors claim MPLL as the largest dataset with 952,601 2D slices, but it only comprises 141 patients. Multiple existing datasets contain significantly more patients (for example: https://vindr.ai/datasets/abdomen-phases, https://zenodo.org/records/12741586, and other research works [1,2,3]). Reporting the number of 2D slices is not a valid metric, as slice thickness varies, and the actual number of liver-containing slices would be considerably lower. Furthermore, the proposed 2D-based methodology is outdated, as current state-of-the-art liver tumor segmentation methods predominantly utilize 3D approaches. The comparison methods selected by the authors are also not current.\n\n2. While the authors focus on AP, VP, and DP phases, they overlook the importance of the non-contrast phase in hepatic radiological diagnosis. The Hounsfield Unit enhancement between AP and non-contrast phases is a crucial diagnostic factor, and non-contrast imaging is essential for identifying calcifications.\n\n3. The complexity of liver lesion types is not adequately addressed. Although the authors collected five lesion types (two malignant, three benign), their evaluation metrics lack clarity. They report only binary metrics combining all lesions as one type, without providing subtype analysis or malignant-benign differentiation. The evaluation focuses solely on segmentation performance, neglecting the clinically crucial aspect of lesion classification. Moreover, the dataset description lacks essential details about the distribution of patients with and without lesions, making the overall methodology unclear.\n\n4. The insights proposed by the authors are well-established in existing literature and do not present novel perspectives.

A major drawback is the lack of external validation, as the method is verified solely on the newly created MPLL dataset without rigorous testing against established public benchmarks. Methodologically, the final implementation often lacks a clear, one-to-one mapping or intuitive bridge to the mathematical rigor presented in the Preliminary section, particularly concerning the explicitly defined uncertainty-aware fusion and adaptive input weights, obscuring the precise realization of these concepts. Furthermore, the paper omits a comprehensive ablation study on all possible phase input combinations (e.g., comparing ART vs DL), hindering a precise understanding of the marginal value of each phase. Finally, the complex multi-stage attention network, despite its high accuracy, introduces a significant computational overhead (high GFLOPs), posing a practical limitation for clinical deployment."}, "questions": {"value": "The validation of MADF-Net relies exclusively on the proprietary MPLL dataset. Although this dataset is comprehensive, the absence of external validation on well-established public benchmarks (e.g., LiTS, 3Dircadb) considerably limits the generalizability of the reported state of the art (SOTA) performance. Since ICLR is a general machine learning conference rather than one focused on medical imaging, broader validation across multiple datasets would strengthen the paper’s claims.\n\nIn addition, the study primarily investigates 1P (PV), 2P (ART+PV), and 3P (ART+PV+DL) settings. However, other important two-phase combinations (e.g., ART+DL or PV+DL) and the standalone contribution of the DL phase were not systematically evaluated. This omission limits a clear understanding of each phase’s marginal contribution to overall performance.\n\nFurthermore, the general fusion formulations presented in the Preliminary section do not align directly with the implementation details described in the Methodology. While it is understandable that the implementation may involve additional technical complexity, each fusion module within the framework should be explicitly linked to the mathematical formulation introduced earlier. Otherwise, the inclusion of a complex adaptive formulation in the Preliminary section appears disconnected and underutilized in the final implementation, which causes confusion."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "d2brb2K3aC", "forum": "oHpWHtfu60", "replyto": "oHpWHtfu60", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8668/Reviewer_CLa4"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8668/Reviewer_CLa4"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8668/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761627377959, "cdate": 1761627377959, "tmdate": 1762920483240, "mdate": 1762920483240, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a framework for liver segmentation, which integrates the information from three phases of CT images.

Lack of true methodological novelty. The proposed MADF-Net mainly combines input-level concatenation, attention-based feature fusion, and decision-level aggregation.

While the integration of these three fusion stages is labeled as hierarchical, the design essentially stacks existing fusion strategies rather than introducing a conceptually new mechanism. Overall, the novelty is incremental and would be considered engineering-level improvement.\n\n2. Unclear contribution of each fusion stage. Although the paper emphasizes multi-level fusion, it lacks an ablation study isolating the contribution of input-, feature-, and decision-level fusion components. Without such evidence, it is hard to assess whether the performance gain stems from the combination itself or simply from increased model capacity.\n\n3. Dataset not publicly validated. The proposed MPLL dataset is claimed to be the largest multi-phase liver dataset, yet the paper provides no cross-center validation or public access.
