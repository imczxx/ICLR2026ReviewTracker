However, the collection of VLN data demands extensive human\neffort to construct trajectories and corresponding instructions, hindering the development of large-scale datasets and capable models. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a comprehensive platform for aerial VLN. Firstly, OpenFly integrates 4 rendering engines and advanced techniques for diverse environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering samples of diverse scenarios and assets across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN\nmodel emphasizing key observations to promote performance and reduce computations. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, where our navigation success rate outperforms others by 14.0% and 7.9% on the seen and unseen scenarios, respectively. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Vision-and-Language Navigation", "multimodal learning", "vision-language model"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1261024c7810c5c821d8003ec7eef1e03838ef23.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/47beffcaa0fe1f0491a5e51f6e2124736a320967.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce a dataset and method for aerial Vision–Language Navigation (VLN).

Since the model builds upon the existing OpenVLA framework, the novelty mainly lies in incremental enhancements, specifically the addition of keyframe selection and token pruning mechanisms.

This makes it challenging to validate whether OpenFly-Agent indeed outperforms them in a fair comparison.\n\n(2) Why was OpenVLA selected as the backbone?\n\nThe performance of OpenVLA baseline (2.3% in Table 3) is significantly lower than that of Navid (13.0%) and NaVila (20.3%) in Table 1. Given this substantial gap, the authors' choice of OpenVLA as the backbone over more performant alternatives such as NaVila requires further justification.\n\n(3) Does OpenFly-Agent generalize to other datasets?\n\nConsidering that trajectories are automatically generated, direct comparisons in terms of dataset scale to handcrafted datasets such as TouchDown and CityNav become less relevant. Rather, the automated data-generation process could be viewed as part of the training methodology itself. Thus, evaluations on external datasets (e.g., AerialVLN, CityNav, OpenUAV) are necessary to substantiate the generalization capability of OpenFly-Agent."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the questions listed under Weaknesses.

Although this paper provides details evaluation of OpenVLA agents, it lacks analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed dataset.

I'd recommend the authors train OpenVLA on both OpenFly and OpenUAV datasets, and test on unseen scenes to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed dataset.\n2. This paper utilizes A* algorithm to generate navigation trajectory.  However, this paper does not comment or provide any analysis on the potential biased introduced by A* algorithm.  For example, are the generated trajectories smooth, energy efficient, or safe? These are key factors that should be considered when deploying simulation-trained agents to the real world.\n3. Likewise, this paper selects 4 DoF action space, which sounds reasonable for long-horizon navigation.  However, such a simplified action space is insufficient for drones to navigate in highly-occluded scenes (e.g. street scenes).  This paper doesn't discuss such limitations.\n4. I'm not sure if training OpenVLA models for navigation is a right reseaerch direction, since recent studies show that navigation tasks are inherently visual grounding tasks.  Since VLMs excel at visual grounding, one can directly use VLM models to generate 2D waypoints for 3D navigation [1].  I'd strongly recommend the authors to test these zero-shot navigation policies on the proposed dataset.\n\n---\n\nReference:\n[1] Hu, Chih Yao, et al. \"See, Point, Fly: A Learning-Free VLM Framework for Universal Unmanned Aerial Navigation.\" Conference on Robot Learning.

Relying on the A* data-generation pipeline introduces a two problems: (1) The path style is unnatural, filled with \"robotic sharp turns\" instead of smooth, human-like flight. (2) The data is pure \"expert demonstration\", meaning the model only learns to follow perfect paths, not recover from deviations. This makes the model extremely fragile to real-world disturbances.\n2. The system uses discrete motion control, which in practice, is more like performing control classification based on visual input. During actual deployment, the UAV is unable to achieve precise flight maneuvers, such as orbiting a small object, because the current turning angles are insufficient"}, "questions": {"value": "1. The paper mentions in Section 3.2 that collision-free training trajectories are generated using A*. However, during the simulation and real-world testing in Section 6, no collision detection mechanism or related metrics (e.g., number of collisions) are mentioned. Please clarify: (1) During evaluation, are the agent's generated trajectories checked for collisions? (2) If a collision occurs, is the task considered a failure, or does it continue? (3) Does the OpenFly-Agent itself possess any form of dynamic or reactive collision avoidance capability?\n\n2. Could the authors clarify the exact movement mechanism for the agent in the simulation? The description suggests the model chooses between a series of discrete waypoints or actions (e.g., Forward 9m). This raises a critical question: after executing an action, does the agent \"teleport\" to the next state, or does it execute a simulated continuous flight action between points? If it is \"teleportation,\" the task essentially degenerates from a \"navigation control\" problem into a \"sequential VQA\" problem. This is fundamentally different from the real world, where a UAV must use continuous motor control to counteract inertia, wind, and various physical disturbances. Please clarify this setup, as it profoundly impacts the sim-to-real difficulty and the model's true generalization capabilities.\n\n3. The ablation study shows a massive performance leap when moving from \"KS\" (9.2% SR) to \"KS + VTM\" (34.3% SR), suggesting the VTM module is critical. Could the authors elaborate on the reasons why this token merging strategy results in such a dramatic improvement? \n\n4. How to deal with the problem in weakness one?\n\nI think the paper's overall contribution to be valuable, particularly the development of a pipeline for building UAV environments. Even if the trajectories have certain issues, the continuous videos are still useful for non-control applications, such as VLM pretraining or developing world models.\nHowever, the paper is positioned as a comprehensive 'platform.' This implies that in addition to the environment, the trajectories and control mechanisms must also be sound and well-justified.\nTherefore, I expect the authors to specifically address my questions on these points.
