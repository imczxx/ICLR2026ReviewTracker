Although recent deep learning–based ANC algorithms have set new performance benchmarks, there remains a shortage of theoretical limits to rigorously assess their improvements. To address this, we derive a unified lower bound on cancellation performance composed of two components. The first component is information-theoretic: it links residual error power to the fraction of disturbance entropy captured by the anti-noise signal, thereby quantifying limits imposed by information-processing capacity. The second component is support-based: it measures the irreducible error arising in frequency bands that the cancellation path cannot address, reflecting fundamental physical constraints. By taking the maximum of these two terms, our bound establishes a theoretical ceiling on the Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) attainable by any ANC algorithm. We validate its tightness empirically on the NOISEX dataset under varying reverberation times, demonstrating robustness across diverse acoustic conditions.", "tldr": "We derive an ANC lower bound and validate it on multiple datasets and ANC algorithms", "keywords": ["Active Noise Cancellation", "Information Theory"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/26a3e052e0cb8dfb9e68af6e71879909375d41de.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/5174e6399d805bf15ebdf189edac12e261c23039.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a unified bound of any active noise cancellation algorithm based on two components such as information theoretic and support based derivations, and demonstrates the effectiveness with experiments on a benchmark dataset called NOISEX.

To tackle this issue, they present a hardware-in-the-loop testbed and a unified set of evaluation metrics that combine objective and perceptual measures.

Most prior studies have focused on simulation-based analysis, which often overlooks key practical factors such as transducer response, delay, and spatial sound propagation. By integrating real-world noise environments into the testing framework, the authors make an important step toward closing the gap between theoretical ANC models and deployable systems.\n\n(2) The proposed metric suite is another valuable contribution. It combines objective measurements such as noise attenuation, latency, and power consumption with perceptual or user-centered measures, providing a more comprehensive picture of ANC performance. This balanced evaluation approach aligns well with how ANC systems are judged in consumer and industrial contexts, where both signal fidelity and user comfort matter."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "(1) The statement that existing ANC research lacks real-world evaluation or unified metrics is somewhat overstated. There is a substantial body of work, particularly from the audio engineering and acoustic signal processing communities, that includes hardware-based testing and adherence to industry standards for headphone or ear-cup ANC evaluation. The contribution of this work would be better framed as extending these established practices into a machine learning–oriented benchmarking context rather than claiming an entirely unexplored area.\n\n(2) The diversity and representativeness of the proposed dataset are not clearly established. Real-world ANC applications span a wide range of acoustic conditions—engine rumble, wind, speech interference, irregular transients, and user motion artifacts. Without sufficient coverage of such variations, the benchmark may not generalize across different use cases or device form factors. More details on the environments, noise categories, and device configurations would strengthen the paper’s claims.\n\n(3) The baseline comparisons presented appear limited. If the evaluation includes only a small set of algorithms or omits the most recent adaptive and hybrid ANC techniques, it becomes difficult to assess the framework’s true benchmarking value. A more extensive comparison including both classical adaptive filtering approaches and advanced learning-based systems would offer a fairer and more informative reference point.\n\n(4) The long-term impact of the benchmark depends heavily on its accessibility and community uptake. Without a clear plan for public release, maintenance, or integration with open repositories, the benchmark risks becoming another isolated dataset. The authors should describe mechanisms for community engagement, version control, and contribution guidelines to ensure the framework remains relevant and widely adopted.\n\n(5) The inclusion of a reproducible experimental protocol would substantially enhance the benchmark’s utility. Providing a detailed description of test scripts, noise source configurations, user movement patterns, latency budgets, and power constraints would make it easier for other researchers to replicate results and compare new methods under standardized conditions.

The main derivations rely heavily on established principles from information theory and signal processing, notably the Shannon rate-distortion lower bound and classical spectral support arguments derived from Parseval’s theorem. The proposed 'unified' bound is constructed heuristically by taking the maximum of these two well-known limits, without formal justification or proof that this composition represents a true optimality condition. The derivation employs standard simplifying assumptions common in adaptive filtering; such as approximate Gaussianity, wide-sense stationarity, and linearization to make the analysis tractable. While these assumptions are reasonable for first-order theoretical treatments, the paper does not adequately discuss their scope or limitations, particularly in nonstationary or nonlinear ANC scenarios where the bound’s validity may break down. Moreover, the empirical validation focuses primarily on visual trends across noise types and reverberation times but does not provide quantitative evidence of how close existing models actually come to the theoretical limit. Without metrics of bound tightness or uncertainty, the results remain largely illustrative. Finally, the narrative tends to reiterate the same conceptual message about unifying information-theoretic and physical constraints without developing deeper analytical or practical insight.
