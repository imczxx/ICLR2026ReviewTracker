Results show very strong accuracies across almost all models and appear saturated. I suggest tempering the claims, or expanding the evaluation (creating harder splits, mask-only inputs, additional stress tests or more datasets).\n\n- **Overly descriptive presentation.** Specifically Section 2 lists architectures, losses, optimizers at great length with very little interpretation. Much of this could be a part of the appendix. I would suggest the authors to create a figure where they present the bag of models, optimizers, losses and then use the saved space to explain how they operated the sweeps and what is the methodology together with their takeaways.\n\n- **No empirical evidence for disentanglement.** The paper claims to separate morphology from imaging artifacts but provides no adversarial or cross domain validation supporting that. As far as I understand, the models that predict protocol values are trained independently from the morphology related tasks. I do not see any motivation drawn in the experimental section to justify or demonstrate the value of protocol tasks. I would expect creating an architecture such that the features for those tasks are shared vs independent; and try to demonstrated when the features are shared the morphology related accuracies improve. This would motivate the additional protocol prediction task significantly.\n\n- **Causal ordering in HMTT unclear.** The sequence cell line, medium, seeding density, ..., replicates is asserted causal but I do not see clearly how or why that would be the clear order.\n\n- **Consistency claims.** Related to my previous point, HMTT is said to yield consistent predictions despite lower accuracy, however consistency is not defined or measured. I did not understand if the model is doing the subsequent predictions given the previous ones to be consistent.\n\n- **No ablations.** There is no vanilla baseline removing the proposed morphometric fusion or hierarchical conditioning (or adversarial training?).\n\n- **Quantitative validation.** Can the authors come up with a quantitative measure for the biological validity? For the Grad-CAM results it would be beneficial to see the model attentions side by side across the models and relate them to their performance.\n\n- **Temporal prediction baseline.** A simple copy the last frame baseline should be reported to verify that the models outperform trivial predictions.\n\n- **Overstated conclusions.** For example in the conclusion the paper claims to \"pave the way for AI systems that explain and validate experimental biology.\" which I dont think is supported by the experiments.

The specific image results after many steps in the protocol and influenced by parameters of imaging. The images are also subject to intrinsic heterogeneity in the cell/spheroid shape. Therefore the problem requires choosing the aspects of protocol that can be predicted and that should be controlled. \n* Technical replicate prediction is uniformly poor (best F1=0.5668 with CoAtNet) because replicates correspond to repeated imaging of the same spheroid with little morphological signal—models default to majority classes (T1-T8 account for 89.2% of images) despite focal loss and reweighting. \n*Microscope and magnification achieve near-perfect scores (F1>0.999) but they can be thought of as dataset artifacts (optical signatures like field of view, resolution) rather than biological inference. \n* Temporal prediction performance remains modest (SSIM<0.40, PSNR≈18 dB) because spheroid growth follows complex, non-linear biological processes (proliferation, compaction, necrosis) only partially visible in bright-field images, and SLiMIA provides short and irregular sequences making it difficult for recurrent models to learn long-term dependencies. \n* Finally, critical data limitations constrain validation: SLiMIA provides no persistent cell IDs across time, making it impossible to validate whether predicted temporal orderings or protocol attributes accurately reflect true single-cell progressions. The dataset is limited to a single experimental context (specific cell lines, culture conditions, imaging setups), and the framework has not been tested on diverse 3D culture systems (organoids, embryoid bodies, tumor spheroids) to establish generalizability.

Can you acquire or identify a time-lapse microscopy dataset where individual spheroids/organoids are tracked with persistent IDs across complete maturation cycles (e.g., Cell Tracking Challenge datasets: http://celltrackingchallenge.net/ which provide ground-truth lineage information). Train inverse protocol prediction models on this dataset and quantitatively validate whether: (1) predicted temporal positions correlate with true temporal ordering, (2) predicted protocol attributes (seeding density, formation method, medium) match ground truth across developmental stages, (3) morphological reconstructions at intermediate timepoints not used for training match actual observations. \n* If you must use SLiMIA dataset, conduct biological validation experiments: for attributes where models make high-confidence predictions (e.g., \"this spheroid was cultured in DMEMLG medium\"), perform orthogonal experimental validation (e.g., mass spectrometry analysis of residual media, genotyping for cell line verification) to confirm predictions. This addresses the critical limitation that SLiMIA provides no cell tracking and establishes whether learned representations capture genuine biological dynamics rather than spurious correlations.\n* Apply the inverse protocol prediction framework to diverse 3D culture systems beyond spheroids to establish generalizability: in addition to cell tracking challenge, you can consider the datasets from Allen Institute and Bioimage archive."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "qZjtMFm29b", "forum": "hqHu9qLfK8", "replyto": "hqHu9qLfK8", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17627/Reviewer_rJc7"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17627/Reviewer_rJc7"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17627/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762356544642, "cdate": 1762356544642, "tmdate": 1762927488165, "mdate": 1762927488165, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a new classification task on the SLiMIA dataset of cell images, which they term \"inverse protocol prediction\".
