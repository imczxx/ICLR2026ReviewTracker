We first show that existing data-constrained approaches of increasing epoch count and parameter count overfit, and we improve upon such recipes by tuning regularization, finding that the optimal weight decay is $30\\times$ larger than standard practice. Since our regularized recipe monotonically decreases loss following a power law in parameter count, we estimate its best possible performance via the \\textbf{asymptote} of its scaling law rather than the performance at a fixed compute budget. We then identify that ensembling independently trained models achieves a significantly lower loss asymptote than the regularized recipe. Our best intervention combining epoching, regularization, parameter scaling, and ensemble scaling achieves an asymptote at 200M tokens using $5.17\\times$ less data than our baseline, and our data scaling laws predict that this improvement persists at higher token budgets. We find that our data efficiency gains can be realized at smaller parameter counts as we can distill an ensemble into a student model that is 8$\\times$ smaller and retains $83$% of the ensembling benefit. Finally, our interventions designed for validation loss generalize to downstream benchmarks, achieving a $9$% improvement for pre-training evals.

For instance, the Qwen3 model was pretrained on about 36T tokens. It would be interesting to investigate, when training with more than 20 x N tokens, how to appropriately adjust the learning rate, weight decay, and number of epochs.\n2.

The authors argue that as compute continues to scale faster than data generation, the community must shift from compute-efficient to data-efficient training paradigms. The work first demonstrates that standard recipes, which involve increasing epochs or model parameters, inevitably lead to overfitting and performance degradation. As a solution, the authors propose a \"regularized recipe\" using aggressive weight decay (up to 30x standard practice) to achieve stable, monotonic performance scaling. Building on this, they show that ensembling multiple smaller models is a more data-efficient use of compute than scaling a single large model. By combining these methods, they claim a significant 5.17x improvement in data efficiency. Finally, the paper grounds these compute-intensive findings in practice, showing that the gains from ensembling can be largely preserved by distilling them into a single, smaller model, and that improvements in validation loss translate to meaningful gains on downstream tasks."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "This is a strong paper that could become a foundational empirical work for the emerging data-constrained training regime. The experiments are thorough, and the insights are valuable for both theoretical and practical applications. Specifically, I appreciate the following contributions of this paper.\n1. **Extensive Experiments:** The claims are backed by an impressive scale of experimentation, reportedly over 2000 training runs. I like the scientific approach of diagnosing the failure of a baseline, introducing a robust regularized recipe, and then demonstrating the superiority of ensembling, which builds a convincing, step-by-step argument.\n2. **Practical and Generalizable Insights:** The work successfully connects the \"infinite compute\" thought experiment back to practical applications. The demonstration that an 8-member ensemble can be distilled into a single student model that retains 83% of the performance gain is a crucial result, proving these methods are not purely theoretical. Furthermore, the validation on downstream benchmarks  confirms that the observed improvements in pre-training loss correspond to genuine enhancements in model capabilities."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Architectural Specificity:** The empirical results are derived exclusively from Llama-style decoder-only architectures. It remains unclear whether the core findings, particularly the superiority of ensembling over scaling a single model, generalize to different architectures such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). More critically, under the infinite-compute regime, transformer architectures may not represent the optimal choice. The paper would benefit from discussion on architectural considerations within data-constrained training regimes.\n2. **Reliability of Power-Law Extrapolation:** The paper's headline quantitative claims (e.g., 5.17× data efficiency) depend on extrapolating power laws fitted to limited data points (typically four model sizes). While the authors provide a sensitivity analysis and appropriately advise caution, the absence of formal statistical goodness-of-fit metrics (such as R² or confidence intervals) makes it difficult to assess the true reliability of these asymptotic estimates. The broader literature demonstrates that simple power laws can break down or exhibit sub-scaling behavior at larger scales, making long-range extrapolation risky. This concern is compounded by the non-standard width/depth configuration of the 1.4B model, which introduces a potential confounder that could affect the quality of the fit."}, "questions": {"value": "The paper convincingly shows that tuned regularization eliminates the initial overfitting peak seen in standard recipes.
