While multi-agent simulations powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) provide an ethically viable alternative, they often fail to bridge the gap from believable narratives to rigorous experiments, plagued by two fundamental hurdles: a lack of psychologically plausible motivations (the Fidelity Challenge) and the absence of systematic methods for quantifying complex interactions (the Measurement Challenge). To overcome these obstacles, we introduce $\\textbf{EduMirror}$, a multi-agent platform designed as a computational laboratory for the scientific study of educational social dynamics. EduMirror's framework integrates four key components: (1) A Systematic Scenario Design Workflow grounds simulations in established social science theory, ensuring construct validity. (2) To address the Fidelity Challenge, a unified Value-Driven Agent Architecture models agent motivation based on both individual psychological needs and Social Value Orientation (SVO). (3) To solve the Measurement Challenge, a Dual-Track Measurement Protocol employs specialized LLMs as a post-hoc Rater for observable behaviors and an in-situ Surveyor for internal states, transforming qualitative interactions into quantitative data. (4) Together, these components enable researchers to conduct controlled Intervention Experiments, branching simulations to systematically assess the causal impact of different strategies. We validate our platform through case studies on school bullying and group cooperation, demonstrating its capacity to generate theoretically-consistent and empirically-verifiable social phenomena, thereby establishing a robust methodology for in silico educational research.", "tldr": "A flexible multi-agent simulation for styding educational social dynamics.", "keywords": ["Educational Simulation", "Multi-Agent Simulation", "Computational Social Science"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5a0e220598ba684f76aca7a7e0eb5d3d5e906583.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proproses a LLM-driven multi-agent simulation framework named EduMirror to simulate the educational social dynamics in educational scenarios.

However, this work neither released new datasets nor established benchmarks that subsequent researchers could build upon for further studies. Therefore, the primary area selected in this paper is inappropriate.\n2. **Missing Details**: In the main technical introduction section (Section 3) of this paper, likely due to space constraints, most technical details are marked as available in the appendix. This prevents readers from effectively understanding the technical contributions shown in Figure 2 through the main text, which is inconsistent with standard writing practices and ICLR submission requirements (the appendix is not required reading for reviewers).\n3. **Fidelity is questionable**: In the experiments conducted in this paper, there is a lack of real-world data participation, such as character profiles or environmental contexts from actual bullying incidents. The paper relies solely on a limited number of questionnaire results to assess the fidelity of the simulated outcomes. These settings and evidence are insufficient to fully validate the fidelity of the framework presented herein.\n4. **Reproducibility**: This paper neither provides open-source code nor offers relevant prompts, making it impossible to verify the reproducibility of its content."}, "questions": {"value": "Please follow the weaknesses part."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "INteOCWyq3", "forum": "xeIheyQAV8", "replyto": "xeIheyQAV8", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5807/Reviewer_uz6m"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5807/Reviewer_uz6m"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5807/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760600280674, "cdate": 1760600280674, "tmdate": 1762918274363, "mdate": 1762918274363, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a multi-agent simulation platform for education social dynamics.
