However, existing approaches like graph neural networks (GNNs) and traffic simulations face challenges in predicting flow for unseen road networks without historical data. Without abundant training data, GNNs often generalize poorly to new graphs, while simulations can be computationally infeasible for large-scale networks. This paper tackles the problem of few-shot traffic flow prediction in unseen road networks. We propose a novel traffic simulation algorithm that efficiently predicts flow based on node and edge attributes. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate our approach closely approximates true flow with asymptotically optimal runtime complexity. Experiments on real-world road networks show our simulation algorithm outperforms GNNs for predicting traffic in unseen cities after training on only three cities. While motivated by traffic prediction in road networks, we expect our contributions to have broader applicability to general graph flow prediction problems across domains.", "tldr": "We propose an efficient algorithm to perform few-shot graph flow prediction.", "keywords": ["graph flow", "flow prediction", "graph neural network", "few-shot learning", "traffic prediction", "neural network"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f281d795265efdd5d08590d7b58df60905cd5864.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies network traffic simulations through flow decomposition and neural network approximation. It considers that traffic flow can be decomposed into the amount of individuals traveling thought a network edge, where each individual travels from its origin to its destination via the shortest path in the network. It uses a neural network to approximate the feature vector associated with each node in the network, then the traffic flow of an edge can be obtained by the dot product of an origin embedding and a destination embedding (feature vectors). Experiments are conducted on three cities in Texas, where node feature vectors are trained from OpenStreetMap location data, satellite image data, and NASA population density data.

The major contribution is in Theorem 1 that, based on some assumptions on distance metrics between network nodes and traffic approximation, quantifies the approximation error of a traffic flow estimation. The intuition and the proof look reasonable (while I haven’t checked the detailed proof).\n2. The experimental studies obtain the location-wise feature vectors from three different sources, which are of independent interest for road network studies."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Weaknesses:\n1. The run-time analysis may be over-simplified. First, the assumption that computing node and edge feature vectors takes constant time may not be correct. Instead, it depends on the number of nodes in the network. Next, the run-time for pre-processing is ignored. The pre-processing includes the computation of node and edge feature vectors, as well as the all-pairs (?) shortest paths. The computational complexity of the latter cannot be simply ignored. If one turns to approximated all-pairs shortest paths, then the impact of the approximation on the effectiveness of the travel flow prediction would need to be revealed.\n2. While the few-shot learning setting is a claimed advantage of the proposed simulation method and a weakness of data-driven GNN approaches, it is not backed with empirical evidence and relevant study to support the statement. \n3. Why is none of the simulation-based methods in the related work included as a baseline? Currently, only a simple GNN method serves as the baseline, making the experimental study less convincing. Similarly, there have been extensive spatial-temporal GNN methods for traffic prediction. Having some representative methods here would strengthen the study.\n\nQuestions:\n-  Line 348: what is the “floating point operation” for the run-time estimate?\n- The experimental study chooses the measure as the avg number of vehicles passing through a road segment per day. I guess the motivation here is the per day data is more stable compared with per hour or hours.
