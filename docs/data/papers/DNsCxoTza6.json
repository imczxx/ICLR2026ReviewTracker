By leveraging dynamic attribute graphs, DATG++ enables fine-grained control over semantic attributes such as sentiment or toxicity, while maintaining fluency and generality across diverse contexts. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on retraining or rigid templates, DATG++ operates as a plug-and-play module compatible with large language models, offering interpretable and adaptable control through graph-based semantic manipulation.\n\nThe framework combines probabilistic adjustment and prompt-based guidance to steer generation toward desired attributes. It further extends to multimodal scenarios by aligning attribute representations across text, image, and audio modalities. A built-in fairness-safety mechanism mitigates biased outputs and supports privacy-preserving generation. DATG++ promotes transparency, efficiency, and ethical alignment, paving the way for responsible deployment in domains such as human-robot interaction, assistive technologies, and scientific communication.", "tldr": "DATG++ pioneers dynamic attribute graphs for efficient multimodal control, enabling precise semantic steering with integrated fairness-safety alignment while preserving generative quality.", "keywords": ["Dynamic Attribute Graphs", "Fairness-Safety Alignment", "Efficient Multimodal Control", "Attribute Boundary Controlling", "Plug-and-Play Framework"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
