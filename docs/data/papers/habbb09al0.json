Evaluation-Aligned Training Signals for Multi-LLM Agents", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise for complex tasks, yet current training methods lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent- and message-level learning. We propose a theoretical framework that unifies cooperative game–theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform \\emph{$\\text{system evaluation} \\rightarrow \\text{agent credit} \\rightarrow \\text{response-level signals}$}. Unlike prior approaches that rely only on attribution (Shapley) or step-level labels (PRM), our method produces local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. In success cases, Shapley-based credit assignment fairly allocates outcomes across agents and is refined into per-message rewards that promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage; in failure cases, first-error localization yields repair-aware preferences that penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts. The resulting signals are bounded, cooperative, and directly compatible with reinforcement- or preference-based post-training, providing a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training. Our contribution is conceptual: we present a theoretical foundation and training signals, leaving empirical validation for future work.", "tldr": "We propose a theoretical framework that transforms system-level evaluations in multi-LLM systems into fair, credit-conserving, and repair-aware training signals, bridging the gap between global outcomes and local post-training supervision.", "keywords": ["Multi-agent systems", "Large language models", "Credit assignment", "Shapley values", "Process reward models"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e5e9bfb213ce815ae908944029a265170012acf6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a theoretical framework for training multi-Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems, aiming to solve the credit assignment problem of translating system-level evaluations into agent- and message-level learning signals.
