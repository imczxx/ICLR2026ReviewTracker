Synthetic data generation, particularly through diffusion models, has become a promising strategy to address these limitations. Diffusion-based models have showcased impressive results, but face challenges in capturing diverse frequency components and retaining high-frequency details during noise accumulation. To address these issues, we propose a multi-stage diffusion framework named Frequency Decomposed and Enhanced Diffusion (\\gen), which explicitly decomposes time series into low- and high-frequency signals and emphasizes preserving fine-grained temporal patterns. Our method first trains an unconditional generator on coarse, periodic low-frequency signals, then incorporates an enhancement mechanism to synthesize precise high-frequency details. This two-stage approach systematically handles complex temporal variations, allowing \\gen to produce more accurate, realistic, and diverse time series. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available real-world datasets, demonstrating that \\gen not only outperforms state-of-the-art generative methods in various evolution metrics but also exhibits superior adaptability across different time series domains. An ablation study confirms the effectiveness of frequency decomposition and high-frequency enhancement, underscoring the advantage of exploiting multi-resolution insights. Our findings expand the application scope of diffusion models for time series generation tasks, offering a flexible solution for data augmentation under privacy and sensitivity constraints.

The novelty of this work is limited which combines existing techniques without significant innovations.

Also no analysis is provided to check if generated samples are authentic versus memorized copies from training data. \n4. Table 1 shows FDEDiff uses 128 hidden size with 8 heads while Diffusion-TS uses 96 hidden with 4 heads. This means different parameter counts and computational costs. The paper claims these are \"aligned for fairness\" but provides no actual parameter count, or training time comparisons. The two-stage training and inference likely adds significant overhead that's completely ignored in the evaluation.\n5. The authors should have used Discriminative Score and Predictive Score like presented in the TimeGAN and Diffusion-TS to evaluate the generated samples.\n6. Table 2 shows no error bars.\n7.
