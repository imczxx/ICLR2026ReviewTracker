Existing compilers operate on hardware coupling graphs and introduce SWAP operations to satisfy restricted qubit interactions, which often increases circuit depth, execution time, and error rates. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for mapping and routing, but prior approaches still lead to long execution times and degraded fidelity on real devices, limiting practical effectiveness. We propose a hardware-aware compilation framework that integrates representation learning with search. Specifically, we design a graph-biased Transformer that jointly encodes logical and physical qubit graphs with structural biases, and train policies via group-relative policy optimization using a blocking-aware simulator aligned with true execution-time objectives. During inference, the learned policy is combined with Monte Carlo tree search to refine mappings under limited simulation budgets. Experiments demonstrate that this integrated learning-and-search framework achieves scalable, hardware-aware compilation with improved fidelity and efficiency across diverse circuits and architectures.", "tldr": "A graph-biased Transformer with policy-guided MCTS learns hardware-aware qubit layouts that reduce makespan versus strong transpiler baselines under matched budgets.", "keywords": ["Quantum compilation", "qubit layout", "graph transformer", "reinforcement learning", "hardware-aware cost"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6c30464681cee5d7ad45556fa7bdfe9bd32e0ac8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces GRIT, a hardware-aware quantum compilation framework based on RL.

Strong Problem Formulation: The paper correctly identifies a critical and practical challenge in near-term quantum computing. The diagnosis of the \"objective mismatch\" (i.e., optimizing proxy metrics like SWAP count instead of true hardware performance like makespan) is accurate and provides a strong motivation for the work [cite: 2635-2636].\n\n2. Well-Motivated High-Level Framework: The high-level design of the proposed solution is logical. The idea of using a learned policy, trained with a realistic hardware simulator (Fig 1b), to guide a robust search algorithm like MCTS (Sec 4.2) is a powerful and well-established paradigm for complex planning problems."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Despite its sound motivation, the paper is plagued by severe issues in its organization, theoretical justification, and experimental validation, which ultimately fail to support its central claims.\n\n1. The paper is poorly organized. It dedicates nearly five pages to introductory and background material, leaving the core model (Sec 3) and learning (Sec 4) sections compressed, underdeveloped, and vague. Critical details of the architecture and training are hard to parse, while extensive space is given to standard definitions.\n\n2. The paper attempts to bolster its contribution by including formal-looking theoretical analysis (e.g., Lemma 3, Proposition 1) that is ultimately superficial. Lemma 3 is a trivial algebraic identity, and Proposition 1 is a standard (and unsurprising) regret bound for policy-guided MCTS. This \"theory\" provides no novel insight into the specific architectural innovations of the Graph-Biased Transformer and feels disconnected from the paper's core claims.\n\n3. The paper's primary claim is its complex GBT architecture, yet this claim is left entirely unsubstantiated by the experiments. There are zero ablation studies to demonstrate that the novel components (Laplacian PE, Geodesic Bias) offer any advantage over a standard Transformer or a simpler GNN. Furthermore, the baselines used (\"RANDOM\" and \"QISKIT TRANSPILER\") are critically insufficient. Qubit routing is a mature field, and failing to compare against any SOTA heuristic (e.g., SABRE) or other ML-based compilers makes it impossible to assess the method's actual contribution.\n\n4. The experimental results fail to justify the model's complexity, even against the weak baselines. As shown in Tables 1 & 2, GRIT often produces worse results (e.g., higher Depth on QFT, more SWAPs on 127q QFT) than the simple Qiskit heuristic. The runtime (TIME(s)) comparison is fundamentally flawed: the baselines are fast, constant-time heuristics (~20-30s), while GRIT is a time-budgeted MCTS search. The results show GRIT is slower, scales poorly, and still fails to deliver a consistent win on the key metrics, demonstrating no practical value for its complex design."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The experimental results (e.g., QFT-127q in Table 2) show that GRIT is significantly slower than the Qiskit heuristic (120s+ vs. 72.84s) and produces a worse-quality circuit (4113 SWAPs vs. 4078).
