While implicit CoT methods promise efficiency by operating in latent space, they largely rely on heuristic architectures, complex multi-stage training (e.g., distillation), and lack a principled objective for end-to-end optimization. We introduce variCoT, a principled variational framework that overcomes these limitations through a unified evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective. Implemented in a single Transformer with strategic control tokens, variCoT learns a continuous latent reasoning trace $Z$ and deploys it via \\textit{guided latent reasoning}: $Z$ acts as a cross-attention query to guide generation across all layers, decoupling abstract reasoning from linguistic realization. This enables flexible inference—direct answer generation (2.5$\\times$ faster) or optional full CoT reproduction—without architectural fragmentation. On GSM8K and CommonsenseQA, variCoT matches or exceeds explicit CoT accuracy while significantly reducing latency, establishing a theoretically grounded and scalable approach to efficient reasoning.", "tldr": "We derive an effective and efficient unified variational framework for training language models thinking in latent space", "keywords": ["Large Language Model", "Chain-of-Thought", "Variational Inference", "Latent Reasoning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/486b86edcf27e8851eada7668ff9f36e4ff65da4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a variational training method for latent reasoning in LLMs. The key idea is to use control tokens to cast a LLM backbone into the prior, the posterior, the CoT decoder and the answer decoder.

But the question is, if we give the proposed model more compute budget, can it outperform the baseline? \n\n3. Inadequate ablation: The idea of sharing backbone for prior, posterior and decoder is interesting. However, the authors' experiments cannot justify the gain comes from variational inference. For example, how about ablating the pathway of posterior (2nd row in Fig. 1) and directly use the latents from 1st row in decoder training? Note that the ELBO in Theorem 2.4 is very prone to posterior collapse.  \n\n4.

Strong Empirical Results & Efficiency: The method is not merely theoretical; it delivers strong practical results. Achieving a 2.5x inference speedup (Figure 3) while matching the accuracy of the much slower explicit CoT-SFT baseline on GSM8K is a significant and compelling result.\n\n3. Reversible Reasoning for Interpretability: A major drawback of most implicit reasoning methods is that the process becomes an opaque \"black box.\" The inclusion of the reasoning decoder p(Y^r | X^q, Z) and the strong reconstruction results (Table 2) is a key advantage, offering a path to interpretability that competing methods lack."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Validity of Assumption 2.2: The entire ELBO decomposition (Theorem 2.4) hinges on Assumption 2.2, which posits that the explicit rationale Y^r and the final answer Y^a are conditionally independent given the latent trace Z. This is a strong assumption, and its validity is questionable; the linguistic formulation of a rationale likely provides constraints that aid in answer generation, and vice-versa. The paper would be strengthened by a justification or analysis of this assumption.\n\n2. Fixed-Size Latent Bottleneck: The method trades the variable-length bottleneck of explicit rationale tokens for a fixed-size latent bottleneck (where K=6 is used in experiments). The sensitivity analysis (Figure 6) confirms K is a critical hyperparameter. This raises a scalability concern: it is unclear whether this small, fixed-size trace can scale to problems requiring significantly more reasoning steps than those in the benchmark datasets.\n\n3. Scalability to Large Models: All experiments are conducted on relatively small models (GPT-2 and LLaMA3.2-1B). The stability and effectiveness of VAE-style training on frontier models (e.g., 70B+) remains an open question. Furthermore, the addition of a new cross-attention mechanism at every Transformer layer introduces a non-trivial computational cost that is not fully analyzed.\n\n4. Incomplete Efficiency Analysis: The paper's efficiency analysis is one-sided, focusing exclusively on the clear win in inference latency. The paper is silent on:\n\n(1) Training Efficiency: The training protocol (Algorithm 1) and the augmented architecture (per-layer cross-attention) are almost certainly more computationally expensive than the CoT-SFT baseline. This trade-off is not discussed.\n\n(2) Data Efficiency: The model is trained on the same large augmented dataset (385K samples) as the baselines. No analysis is provided to suggest that this more complex variational objective improves sample efficiency or could learn effectively from less data."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Analysis of Posterior Collapse: A discussion on posterior collapse—a primary challenge for VAEs—is notably absent. The paper appears to use two mechanisms to mitigate this: (1) a β=0.01 coefficient on the KL divergence, and (2) a dual-reconstruction objective (L_reasoning and L_answer). A formal analysis of these mechanisms is needed. How sensitive is model performance to the choice of β? Is the dual-loss objective a sufficient regularizer on its own?\n\n2. Justification for Query-based Guidance: The authors use the latent Z as the Query and the text representations H_self as the Key/Value, implying the \"reasoning state\" is actively probing the text for information. Could the authors elaborate on this important design choice? Did they experiment with the reverse configuration (i.e., H_self as Query) and, if so, what were the results?\n\n3. Discussion of Concurrent Work: The \"Related Work\" section should be updated to situate the paper against highly relevant concurrent research. Specifically, \"Latent thought models with Variational Bayes inference-time computation\" (ICML'25) appears to be a parallel effort, also proposing a variational Bayes framework for learning \"latent thought vectors.\" A discussion comparing and contrasting the variCoT framework with this \"LTM\" approach (e.g., differences in architecture, objective, or optimization) is essential to properly clarify this paper's unique contributions."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "cJGBGmZxWA", "forum": "NpKyLOcFCX", "replyto": "NpKyLOcFCX", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19195/Reviewer_axp1"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19195/Reviewer_axp1"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19195/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762470883559, "cdate": 1762470883559, "tmdate": 1762931192126, "mdate": 1762931192126, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes variCoT, a variational framework for implicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
