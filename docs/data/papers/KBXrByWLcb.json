In many clinical datasets, including Our reconstructed cohort of $N = 50{,}155$ patients with observed follow-up of only 74.742 months (58.8\\% deceased, 41.2\\% censored), long-term outcomes remain unobserved, preventing reliable 10-year (120-month) survival estimation. We address this gap by introducing a dynamic pseudo-label refinement and calibration framework that transforms incomplete follow-up into extended, biologically consistent survival trajectories. Starting from a hybrid Weibull–Kaplan–Meier initialization, pseudo-labels are iteratively corrected under survival-theoretic constraints and clinical plausibility rules, including enforcing zero survival beyond death and monotonic survival probabilities for censored patients. These refined labels are propagated through a deep ensemble trained with variance-penalizing objectives and monitored via diagnostic feedback for stability and uncertainty calibration. This process enables survival labels to evolve adaptively, rather than remain static preprocessing artifacts, and produces clinically plausible estimates well beyond the observed horizon. We applied to the 50{,}155-patient cohort, the framework achieved rapid convergence and outstanding predictive performance ($R^2 = 0.9964$, MAE = 0.0066, C-index = 0.9915), with predictions tightly calibrated, biologically consistent, and robust under long-term censoring. We validated Our proposed framework on two public datasets of N = 2509 \\& N = 205  available in \\cite{Metabric_Kaggle} (Metabric) \\& \\cite{finalfit2023survival} (Malignant Melanoma) achieved remarkable results ($R^2 = 0.9924$ \\& $0.9781$, MAE = 0.0142 \\& 0.0247, C-index = 0.9633 \\& 0.8459) by follow-up to 480 \\& 240 months respectively. Thus, by bridging the 74.742-month follow-up limit with reliable 120-month projections on Our dataset, Our work establishes adaptive pseudo-label refinement as a principled foundation for long-horizon, interpretable, and clinically reliable survival modeling.

The paper has very weak ML/methodological contribution. For an ICLR-style ML venue, the core methodological novelty is quite limited. The paper combines:\n   - A simple hybrid pseudo-label initialization using Weibull and KM survival at 120 months; \n   - A fairly standard deep neural network architecture with engineered time features and an ensemble of three models; \n   - Several ad-hoc iterative tricks (periodic quantile transformation, clipping, moving averages, early stopping, ad-hoc learning-rate decay, periodic model reset, etc.); \n   - Survival “constraints” (monotonicity, survival=0 after death) that are conceptually obvious and implemented via post-hoc corrections. \n\nThis is essentially an engineering pipeline built from known components, not a new learning principle, not a new loss, not a new architecture, etc. There is no theory (no consistency or convergence analysis, no characterization of what the fixed point of the pseudo-label iteration represents, no error propagation analysis). The “EM-like” iterative flavor is mentioned informally in the discussion but never formalized. As a result, I see no solid methodological contribution that would be of lasting interest to the ML community.\n\n2. Motivation and positioning wrt pseudo-observation literature are weak/misleading. The introduction motivates the method by listing three “limitations” of pseudo-observation approaches: dependence on independent censoring, static pseudo-values, and lack of interpretability/diagnostics. However:\n   - Wrt Independent censoring. The paper claims existing pseudo-observation methods crucially rely on independent censoring and thereby suffer in realistic clinical data. But there are already many well-known literatures on pseudo-observations under covariate-dependent or informative censoring, e.g. via IPCW or working models, which is not discussed or cited. The discussion glosses over these developments and gives the reader the impression that pseudo-observation methods are fundamentally tied to naive independent censoring assumptions, which is not accurate.\n   - Wrt static vs dynamic labels. The fact that classical pseudo-observations are not iteratively updated is presented as a limitation, but pseudo-values are designed to be asymptotically unbiased estimators of well-defined functionals (e.g., survival probability at a time point, RMST). In many settings, not iteratively changing the labels is a feature: you know exactly what target you are estimating. The paper does not articulate what statistical estimand their dynamic pseudo-labels converge to, if any, and why iterative “refinement” is preferable to a consistent, one-shot pseudo-observation.\n   - Wrt interpretability and calibration. The introduction frames pseudo-observations as lacking interpretability and calibration; in practice, many pseudo-observation methods are precisely used because the resulting regression coefficients/outputs are interpretable survival functionals and can be assessed with standard calibration tools. The claimed interpretability of SPARC is never concretely demonstrated -- there are no case studies, no feature importance analyses, no subgroup plots that would justify the interpretability claim.\n\n\n3. The method is heavily heuristic, with many arbitrary design choices and no justification. Concretely, Algorithm 1 is a long list of heuristic operations:\n\n   - Special treatment of a fixed horizon τ=120 months, chosen because “10-year survival” is clinically relevant, but no quantitative justification is provided, and all modeling is single-time-point anyway. \n   - Periodic quantile transformation every 3 iterations, hard clipping of labels to [0.01, 0.99], a weight function inversely proportional to |y−0.5|, periodic full model resets after “stagnation”, blending new predictions with previous pseudo-labels using a 70/30 exponential moving average, gradually tightening constraints up to 95%, etc. \n   - The architecture itself (layer sizes, dropout schedule, L2 value, the number of ensemble members, learning rate decay schedule) is also fixed by apparent trial-and-error, with no sensitivity analysis.\n\nNone of these choices is theoretically motivated, and the paper does not even provide an empirical ablation study to show which parts are necessary. Without such justification, the method looks like a brittle, hand-tuned recipe rather than a principled algorithm.\n\n4. Evaluation is fundamentally circular and lacks proper baselines. The main dataset (“Our dataset”) has a maximum observed follow-up of 74.7 months, but the model predicts 120-month survival. Since there is no actual 120-month ground truth, the authors evaluate performance almost entirely against their own pseudo-labels: R², MAE, etc. measure self-consistency between the model and the pseudo-labels it iteratively helped to create. This raises several issues:\n\n   - The reported near-perfect metrics on the main dataset are not meaningful in terms of real clinical predictive performance; they show only that the ensemble can approximate its own smoothed targets very well.\n   - There is no comparison to standard baselines: e.g., pseudo-observation, pseudo observation for dependent censoring, or even simple pseudo-labeling methods. The introduction criticizes existing methods, but the experiments do not include them, which is unacceptable for a paper claiming methodological contribution.\n   - On the two public datasets (METABRIC and the melanoma dataset), results are again phrased in terms of pseudo-labels and internal diagnostics; there is no comparison to the many survival benchmarks already reported on these datasets. Also, calibration results in Figure 1 indicate misclassification on these real datasets.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation design does not provide evidence that SPARC is better (or even competitive) with existing survival methods; it mainly demonstrates that a powerful network can fit its own pseudo-labels.\n\n5. The “Our dataset” is reconstructed from KM curves; individual covariates are then simulated to match marginal distributions (median/IQR for continuous variables, proportions for categorical). This causes problems:\n   - This procedure does not recover the joint distribution of covariates and outcomes; at best it creates synthetic patients whose marginals mimic published summaries. The relationship between covariates and survival is essentially invented by design choices, not learned from real IPD.\n   - Validation of the reconstruction is only briefly described (12-month mortality encoding, KM overlays, RMSE), and it focuses on marginal survival curves, not on the joint structure that matters for individualized prediction.\n   - Yet the paper repeatedly talks about “individualized survival modeling” and “patient-level prediction.” Given that the core dataset is synthetic and only loosely tied to real IPD, it is hard to interpret the clinical meaning of the resulting model."}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["Yes, Legal compliance (e.g., GDPR, copyright, terms of use, web crawling policies)"]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "The paper constructs an “Our Dataset” by aggregating 36 published studies.
