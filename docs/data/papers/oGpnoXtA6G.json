In this paper, we investigate exploration principles for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect new preference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in a data-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based exploration algorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in reward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can incur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this insight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy improvement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret bounds of order $T^{(\\beta+1)/(\\beta+2)}$, where $\\beta>0$ is a hyperparameter that balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift. To our knowledge, this is the first online RLHF algorithm with regret scaling polynomially in all model parameters.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)", "online exploration", "principle of optimism", "preference data"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cd4b9db176ca5e2b308c841e4f09853bec289a2e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies online RLHF and proposes a new uncertainty-based exploration framework.

The paper discovers two shortcomings of traditional exploration in preference-based RL in LLMs. First, the compared actions do not directly align with decreasing the uncertainty compared to the calibration policy, which defines the uncertainty bonus. Second, even when we compare actions from the current policy to the calibration policy, a fixed calibration policy is not enough. Both are rigorously shown from counterexamples and propositions.\n\n2. The proposed algorithm, in principle, solves both problems intuitively. A regret guarantee is given with polynomial dependence on all problem parameters. And in the regime without KL regularization, the rate matches the best known regret.\n\n3. For most parts, the paper is quite well-written."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "There are some weaknesses in this paper despite its solid contribution. I will raise my score if, in general, the inconsistency between the theoretical characterization of regret bound in some cases and the intuition of algorithm development is resolved to some extent.\n\n1. The theoretical results with KL regularization are a bit detached from the storytelling of the algorithm design. It is a bit strange in the sense that (consider the example of $\\beta = 1$ and examine the large $T$ regime) the proposed algorithm should work better than traditional RLHF exploration algorithms, from an intuitive understanding, but the regret bound looks otherwise. The new algorithm has $T^{2/3}$ while classic algorithm has $T^{1/2}$. The authors should include a deep discussion on why the exponent $\\beta / (\\beta + 2)$ appears, and explain carefully why this could or could not be fundamental.\n\n2. I feel the regret defined in the regularized objective function is not natural and does not make sense at several points. They make more sense in terms of studying the convergence of policy, but not the regret. Regret should only count the loss of utility in previous rounds and not other notions such as the KL divergence. Essentially, people want a policy with a large reward. For example, if a policy only uses the best arm $a^*$, it should be a very good policy. But in the paper's definition of regret, this policy would incur a large constant regret in some cases. On the other hand, the regret also cumulatively sums the KL distance difference of policies to the reference policy, which does not translate to any physical meaning. I understand the authors are following a line of work that defines regret as it is in the paper, but I feel there is a way to define the regret more naturally and present the results more cleanly, while still recognizing the effect of KL regularization. For example, one could let the regret be $0$ when the policy value $J(\\pi)$ is larger than the value of the optimal policy defined by the regularized problem. I do believe the guarantee in the paper could directly translate to a guarantee in an alternative definition where the regret would directly reflect the loss of utility and the distance to true optimality. This may also be part of the reason why the regret guarantee does not match classic exploration in dependence on $T$.\n\n3. The essential principle behind the adaptive calibration policy and comparison to it for exploration is very closely related to the optimism principle in dueling bandit problems, e.g., RUCB, which also uses a dynamic challenger scheme. A discussion of this literature and comparing the proposed algorithm to them would benefit the paper a lot, especially in explaining the idea and motivation behind the proposed method. That is, there is a systematic flaw in classic exploration in LLM RLHF.\n\n4. The paper should use a representative empirical study (a contextual bandit example as the model of this paper should suffice) to validate a few aspects that are not clear from the theory section. First, the regret guarantee seems to be somewhat inconsistent with the beneficiary described in the algorithm development, so empirical evidence would present a lot of insight into whether the rate is a fundamental block (as suspected by the authors), or is merely something from an analysis bottleneck, but the algorithm itself would still perform better than classic exploration. Second, it would strengthen the impact for practitioners to fix the systematic flaw discovered in this paper in LLM RLHF.\n\n5. The claim in the abstract is overly strong. Various papers study online RLHF, but in different settings where the regret (subject to different definitions) could be polynomial in all parameters. For example, plugging in a dueling bandit algorithm into an MAB setting studied in this paper with $\\beta = 0$ would lead to a regret bound that is polynomial in all parameters.
