While most CL research focuses on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, memorizing outdated knowledge can cause negative transfer, where irrelevant prior knowledge interferes with new task learning and impairs adaptability. Inspired by how the human brain selectively unlearns unimportant information to prioritize learning and to recall relevant knowledge, we explore the intuition that effective CL should not only preserve but also selectively unlearn prior knowledge that hinders adaptation. We introduce DEtect, Decide, Unlearn in Continual lEarning (DEDUCE), a novel CL framework that dynamically detects negative transfer and mitigates it by a hybrid unlearning mechanism. Specifically, we investigate two complementary negative transfer detection strategies: transferability bound and gradient conflict analysis. Based on this detection, the model decides whether to activate a Local Unlearning Module (LUM) to filter outdated knowledge before learning new task. Additionally, a Global Unlearning Module (GUM) periodically reclaims model capacity to enhance plasticity. Our experiments demonstrate that DEDUCE effectively mitigates task interference and improves overall accuracy with an average gain of up to 5.5\\% over state-of-the-art baselines.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Continual Learning"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/842eff612ebcbf90dddfe8e651145beb42fdef3e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/5bf953ba8c8d65a3496ecbbe78f72ccefc5e3a1e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces DEDUCE, a continual learning framework that detects negative transfer between tasks and mitigates it through selective unlearning.

The paper addresses an underexplored aspect of continual learning - that blindly preserving all knowledge can hurt performance. This perspective is refreshing and the neuroscience motivation about selective forgetting is compelling.\n\n2. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, testing across multiple datasets (CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, CORE-50) and showing that DEDUCE works as a plug-in enhancement for various existing methods. The consistency of improvements across different baselines suggests the approach has broad applicability.\n\n3.

There's a fundamental conceptual issue with the gradient conflict detection mechanism. Gradient conflict is an optimization phenomenon, while negative transfer concerns generalization. The paper doesn't justify why opposing gradients during training would necessarily indicate poor test-time transfer between tasks. This conflation undermines the theoretical foundation of one of the main detection strategies.\n\n2. The implementation of the transferability bound also has gaps. The use of LEEP scores as a proxy for λ isn't well justified, especially since LEEP was designed for offline transfer learning with fixed source models, not continual learning where models evolve. The connection between Eq.4 and the actual bound is hand-wavy at best.\n\n3. The paper doesn't clearly explain what constitutes **interfering knowledge** versus **useful knowledge**. How does maximizing cross-entropy loss (Eq. 8) specifically target interference rather than just degrading performance broadly? The mechanism seems too coarse-grained for selective unlearning.\n\n4. The global unlearning module appears disconnected from the negative transfer detection - it periodically resets neurons regardless of whether negative transfer is detected. This seems more like a generic plasticity mechanism than targeted unlearning.\n\n5. The paper claims that unlearning improves plasticity but provides no direct evidence for this. While they show accuracy improvements on new tasks, they don't demonstrate that this is due to increased plasticity rather than other factors. Including analysis of network capacity in [1] could help.\n\n[1] Dohare S, Hernandez-Garcia J F, Lan Q, et al. Loss of plasticity in deep continual learning[J].
