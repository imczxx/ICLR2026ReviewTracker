The self-supervised signal derives from the containment relationships in these spaces, which pulls embedded patches closer to their host container patches in the embedding space, following a training approach similar to Hyperbolic Masked Siamese Networks (HMSN). After training a shared encoder, the model leverages WSI-level subtype labels to estimate probability density ratios on nuclear embeddings, identifying nuclei with high density ratios as representative instances of that subtype.
