Specifically:\n1. FSCM employs interval type-2 Gaussian membership functions to model boundary uncertainty as a flexible spatial band, moving beyond deterministic or simple fuzzy approaches.\n2. FASM performs octave-wise spectral decomposition with learnable, spatially-adaptive weighting, aiming to capture subtle variations beyond simple high-low frequency splits.\n3. The D2PM module integrates these two streams using a Mamba-based state-space block, promoting long-range interaction between the fuzzy spatial and selected frequency features.\nThe method is evaluated on five public datasets (CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB, ETIS) and shows consistent improvement over 13 recent baselines, supporting the claim of improved boundary sharpness and generalization.\n\nMethodology:\nI have few questions in the methodology part:\n1. The mathematical derivation of the FSCM module is relatively complete, and the upper and lower bound membership functions are defined as G^+ and G^-. Their forms conform to the general theoretical framework of the Gaussian fuzzy set.\nThe core formulation in the main text (Eq.~1) defines the basic Gaussian membership function, but the symbols are ambiguous (such as $R_i'$ and $\\rho(\\cdot)$ are not clearly defined).\n2. It is not clear how the upper and lower bounds of fuzzy membership functions propagate gradients in spatial regular terms. There is a lack of feasibility explanation for closed-form gradient derivation or automatic differentiation. In theory, the backpropagation of fuzzy intervals is non-smooth, and the author does not explain how to stabilize training.\n3. The FASM's frequency-domain operating formulas (Eq.~5–7) comply with the DFT definition and show no significant logical errors.\nThe main formula (Eq.6) uses a binary mask, but AppendixA.4 uses a smoothing mask (Eq.~22), leading to inconsistent theoretical descriptions. Although smoothing masks reduce artifacts, they have not been proven to be superior to binary masks, and the computational overhead is not discussed in the derivation.\n4. The paper lacks a rigorous theoretical analysis of how FSCM and FASM synergize. The fusion process in Eq.~8 is described as a simple concatenation followed by processing in a Mamba block. This design is empirically driven rather than theoretically motivated. There is no mathematical argument explaining why this specific fusion strategy is optimal for combining fuzzy spatial and adaptive frequency features.\n\nThe paper conducts extensive experiments using five standard datasets—CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB, and ETIS to comprehensively cover mainstream benchmarks in polyp segmentation. It compares the proposed method against 13 recent state-of-the-art models, encompassing CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid, and baseline architectures. The evaluation employs a wide range of performance metrics, including Dice, IoU, wFm, Sm, maxEm, and MAE, forming a well-rounded indicator system. Through ablation studies, the FLFSC module is analyzed in configurations #1 to #4, demonstrating that its inclusion brings significant performance improvements. Additionally, submodule experiments (#5 to #7) are performed to isolate and assess the individual contributions of the FSCM, FASM, and D2PM components. Overall, while the experimental design is broad and systematic, it lacks targeted validation directly addressing the paper’s core claims.\n1.  Lack of Boundary-Specific Evaluation: one of FSFMamba's core contributions is to deal with boundary ambiguity, but all evaluations use global metrics. Targeted evaluations in fuzzy boundary areas must be added, such as using the boundary F-score metric, and tested on a subset marked with boundary uncertainties to prove that the improvement in FSCM does come from the improvement in boundary areas.\n2.  No Validation of Adaptive Frequency Selection: Experiments need to be designed to prove that FASM has indeed learned to adaptively select frequencies for different image content. It is recommended to add frequency interference experiments (such as applying different intensities of blur or noise) and demonstrate that FSFMamba is more robust than the baseline model.\n\nThe overall paper is well written, and core contributions are clearly stated in a bulleted list in the abstract and introduction. The motivation for the dual-domain approach is well-articulated.\n\n1/ Grammar and Language: The text contains numerous grammatical errors and non-idiomatic expressions (e.g., sentence fragments like \"The training process, executed on an NVIDIA A5000 GPU.\"), which detract from the paper's professionalism.\n2/ Ambiguous Definitions: The function $\\rho(\\cdot)$ in Eq. (1) is vaguely described as \"neighborhood normalization\" but is never formally defined. The symbol  $R_i'$ is also unclear.\n3/ Contextual Confusion: It is ambiguous whether the variable v in FSCM formulas represents the original pixel value or a deep feature.
