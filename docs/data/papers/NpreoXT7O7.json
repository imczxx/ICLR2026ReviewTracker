Recent works have shown that distributional constraints, such as rank deficiency constraints of the covariance matrices, can be exploited to recover the underlying causal structure involving latent variables. However, real-world data often exhibit heterogeneity/nonstationarity, which pose challenges to existing methods. In this work, we develop a principled approach for identifying the structure of partially observed linear causal models from heterogenous/nonstationary data. We first formulate a class of heterogenous/nonstationary, partially observed linear causal models and prove that their distributional constraints are equivalent to those in the homogeneous case. Building on this, we propose a novel rank deficiency test that can efficiently handle heterogenous/nonstationary data, and further establish identifiability results for recovering the causal structure involving latent variables. We also provide a method to identify which variables exhibit distribution shifts, i.e., whose causal mechanisms vary across domains. Experiments on simulated and real-world data validate our theoretical findings and the effectiveness of our method.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Causal Discovery", "Latent Variable", "Nonstationary"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/19ede73cbf61067950b82c5db99aec12bf6f13af.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a rank-based test for identifying causal structures from nonstationary data in the presence of latent variables.

This imposes strong restrictions on the functions (h) and (g), yet the authors do not discuss under what conditions these functions satisfy the Gaussian constraint.\n\nSecond, the proof of Theorem 4 is incorrect. It appears to be a direct application of Theorem 1 without additional justification. Moreover, since the proposed algorithm relies on Gaussianity, it may fail to correctly test (t)-separation (even under rank faithfulness) for non-Gaussian distributions within nonstationary POLCMs.\n\nThird, there are conceptual errors in some claims. For instance, lines 232–233 on page 5 state that “in this case, only the second-order information can be used.” This is inaccurate, as uncorrelatedness does not imply independence. Furthermore, numerous nonparametric conditional independence (CI) testing methods—such as kernel-based approaches—can go beyond simple correlation testing.\n\nLastly, the empirical validation is not convincing. The paper does not report standard evaluation metrics such as precision and recall. In addition, the authors fail to specify the functional forms of (h) and (g), which is crucial because even if (\\delta) and (\\epsilon) are Gaussian, the transformations may induce non-Gaussianity in (X). It would be insightful to evaluate the proposed method’s performance in such cases."}, "questions": {"value": "See the weakness above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "HuXgcN1dgk", "forum": "NpreoXT7O7", "replyto": "NpreoXT7O7", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13746/Reviewer_cmSR"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13746/Reviewer_cmSR"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13746/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761894240121, "cdate": 1761894240121, "tmdate": 1762924283852, "mdate": 1762924283852, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies causal discovery with latent variables under heterogeneous/nonstationary settings.

While the author has acknowledged the limitation of Gaussianity in using the rank test, its robustness remains unclear to me. For example, in Figure 11, the author tested its performance under non-Gaussian noise, but which non-Gaussian noise was used? How would the results be affected in terms of causal discovery from end-to-end? Would non-Gaussian noise also affect phase 2? I suggest the author provide more details on this point.\n\n3. The description of phase 2 is not as clear as the other parts of the paper. It was split into different sections, which makes it hard to follow. A pseudo-code or a more structured description would be helpful.\n\n4. I found some of the experimental settings insufficient. For example, the number of domains is limited to 10, and the number of samples seems to be the same across the domains. However, it was stated that the motivation of the new rank test is to deal with cases with a large number of domains and imbalanced sample sizes.
