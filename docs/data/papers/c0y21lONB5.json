Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur cubic memory and computation overhead. We introduce $\\texttt{GEM}$, a novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of modeling the entire density volume, $\\texttt{GEM}$ represents proteins with hundreds of thousands of compact 3D Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. An efficient implementation further restricts gradient computation to 3D Gaussians that contribute to each pixel, substantially reducing both memory footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, $\\texttt{GEM}$ achieves up to $48\\times$ faster training and $12\\times$ lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while improving local resolution by as much as $38.8\\\\%$.

This context should be mentioned in the introduction.\n- The description of how the Gaussians are initialized is lacking in details. The paper states that the Gaussians are initialized randomly, but doesn’t specify the sampling distribution for the Gaussian means, rotations, scales, and densities. As 3DGS is sensitive to initialization, this is important information to include.\n- Line 100-101 claims that Fourier-space cryo-EM reconstruction methods incur information loss because they “involve repeated FFTs and interpolation steps and operate on band-limited representations.” What is the evidence for this claim of information loss? Since there is presumably limited resolution on the cryo-EM detector leading to an inherent bandlimit in the measurements themselves, it’s not obvious why FFTs with interpolation on a bandlimited representation would incur any further information loss. It would also be good to specify what the “bandlimited representation” is–does this refer to a voxel grid?\n- Line 115 argues that a benefit of 3DGS as a representation is that the “gradients remain localized to the subset of primitives that actually contribute to each pixel.” While it is true that Gaussians satisfy this desirable property, a sparse voxel grid would have the same property. The same is true for the properties marked (i) and (ii) on lines 124-126.\nLine 128 mentions joint optimization over density and “imaging latents” but doesn’t specify what these latents are. I would expect these might refer to CTF or pose, but line 161 says that both of these are assumed known so it’s not clear what remaining latents need to be jointly optimized over.\n- Lines 162-167 explain the difference between Fourier-space and real-space reconstruction. Since this is part of the method section, it is important to specify that the proposed method is real-space; ideally the description of Fourier-space reconstruction would not be in the methods section as it could confuse a reader as to which method is used here.\n- There are some typos, mostly repeated and missing words/phrases but also some typos at the letter level. See lines 191, 192, 195, 198, 271, 304, 360.\n- Figure 3a is confusing/misleading. It makes it look like you start with a known protein density and use that to initialize the Gaussians. But in reality the Gaussians are initialized randomly and then optimized to fit the density.\n- The paragraph surrounding equation 8 describes efficient gradient computation as part of the method. While this is important for computational and memory efficiency, it is not clear what (if any) aspects of this computation are novel to GEM versus reused from 3DGS. For example, equation 8 describes thresholding each Gaussian into an ellipsoid to enable skipping some Gaussians that do not meaningfully influence a given pixel projection; this is exactly the same thresholding that 3DGS does for the same purpose. The only difference I am aware of is that 3DGS uses perspective projection whereas cryo-EM uses orthographic projection, but that does not seem to be the focus of this section so I am left wondering what is the novelty in the efficient computation.\n- Lines 415-417, and line 446, describe the Nyquist-Shannon resolution limit as based on the voxel size of the protein density map. I have two questions about this. (1) What voxels are being discussed? The proposed method does not use voxels, nor is there a ground truth voxel grid that is mentioned. (2) Line 446 claims that GEM’s average local resolution is better than the Nyquist-Shannon limit. How is this possible?\n- Section 4.4 introduces FSLC, but doesn’t really explain how it differs from GSFSC. From the names I gather that the difference is comparison on Fourier slices instead of Fourier shells, but the reader shouldn’t need to infer.\n- Section 4.5 describes an ablation study involving isotropic scaling, in which S_i = s_i I. However, instead of allowing s_i to be optimized over (which would still enforce isotropic scaling since s_i is scalar), this ablation study forces s_i to equal the distance between the i’th Gaussian and its nearest neighbor. I think this would be a more informative ablation study if s_i were allowed to optimize, while still being enforced to be isotropic."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to questions embedded in weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "VBluEEZjxK", "forum": "c0y21lONB5", "replyto": "c0y21lONB5", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6298/Reviewer_VL78"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6298/Reviewer_VL78"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6298/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761763439438, "cdate": 1761763439438, "tmdate": 1762918601560, "mdate": 1762918601560, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents GEM, a new framework for efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Several technical explanations are hard to follow, particularly the definitions of rays and the sentence spanning L204–L205, which require clearer formulation. A thorough language revision is essential to improve accessibility and ensure technical accuracy.\n2. **Unclear Necessity of Gaussian Sorting.** The decision to sort 3D Gaussians along the projection axis (Sec. 3.2) is not well justified. In principle, sorting should not affect the final result of the projection integral, yet it introduces nontrivial computational overhead, especially in CUDA kernels. The authors should explain the rationale behind this step—e.g., whether it serves numerical stability, differentiability, or rasterization ordering—and ideally show an ablation demonstrating that removing sorting does not harm reconstruction quality.\n3. **Inconsistent Quantitative and Qualitative Results.** The reported quantitative results (Tables 2 and 3) appear unusually strong and potentially inconsistent with the qualitative reconstructions shown in Figures 5 and 6. For example, the sharp improvement in GSFSC for EMPIAR-10076 near 4–5 Å seems atypical and lacks discussion. Meanwhile, the visual reconstructions in Figure 6 appear smoother and less detailed than those from CryoDRGN or CryoSPARC, especially in α-helix regions. This suggests that GEM may underfit the true density due to the strong structural prior imposed by 3DGS (insufficient number of 3DGS may cause this). A useful diagnostic would be to increase the number of Gaussians (e.g., from 1 k to 10 k) and analyze whether this reduces oversmoothing. Additionally, experimenting with more advanced loss functions—such as those used in RELION or other likelihood-based formulations—could help recover finer local features. Overall, the current performance claims are not fully convincing without further analysis of these discrepancies.\n4. **Lack of Details on the Number and Impact of 3D Gaussians.** The paper does not specify how many 3D Gaussians are used in training or how this parameter affects speed, memory usage, and reconstruction quality. Since this is central to both the efficiency and fidelity of GEM, the authors should include an ablation or scaling study to clarify this relationship.\n\n## Minor Weaknesses\n\n1. L165: The slice operation in Fourier space still requires instantiating the entire 3D density volume because the slicing orientation is unknown a priori.\n\n2. L192: “density-based, density-based” → should be “density-based.”\n\n3. L195: The phrase “Explicit Integration for XXX” appears incomplete and should be clarified.\n\n4. L204–L205: The sentence is difficult to interpret, and the definition of r is missing, despite being fundamental to the imaging model—please rewrite and define it formally.\n\n5. L243: The phrase “CTF-corrected” should be replaced with “CTF-corrupted” or “CTF-applied,” as no correction occurs in this step.\n\n6. L198: Typo — “3D 3D” → “3D.”\n\n7.

To evaluate and show that GEM can achieve better results compared to other methods, the paper heavily used metrics (including GSFSC, local resolution, FSLC) that assess the self consistency between the two half maps. This is wrong. Here the methods themselves, will lead to spurious correlation between the half maps due to the induction bias of the methods. Therefore, GSFSC, FSLC and local resolution are all hacked and unreliable. This can be reflected in the results by: 1) GSFSC curves never reaches zero and even increase by a lot at very high frequency (Fig. 5), 2) Final resolution (0.143 cutoff) almost reach Nyquist while the density maps do not support such high resolution, 3) Local resolutions are severely overestimated while the maps lack structural details compared to other methods (Fig. 6), 4) even when the particle poses are the same, FSLC are quite different (Fig. 7). All of these show that half maps based metrics are all over estimated.\n\n- The author should also compare 3DGS with the traditional reconstruction method using (weighted) back-projection (WBP) in Fourier space. The comparison with cryoSPARC is unfair, since both ab initio and homogenous refinement in cryoSPARC refine particle poses, while other methods do not. The easiest way to compare is reconstruct only with given poses. In RELION, you can use the `relion_reconstruct` command. Since WBP is simply performing back-projection with accumulation, computation can be easily paralleled across particles and it is usually very fast even without a GPU.\n\n- Given the previous points, the motivation of using 3DGS into cryo-EM, although interesting and insightful, seems very unclear to me. \n\nMinor: In Fig. 6, the threshold level for EMPIAR-10005 map is too low (probably also 10049 as well)."}, "questions": {"value": "- Just for clarification purpose, for both cryoDRGN and GEM experiments, the poses of the particles are given, correct?
