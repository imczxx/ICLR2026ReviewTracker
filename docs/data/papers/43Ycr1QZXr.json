Leveraging self-supervised DINO embeddings, EFS first partitions the video stream into visually homogeneous temporal segments, which serve as proxies for semantic events.

These anchors act as structural priors that guide a global refinement stage using an adaptive Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) scheme. This pipeline ensures the final keyframe set jointly optimizes for event coverage, query relevance, and visual diversity. As a $\\textbf{training-free, plug-and-play module,}$ EFS can be seamlessly integrated into off-the-shelf LVLMs, yielding substantial gains on challenging video understanding benchmarks.

Similar “event-aware” or structure-guided frame selection frameworks have appeared in AKS (Tang et al., 2025), $T^{*}$ (Ye et al., 2025), Logic‑in‑Frames (Guo et al., 2025), mDP3 (Sun et al., 2025), VSI (He et al., 2025) and Nar-KFC (Fang et al., 2025). The adaptive MMR is a useful tweak but not a conceptual breakthrough. The overall framework feels like a careful integration rather than a fundamentally new idea.\n\n- **Lack of Theoretical or Analytical Insight.** The method is largely empirical and heuristic. There is no principled analysis or theoretical grounding to justify why event segmentation + adaptive MMR leads to better reasoning beyond intuitive explanations. A formal examination of coverage–diversity trade-offs or selection optimality is missing.\n\n- **Heavy Reliance on Handcrafted Hyperparameters.** The approach depends on manually chosen values for event number 𝑀, relaxation factor 𝛼, and fixed frame sampling rate (1 fps). These hyperparameters are dataset-specific (Appendix C.2), raising concerns about reproducibility and generalization to other video domains or tasks.\n\n- **No End-to-End Learning or Adaptivity.** Although the training-free nature is a strength for efficiency, it also restricts adaptivity. The pipeline cannot learn task- or model-specific cues, limiting scalability to more complex or diverse LVLM architectures. The authors themselves acknowledge this in the “Future Work” section (B.2).\n\n- **Ambiguous Distinction from Shot Detection.** The “event partitioning” step relies on detecting local minima of temporal similarity curves, which is conceptually close to traditional shot boundary detection. While Table 3 provides some empirical differentiation, the conceptual novelty over shot detection remains insufficiently justified.\n\n- **Limited Exploration Beyond QA.** The paper’s experiments focus exclusively on multiple-choice video QA. The method’s claimed generality (e.g., for captioning, summarization, or temporal reasoning) is not demonstrated, leaving the broader utility speculative.\n\n- **Missing Analysis on Failure Cases and Selection Behavior.** While qualitative examples are shown, there is no systematic analysis of when EFS fails—e.g., for videos with smooth transitions, repetitive scenes, or motion-heavy segments where visual similarity is unreliable. Understanding such behaviors would strengthen the paper’s empirical claims.\n\n- **Inter-module Independence and Information Loss.** The three stages (DINOv2 partition → BLIP2-ITM anchor → adaptive MMR) are executed sequentially with no feedback loop. Errors from earlier stages (e.g., missegmented events or irrelevant anchors) can propagate without correction. An end-to-end or iterative variant might better capture dependencies.\n\n- **No Statistical Significance or Variance Reporting.** The paper reports average accuracies but lacks variance, confidence intervals, or statistical tests across runs. This makes it hard to judge the reliability of reported 1–2% gains, especially for large models with stochastic inference."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The novelty of the proposed event partitioning method seems somewhat overstated. Since similarity scores from Dinov2 may not fully capture semantic-level changes (i.e., shifts in action or plot), the method appears to focus mainly on low-level changes like camera cuts and obvious scene transitions. As Figure 4 suggests, the partitioning is primarily based on simple, low-level units rather than high-level events. I would suggest that the authors visualize more examples to clarify the partitioning process. Moreover, the main contribution to the final performance seems to stem from BLIP2-ITM rather than the event partitioning. This is supported by Table 2, which shows that a random partition still achieves good performance, while the random anchor baseline performs poorly.\n- Computational cost. The preprocessing step (feature extraction with DINOv2 and BLIP2) introduces more latency, which may be a concern for real-time applications despite being an offline cost. For hours-long videos, the problem becomes crucial. \n- Moreover, the performance is tied to potential biases of DINOv2 and BLIP2.\n- Hyperparameter sensitivity. The method relies on several hyperparameters (e.g., event number M, relaxation factor α) whose optimal values vary across datasets. This requires tuning and could hinder out-of-the-box usability. How to adaptively determine such factors?\n- Limited gains for genral query.
