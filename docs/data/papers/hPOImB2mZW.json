Existing works have focused on autoformulating mathematical optimization problems for $\\textit{one-shot}$ decision-making. However, many real-world decision-making problems are $\\textit{sequential}$, best modeled as $\\textit{Markov decision processes}$ (MDPs). MDPs introduce unique challenges for autoformulation, including a significantly larger formulation search space, and for computing and interpreting the optimal policy. In this work, we address these challenges in the context of queueing problems---central to domains such as healthcare and logistics---which often require substantial technical expertise to formulate correctly. We propose a novel operator-theoretic autoformulation framework using LLMs. Our approach captures the underlying decision structure of queueing problems through constructing the Bellman equation as a graph of $\\textit{operators}$, where each operator is an $\\textit{interpretable}$ transformation of the value function corresponding to certain $\\textit{event}$ (e.g., arrival, departure, routing). Theoretically, we prove a universal three-level operator-graph topology covering a broad class of MDPs, significantly shrinking the formulation search space. Algorithmically, we propose customized Monte Carlo tree search to build operator graphs while incorporating self-evaluation, solver feedback, and intermediate syntax checking for early assessment, and present a provably low-complexity algorithm that automatically identifies structures of the optimal policy (e.g., threshold-based), accelerating downstream solving. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in formulating queueing problems and identifying structural results.", "tldr": "We present an LLM-driven method that autoformulates MDPs from natural-language descriptions, achieving interpretability, accuracy, and reduced complexity by operator-graph Bellman representation, tailored MCTS and a low-complexity algorithm.", "keywords": ["Autoformulation", "autoformalism", "large language model", "Markov decision process", "queueing systems"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1177cd140d6b73614f50a533185772cf102c2cb3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "A very interesting paper proposing an automated approach to translate and solve MDPs formulated as natural language descriptions within the domain of queueing theory.
