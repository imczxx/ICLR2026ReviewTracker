Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guarantees, but in time-dependent settings common to physics and engineering, these guarantees can break down, leading to systematic undercoverage. We study this problem in the context of surrogate models for time-dependent physical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). We prove that in a function space setting, distributions at arbitrarily close times can be mutually singular, making exact coverage guarantees impossible. As a solution, we facilitate weighted conformal prediction for a broad class of PDE problems arising from discretized models and validate these results in experiments. While prior work often sidesteps time dependence—by assuming exchangeability, focusing on short horizons, or ignoring long-term deployment—we address it directly by providing exact coverage guarantees through reweighting calibration scores.", "tldr": "We derive weighted conformal prediction for linear time-dependent PDEs, restoring exact coverage for surrogate models.", "keywords": ["Uncertainty Quantification", "Neural Operators", "Conformal Prediction", "PDE Surrogates", "Scientific Machine Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/eeaca463ee63ff6bf309031b0c5df2e93f4f4803.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a9647b7831dec8c80cb4f6e6a96d2961f2e9cd2a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Spatiotemporal PDEs are being increasingly solved with neural operators.

However, the approach of Barbet et. al only establishes that $\\mathcal{P}(Y\\in\\mathcal{C}(X))\\ge 1-\\alpha-\\sum_i w_i d_{TV}(z, z^i)$, which is a lower bound. How can we say anything more strongly than just making claims of this lower bound here?\n\nMoreover, this then motivates studying this problem in a finite-dimensional discretized form. This, however, then just becomes a standard, finite-dimensional time series problem, so I do not see how this becomes any different from a typical finite-dimensional conformal time series problem. Also, Theorem 4.2 appears to be a standard proof from SDEs, so I do not see why it and its proof are provided in the main body of the paper.\n\nFinally, the experimental results appear to be not very compelling: many times, WCP appears to produce extremely conservative prediction regions, having a coverage of 1.0 or close to it at desired coverage levels well below this. The other methods, in contrast, appropriately hit 0.90 initially."}, "questions": {"value": "1. How does this particular setting differ from a general time series conformal prediction problem after the PDE has been discretized? Are there particular structures that you can uniquely leverage to develop a method in this setting that cannot be more generally applied?

The empirical results seem to indicate over-coverage even before the time steps progress very far.\n\n3.

Theorem 4.1 proves that for the heat equation with Gaussian initial conditions, the TV distance between solution distributions at any two distinct time points is maximal (equals 1). Theorem 4.2 shows that for discretized linear PDEs with Gaussian initial conditions, the solution distribution at any time t remains Gaussian, with explicitly computable mean and covariance. These two results are not particular novel for PDEs. The authors' method, then, directly applies Barber et al. 2023's weighted conformal prediction algorithm using the likelihoods. The coverage guarantees are from Barber 2023. I fail to see how this algorithm is a novel contribution. \n\n- The scope is limited. The algorithm only applies to _linear_ PDEs with _Gaussian_ (and location-scale) initial conditions, but most physical systems of interest of UQ have nonlinear dynamics (Navier-Stokes, reaction-diffusion with nonlinear terms, etc.). The proposed algorithm require explicit probabilities which makes it not extendable to the more general case. \n\n- Significant weakness and ambiguity in the experiment section. This includes:\n    - What is the target coverage? Why is the target in Fig 3 set at 90% but the target for WCP said to be 99%? Why does WCP's line disappear half way through the horizon? What is $n_\\infty$ in Table 1 and how should we interpret it?\n    - Limited experiment setups: only linear, univariate, synthetic experiments. This is a result of the nature and assumption made by the method, but with this set of experiments it's not very convincing that this algorithm is useful in practice.  \n    - Lack of comparison to baselines, and discussion of literature. From the PDE literature, there are works that provide probabilistic forecasts (for example [1,2], and the baselines in LSCI). From the CP literature, there are a swath of works that handles time series distribution shift that does not require explicit covariates or local exchangeability [3-6]. They should be compared to show what are the advantages of your algorithm, or at least discussed w.r.t. why they are not applicable to your setup. \n    - It is also questionable that WCP over-covers by so much, often achieving 1.0 coverage with infinite bands. While I respect the authors' honest reporting, this is a significant limitation on the usability of the UQ bands. UQ's goal is calibration and the tendency to over-cover is not desirable. Can you show results of both 90\\% and 99\\% target coverage?\n    - Some qualitative plots of UQ bands (similar to figure 1) will also help the presentation of results.  \n\n[1] Yang, Liu, Xuhui Meng, and George Em Karniadakis. \"B-PINNs: Bayesian physics-informed neural networks for forward and inverse PDE problems with noisy data.\" Journal of Computational Physics 425 (2021): 109913.\n\n[2] Bülte, Christopher, Philipp Scholl, and Gitta Kutyniok. \"Probabilistic neural operators for functional uncertainty quantification.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2502.12902 (2025).\n\n[3] Gibbs, Isaac, and Emmanuel Candes. \"Adaptive conformal inference under distribution shift.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 1660-1672\n\n[4] Angelopoulos, Anastasios, Emmanuel Candes, and Ryan J.
