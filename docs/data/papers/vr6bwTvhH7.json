To address this, we introduce DST-Part3D, a 3D semantic part dataset with $3,300$ fine-grained 3D part annotations across $475$ shapes from $50$ object categories, paired with $125,000$ realistic synthetic images. DST-Part3D enables training and evaluation of 3D part detection from images, 2D part segmentation via projection, and benchmarking of 3D correspondence quality through transferred part labels. Using this dataset, we develop Part321, an algorithm that recognizes 3D parts in images using only one annotated mesh per category. Part321 establishes mesh-to-mesh and mesh-to-image correspondences to propagate part pseudo-labels across instances, allowing effective 3D part detector training with minimal supervision. Experiments demonstrate that Part321 outperforms previous methods on 3D and 2D part detection tasks. In addition, we use DST-Part3D to analyze the mesh-to-mesh correspondence obtained by different methods leveraging transferred 3d part labels, highlighting the key challenge in 3D part correspondence, which provides insight into future work.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Vision", "3D from Single Image", "3D Part recognition"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/15a4e8bd9a4453de45d3bf078f29ce634d77c7e4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e0233fe57edc1f1fbe901d235887db38bc9858f0.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces DST-Part3D, a dataset pairing 475 CAD shapes across 50 rigid categories with ~3,300 fine-grained 3D part annotations and 125,000 realistic synthetic images; it further proposes Part321, a one-shot 3D part recognition method from a single image that builds (i) mesh-to-mesh correspondence via vertex features and a deformation network, and (ii) mesh-to-image correspondence via contrastive, feature-level render-and-compare."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The paper does not discuss or compare against prior 3D datasets with part annotations. It is unclear what makes this dataset unique, especially given existing 3D part datasets derived from ShapeNet. It is also unclear whether the limited scale and diversity are sufficient to support the paper’s claims and to enable meaningful follow-up work.\n\n2. **Methodological limitations.** The proposed one-shot method has several inherent limitations:\n   (a) It cannot handle arbitrary open-world categories; it requires a template mesh per category and category-wise training.\n   (b) The deformation network does not support correspondences between meshes with different topologies (e.g., swivel chairs with four wheels vs. six wheels).\n   (c) The provided 2D images are object-centric and free of occlusions.

Several symbols are introduced without proper explanation. The overall presentation makes it difficult to follow the technical details. For example, Section 4.3 is not self-contained; despite considerable effort, it remains unclear how the components interact and what exactly is happening in that section.\n\n4. **Experimental setup and terminology.** The experimental setup is insufficiently explained, and key terms are used inconsistently.

Please use consistent terminology and rigorously define each task, including inputs, outputs, and metric computations. Also specify how baseline methods are adapted to your evaluation protocol. For instance, for Wonder3D, how is object pose obtained? For PartField, how is it adapted to the one-shot setting? These details are currently missing.\n\n5. **Choice of baselines.** The set of baselines appears outdated.
