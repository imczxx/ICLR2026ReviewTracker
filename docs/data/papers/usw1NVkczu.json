Yet, despite the promise of this paradigm, it remains challenging to achieve due to algorithms not being able to learn effectively from the autonomous data. For example, prior works have applied imitation learning and filtered imitation learning methods to the batch online RL problem, but these algorithms often fail to efficiently improve from the autonomously collected data or converge quickly to a suboptimal point. This raises the question of what matters for effective batch online reinforcement learning in robotics. Motivated by this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of three axes---(i) algorithm class, (ii) policy extraction methods, and (iii) policy expressivity---and analyze how these axes affect performance and scaling with the amount of autonomously collected data. Through our analysis, we make several observations. First, we observe that the use of Q-functions to guide batch online RL significantly improves performance over imitation-based methods. Building on this, we show that an implicit method of policy extraction---via choosing the best action in the distribution of the policy---is necessary over traditional explicit policy extraction methods from offline RL. Next, we show that an expressive policy class is preferred over less expressive policy classes. Based on this analysis, we propose a general recipe for effective batch online RL. We then show a simple addition to the recipe, namely using temporally-correlated noise to obtain more diversity, results in further performance gains. Our recipe obtains significantly better performance and scaling compared to prior methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "autonomous improvement", "imitation leaning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/890b9cf6525c7071a12a1611d266c5971aac15d6.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/65b326724bc74ee3be3f37e575ed2527c24a2c8f.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies batch online RL setting for robot manipulation, where a fixed policy collects large batches of autonomous rollouts, then the policy (and optionally a Q-function) is retrained offline before the next deployment.

The value-based RL one trains an additional Q function guiding policy rollout only. If this is the case, why does the initial performance of value-based RL differ from the IL baseline when both of them learn from $\\mathcal{D}_0$?\n- In Section 4.2, what is the training objective when the authors apply AWR to a diffusion-based policy with the DDPM objective? Did the authors reweigh the MSE by the advantages, like how IDQL does in their paper (Appendix F.5)?\n- In terms of the real-world task, when applying the Steering baseline, why did the authors not train the Q function in a batch online RL manner? I am aware of the Steering paper’s setting and how it is deployed in this paper, but a reasonable variant should consider iteratively improving the Q function on new online rollouts (e.g., N=3, M=30). This also benefits the understanding of whether the performance bottleneck results from the value learning for online batch RL.\n\n__Some arguments made in the paper were not well-supported:__\n\n- In my opinion, the central claim of this paper is: “policies that not only can collect diverse trajectories but also can learn from this diversity matter for batch online RL” (Lines 064-066). Intuitively, I agree that expressive RL policies with value guidance should satisfy this requirement and thus work well for batch online RL. However, the normalized score is an indirect metric supporting this claim. Like Figure 4, I expected to see more direct quantitative analysis or visualization of the diversity of the collected data in each iteration, along the three proposed axes. For example, although an implicit Gaussian policy performs worse than the recipe, showing it might be able to collect relatively more diverse data for Threading and Square tasks can actually enhance the central claim.\n- The argument made in Lines 346-351 is not supported with empirical evidence. Could the authors confirm whether implicit policy extraction can generate and leverage more diverse data? Could the authors confirm that explicit policy extraction cannot adapt policy to value functions trained on new data? Is the value learning the performance bottleneck, or the policy learning? Is the data collection the bottleneck?\n- In Lines 395-402, could the authors provide direct evidence showing that an expressive policy can capture multimodality in action distribution in the initial iteration? How does the ability of modelling action distribution change across the iterations?\n\n__Despite applying existing methods to a new problem setup, I felt the novelty of this paper is limited.__\n\n- First of all, although I agree that diverse data collection and learning from diverse data are essential for batch online RL, I think the community has been aware of their necessity for offline RL, imitation learning, and online RL. Early prior study have shown their importance in each setup, like [1, 2, 3, 4]. Given that the batch online RL setup could be treated as consecutive offline RL or “low update-to-data ratio” online RL, what are the other unique insights the reader may grasp?\n- For the second aspect of policy extraction, I recall that IDQL found that explicit policy extraction via AWR does not bring benefit to the DDPM-trained diffusion policy.\n\n__Minor Issues:__\n\n- In equation (1), the V function should be parameterized by $\\psi$.\n- In Line 292, it should be “the amount of data collected”.\n- In Line 261, the notation of N is abused.\n- In Lines 147-149, the authors argue that online RL risks of unsafe and unstable behavior. I wonder if in batch online RL, the agent also risks this since it is possible to conduct unsafe and unstable behavior during the data collection stage if the offline training was not sufficient. But I agree that this should happen less than the online RL paradigm.\n- Compared with the network used for diffusion-based policy, the network used for the Gaussian policy in Section 4.3 is smaller (3-layer MLP). Although I do not expect that increasing the model size for the Gaussian policy can significantly improve performance, the authors should mention in the main body this experimental detail.\n\n\n__References:__\n\n[1] Don't Change the Algorithm, Change the Data: Exploratory Data for Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\n[2] Behavior Transformers: Cloning k modes with one stone\n\n[3] Synthetic Experience Replay\n\n[4] The Primacy Bias in Deep Reinforcement Learning"}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the questions above __\"Minor Issues\"__ part."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "sDjXXKHrrF", "forum": "usw1NVkczu", "replyto": "usw1NVkczu", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14640/Reviewer_MA26"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14640/Reviewer_MA26"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14640/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761752541281, "cdate": 1761752541281, "tmdate": 1762925014090, "mdate": 1762925014090, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the problem of \"batch online reinforcement learning,\" a paradigm where a robotic policy is improved by collecting large batches of autonomous data and then performing offline updates.
