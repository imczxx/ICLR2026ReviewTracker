However, such models require a significant number of function evaluations (NFEs) during sampling, leading to costly inference. Consequently, quality-preserving fast sampling methods that require fewer NFEs have been an active area of research. However, prior training-free sampling methods fail to simultaneously address two key challenges: the stiffness of the ODE (i.e., the non-straightness of the velocity field) and dependence on the semi-linear structure of the DM ODE (which limits their direct applicability to flow-matching models). In this work, we introduce the Stabilized Taylor Orthogonal Runge–Kutta (STORK) method, addressing both design concerns. We demonstrate that STORK consistently improves the quality of diffusion and flow-matching sampling for image and video generation.", "tldr": "We propose a new training-free fast sampler for diffusion models by resolving both stiffness and structure-dependence.", "keywords": ["diffusion model", "fast sampling method", "stabilized Runge--Kutta", "training-free"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8e86ffc77f6f7ea0f87acbac89506624af54d398.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/5d2238dc8d5b74c031254482add98bb453fea0da.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the challenges of non-straight velocity fields and the dependence on the semi-linear structure in diffusion model ODEs, which make fast but quality-preserving sampling difficult.

The paper motivates the proposed method by claiming diffusion models exhibit stiff dynamics, but this is not properly justified empirically or theoretically. There is insufficient evidence presented that diffusion models are actually stiff, making the motivation unclear. Table 1 shows that the STORK-4 is significantly better than SRK4. More intriguingly, even with 50 NFE of SRK4, its performance is around 6.167 for FID score which is lower than its STORK-4 at 10 NFE. This raises the question of whether SRK4 is a good solver for diffusion models and whether the stiffness assumption is valid.\n2. Theorem 1 establishes the theoretical guarantee of STORK-4 based on its approximation quality to SRK4. However, it is not clear whether the theory actually supports the empirical finding that 10 NFE of STORK-4 can be better than 50 NFE of SRK4. Additionally, since the goal is to achieve fewer NFE in sampling, does the asymptotic rate (provided in Theorem 1) even matter in practice? The constant in front of the rate may matter more for the low NFE regime that this paper targets. Theorem 1 does not help understand the performance of few-step sampling, leaving the empirical gains unexplained by the theoretical analysis.\n3. STORK-4 has many hyperparameters, which makes it unclear whether the observed performance gains come from genuine improvements or from more extensive hyperparameter search. Maybe fix a parameter like s=9 suggested in the paper and report the results for all experiments could help understand the performance gains."}, "questions": {"value": "- Can you clarify why other methods, like the DPM solver, cannot apply to flow matching?

This is an interesting observation, but the reason is not analyzed in depth. If SRK is considered a common method for solving stiff ODEs, why would it not work in this case? Using Taylor expansion and Adams-Bashforth approximation is common in previous flow ODE solvers, so plugging this into SRK seems to make it less unique.\n- I wonder how the methods are categorized in Fig. 4. In particular, UniPC, which works very well in practice, is categorized as not stiff, whereas DPM-Solver is considered stiff. Yet it is clear that UniPC can be considered as an extension of DPM-Solver with an additional corrector. Please check this carefully.\n- Another claimed advantage of the proposed method is structure-independency. However, in most cases, structure-dependency of ODE solvers is not really an issue in practice. It is very trivial to adopt diffusion solvers using exponential integrators for flow models by rescaling the noise schedule and reparametrizing the prediction format.\n- Why is FID getting worse with more NFEs? (fig. 6, Table 6, 10, 11). This behavior is clearly different from DPM-Solver and UniPC, which often converge monotonically.
