The dataset includes over 175,000\nhalf-hourly spot prices from New South Wales, Australia (2015–2024) and curated market-news\nsummaries from WattClarity. We frame the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting, using multimodal input,\nincluding lagged prices, vectorized news for classical and state-of-the-arts time-series forecasting\nmodels, and prompt-engineered structured contexts for LLMs. Our datasets yields 3.6k multimodal\nprompt-output pairs for LLM evaluation using specific templates. In our comprehensive benchmarks,\nwe identify that news features yield marginal benefits at best and can even degrade performance across\ntraditional statistical, machine learning, deep learning and state of the art time series forecasting\nmodels. This pattern holds for open and closed-source LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro,\nMeta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1 and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct. It also leads to frequent\nhallucinations in some closed-source models, such as fabricated or malformed price sequences.
