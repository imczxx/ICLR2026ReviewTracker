While deep generative models have shown promise for peptide design, existing approaches are often structure-centric and therefore generate sequences and structures in a decoupled manner, failing to ensure that designs are simultaneously physically stable, evolutionarily plausible, and internally coherent. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PepTri, a novel diffusion framework that addresses this by jointly generating peptide sequences and 3D structures within a unified, SE(3)-equivariant latent space. Our proposed model integrates three complementary guidance signals during the generative process: (i) physics-informed guidance via differentiable molecular mechanics to ensure structural stability and realism; (ii) evolutionary guidance to bias sequences toward conserved, functional motifs; and (iii) mutual information guidance to explicitly maximize sequence-structure coherence. This tri-guided approach ensures the generative process is steered by biophysical laws, biological priors, and information-theoretic alignment in tandem. Extensive evaluations on challenging peptide-protein design benchmarks, cross-domain (PepBench, LNR) and in-domain (PepBDB), demonstrate that PepTri substantially outperforms strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in binding affinity, structural accuracy, and design diversity. Our results establish that integrating these complementary signals directly into the denoising process is crucial for generating viable, high-quality peptide medicines.", "tldr": "Designing peptides with tri-guidance diffusion model via physics, evolution, and mutual information", "keywords": ["sequence-structure peptide design", "all-atom", "guided latent diffusion"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7fb4834d13b6eb584e8abf2363eba7fd14a1b306.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces PepTri, a novel diffusion-based framework for joint sequence-structure peptide design.

This tri-guidance setup goes beyond traditional structure-focused pipelines and post-generation checks, offering a more integrated way to ensure the generated peptides are physically and biologically consistent. The use of mutual information to explicitly link sequence and structure is conceptually clear and feels natural for this type of task. Overall, the framework is well designed: it uses an SE(3)-equivariant encoder–decoder with latent diffusion, and the guidance is smoothly applied at every denoising step. The experiments are thorough, with detailed ablations showing how each component contributes to improvements across metrics like Delta G, DockQ, and Contact-F1. The paper is also clearly written, with figures that make the flow of the three guidance types easy to understand. Results on benchmarks such as PepBench, LNR, and PepBDB show consistent and meaningful gains—for example, the success rate with Delta G < 0 rises from about 0.37–0.55 in simpler versions to 0.58 in the full model—demonstrating strong potential for real-world peptide design where both physical realism and biological relevance matter."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Physics term scope and calibration:\nThe paper combines bond, angle, clash, and van der Waals terms into a differentiable physical energy on the peptide side, but it’s not clear how receptor interactions are handled during guidance.
