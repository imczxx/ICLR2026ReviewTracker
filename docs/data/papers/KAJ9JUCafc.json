While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm. To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the lens of *Orlicz geometric structure*, which employs convex functions to capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in optimal transport theory---particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and generalized Sobolev transport---that have proven instrumental in advancing machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces to a simple *univariate optimization* problem, achieving remarkably computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and several tasks in topological data analysis.", "tldr": "We leverage convex functions to generalize Sobolev IPM beyond Lp geometric structure, and propose a novel regularization for the generalized Sobolev IPM to compute it efficiently.", "keywords": ["Sobolev IPM", "Orlicz-Wasserstein", "generalized Sobolev transport", "Orlicz geometric structure", "Lp structure", "probability measures supported on a graph", "Orlicz-Sobolev norm", "Musielak norm"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e3cb49d6e75efae932647f2a32acb4b86397d600.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4eb5b78448d60e7da67277cc1c1b23e51b15cf25.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper aims to generalize the Sobolev IPM [1] using the idea of an Orlicz geometric structure, which has previously been used to extend the Wasserstein distance on L_p spaces to the Orlicz–Wasserstein (OW) distance.

Under this assumption, the computation of the optimal transport plan, required in Wasserstein or OW distances, can be avoided, similar to the case where a closed-form solution exists for the Wasserstein distance in the one-dimensional setting. This advantage has also been extensively exploited in several prior works [1, 2, 3]."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- At first glance, I thought this paper extends [1], in the sense that the Sobolev IPM in [1] is defined on an L_p geometric structure, while the proposed method generalizes it by replacing the L_p structure with an Orlicz geometric one. However, I found that the method called generalized Sobolev transport (GST, [2]) also employs an Orlicz geometric structure to generalize L_p. Moreover, my understanding is that the proposed method is essentially a weighted version of [2], that is, it introduces weights into the definition of the Orlicz–Sobolev space, resulting in what the authors call the generalized Sobolev IPM with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) in Eq. (11). I cannot see why [1] is cited in the abstract but not [2], since [2] appears to be more closely related. \n- regarding the weighting functions, [2] fixes the weights as w(x) = 1+\\lambda(\\Lmabda(x)), while in this paper, the weights are defined as w(x) = 1+\\lambda(\\Lmabda(x))/\\lambda(G). A question arises: is it possible to use other weight functions, such as user-defined functions. Furthermore, as the proposed method is a weighted variant of GST [2], the paper should include a more careful discussion on the choice and impact of the weighting functions.\n- In the experiments, the authors compare OW (without graph structure), GST [2], and the proposed GSI. It appears that GST and GSI achieve comparable performance in terms of both accuracy and running time. In other words, as mentioned above, although the proposed GSI is the weighted version of GST [2], the paper fails to clearly explain what benefits the weighting scheme of GSI .\n- Overall, the paper is not written in a way that is accessible to those who are not familiar with this research line. The proposed method seems to be a weighted variant of [2], but the motivation and practical advantages of introducing this specific weighting scheme remain unclear.\n\n[1] Tam et al., Scalable Sobolev IPM for Probability Measures on a Graph, ICML2025. \n\n[2] Tam et al., Generalized Sobolev Transport for Probability Measures on a Graph, ICML2024 \n\n[3] Tam et al., Sobolev transport: A scalable metric for probability measures with graph metric, AISTATS2022"}, "questions": {"value": "See the weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "jP6KNjXzkg", "forum": "KAJ9JUCafc", "replyto": "KAJ9JUCafc", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17917/Reviewer_BDM1"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17917/Reviewer_BDM1"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17917/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761580001499, "cdate": 1761580001499, "tmdate": 1762927733792, "mdate": 1762927733792, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI) with Musielak regularization for measuring distances between probability measures on graph metric spaces.

Would it be easier to reuse prior art in this line of research rather than potentially restating similar results?\n\n- The empirical benefit of the Orlicz generalization (using $\\Phi_1, \\Phi_2$) over the $L^1$-like $\\Phi_0$ case seems minimal. Can you provide evidence of (or hypothesize about) specific applications, graph types, or N-functions where this generalization would provide a clear and significant practical advantage?\n\n- To improve readability, you might consider moving Sec. 4 to the appendix, keeping only the major Theorems.
