We present FOR-Prompting (From Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1 judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (≈19\\% accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.", "tldr": "We propose FOR-Prompting, an asymmetric prompting method where an Objectioner asks question-style objections to elicit the Defender’s self-revision.", "keywords": ["multi-agent prompting", "external questioning", "LLM", "reasoning", "prompting protocol"], "primary_area": "neurosymbolic & hybrid AI systems (physics-informed, logic & formal reasoning, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1094fe474ec8512c28b5f96d90ad7b4e5dac22d4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces FOR-Prompting, a novel, model-agnostic prompting protocol that structures LLM reasoning as an asymmetric dialogue between a \"Defender\" agent that proposes answers and a \"Debater\" agent that raises question-style objections without providing solutions.

It’s hard to tell whether the better reasoning and coherence actually come from the FOR-Prompting method itself or just from the stronger model (gpt-4o).\n\n(2) In Case Study 2, the authors only compare FOR-Prompting on the LLaMA-3.2-1B model with a single-prompt baseline. They don’t test against other lightweight reasoning methods—like a CoT version run on the same 1B model—so we can’t really tell how much benefit comes from FOR-Prompting versus other simple prompting tricks.\n\n(3) Section 4 introduces three roles in the framework, including a “Host” that combines the dialogue into a final answer.
