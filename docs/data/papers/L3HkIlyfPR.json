However, due to the distinct biological underpinnings of SC and FC, understanding how the altered coupling mechanism is associated with the progression of neurodegeneration remains a challenge in the neuroscience field. Drawing inspiration from the rich neural dynamics captured by the Kuramoto model, we introduce a brain-inspired neural network, coined KM-Net, to explain cognitive behavior from neuroimages, which is rooted in the neuroscience principle of oscillatory synchronization.\nGiven that disrupted synchronization in neural oscillations closely underlines neurodegenerative diseases, we further extend KM-Net to an explainable deep model in the arena of disease early diagnosis.\nBy capturing the emergence of synchronized FC patterns from the underlying SC architecture, our approach provides a biologically informed representation for the dynamical system of functional fluctuations. We validate our novel computational framework through extensive experiments on a diverse set of neuroimaging cohorts, demonstrating its effectiveness in characterizing cognition-relevant brain fingerprint and disease-specific imaging biomarkers. \nTogether, promising results indicate the potential of neural synchronization modeling for advancing computational neuroscience and improving the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Neurodegenerative diseases", "Kuramoto model", "SC-FC coupling", "fMRI"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d2ed74ee7fa8a16ad812a3e66c367564698d3eca.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "xpZkjxTV1v", "forum": "L3HkIlyfPR", "replyto": "L3HkIlyfPR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13658/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13658/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762617349276, "cdate": 1762617349276, "tmdate": 1762617349276, "mdate": 1762617349276, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
