Even though most traffic accident facilities account to bicycles, they have received little attention, as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble of physics models - performing well in the short-term predictions - and social models - performing well in the long-term predictions - exceeds state-of-the-art performance.

Risk of Circular Logic in the Core Innovation: The \"anticipation mechanism\" in the social module requires predicting the future trajectories of neighboring agents (using a simple const.v model, mentioned in ilne 239) to serve as input for forecasting the ego agent's future. This creates a potential circular argument: predicting agent A's future relies on first predicting agent B's future, which is itself a challenging prediction problem. The model sidesteps this fundamental issue rather than solving it. If the const.v predictions for neighbors are unreliable, this \"anticipated\" input may introduce noise rather than beneficial information.\n2. Unclear Motivation for Physics Models: The physics module ensembles four models, but their fusion is performed opaquely through LSTM encoding and concatenation. The paper fails to justify why this specific combination of models is necessary and sufficient, nor does it provide significance analysis to demonstrate each model's unique contribution. Notably, since the simplest const.v model performs best among the individual baselines (Table 1), the motivation for including the more complex and poorer-performing kinematic and xkalman models is questionable. This appears more like model stacking than a deliberate design. An ablation study comparing different subsets (e.g., 2 or 3 models) is needed to substantiate that using all four is optimal.\n3. Writing: Line 68 appears to have a missing citation.\n4. Figures: Figure 1 is blurring, and the overlaid trajectories are difficult to discern.\n5. Social Graph Construction: Line 284 states \"at most five neighbors at a distance below 20m are considered,\" but the specific selection strategy (e.g., the five closest? random selection?) is not specified.
