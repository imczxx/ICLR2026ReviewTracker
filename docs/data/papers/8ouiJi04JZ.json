It is critical for high-stakes, real-world applications where models frequently encounter unexpected data, including finance, security and healthcare etc. Though utilizing the message-passing mechanism,\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in this area by focusing on preserving structural properties, the robustness against noises is generally ignored, especially the structural noise which is inevitable in open-world scenarios of real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to achieve open-set node classification with structure-noise robustness, which is specifically tailored for open-set graph data with structural noise and out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Specifically, our approach refines graph structures by leveraging both node features and structural information. Furthermore, we mitigate the impact of noisy edges using a curriculum learning framework and dynamically select a subset of samples as ”pseudo-OOD nodes” during training. By incorporating an entropy maximization loss, the method achieves open-set node classification guided by node confidence scores. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore this problem. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our proposed approach.", "tldr": "We propose a robust graph learning framework that integrates structure refinement, curriculum learning, and entropy maximization to achieve noise-resistant open-set node classification on graph data.", "keywords": ["GNN", "Open Set", "Structural noise", "robustness"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a8b353a22dfc8f5eec2efae8fccab1c03dd882cc.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/2dddf50f1fd2f35bfc3048aa4087837e11428310.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces an innovative framework named OG-SNR, which, for the first time, systematically addresses the open-set node classification problem on graph-structured data, with a particular emphasis on robustness to structural noise. The proposed framework tackles this challenge through the integration of three key components. First, it optimizes the graph structure via node embedding refinement to enhance structural homophily. Second, a curriculum learning mechanism is incorporated to dynamically select reliable edges during training, thereby improving the model’s resistance to noise. Finally, by generating pseudo-unknown nodes and employing an entropy maximization loss, OG-SNR effectively distinguishes between known and unknown classes.

To more comprehensively validate the generalization capability of the OG-SNR framework, it is recommended to extend experiments to more diverse graph structure scenarios, such as: social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter); information networks (e.g., protein interaction networks); e-commerce networks (e.g., Amazon co-purchasing networks).\n2.\tThis paper effectively investigates the model's robustness to structural noise (edge-level perturbations), which is an important contribution. However, real-world graph data noise may also manifest in node features (e.g., missing features, outliers, or adversarial perturbations). The current experimental setup fails to evaluate the model's stability under such node-level noise. Therefore, it is recommended to supplement relevant experiments, such as adding Gaussian noise to node features, to verify whether the OG-SNR method possesses more comprehensive noise robustness.\n3.\tThe proportion of unknown category nodes in the test set is a critical parameter. An excessively low proportion (e.g., 1%) may fail to adequately challenge the model's recognition capabilities, potentially leading to misleading high metrics. This paper neither controls nor specifies this proportion, making it difficult to accurately evaluate and reproduce the experimental results. We recommend conducting sensitivity analyses by systematically adjusting the proportion of unknown nodes in the test set and reporting the resulting trends in model performance. This would significantly enhance the rigor and persuasiveness of the experimental conclusions.\n4.\tThe baseline methods selected in this paper encompass closed-set classification, open-set classification, and graph structure learning, ensuring comprehensive comparison. However, under the specific scenario of a “single unknown category,” the open-set node classification task is highly analogous to graph anomaly detection (where unknown nodes are treated as anomalies). Therefore, incorporating several classical or advanced graph anomaly detection methods as additional baselines enables a more comprehensive assessment of OG-SNR's performance level. This approach also highlights its advantages over general anomaly detection schemes when addressing specific open-set problems.\n5.
