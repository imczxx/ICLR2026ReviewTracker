Conformal prediction provides such UQ by wrapping ML predictions into prediction sets, and recent work has shown that these sets can be translated into optimal risk-averse decision policies—though only under marginal safety guarantees [Kiyani et al., 2025]. We generalize and strengthen this connection by (i) introducing action-conditional conformal prediction, which yields safety guarantees conditioned explicitly on each action taken by the decision maker, (ii) proving that action-conditional prediction sets characterize the feasible decision space for risk-averse decision makers aiming to optimize action-conditional value-at-risk, and (iii) proposing a principled finite-sample algorithm based on pinball-loss minimization that extends the conditional validity framework of [Gibbs et al., 2025] to the action-conditional setting. Experiments on two real-world datasets confirm that our approach significantly improves action-conditional performance over prior work.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Conformal prediction", "Uncertainty quantification", "Risk averse", "Risk sensitive", "Decision making", "Safety guarantees"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fb4320628e45def114d12ccc71b329a5da69e123.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper extends results presented by Kiyani et al.

It might also be of interest to compare to some method of [Gibbs et al., 2025].
