In addition, not all scenarios require every sensor. An excessive number of sensors not only constrains inference performance but can also degrade accuracy by introducing noise. To achieve the Pareto optimality between accuracy and efficient performance, we introduce $\\texttt{AdaSensor}$, an $\\textbf{Ada}$ptive $\\textbf{Sensor}$ selection framework for power-efficient 3D object detection. The $\\texttt{AdaSensor}$ first designs the Mixture of Sensors (MoS) module that employs a lightweight sensor router to choose the necessary sensors during inference. This selective sensor activation reduces the computational load by processing fewer inputs and lowers power consumption by deactivating unused sensors. However, a naive MoS suffers from inference instability, rooted in the latency overhead from frequent sensor switching. To mitigate this, $\\texttt{AdaSensor}$ incorporates a novel non-congested switching policy to judiciously limit the switching frequency, which enhances system stability and efficiency while extending sensor lifetime. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, we evaluate $\\texttt{AdaSensor}$ on the classical autonomous driving computing platform Nvidia Jetson Orin. On the nuScenes dataset, our method effectively reduces system power consumption by 11.7\\% and inference latency by 11.3\\%.

Safety risk of sensor deactivation: The paper’s core idea of turning off certain sensors to save energy is questionable in safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios. Real-world driving requires continuous 360° situational awareness— even human drivers rely on constant proximity sensing (e.g., ultrasonic anti-collision sensors). Disabling parts of the perception system means the vehicle is making decisions under incomplete environmental information, which could lead to unsafe behaviors or missed detections. The paper does not provide sufficient justification or safety analysis to demonstrate that such sensor reduction would not compromise driving safety.\n2. Unclear and possibly marginal energy benefit: The paper’s discussion of sensor power consumption lacks clarity and proportional reasoning. If sensors account for only around 29% of total system power, and AdaSensor achieves roughly an 11% total reduction, the net gain may correspond to only about 3% absolute system-level savings. Considering the added complexity, potential latency overhead, and safety risks from frequent sensor switching, such a modest improvement may not justify the design trade-offs. The paper should provide a clearer energy breakdown and cost–benefit analysis to validate the claimed efficiency advantage.\n3. Lack of consideration for sensor activation failure and system reliability: The paper does not discuss the risk of sensor startup or shutdown failures. In real vehicle systems, dynamically enabling or disabling sensors during driving is generally avoided because sensor booting can cause transient spikes in computational and power demand on the vehicle’s industrial computer. Such peaks may interfere with other modules or even lead to sensor initialization failures. Without addressing these potential reliability risks, the proposed dynamic activation strategy may be impractical for deployment in real autonomous driving systems."}, "questions": {"value": "Given that autonomous driving is a safety-critical task requiring continuous 360° perception, how do you justify the practicality of intentionally disabling sensors during vehicle operation?
