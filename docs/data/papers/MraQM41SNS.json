To address both types of imbalance in a unified manner, we propose UniImb, a novel framework for imbalanced graph classification. Specifically, UniImb first captures multi-scale topological features and enhances data diversity via learnable personalized graph perturbations. It then employs a dynamic balanced prototype module to learn representative prototypes from graph instances, improving the quality of graph representations. Concurrently, a prototype load-balancing optimization term mitigates dominance by majority samples to equalize sample influence during training. We justify these design choices theoretically using the Information Bottleneck principle. Extensive experiments on 13 datasets and 20 baselines demonstrate that UniImb substantially improves graph classification under diverse imbalance scenarios, achieving up to 41.62% improvement on class-imbalance tasks and up to 20.57% improvement on topological-imbalance tasks.

Was there any issue with running the TopoImb baseline? The results there look unreasonably low. \n\n2.

Although focused on graph-level tasks, providing a bit more related work on other imbalance problems could be beneficial (e.g., representative works in node, edge, and potentially subgraph), but the discussion in relation to the vision domain seems less relevant. \n\n4. Can you elaborate more on specifically why a contribution is unifying class and topological imbalance? Note that the prior work ImbGNN also discusses this innovation when building the connection between them. \n\n5. As compared to cherry picking the best result to make claims like \"UniImb delivers up to 41.62% relative improvement on ...\" providing averages across all datasets would be a preferred and less biased approach for the reader to consume the summarized information (note that already the average improvement is quite significant and need not just report the \"up to\" results here to show the empirical success/benefits of the proposed method).\n\n6. The work \"DPGNN: Dual-Perception Graph Neural Network for Representation Learning\" is cited as providing a prototype based approach, but does not appear to present such method.  \n\n7. Most of the datasets are binary classification and have overlapping domains. Are there datasets with more classes that could be explored (potentially diverse domains)? How would this prototype-based framework handle many classes?

Although imbalance graph classification is indeed a very important problem, the more realistic setting, as the field advances, should focus on graphs aligned more with reality, such as graphs with 3D structures.\n\n(2) The proposed method stacks many different techniques together, which makes the core contribution hardly justified. Although the ablation study has demonstrated that the most critical part is DBP, it might be more interesting to intuitively demonstrate how DBP can benefit the imbalance graph classification.

Emphasizing DBP’s independent efficacy would strengthen the justification of its contribution—particularly if experimental evidence can directly show that DBP alone mitigates class imbalance.\n\n(2) It would also be valuable to provide an intuitive and visual illustration of how DBP alleviates both quantitative and topological imbalance. For instance, does the learned DBP reflect specific topological patterns that are desirable for minority-class test graphs but absent in the minority-class training data? Such visualization could make the mechanism and impact of DBP more tangible and convincing.\n\n(3) My main concern, as noted in the weakness section, lies in the real-world practicality of the study. While the analyzed graphs are important, they do not capture realistic structural properties, such as the 3D conformations of proteins and molecules, which are crucial in real-world applications.
