Among them, domain-specific finetuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have received widespread attention. However, there are still some drawbacks such as hallucinated citations and limited explainability. To address these challenges, we construct AALawyer, a generative retrieval-augmented LLM system for legal reasoning in the criminal law domain, and Hallucination Risk-Benchmark, a new benchmark designed for evaluating RAG-based models. Our AALawyer consists of a domain-specific legal LLM named AA-LeLLM and two retrieval modules named AC-RAG and CCs-RAG. Different from both traditional RAG commonly used in legal LLMs and other new RAG, we propose a novel generative RAG, AC-RAG, and construct a CCs-RAG with new criminal cases for retrieval.\nExperiments demonstrate the professionalism and small hallucination of AALawyer in real-world cases. The model reaches the state-of-the-art level on LawBench classification tasks and scores $88.84\\\\%$ (improve $71.98\\\\%$) on our target classification task FAP. On the Hallucination Risk-Benchmark, AALawyer outperforms the base model, reducing $37.6\\\\%$ hallucination risk and finally the average score is improved by $31.7\\\\%$.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Retrieval-Augmented Generation", "Legal Reasoning", "Hallucination Mitigation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3438130ffc5298e5e04ec816c5b5b79e37e00f50.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents AALawyer, a generative retrieval-augmented legal AI system that combines a fine-tuned legal LLM, precise legal and case retrieval modules, and a 4-dimensional evaluation benchmark to improve accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and enhance explainability in criminal law reasoning."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

(3), the calculation of `auth()` is not clearly introduced. Does it originate from the article itself, or is it derived through another computational method?

Providing a concrete example would also help readers better understand the process.\n\n2. **Lack of clarity in presentation.**\n   The paper is somewhat difficult to follow. For instance, Figure 1 provides limited information and would be more informative if it used a legal-related context. Similar issues are observed with Figure 2.\n\n3. **Minor inconsistencies and typos.**\n   There are inconsistent expressions such as *G&G RAG* and *G&G-RAG*. It is recommended to standardize these terms throughout the paper for consistency and professionalism.\n\n4. **Outdated baselines.**\n   Some comparison methods appear outdated. To the best of my knowledge, the experiments do not include the latest Legal LLMs [1], and the LawGPT method has been updated in [2].

Critical questions remain unanswered: What criteria ensure these cases have appropriate difficulty levels? How is diversity guaranteed—do they cover a broad range or representative set of criminal charges? Why only 200 cases rather than a more comprehensive evaluation set? Without this information, the benchmark's representativeness and reliability are questionable.\n\n* Ambiguous and unvalidated evaluation dimensions: The four dimensions (hallucination, professionalism, informativeness, explainability) are vaguely defined without clear operational definitions or grounding in legal theory. It is unclear whether these dimensions are legally meaningful or simply intuitive categories. The paper does not justify why these specific four dimensions are appropriate for evaluating legal reasoning systems.\n\n* Insufficient LLM-as-judge methodology: While the authors employ an LLM-as-judge approach, Section 4 provides no details about the evaluation prompts or scoring rubrics. The validity of using LLMs to evaluate legal reasoning quality—especially for domain-specific dimensions like \"professionalism\"—is not established. Critically, there is no validation against legal expert judgments to confirm that the LLM's assessments align with human expert evaluations.
