While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a path forward with their broad knowledge and interactivity, existing methods remain data-intensive and lack transparent reasoning. To address these issues, we present DrugTrail, an LLM-based framework for explainable drug discovery that integrates structured reasoning trajectories with a Druggability‑Tailored Preference Optimization (DTPO) strategy. It not only introduces structured reasoning traces to articulate the \"how\" and \"why\" behind its conclusions but also serve to guide task-specific reasoning pathways within the LLM's vast knowledge space, thereby enhancing its interpretability and reliability of its final outputs. Furthermore, based on the fact that optimizing for binding affinity alone does not equate to optimizing for druggability, DTPO explicitly moves beyond single-metric optimization and opens up a broader search space that balances affinity with other essential factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its generalizability to a wider range of biomolecular optimization domains, bridging the gap between LLM reasoning capabilities and trustworthy AI-assisted drug discovery.", "tldr": "We propose DrugTrail, a novel paradigm for explainable drug discovery that integrates both structured reasoning trajectories and druggability‑tailored preference optimization.", "keywords": ["LLM-based drug discovery", "Explainability", "Structured reasoning", "Druggability‑tailored preference optimization"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d8932a408f814db2c64922f4fb3bea4c33ee675a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors present DrugTrail, an LLM-based method for computational drug discovery.

This is confusing.\n\n2.The SFT dataset generation (2.1.2) relies on several LLM-based filtering steps, such as Conflict Resolving and Domain Consistency which introduce unquantified biases. The \"Domain Consistency\" check, in particular, relies on a \"small set of 'golden' reasoning trajectories\" whose size and diversity are not specified.\n\n3.By pre-filtering the reference dataset with AutoDock Vina and then rewarding Tanimoto similarity, the model is effectively trained to optimize the Vina score, which is also the primary evaluation metric (Table 1). This risks overfitting to the Vina function.\n\n4.The \"Reasoning Quality Reward\" merely checks for the syntactic presence of formatting tags, not the semantic quality or logical accuracy of the reasoning content. Sometimes the model is not penalized for generating nonsensical reasoning as long as the format is correct.\n\n5.The paper claims its 1D SMILES generation method \"excludes the geometric dimension\". However, pocket-ligand binding is inherently a 3D problem. Furthermore, the model's inference (e.g.,π-π stacking) and key evaluation (Vina docking score) heavily rely on 3D geometry.
