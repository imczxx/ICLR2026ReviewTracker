A central challenge is that high predictive accuracy does not necessarily translate into optimal decisions. Existing approaches typically rely on custom loss functions, but these often suffer from non-differentiability, discontinuity, and limited modularity. To address these limitations, we propose a decision-aware Label Distribution Learning (LDL) framework that retains standard loss functions to avoid computational issues, while encoding decision knowledge entirely at the level of data representation. Our approach models uncertainty as full label distributions and reshapes them during the label enhancement stage to reduce predictive mass in high-risk regions. Scalar targets are transformed into individualized mixture distributions using decision-aware similarity matrices, and a dual-branch neural network is trained to learn decision-aware label distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks (e.g., newsvendor, network flow) and real-world datasets demonstrate consistent regret reduction across different sample sizes, with particularly strong improvements in low-data regimes. These results highlight LDL as a promising new pathway for achieving robust and principled decision-making under complex cost structures.", "tldr": "We introduce a Decision-aware Label Distribution Learning framework that embeds decision knowledge into labels, enabling them to better guide robust decision-making.", "keywords": ["Contextual Stochastic Optimization", "Label Distribution Learning", "Uncertainty modeling"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c16c06bc3299702713e8dc50960b0da6ca91da95.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a decision-aware Label Distribution Learning (LDL) framework for Contextual Stochastic Optimization (CSO).

Given a context $x$, we would like to solve the optimization problem\n$$\n\\min_{z \\in \\mathcal{Z}} \\mathbb{E}_{y \\sim P(y \\mid x)}[c(z, y)].\n$$\nThe distribution $P$ is not known, but we have a dataset of samples $(x_1, y_1), \\ldots, (x_m, y_m)$ drawn from $P$.\nThe approach explored in this paper and in prior work roughly involves using the data to learn a model that predicts for each context $x$ the distribution over outcomes $y$. Then the optimization problem is solved using the predicted distribution in place of the true conditional distribution of $y$ given $x$.\n\nA recent line of work studies \"Integrated Learning and Optimization\", where the loss function used when learning to predict the distribution of $y$ given $x$ is informed by the down-stream task (instead of simply being some generic measure of distributional similarity).\nHowever, the authors point out that a weakness of this approach is that these loss functions need to be designed bespoke for each downstream task, and are often difficult to work with due to being non-differentiable or discontinuous.\n\nThis paper proposes a new approach called Label Distribution Learning (LDL) that does not require per-problem loss derivations and argue that it generally achieves decision-awareness (i.e., works well for most down-stream tasks).\nThe high-level idea of the proposal is follows:\n1. From the training data of $(x_i,y_i)$ pairs, construct a distribution $p_i$ over $\\mathcal{Y}$ for each example. The distribution $p_i$ is a product distribution over the coordinates of $\\mathcal{Y}$ where each coordinate's marginal distribution is supported on a finite set of values. The support of each marginal distribution and the weights associated with each value are determined from the training data by incorporating the data manifold as well as the decision objectives.\n2. Next, train a two-branch neural network to simultaneously predict the support and weights from the context $x$.\n\nThe authors then carry out experiments comparing their proposed method against several baselines on two separate tasks with both real-data and simulated data. The experiments show that the proposed method works well on these tasks."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The problem studied by the paper is interesting, the approach seems quite different from prior work and is innovative and interesting. The experimental results are somewhat limited (only two decision tasks) but show promise for the proposed approach."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "At a high level, the label enrichment process described in the paper makes intuitive sense. However, at the same time, there are no formal guarantees or arguments suggesting that the approach will always result in predicted conditional distributions over problem parameters that work well for the down-stream decision task. While a formal guarantee is not required, the experiments section is limited to two decision tasks, so it remains unclear if the proposed approach would continue to work well across a wide range of tasks. My main concern with the paper is further justification for the details of the approach, either with theory arguing that the specific approach will capture important problem-specific structures, or with a broader experimental evaluation.\n\nTo give one example of a situation where the proposed approach might go wrong, suppose that the dataset of $(x,y)$ pairs has the property that every pair it contains appears at least $M$ times (so that there are many duplicates of every example). In this case, the set of top-$M$ neighbors that have maximal transferrability to a given $(x,y)$ pair (defined on line 242) will be the $M$ copies of $(x,y)$. As a result, the support for each of the marginal distributions over the coordinates of $y$ will contain a single value: the one that was present in $y$. After this, my understanding is that the label enrichment process will associate each training $(x,y)$ pair with a distribution $p_i$ that is a point mass on $y$, which seems to undermine the goals of the process.\n\nWhile this is an extreme example, it seems that softer versions of this could cause the LDL method to behave poorly.\n\nA second weakness (which is acknowledged by the authors in the conclusion) is that LDL always fits a product distribution for $y$, ignoring any correlations between the problem parameters. In some cases a product distribution might work well enough, but it seems like this is a significant simplifying assumption."}, "questions": {"value": "1. In equation 7 distances are measured according to a distance metric $d$, but in equation (8) you switch to using norm notation. Is the norm meant to be a different measure of distance, or are these the same distance?\n2. How is the specific form of the objective in equation 10 motivated? Intuitively it makes sense to find distributions that are similar both for other data points that are similar either in their context $x$ or where their problem parameters $y$ have exchangeable optimal decisions, but it seems like there are many choices.\n2. In the special case where the training data contains $M$ identical copies of each $(x,y)$ pair, does the label enrichment process result in $p_i$ being a point mass on $y_i$?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "7mOXeelXAz", "forum": "n5XpACMecf", "replyto": "n5XpACMecf", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4760/Reviewer_nUpX"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4760/Reviewer_nUpX"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4760/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761857034489, "cdate": 1761857034489, "tmdate": 1762917558473, "mdate": 1762917558473, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a decision‑aware Label Distribution Learning (LDL) pipeline for contextual stochastic optimization (CSO).

In particular, there is a pronounced effect of low-data regime superiority compared to other methods.\n\nOn the methodological side, the proposed method exhibits an intuitive multi-stage structure that lets it generate learned label distributions that can then be used to solve a large variety of decision-oriented problems; the distributions are learned in a way that leverage the downstream decisions and how those are correlated across samples; the usage of such correlations on the decision/label level, as opposed to earlier approaches that embraced adaptivity at the feature level, appears in certain ways more principled in decision-focused settings than these prior methods with local feature-based adaptivity."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "To start, the proposed method appears to be very computationally demanding compared to the alternatives it is benchmarked against. I could not find a runtime comparison in the pdf manuscript, so in the interests of transparency I’d like to ask for it to be disclosed. Overall, the expansion of the label space into custom “label-distribution” space involves a lot of matrix computations, together with many parallel neural networks with non-trivial architecture.\n\nFurthermore, it appears that due to the heavy parameterization of the method, there is a risk of non-robustness to misspecification that could be more pronounced than with the other methods. Thus, it would have been important to see how well this method does for noisy/drift-prone settings where the decision maps and/or labels could be misspecified.\n\nAlso, examining the plots, I would agree that the proposed method does exhibit substantial regret benefit over the benchmark methods on aggregate (as well as that the proposed method is more robustly performant, with box widths smaller than the rest), but I would be more moderate in making the performance gains claims given that there is still substantial overlap between the boxes in most cases. Thus, what we can deduce with a lot of certainty is that the proposed method obtains much better regret than the naive benchmark in almost all evaluations, which other methods by and large cannot consistently achieve in the sense of box-plots. However, what I believe we cannot claim with absolute certainty is the superiority of the proposed method over all of the benchmarks at once: For instance, the KNN based benchmark is usually in the same ballpark. Moreover, on real-world multi-item newsvendor (Figure 3), the performance of most methods looks quite evenly matched, modulo the variation/box width.\n\nAs another meta-issue, while I appreciated the logical nature of the proposed pipeline, I was not as convinced about the variety of heuristic choices that went into it at most junctures (many of these choices are not ablated against and would in fact be difficult to ablate). This relates to neural net architectures, hyperparameters like the neighbor count M when deciding on the largest transfer components; and this also relates to other subtler design choices that could be made, but were not made and weren’t usually discussed. Just as an example, when finding the M highest transfer cost samples, the hyperparameter M first of all sounds like the performance could be quite sensitive to it; so it appears that similar samples could be clustered together at first before performing this step, as the optimal M would then be found in a smaller, more robust range."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see above. Furthermore, I have some additional questions, which if the authors are able to address them would likely require some different plots from the ones displayed. \n\nFirst, the adaptively chosen support is mentioned quite a few times, but there are no illustrations that specifically showcase the adaptivity/variation in support throughout the instances on any of the tasks, so I’d request for this to be provided.\n\nSecond, there is a lot of mention of the difficulties, related to non-differentiability, of the standard existing predict-then-optimize approaches that are based on designing customized decision-aware losses. Yet, the comparison in the experimental section remains high-level, and doesn’t focus on exhibiting the favorable contrast as it specifically pertains to non-smoothness issues: I could imagine a dataset where decisions are intentionally set to be very discontinuous, and showing the benefits that the current framework has over decision-loss-based ones, locally. Currently, based on the results of this paper, it appears that the added benefit may be in the extra stability of the proposed method, as I imagine it to be quite computationally demanding compared to any decision-loss-optimizing method, smooth or nonsmooth.\n\nSecond, returning to the point of the KNN method being one of the most closely matched, this raises the question as to whether the feature-level similarity may in any way have translated to decision-level similarity. If is there a way to display whether that is or is not the case empirically, that would be great; else, a qualitative discussion in the case of each of the two studied settings would suffice."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "tKxzjEczfW", "forum": "n5XpACMecf", "replyto": "n5XpACMecf", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4760/Reviewer_vKBN"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4760/Reviewer_vKBN"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4760/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761970933890, "cdate": 1761970933890, "tmdate": 1762917557971, "mdate": 1762917557971, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
