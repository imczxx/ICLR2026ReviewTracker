The authors propose that the standard \"teleological\" view (what features do in a final model) is insufficient. Instead, they adopt a \"developmental\" perspective, analyzing how features emerge from the gradient signal during training.\n\nThe paper's main contribution is a decomposition of the NTP gradient into three distinct components, based on the information flow relative to a specific hidden state at position $i$:\n- direct learning, that is the standard gradient signal from the loss at position $i+1$. This component pushes toward features directly useful for predicting the next token.\n- pre-caching, that we can see when the gradient signal from future losses (at positions $j > i+1$) flows back through attention to the state at position $i$. And this allows the model to learn to \"pre-cache\" information at position $i$ that will be needed for future predictions.\n- circuit sharing: That is the gradient signal from losses at any position $j$ that updates the model's shared parameters ($\\theta$) without passing through the specific state at position $i$. Because parameters are shared across all positions, a feature learned for a direct task at position $j$ can appear at position $i$ even if it's useless there.\n\nThe authors then introduce \"myopic training\" (to block pre-caching) and \"m-untied training\" (to block circuit sharing) to show that these mechanisms are necessary for learning NTP-useless features in toy tasks. And they propose a new method to quantify the \"integrated influence\" of each of the three gradient components on the development of a specific feature over the entire training process."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "- The decomposition of the gradient signal into direct, pre-cached, and shared components is a powerful new way to think about feature emergence. It provides a principled answer to the fundamental question of why NTP models learn more than just $t+1$ prediction. \n- The integrated influence attribution method (section 3.4) is computationally expensive, but it provides a concrete, quantitative tool for tracing the origin of a given feature back to its specific gradient source, moving beyond static, post-hoc analysis."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The entire analysis pipeline (from probing to influence attribution (Def 3.2) to the $Q(w)$ proxy) depends on features being linearly represented in the residual stream. It's highly probable that many complex, abstract, or \"useless\" features are not linearly decodable, especially in middle layers. The paper's methodology doesn't take into account the emergence of such non-linear features.\n- The paper's core premise relies on a binary split between NTP-useful and NTP-useless features. While for Othello this line is clear (does a square affect the next move?), with language it's way murkier. Is a Part-of-Speech tag NTP-useless? It might not be necessary for 90% of predictions, but it might be helpful for 10% (for example when the next token could be \"jumped\" or \"jump\").\n- The the \"integrated influence\" method has a huge computational cost. It requires a full retraining of the model (or more, depending on the implementation) to analyze the development of features. This is acknowledged by the authors and is why they resort to a proxy for the LLM experiments.\n- While the gradient paths for pre-caching and circuit sharing are defined as disjoint, their effects on parameter updates $\\theta$ are deeply related. A pre-cache signal from a future loss at $j$ also contributes to the gradient on $\\theta$, just as a shared-circuit signal from $j$ does. The attribution method for separating these influences (section 3.4, adapting Adam) is complex, and its robustness is not fully explored.\n- The attribution method explains the origin of a known feature (defined by a probe direction $w$). It does not, by itself, discover features. The experiments rely on features found either via linear probes on ground-truth labels (toy tasks, Othello) or an unsupervised method (SAEs on Gemma). This creates a \"chicken-and-egg\" problem: to understand how a feature develops, you must already have a way to find it in the final model.\n- The paper's entire analysis of the pre-trained LLM (Section 5) hinges on the $Q(w)$ metric being a faithful proxy for the developmental gradient influences. This link, established in proposition 5.1, is theoretically shaky. The proof provided in the appendix conflates a local, static analysis with a global, developmental history. It justifies the proxy by performing a first-order approximation (a Taylor expansion) around the final, trained model $\\theta^*$, measuring the static causal effect of a feature after training is complete. It then equates this local, static measurement to the integrated influence (like, $I_{\\text{pre-cached}}$) over the entire training run. This assumes, without evidence, that the gradient dynamics at the end of training are representative of the cumulative signals that created the feature from scratch, which is a very strong and unlikely leap."}, "questions": {"value": "Your integrated influence method provides an interesting way to analyze the origin of a pre-defined feature (for example, from a probe or SAE). Could this developmental framework be inverted?\nI mean, could you use the gradient components themselves during training as a discovery mechanism?\n\nFor example, could you monitor the training dynamics and look for directions in parameter space (or activation space) that consistently receive a high magnitude of \"pre-cached\" or \"shared\" gradient, but a low \"direct\" gradient?

The authors carefully decompose the loss into the three components, so that they may define feature mismatch and consider how this accumulates along a training trajectory. To ablate pre-caching, they borrow from Wu et al. the concept of myopic training. To ablate circuit sharing, they pick a layer, and use different, non-shared weights up to the layer (inclusive) and after the layer (exclusive). To estimate if the models (transformer-based) represent features linearly, they train position-specific linear probes to regress from the residual stream to the feature values. By ablating in the two ways described above, they find that on toy examples and GPT-2, features that do not immediately aid the next token prediction task do not emerge. Studying OthelloGPT, they confirm the large signal value for the direct component, congruent with an inductive bias to distinguish boards with similar valid next move sets; however, the indirect components persist, suggesting that NTP-useless features are still learnt. By ablating pre-caching, they also find that syntax performance does not degrade, while generation does. Shifting to large language models, the authors formulate an intervention study where they add a vector value to the residual stream and use it to estimate the direct vs pre-cached influence on a specific token.
