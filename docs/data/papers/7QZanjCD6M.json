Ternarization has gained attention as a promising compression technique, delivering substantial size reduction and high computational efficiency. However, its potential in the post-training quantization (PTQ) setting remains underexplored, due to the challenge of training-free parameter optimization and the quantization difficulty posed by outliers and dispersed weights. To address these issues, we propose PT$^2$-LLM, a post-training ternarization framework tailored for LLMs. At its core is an Asymmetric Ternary Quantizer equipped with a two-stage refinement pipeline: (1) Iterative Ternary Fitting (ITF), which alternates between optimal ternary grid construction and flexible rounding to minimize quantization error, and (2) Activation-aware Grid Alignment (AGA), which further refines the ternary grid to better match full-precision outputs. In addition, we propose a plug-and-play Structural Similarity-based Reordering (SSR) strategy that leverages inter-column structural similarity to ease quantization and mitigate outlier effects, further enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PT$^2$-LLM delivers competitive performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) 2-bit PTQ methods with lower memory cost, while also accelerating both prefill and decoding to achieve end-to-end speedup.

Favorable Reported Results on Standard Benchmarks: The reported results in Table 1 indicate that the proposed 1.58-bit method achieves lower perplexity and higher average accuracy on several standard zero-shot QA tasks compared to the selected 2-bit PTQ baselines across various model scales."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Weak Theoretical Grounding and Unclear Practicality of the SSR Strategy. The proposed Structural Similarity-based Reordering (SSR) strategy lacks a strong theoretical connection to the primary objective of minimizing quantization error. Unlike Hessian-based methods... its objective (maximizing cosine similarity) is decoupled from the actual error minimization process. This weak theoretical grounding makes it difficult to understand why it works or to guarantee its effectiveness. This ambiguity is compounded by a lack of implementation clarity and cost analysis. The paper claims SSR is a \"lightweight strategy\" but fails to provide a detailed algorithm or an analysis of its computational overhead, making it difficult to assess its true practicality and reproduce the results.\n2. Unsubstantiated Claim of SOTA due to Lack of Direct Comparison: The paper's central claim of state-of-the-art performance at 1.58 bits is not adequately supported. The evaluation primarily relies on comparisons against higher-bitwidth (2-bit) methods. While outperforming them is a positive signal, a direct, apple-to-apples comparison against another 1.58-bit PTQ baseline is necessary to validate the true efficacy of the proposed techniques over other potential ternarization strategies. The absence of such a comparison represents a significant gap in the evaluation, leaving the paper's primary claim unsubstantiated.\n3. Insufficient Validation on Recent and Diverse Architectures: The paper's claims of general applicability are undermined by an incomplete evaluation on recent model families and a complete lack of testing on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. While thorough on older LLaMA/LLaMA-2 models, the validation on the more recent LLaMA-3 and Qwen3 families is limited to a single small-scale model. This raises questions about the method's robustness on larger variants like LLaMA-3-70B. Furthermore, the absence of any experiments on MoE models (e.g., Qwen3-MoE) is a significant omission, as these architectures present unique quantization challenges that are not addressed.\n4. Mismatch Between Model Capabilities and Evaluation Benchmarks: The choice of evaluation benchmarks fails to adequately probe the impact of extreme quantization on the core competencies of the tested models. Specifically, while the paper includes modern, reasoning-capable models like Qwen3, it restricts evaluation to older, simpler zero-shot QA benchmarks (e.g., ARC, BoolQ). These benchmarks do not effectively measure the multi-step, complex reasoning abilities that are a hallmark of such models. Consequently, the evaluation may be masking significant performance degradation on these crucial capabilities. A comprehensive assessment requires reporting performance on advanced reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, AIME)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can the authors provide a more formal justification for the SSR strategy, explaining its connection to quantization error minimization beyond the intuition of variance reduction? Furthermore, please clarify the algorithmic details of its integration and provide an analysis of its computational overhead.\n2. Could the authors provide a direct comparison against another 1.58-bit PTQ method to substantiate their claim of state-of-the-art performance? If no such public method exists, could they construct a strong baseline (e.g., by adapting GPTQ or other frameworks to a ternary setting) for a more rigorous comparison?\n3. Why were the evaluations on the LLaMA-3 and Qwen3 families limited to a single model each? To support the claim of generalizability, please provide results on larger models like LLaMA-3-70B and on MoE variants like Qwen3-MoE.\n4. Given that Qwen3 is known for its reasoning abilities, can the authors provide evaluation results on more challenging reasoning benchmarks like MATH or AIME to give a more transparent assessment of how 1.58-bit quantization affects these critical capabilities?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4},
