However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a vulnerability analysis framework for Safe RL policies via inverse constrained reinforcement learning (ICRL). Our approach only requires a set of expert demonstrations to learn both the safety constraints and a learner policy, which are then used to generate adversarial attacks capable of inducing safety violations in Safe RL policies. Theoretical analysis establishes  the feasibility and provides bounds for our attack  method. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "tldr": "Explore vulnerabilities of safe reinforcement learning applications under the minimal knowledge assumption via Inverse Constrained RL", "keywords": ["Safe reinforcement learning", "inverse constrained reinforcement learning", "adversarial attack", "vulnerability analyses"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/55679d5287e15bc80e35fe96b1e04e6eb3c5b060.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a state-perturbation attack method to increase the safety cost of an RL agent subject to a safety constraint.

The paper applies the ICRL method in [Kim et al., 2024] to estimate the agent's cost function and then leverages the standard PGD attack. The technical contribution is low. \n2. While the paper claims its approach to be gradient-free, it looks like it still needs the gradient information. In Algorithm 1, line 4, the PGD method requires evaluating the gradient with respect to s', which involves the gradient of pi_E. \n3. The attacker's objective is confusing. According to (4), it appears the attacker simply maximizes the instantaneous cost at each time step, which is inconsistent with the cumulative cost constraint in the safe RL formulation (1). Further, in this case, the attacker's problem is essentially the same as the traditional reward minimization problem considered in the literature for unconstrained MDPs. \n4. The evaluation is unfair by comparing the proposed method with baselines developed for different objectives other than (4). Given the myopic objective (4), PGD is the most direct approach to optimize it. It makes better sense to just compare the same PGD attack with and without ICRL. \n5. Another big issue with the evaluation is that it completely ignores defenses. As the attacker in the paper only considers the cost objective, previous defenses for unconstrained MDPs can be easily adapted to the scenario considered in this paper.  \n6. The paper has multiple typos and missing/inconsistent definitions. \n - The constraint function phi is undefined. It looks like phi should just be the cost function c in the safe MDP formulation, although that is never made clear in the paper. \n - Similarly, it looks like the so-called system identification function f is simply the transition dynamics p. \n - The definition of stealthness is not standard. In adversarial machine learning, one typically captures stealthiness based on the attack outcome (intensity, frequency, etc.), not the attacker's capability (black-box, white-box, etc.). \n - In the safe MDP definition, the cost function c relies on the current state, the current action, and the next state, but in Algorithm 1 and Eq. (4), it only depends on the next state. Then, in Lemma 1, it only depends on the current perturbed state and action, which is very confusing.\n7.
