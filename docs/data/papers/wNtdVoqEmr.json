Current AI models, despite extensive training, still struggle to achieve similar generalization, especially in Out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. This limitation stems from their inability to abstract core physical principles from observations. A key challenge is developing representations that can efficiently learn and generalize physical dynamics from minimal data. Here we present Neural Force Field (NFF), a framework extending Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) to learn complex object interactions through force field representations, which can be efficiently integrated through an Ordinary Differential Equation ( ODE) solver to predict object trajectories. Unlike existing approaches that rely on discrete latent spaces, NFF captures fundamental physical concepts such as gravity, support, and collision in continuous explicit force fields. Experiments on three challenging physical reasoning tasks demonstrate that NFF, trained with only a few examples, achieves strong generalization to unseen scenarios. This physics-grounded representation enables efficient forward-backward planning and rapid adaptation through interactive refinement. Our work suggests that incorporating physics-inspired representations into learning systems can help bridge the gap between artificial and human physical reasoning capabilities.", "tldr": "Few-shot learning and generalization in physical reasoning tasks", "keywords": ["Physical reasoning", "few-shot learning"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/45fadd7df1b76254ff5544bf361a251519625345.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a555e97c88d2de40e873ffc588e63648a4af2668.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a method for learning physical systems behavior and dynamics by combining an explicit ODE solver working on top of a learned, implicit, force field.

If we do not take mass into account, how can we predict the velocity accurately in general? It’s mentioned that mass is absorbed in force through correlated features like size, but is there any experiment that tests this assertion with counterintuitive sizes? Or, to put it in another term, how do the results change with objects of highly varying densities? Do you think adding a mass prediction would help? This part needs to be discussed and motivated in more detail.\n\nI’m not sure if this is due to the space constraints but, Figures 1 and 2 (especially Fig. 2) are a bit condensed and hard to parse.\n\nI'm not fully familiar with the work in this subfield, but it doesn't strike me as something brand new to do force prediction and combine it with ODE integration. Most of the related work is mentioned as it lacks robustness and sample efficiency, which makes it feel like the main contribution is the few-shot performance rather than the force + ODE combination. If that is the case, then I would wonder what's different in this method that makes it more sample efficient and applicable in few-shot scenarios---I don't think it's clear from the related work section. I tried to search for other methods, and found some, but I couldn't be sure if they are working with the same set of assumptions, and therefore, didn't want to speculate.

While the results support that predicting force fields is a better alternative when compared with pixel reconstruction, I’m not sure if it compares the model itself (i.e., the force field + ODE integration) with, say, SlotFormer, since the predictions are in different lands.

The formulation requires the past history of the object states as input in order to predict forces, but it seems like eqn (1) only contains the current state of the world as input. In theory this would not work, unless you make the assumption that acceleration is not required for estimating forces, which seems incorrect. Later in L194, it’s said that the framework uses autoregressive prediction of future states given past states - it seems like this is inconsistent with eqn (1) somehow.   \n2. I’m wondering how object geometry gets modeled in this framework, because that doesn’t seem to be part of the description of the system state which includes only position and velocity. Isn’t that necessary to predict forces that result from collisions? It seems like there’s some underlying assumptions being made which is not evident when you read the paper.\n3. I think another assumption being made is that all collisions are elastic and objects are rigid. To generalize this, we would need a representation of the material properties of objects, which the authors do not discuss. Moreover, it seems like the mass of the object is not part of the state in eqn (1). It might be worth first talking about a more generic physical system which doesn’t have these assumptions, and then introduce the approximations being made. Otherwise it seems like the equations are physically incorrect. \n4. The authors talk about an image space NFF, but don’t describe how the state of the system is represented in this case. Do they use an off the shelf model to get object masks/positions, or use pre-trained features as state representation? This part was not clear to me. \n\nThe goals laid out in the intro are too broad and ambitious. The paper doesn’t really solve them, which is okay, but the limitations and the way forward should still be discussed (i.e. how might one extend this to real stimuli). Otherwise, it’s hard to understand the contributions of the paper and makes the intro a bit misleading.
