In this paper, we define *latent planning* as occurring when LLMs possess internal planning representations that (1) cause the generation of a specific future token or concept, and (2) shape preceding context to license said future token or concept. We study the Qwen-3 family (0.6B-14B) on simple planning tasks, finding that latent planning ability increases with scale. Models that plan possess features that represent a planned-for word like *accountant*, and cause them to output *an* rather than *a*; moreover, even the less-successful Qwen-3 4B-8B have nascent planning mechanisms. On the more complex task of completing rhyming couplets, we find that models often identify a rhyme ahead of time, but even large models seldom plan far ahead. However, we can elicit some planning that increases with scale when steering models towards planned words in prose. In sum, we offer a framework for measuring planning and mechanistic evidence of how models' planning abilities grow with scale.", "tldr": "We propose a mechanistic definition of latent planning in LLMs, and provide evidence of its emergence at scale in open models.", "keywords": ["planning", "feature circuits", "circuits", "mechanistic interpretability"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/01d6dd250041bafec41c003033094fef0d3de6d6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Investigates whether LLMs engage in latent (not explicitly generated) planning and shows that planning ability grows with model scale (in the Qwen-3 family).\n\nContributions\n\n* Provides a causal definition of latent planning  -- planning is an internal representation that (i) causes the model to produce a specific future token for forward planning and (ii) causes generation of a context that makes that token more likely.

It seeks to answer (1) whether LLMs engage in a mechanistically verifiable form of latent planning, (2) how this ability can be defined and measured, and (3) how this capability scales with model size.\n\nThe methodology first establishes a strict, two-condition causal definition of latent planning, distinguishing it from prior observational or probing-based work. For an LLM to be \"latent planning,\" it must possess an internal representation of a future goal (a token or concept $t$) that: \n1. Forward Planning: Causes the model to eventually generate $t$ (Condition 1). \n2. Backward Planning: Causes the model to generate a preceding context that licenses $t$ (Condition 2).\n\nTo identify these causal mechanisms, the authors employ Transcoder Feature Circuits, a mechanistic interpretability technique. This method decomposes a model's dense MLP activations into sparse, monosemantic (interpretable) features and identifies the causal sub-graph (the \"circuit\") that explains a specific behavior.1 The study is conducted on the Qwen-3 family of open-source models, ranging from 0.6B to 14B parameters."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper's greatest strength is its insistence on a rigorous, two-condition causal definition of latent planning. This elevates the study from a correlational observation to a test of a mechanistic hypothesis. This strength is powerfully underscored by the refutation of probing-based methods in Appendix G, which demonstrates that high probing accuracy can be causally irrelevant.\n2. The quality of the core experiment is extremely high. The a/an and is/are tasks serve as an elegant \"minimal pair\" testbed for planning. The causal interventions (ablation and boosting) in Section 4.4 provide \"smoking gun\" evidence for the discovered planning circuit. The analysis in Appendix E, which surgically separates task-solving ability from planning ability, is a brilliant and crucial piece of analysis that solidifies the paper's claims."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The complete failure of the methodology on the el/la task (Appendix D) is a significant weakness. The authors' explanation—that \"Qwen-3 is not highly capable in language besides English and Chinese\" —is an ad hoc hypothesis. This failure could alternatively imply that the \"planning\" mechanism found is not a general-purpose planning module at all, but a highly specific and brittle circuit for English grammatical agreement. This possibility severely undercuts the generality of the paper's claims.\n2. The paper repeatedly claims that smaller models (4B-8B) have \"nascent planning mechanisms\"  but \"fail\" the task. It is unclear what this means mechanistically. Does the circuit exist, but is weak? Are some features missing? Does the model have the 'accountant' feature but lacks the causal connection to 'an' ? This \"nascent\" concept is central to the \"emergence\" narrative but remains poorly defined."}, "questions": {"value": "On local planning, They say X features are described as \"sensitive\" and found in a \"small minority.\" Is this evidence of a real, generalizable mechanism, or an artifact of steering on specific, polysemantic features that happen to fire on common n-grams?
