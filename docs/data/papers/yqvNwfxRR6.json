As modern chips scale to accommodate millions of components, manual placement by human experts becomes infeasible, necessitating the use of automated algorithms. \nRecently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for automating macro placement, owing to its high optimization efficiency and potential for generalization. \nDespite their promise, existing RL-based methods often neglect the value of expert knowledge accumulated through years of engineering practice. They tend to optimize oversimplified proxy objectives, resulting in suboptimal placements that deviate significantly from expert-designed solutions. \nTo bridge this gap, we propose a novel RL-based placement framework that integrates EDA domain expertise from two complementary perspectives: (1) \\textit{Expert Knowledge Injection}: Incorporating well-established placement knowledge, such as dataflow guidance, periphery bias, macro grouping, and I/O keepout constraints, to guide the learning process toward human-level solutions. (2) \\textit{Expert Workflow Imitation}: Emulating the post-refinement process of human experts (i.e., updating the design iteratively based on backend PPA feedback) to progressively optimize timing metrics by employing preference optimization.\nExperiments on the ICCAD 2015 and OpenROAD benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in PPA metrics~(e.g., 12.84\\% in total negative slack and 20.79\\% in worst negative slack compared to the runner-up method on average), outperforming advanced analytical, black-box optimization, and RL-based methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Chip Placement", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5f7879ea1240745553e0183c5eeafe56f30fd38a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the EXPlace algorithm to addresse the macro placement task.

It is well known that introducing expert knowledge during training can significantly benefit the early stages of learning, enabling the model to quickly reach a relatively high level of performance. This has been demonstrated in many works, such as AlphaGo. Therefore, the conclusions of this paper are not particularly novel. On the other hand, although the paper achieves impressive results, this may be due to the fact that using reinforcement learning to solve macro placement is still at an early stage. In such cases, the involvement of expert knowledge can lead to a noticeable improvement. However, one of the goals of AI is to surpass the limitations of human expert knowledge in order to achieve better performance. For example, algorithms like AlphaZero entirely abandoned expert priors and reached even higher levels of performance. In such scenarios, expert knowledge can become a local optimum that restricts further breakthroughs. Thus, I believe this paper represents a solid engineering effort within the current technological context, but its conclusions and level of innovation are limited in the long term.
