Existing benchmarks either (i) evaluate multiple, coarse-grained shift levels on general-purpose datasets (e.g., near-OOD \\& far-OOD), or (ii) examine limited shift level in fine-grained datasets (e.g., open-set recognition on fine-grained dataset), but none comprehensive address multi-level fine-grained shift. To bridge this gap, we introduce ShiftedBronzes, a benchmark designed for fine-grained OOD detection that systematically covers multiple, nuanced shift levels. We evaluate representative post-hoc detectors and vision-language model (VLM)-based methods on ShiftedBronzes and five general OOD benchmarks, uncovering two key limitations: (i) most post-hoc detectors fail to distinguish between varying degrees of distributional shifts, and (ii) although VLMs with prompt tuning outperform most post-hoc methods, they suffer from overfitting when fine-tuned on data with a single background context. To address these challenges, we propose a distribution-aware sensitivity metric that quantifies model robustness across shift levels, and a background-bias mitigation strategy tailored to VLMs. Together, ShiftedBronzes and our sensitivity metric form a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing robust multi-level OOD detection in fine-grained domains.", "tldr": "Our work introduces ShiftedBronzes, the first benchmark for multi-level, fine-grained OOD detection, along with a novel distribution-aware degree metric (DAD) and comprehensive evaluation across various OOD methods.", "keywords": ["Fine-grained Multi-level OOD detection; Benchmarking and Analysis"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7780fc6b323ab4c4ab313d078008dd45bc99f452.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles the challenge of fine-grained out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, where subtle distribution shifts can significantly degrade model performance.

Regarding the problem setting, I wonder why the paper treats covariate shift data (e.g., background or style variations) as OOD samples, rather than focusing on the model’s generalization performance on these data, such as classification accuracy. This is a more common practice and is central to the field of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, since a robust model should be able to maintain reasonably accurate classification performance under various environmental changes, even when the background differs. Therefore, I believe that for datasets such as Sketch and Rubbing, Transferred Bronze, the paper should also report OOD classification accuracy.

The paper would benefit from a more comprehensive summary that contrasts the unique challenges presented by the ShiftedBronzes dataset with those of other domain-specific OOD benchmarks, such as those in medical imaging and drug discovery. The core difficulties inherent in OOD detection within the field of archaeology, particularly in the context of bronze ware dating, are not sufficiently elaborated. Furthermore, the high performance of the ID-like method suggests that the problem may be less challenging than presented or already well-resolved. It is recommended that the authors provide a more nuanced discussion on the complexities and distinctiveness of OOD detection in archaeological applications.\n2. The paper lacks a detailed explanation of the practical applications of OOD detection in archaeology. While the identification of counterfeit antiques is posited as a significant application, the selected OOD datasets do not align with this requirement. Specifically, the \"Container\" dataset does not consist of antique items, and the \"Transferred Container\" and \"Transferred Bronze\" datasets are not described with sufficient detail to assess their relevance to the identification of fake antiques. The authors are encouraged to provide a more thorough description and justification of these datasets in relation to the problem of identifying counterfeit archaeological artifacts.\n3. The use of ancient bronze dating as a proxy for fine-grained OOD detection is interesting. However, the specific types of shifts created—sketches, rubbings, and AI-driven material transfers (ZeST)—are highly stylistic and artistic in nature. It is unclear if the insights derived from this domain (e.g., VLM's vulnerability to homogenous backgrounds) would directly translate to other fine-grained domains like medical imaging (e.g., different scanners), remote sensing (e.g., seasonal changes), or species classification (e.g., new subspecies). The paper claims the shifts are comparable to these domains but provides no empirical evidence. The benchmark might be testing robustness to a very specific, human-interpretable set of transformations rather than general, subtle distribution shifts.\n4. The proposed Distribution-Aware Degree (DAD) metric is defined solely based on the pairwise comparison of FPR95 scores. While FPR95 is a standard OOD metric, it represents only a single point on the ROC curve. A method could have a favorable DAD score by happening to order its FPR95 values correctly, while its overall performance, as measured by AUROC, might be poor or show a different trend. This makes DAD potentially brittle and not fully representative of a method's \"distribution awareness.\" A more robust version of DAD might incorporate multiple metrics (e.g., AUROC, AUPR) or analyze the entire ROC curve's relationship across shift levels. The paper does not justify why FPR95 was the exclusive choice.\n5. The Related Work section is largely descriptive rather than analytical. While it enumerates prior benchmarks and methods, it fails to provide a deep, critical synthesis of why existing benchmarks are insufficient for fine-grained analysis or why existing post-hoc methods are theoretically expected to fail on gradual shifts. \n6. The paper proposes the DAD metric to measure sensitivity but does not justify why the ability to correctly rank FPR95 scores is a meaningful or sufficient proxy for robust OOD detection."}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "a5g2OkiWqs", "forum": "qx5AF0X6jW", "replyto": "qx5AF0X6jW", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15380/Reviewer_gdc3"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15380/Reviewer_gdc3"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15380/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761673751719, "cdate": 1761673751719, "tmdate": 1762925663368, "mdate": 1762925663368, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The ShiftedBronzes paper introduces a benchmark for fine-grained out-of-distribution (OOD) detection evaluation under gradual domain shifts.
