Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication addresses these limits by enabling collaboration across vehicles and infrastructure, but it also faces heterogeneity, synchronization, and latency constraints. Language models offer strong knowledge-driven reasoning and decision-making capabilities, but they are not inherently designed to process raw sensor streams and are prone to hallucination. We propose V2X-UniPool, the first framework that unifies V2X perception with language-based reasoning for knowledge-driven AD. It transforms multimodal V2X data into structured, language-based knowledge, organizes it in a time-indexed knowledge pool for temporally consistent reasoning, and employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground decisions in real-time context. Experiments on the real-world DAIR-V2X dataset show that V2X-UniPool achieves state-of-the-art planning accuracy and safety while reducing communication cost by more than 80\\%, achieving the lowest overhead among evaluated methods. These results highlight the promise of bridging V2X perception and language reasoning to advance scalable and trustworthy driving.

Notably, while V2X intuitively should provide more performance gain in long-term planning (Just as the authors stated, V2X helps extend perception range), V2X-UniPool shows an even larger gap on 3.5s and 4.5s error.\n- Compared with the no-fusion result from V2X-VLM, which achieves an average L2 of 1.49m, the 1.47m result is not convincing, especially when more external knowledge is given.\n- Considered V2X-VLM directly predicts waypoints, V2X-UniPool predicts speed and curvature following the OpenEmma paradigm. The effect of this difference is unclear.\n2. **Missing details in the knowledge pool component.**\n- In section 1, section 3.2, and Figure 2, LiDAR input is seen as an essential part, but no further explanation on how this modality is integrated into the system.\n- In section 3.2, from equations 3 and 4, it seems that the proposed two sub-pools cannot fully cover the dynamic pool described in Eq. 2.\n3. **The ablation study is also not well designed to prove the effectiveness.**\n- Multiple key components, including information retrieval, knowledge pool operations, build up a relatively complicated system. However, no detailed information is provided to show how those components contribute to the performance gain in Table 3.\n\n### Minor Weaknesses\n1. The VLM setup (probabilistic sampling or not, preset temperature) is unclear, which is important to the significance of the results in Table 3.\n2. In section 3.3, Encode and Retrieve are not well defined."}, "questions": {"value": "1. What's the performance of V2X-UniPool if the downstreamed AD model predicts waypoints directly? This helps to have a fair comparison with baselines.\n2. Do you have qualitative results to show the actual improvement with V2X information integrated? Given that DAIR-V2X is collected at signalized intersections, do frequent conflicting interactions occur?\n3. For the mapping from messages to specific pools, is it fixed during the design stage or dynamically changes on the fly? Will different pools be treated differently in the downstream tasks? How will this categorization affect the performance?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "a9RX5dJ5F4", "forum": "KvjohQDQhB", "replyto": "KvjohQDQhB", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9818/Reviewer_2oTn"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9818/Reviewer_2oTn"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9818/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761891879568, "cdate": 1761891879568, "tmdate": 1762921300431, "mdate": 1762921300431, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents V2X-UniPool. The core idea is to establish a \"V2X as a Knowledge Service\" model, where roadside infrastructure (RSUs) acts as a centralized processor.
