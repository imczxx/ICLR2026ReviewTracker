While prior $\\texttt{M-Attack}$ demonstrated notable success in exceeding 90% attack success rate on GPT‑4o/o1/4.5 by leveraging local crop-level matching between source and target data, we show this strategy introduces high-variance gradient estimates. Specifically, we empirically find that gradients computed over randomly sampled local crops are nearly orthogonal, violating the implicit assumption of coherent local alignment and leading to unstable optimization.\nTo address this, we propose a theoretically grounded **gradient denoising** framework that redefines the adversarial objective as an expectation over local transformations. Our first component, *Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA)*, estimates the expected gradient by averaging gradients across diverse, independently sampled local transformations. This significantly reduces gradient variance, enhancing convergence stability. Recognizing an asymmetry in the roles of source and target transformations, we introduce *Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA)*. ATA regularizes optimization by aligning the adversarial example not only with the primary target image but also with auxiliary samples from a semantically correlated distribution. This forms a smooth semantic trajectory in the embedding space, acting as a low-variance regularizer.\nFinally, we reinterpret prior momentum replay within local matching as variance-minimizing estimators under the crop-transformed objective landscape. Momentum replay stabilizes and amplifies transferable perturbations by preserving gradient directionality across local perturbation manifolds. Together, MCA, ATA, momentum replay, and a delicately selected ensemble constitute $\\texttt{M-Attack-V2}$, a principled framework for robust black-box LVLM attack.\nEmpirical results show our framework significantly improves the attack success rate on Claude-4.0 from **8% → 30%**, on Gemini-2.5-Pro from **83% → 97%**, and on GPT‑5 from **98% → 100%**, surpassing all existing black-box LVLM attacking methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Vision-Language Model", "Adversarial Attack", "Muti-modality Models"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e22c9cead67394b4c8c29124c1f9bbc15e7a197c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f2bee7044bbd489ab43252276fad411d7ebe5fd0.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces M-Attack-V2, a new framework for black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).

While gradient overlap, improved sampling quality, and patch momentum are analyzed theoretically, their explicit connection to adversarial transferability remains unclear beyond empirical evidence. The theoretical evidence and the observed transfer performance appear disconnected.\n\n2.  The results rely heavily on proprietary models, which are subject to continuous updates and thus limit reproducibility and fair comparison. It would strengthen the work to include experiments on open-source models in the main text. The appendix currently reports results on older variants; incorporating evaluations on more recent VLMs such as GLM-4.1, LLaVA 1.6, and Llama-3.2-Vision would help to strength the findings.\n\n3. The proposed method is compared against only a few baselines on VLM classification tasks, without considering a broader line of adversarial attack studies [1-5] on CLIP that explore more diverse tasks such as retrieval, VQA, and image captioning. The use of CLIP as surrogate models is appropriate and fair; however, including evaluations across these additional task types would provide a more comprehensive assessment of transferability and generalization.\n\n4. The ASR evaluation relies on GPTScore and keyword matching (KMRa/b/c), which may introduce prompt-specific bias. \n\n5. The performance improvements for individual modules (Table 3) are small and may not justify the added complexity.\n\n6.

The introduction to the original M-Attack is very limited, making it difficult to follow the motivation and context of the proposed improvements. The discussion on gradient mismatch is especially confusing. There is no formal definition or equation specifying which gradient is being analyzed. It is unclear whether the gradient refers to that of the source crop or the target crop, and whether the mismatch occurs between similar source crops with the same target crop or across different target crops. The description of how cropping operates on the source and target sides is also vague; the important distinction that the source crop acts in pixel space while the target crop acts in feature space only becomes apparent much later (around line 177). These key details should be clearly articulated in the background section.\n\n2. The method section also suffers from a lack of precision. The notion of a “target embedding distribution” is introduced without a clear definition or explanation of how it is constructed.
