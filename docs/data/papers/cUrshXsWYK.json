We consider a setup focusing on optimizing downlink communication by improving state-of-the-art schemes like EF21-P [Gruntkowska et al., 2023] and MARINA-P [Gruntkowska et al., 2024] in the non-smooth convex setting. Our key contributions include extending the non-smooth convex theory of EF21-P from single-node to distributed settings and generalizing MARINA-P to non-smooth convex optimization. For both algorithms, we prove optimal $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rates under standard assumptions and establish matching communication complexity bounds with classical subgradient methods. We provide theoretical guarantees under constant, decreasing, and adaptive (Polyak-type) stepsizes. Our experiments demonstrate MARINA-P’s superior performance with correlated compressors in both smooth non-convex and non-smooth convex settings. This work presents the first theoretical analysis of distributed non-smooth optimization with server-to-worker compression, including a comprehensive analysis for various stepsize schemes.", "tldr": "We extend MARINA-P and EF21-P to non-smooth distributed optimization, introduce adaptive stepsizes, and show MARINA-P with permutation compressors outperforms EF21-P in non-smooth settings", "keywords": ["Federated Learning", "Communication-efficient non-smooth optimization", "Adaptive Stepsizes"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fe0d57f0d21aa1b22be55d3ee6383abccc106cb7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/51668adc2048872493c6c3f4296b75aae17e00fb.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies the distributed optimization problem under server-to-worker (s2w) compression with error feedback.
