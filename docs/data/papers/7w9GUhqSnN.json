By introducing a differentiable leaky-integrate-and-fire (dLIF) prior, BayesENDS is capable of inferring population events and interaction dynamics directly from EEG—without spike or interaction annotations. The dLIF prior encodes membrane dynamics, rate/refractory constraints, and physiologically plausible frequency ranges, improving identifiability while yielding biologically plausible, subject-level biomarkers alongside AD predictions.
