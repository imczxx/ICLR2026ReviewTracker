State-of-the-art neural network solutions operating on such edge-attributed multigraphs either preprocess the multigraph by collapsing its multi-edges into a single edge or introduce auxiliary edge features that compromise permutation equivariance. We introduce MEGA-GNN, a graph neural network (GNN) for edge-attributed multigraphs, which overcomes these limitations by employing a two-stage aggregation process in its message passing layers: first, features of the multi-edges between the same two nodes are aggregated, and then messages from distinct neighbors are combined. We show that MEGA-GNN computes a richer set of statistical features than the GNNs that implement only single-stage aggregation in their message passing layers. We evaluate MEGA-GNN on seven financial transaction network datasets and three temporal user-item interaction datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in minority-class F1 scores for illicit transaction detection and ROC-AUC scores for user state-change prediction, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "tldr": "A GNN architecture for edge-attributed multigraphs that integrates two-stage aggregation into its message passing layers.", "keywords": ["graph neural network", "multigraph", "edge attributes", "financial crime", "money laundering"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d83bb1ac0e87986fb9bca22dcc76f9b5073b940b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b37b5c2867295599f5131f51acaa0283b453a535.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MEGA-GNN, a graph neural network structure designed for multigraphs with edge attributes, addressing an important problem with potential applications across various domains.

The two-stage message passing mechanism is intuitive yet effective, and it directly addresses a structural limitation of current GNNs on multigraphs. The formal proof that this design is strictly more expressive than single-stage aggregation is quite convincing.\n\n2. The paper carefully formalizes permutation equivariance and provides a universality result (under an edge ordering assumption). These theoretical discussions are coherent and help justify the architectural choices.\n\n3. The experiments are thorough within their chosen domains, and MEGA achieves steady improvements over multiple strong baselines. The results are reproducible and the code organization appears clean and principled.\n\n4. It’s nice to see that the authors didn’t just stop at the theoretical part, they also validated scalability and provided a reasonable complexity analysis, showing that the model can be trained efficiently in practice."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The universality argument depends on having a strict total order over edges. That’s fine for datasets with clear timestamps, but in reality many edges can share identical times or even lack ordering info. It’s not entirely clear how the model behaves in those cases, or whether the ordering assumption limits the practical generality.\n\n2. There are some nice comparisons showing the effect of the two-stage design, but the analysis feels a bit narrow. For instance, it’s unclear how different aggregation choices or varying numbers of edge types would change the results. I would have liked to see a more systematic exploration here — even a small controlled study would help.\n\n3. The datasets are mid-sized, and one of the baselines already runs out of memory. That makes me wonder how MEGA would perform on larger, real-world graphs. Some evidence or discussion about scaling behavior would make the contribution stronger.\n\n4. Most results come from financial transaction or interaction graphs. That’s a relevant testbed, but I’m not sure how general these conclusions are beyond that context. It would be nice to see at least one example from another kind of multigraph, maybe something in social or transportation data.\n\n5. The paper shows aggregate runtime comparisons, but not much insight into where the actual cost comes from. Since the model introduces an additional aggregation stage, some operator-level breakdown or profiling would make the trade-offs clearer."}, "questions": {"value": "1. How does the model handle cases where multiple edges share the same timestamp or lack ordering information? Is there a deterministic tie-breaking rule, and does that affect permutation equivariance or expressiveness?\n\n2. Could the authors provide more insight into how the two aggregation stages are parameterized? For example, is there any adaptive mechanism to select the number or type of aggregators based on edge multiplicity?\n\n3. How expensive is the artificial-node construction in practice when using neighbor sampling? Does it cause additional indexing or memory overhead during batch training?\n\n4. For the temporal datasets, how do you ensure there’s no information leakage across time? Are all multi-hop neighbors restricted to the same snapshot, or could future edges appear in the receptive field?\n\n5. Have you considered pretraining or reweighting strategies to further mitigate the strong class imbalance in AML datasets? Some contrastive or cost-sensitive techniques might improve performance in the low-positive regime.\n\n6. It would be interesting to see a plot showing how throughput and memory usage scale with the average number of edges per node.
