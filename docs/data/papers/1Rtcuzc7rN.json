We propose and evaluate fea\nture selection methods based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which\nparameterize feature transformations through splines, enabling direct access to in\nterpretable importance measures. We introduce four KAN-based selectors (KAN-\nL1, KAN-L2, KAN-SI, KAN-KO) and compare them against classical baselines\n(LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple clas\nsification and regression benchmarks.

In regres\nsion tasks, KAN-L2 and KAN-SI provide robust performance across noisy and\nheterogeneous datasets, aligning closely with ensemble predictors. Overall, our\nfindings demonstrate that KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and\ninterpretable alternative to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear\nand multivariate feature relevance beyond sparsity- or impurity-based measures", "tldr": "This paper leverage the spline coefficients  in Kolmogorov Arnold networks through three different strategies  for  feature selection tabular data.", "keywords": ["feature selection", "supervised learning", "tabular data", "KAN"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8ad7b81ee94b08d3743bbd55ff42d1dcd7c941d3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose four KAN-based selectors: KAN-L1 and KAN-L2 (based on spline coefficient norms), KAN-SI (sensitivity integral approach), and KAN-KO (knock-out strategy).

The reliance on classic machine learning datasets raises questions about the methods' applicability to modern high-dimensional data challenges. The absence of contemporary, complex datasets limits the generalizability claims.\n4.
