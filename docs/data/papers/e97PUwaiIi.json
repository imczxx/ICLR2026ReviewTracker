A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this problem, we introduce MEGS², a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight, arbitrarily oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS² achieves a 50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.", "tldr": "MEGS² is a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reduces rendering VRAM via spherical Gaussians and unified pruning.", "keywords": ["3D vision", "3D construction", "novel view synthesis", "3D Gaussian Splatting", "lightweight 3DGS", "3DGS compression"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d74035978e6046185a2d090ae7517a8e189c4a9e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/40bd157fcc3f418ff6854f1a587060118be482f2.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposed a memory-efficient Gaussian Splatting method for edge devices.

Similarly, the second contribution claim is also inaccurate, as discussed in Question 2. Moreover, poor presentation of the method, such as missing information on model choices, makes it difficult for readers to fully understand their approach. Please refer to my Questions for detailed comments.\n\nPresentation issue:\n* I could not find the authors’ conclusion regarding model selection.\n  1. In lines 306–311, the authors propose two distinct operators: **sharpness-based selection** and **range-based selection**. Which one is ultimately adopted in the final model and why? I could not find a statement clarifying this choice.\n  2. Similarly, in lines 785–787, which criterion was finally chosen and why?: **magnitude-based selection** or **importance-based selection**?\n* I could not identify the setting difference between the last two rows in Table 1. Please provide distinct method names (e.g., ours-setting_A and ours-setting_B) and explain them clearly in the appropriate section of the main text.\n* Please include a citation for ADMM at line 234."}, "questions": {"value": "* The first contribution claim in lines 97–99 makes it sound as if the authors are the first to propose substituting Gaussian Splats with Spherical Gaussians, which is not true, as this was already introduced by SG-Splatting. The authors should instead highlight the distinction between **fixed axes** and **arbitrarily oriented axes** in Spherical Gaussians. Emphasizing the reduction of per-primitive parameter count and VRAM savings is also inappropriate, since these advantages originate from SG-Splatting.\n* The second contribution claim in lines 100–102 also seems inaccurate. The memory-constrained problem and its solution were originally introduced by GaussianSpa, and the authors simply extend that method by incorporating the sharpness of Gaussians to retain those with better expressive capacity. The authors should revise the statement of contribution 2 to accurately reflect their original findings.\n* The VRAM reduction of the proposed method is primarily attributed to the smaller number of parameters used for encoding view-specific color and pruning. To provide supporting evidence for the pruning aspect, I suggest that the authors present both VRAM consumption and the number of Gaussians in Table 1. This will help readers better understand the pruning performance compared to pruning-only baselines such as LP-3DGS, Mini-Splatting, and GaussianSpa.\n* The qualitative results in Figure 3 do not fully support the authors’ claim that \"MEGS² delivers a cleaner and more complete reconstruction in Playroom\" (line 415). When examining the ceiling area in the top center of the rendered images, MEGS² produces a somewhat speckled texture, whereas GaussianSpa and 3DGS yield cleaner textures. Additionally, the light switch in the bottom-left area appears blurrier in MEGS² compared to GaussianSpa.\n* I am wondering about the effect of using arbitrarily oriented Spherical Gaussians. Please include an ablation study to analyze this effect. For example, the authors could test:\n  1. The proposed method with **Spherical Harmonics (SH)**\n  2. The proposed method with **fixed-axis Spherical Gaussians**\n* Furthermore, I am curious why **GaussianSpa (SH → SG)** shows a quality drop (27.01dB in Table 2) compared to the original GaussianSpa (27.56dB in Table 1).
