Including 2–3 sentences explaining how the analysis was conducted would improve clarity and help ensure the reproducibility of the findings.\n\n- While the task design is interesting, the current evaluation (based on computing Euclidean distance) may be somewhat impractical.

The conceptual framing thus misrepresents the task scope and inflates the claimed contribution.\n\n2. Insufficient benchmark scale and unclear data composition.\n\nThe dataset is relatively small, and the paper lacks comprehensive statistics or visual summaries of the benchmark. Readers cannot assess the distribution of grid sizes, object counts, or overlap ratios. Without transparent visualization (e.g., histograms or embedding maps), the dataset’s diversity and representativeness remain uncertain.\n\n3.
