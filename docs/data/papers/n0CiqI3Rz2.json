We propose a symmetry-inspired symbolic regression (SI-SR) framework that automatically identifies intrinsic physical invariances and embeds them into a symmetry-constrained variable set, enhancing robustness and promoting sparsity. The framework combines a validation step for symmetry confirmation with symbolic regression for expressive nonlinear modelling. We evaluate SI-SR on canonical partial differential equations (PDEs) and variable-coefficient systems, with systematic comparisons against state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that leveraging symmetry reduces redundancy and enables the recovery of compact, accurate models. This establishes symmetry as a powerful inductive bias for data-driven equation discovery.", "tldr": "Robust equation discovery via symmetry identification", "keywords": ["Dynamical systems", "Equation discovery", "Symmetry", "Noisy and sparse data"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/45c0874a44306fa4eea3281ac39355fd0e379778.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a framework to identify unknown symmetries of PDE systems and use them to reduce the variable space in symbolic regression.

However, there are a large number of related works, some of which address more general scenarios, that this paper has not mentioned. For example, [1, 2] are the most relevant methods, which also aim to discover PDEs and utilize the much more general *Lie point symmetries* to reduce the symbolic regression problem. These papers, in my opinion, already provide a more generalized solution to the same problem compared to this submission in terms of the type of symmetries (Lie point symmetry v.s. symmetry that leads to the composition of *two* variables, as I will elaborate next), differential equations (multiple independent variables v.s. just $x$ and $t$), and base equation discovery algorithms (SINDy/genetic programming/symbolic transformer v.s. just genetic programming).\n\nFor example, to elaborate on my point on the type of symmetries, the symmetry reduction in this submission is described in the example in (5) and (6), i.e. $z_1 \\odot z_2$ for a binary operator $\\odot$ and two jet variables $z_1$ and $z_2$. However, not all reductions from symmetries can be done in this format. For example, consider the rotation symmetry on the 2D $(x,y)$-space. The only invariant (up to functional dependency) of this symmetry is $x^2+y^2$, meaning that any equation $F(x, y)$ with this symmetry can be expressed as $\\tilde F(x^2+y^2)$. However, $x^2+y^2$ cannot be expressed by $x \\odot y$ in your formulation and thus cannot be detected by the symmetry errors (7) and (8). In fact, there are abundant examples of symmetries, many of them already considered in [1,2], that the proposed method in this paper cannot apply to.\n\nI understand that the previously mentioned papers are relatively recent, so the authors might not be aware of them. However, since this submission focuses on PDE discovery with symmetry, it is natural to consider those Lie point symmetries of PDEs. There have been many other papers with similar spirits, e.g. [3-6]. They may not have exactly targeted PDE discovery (but rather, discovering ODEs in dynamical systems, for example), but their methods are very relevant and can be easily extended to deal with partial derivatives. Without discussing these works and comparing them in terms of applicability and experimental results, it is difficult to evaluate the significance of the proposed method in this submission.\n\nAnother relatively minor comment about methodology: SINDy is used as a surrogate model for interpolating $F$ in the symmetry loss. Is it accurate enough when the ground truth dynamics contain terms that are not included in the polynomial library, e.g., trigonometric or exponential terms? On the other hand, if the ground truth equation only contains polynomial terms, why not directly use sparse regression instead of GP-based symbolic regression, since sparse regression is much more efficient in this case?\n\n## References\n\n[1] Discovering Symbolic Differential Equations with Symmetry Invariants. arXiv 2025.\n\n[2] Governing Equation Discovery from Data Based on Differential Invariants. arXiv 2025.\n\n[3] A Unified Framework to Enforce, Discover, and Promote Symmetry in Machine Learning. arXiv 2023.\n\n[4] Symmetry-Informed Governing Equation Discovery.
