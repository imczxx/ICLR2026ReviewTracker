Autonomous robots often need to satisfy spatial and temporal goals that are unknown until run time. Prior work focuses on learning policies for executing a task specified using LTL, but they incorporate the specification into the learning process. Any change to the specification requires retraining the policy, either via fine-tuning or from scratch. We present a more flexible approach -- to learn a set of composable task primitive policies that can be used to satisfy arbitrary LTL specifications without retraining or fine-tuning. Task primitives can be learned offline using RL and combined using Boolean composition at deployment. This work focuses on creating and pruning a transition system (TS) representation of the environment in order to solve for deterministic, non-ambiguous, and feasible solutions to LTL specifications given an environment with multiply-labeled regions and a set of task primitive policies. We show that our pruned TS is deterministic, contains no unrealizable transitions, and is sound. Training physical robots for every possible task is expensive--by training on a base set of tasks and composing at run time we are able to reduce total training time compared to non-composition approaches and have negligible processing time at run time. We verify our approach via simulation and compare it to other state of the art approaches, showing that Comp-LTL is safer, more adaptable, and quicker at satisfying unseen specifications at runtime.", "tldr": "We develop a zero-shot mechanism to satisfy a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specification by solving for a set of existing safety-aware RL task primitives accepted by the product between the environment transition system and specification automaton.", "keywords": ["Robotics", "Reinforcement Learning", "Linear Temporal Logic", "Logical Composition", "Zero-shot"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e33e788c46476fdb32bae9bb12aec981828914f7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/65970f12111214c46eb7f87c045f4c9f6bf7fc6f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an approach that composes pretrained task primitives to satisfy Linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications, with the aim of avoiding retraining or fine-tuning whenever the specifications change.

The paper uses notation and symbols in a way that is typical of this line of work which makes it easier to follow.\n\n## Significance\nThe work considers an important problem - safety within RL and also does support faster learning which is important as we expand our models into more difficult domains. Thus, there could be future work which builds on this paper and its stated claims."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "## Clarity\nFirstly the minor concern, the figure captions are very uninformative and this limits the benefit of the figures substantially. Figure 3a in particular really needs to be more descriptive both in terms of the caption and figure itself. The work also uses jargon which is not sufficiently defined such as \"sound\". When a word is used in this manner to mean something technical it is necessary to define it formally.\n\nMore importantly, it is very difficult for me to see the connection between the two main concerns of this work: the TS pruning and the approach of embedding safety directly into the primitives. This seems like two entirely distinct directions and makes the overall structure of the paper confusing.\n\n## Quality and Significance\nMy first critique here is that the paper takes for granted that safety should be embedded directly into the task primitives rather than specified in the LTL. This is not obvious to me and undermines the entire direction as a result. I would greatly appreciate clarity on why we even want this in the first place. Secondly, the consequences of putting the safety behaviour into the training of the primitives is not given due consideration. My understanding is that this will make all of the task primitives sub-optimal and inflexible to cases where the constrains may be temporary. So while the domains with fixed constrains may be fine for this, the flexibility of the approach is limited greatly and by extension so is the applicability of the model. Remark 1 similarly notes a trade-off which emerges from the paper's approach to zero-shot satisfaction and the possibility of introducing sub-optimality and notes that RMs take a different approach by fine-tuning. But then why is the paper phrased as if it improves on RMs and SMs in this regard (for example on lines 471 to 473)? What is the point of being \"full-zero shot\" if the proposed method is also suboptimal at this just like the prior work which at least considers fine-tuning. \n\nFinally, Table 4 seems unreasonable to me and is poor experimental design. Perhaps I am missing something, but to compare the prior methods on a fairly arbitrary metric (number of additional symbols collected) which they were not trained to consider at all, while the proposed method explicitly optimises the metric and then claims to be superior, is fairly meaningless. I would appreciate more explanation on why this is even a fair comparison."}, "questions": {"value": "I have asked some question in the review above which I would appreciate answers to.
