Existing heuristic-based methods attempt to identify addresses belonging to the same user, but they often produce flat cluster assignments with limited modularity and are prone to errors such as merging different users together. In this work, we propose a method for refining heuristic-obtain clusters by grounding our clustering on contrastive embeddings yielded by graph neural networks . Our contribution is threefold: (i) we release a publicly available dataset of Bitcoin transaction graphs containing a substantial number of clusters; (ii) we propose a methodology for learning address embeddings consistent with heuristics, and back it up with solid theoretical foundations and empirical results; (iii) through hierarchical clustering, we allow a finer analysis of heuristic clusters and provide a quantitative criterion for flagging suspicious merges.", "tldr": "Using GNNs and Constrastive Learning to learn embedding suitable for Bitcoin address clustering.", "keywords": ["Graph Neural Networks", "Representation Learning", "Clustering", "Hierarchical Clustering", "Bitcoin"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/41fd4bbfbd8da29980ac35c709c82886ec06c6d7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e6cd9b286cda6d7cafa7a7c36b3a88c16afee52d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tackles Bitcoin address clustering by starting from standard heuristics that often over merge, then learning contrastive GNN embeddings designed to remain consistent with those heuristics.

The theoretical analysis in Section 4 appears disconnected from the paper's refinement objective. The theory provides no theoretical justification for the refinement step.\n\nW3.
