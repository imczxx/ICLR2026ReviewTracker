Our experimental findings indicate that the core bottleneck lies not only in the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs but more critically in their absence of fine-grained perception. To address this issue, we present VisuRiddles, a dedicated resource for AVR research. It consists of (i) a benchmark, collected from real-world data, for the systematic evaluation of MLLMs' AVR capabilities, and (ii) a synthesizer, which automatically generates AVR instances enriched with perceptual descriptions and reasoning chains, enabling supervised training and deeper investigation. Building on VisuRiddles, we propose a two-stage training paradigm that progressively enhances perceptual ability and strengthens reasoning, producing the Perception-Augmented Visual Reasoner (PAVR).

The structure of this paper is extremely clear, presenting a definite logical flow.\n2. The paper thoroughly discusses the deficiencies of existing general-purpose MLLMs in Abstract Visual Reasoning and validates this observation by introducing the VisuRiddles Benchmark, a comprehensive testbed covering multiple reasoning dimensions.\n3. It innovatively proposes the VisuRiddles Synthesizer, an ingenious data synthesizer that generates a diverse set of AVR instances with detailed perception annotations. These instances are highly interpretable and reusable, making this a valuable contribution for future research aimed at enhancing the AVR capabilities of MLLMs.\n4. The paper employs a systematic two-stage training paradigm (SFT+RL) that effectively enhances the model's abstract visual reasoning capabilities.\n5. The experimental section comprehensively presents the performance of current open-source and closed-source MLLMs on the VisuRiddles Benchmark, showcasing the remarkable performance achieved by the PAVR model after the two-stage training. Furthermore, well-designed ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the rationale and contribution of each component in the training process."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Detailed experimental settings and configurations should be included in the appendix to ensure the reproducibility of the reported results.\n2.  A central claim of the paper is that deficient fine-grained perception is the primary bottleneck for MLLMs on AVR tasks. While the experiment in Table 3 supports this, it also shows that commercial MLLMs achieve only around 30% accuracy on Raven-like tasks even when provided with perception descriptions ('P') as input. This raises a question: is this poor performance due to the perception descriptions still being insufficiently comprehensive, or is it due to the inherent limitations of the models' reasoning capabilities? Further experiments are required to more conclusively disentangle these factors.\n3. The trained model should also be evaluated on a suite of standard MLLM benchmarks. This would verify that the model's original, general-purpose capabilities have not been compromised by the specialized training (i.e., to check for catastrophic forgetting).\n4. The paper states that common reasoning-enhancement strategies, such as increasing model parameter scale or applying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, yield limited benefits on AVR tasks. However, it does not provide sufficient detail on the specific implementation of the CoT prompts used for evaluating the baseline models.\n5. The experiments are conducted exclusively on the Qwen-VL-7B model. To validate the generalizability of the proposed training paradigm, it should be tested on a wider range of MLLMs with varying architectures and parameter scales.\n6. The paper would be more persuasive，if it could be directly compared with other MLLMs specifically designed to enhance reasoning abilities."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The patterns in VisuRiddles are relatively simple and clean geometric shapes. If these shapes are replaced with more complex or \"noisy\" objects (such as small icons of real-world objects like cats or cars, or complex fractal patterns), will the model fail in the abstract reasoning task due to being disturbed by the semantic content of the complex objects? For a given abstract rule (such as \"the number of elements increases one by one\"), if the elements undergo a simple style change (for example, from black squares to blue triangles), will the model's accuracy be affected? This will test to what extent the model generalizes the abstract rule itself rather than merely memorizing specific visual features.\n2. The paper convincingly demonstrates that fine-grained perception is the key bottleneck. However, Table 3 shows that even when perception descriptions (denoted as \"P\") are provided, powerful models like GPT-4V still perform poorly (with an accuracy rate of approximately 30%). What is the essence of these failures? When perception prompts are provided, do the models fail to understand the prompts, or do they understand the prompts but make fundamental logical errors? If a better perception description is provided, will the models be able to correctly arrive at the answer? If not, does this prove that reasoning ability remains the core limitation?\n3. The SFT+RL mentioned in this article is a training paradigm specifically for the VisuRiddles domain. Has the final PAVR model been evaluated on standard and general multi-modal large model benchmark tests (such as MMBench, etc.)? Will such training weaken the original basic capabilities of the model?\n4. The experiments in the paper were conducted only on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Have you ever attempted to apply this SFT+RL training paradigm to other models with different parameter sizes or to other MLLM architectures?\n5. The paper states that the benefits brought by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hinting mechanism to the baseline model are limited. Could you provide the detailed information for this part?\n6.

How were 100 RAVEN questions selected from the 70k instances?\n    3. A pseudo-code description of the “Synthesis Algorithm” (Fig. 2a) would improve reproducibility.\n2. Limited methodological novelty: The approach (SFT + GRPO on Qwen2.5-VL-7B) applies standard fine-tuning methods rather than introducing new learning techniques. The contribution is mainly empirical.\n3. Unfair evaluation setup: The trained PAVR model is evaluated on the same benchmark it was fine-tuned on, whereas competing models are evaluated zero-shot. This limits the fairness and interpretability of the comparison.\n4. Missing training details: The paper does not specify the train/validation/test splits used for fine-tuning PAVR, leaving open the possibility of data leakage or overfitting to the benchmark distribution. The claimed improvements might be in-distribution effects rather than true reasoning gains.\n5. Limited analysis: While Appendix D attempts to evaluate transfer to other tasks, details are insufficient. Stronger evidence is needed to show that perceptual training benefits general reasoning.\n6. The discussion stops short of exploring why models fail across AVR dimensions. A qualitative error analysis would be helpful.\n7. The structured perceptual descriptions and reasoning chains are generated using only Gemini 2.5-Flash-Think. The paper should justify this choice and assess how dependent results are on this specific model.\n8. Missing baselines: The evaluation omits several relevant MLLMs (e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP) and non-MLLM baselines such as supervised CNNs or few-shot methods (e.g., Prototypical Networks, SNAIL, MetaBaseline).\n9. Figure 1a shows some models performing below random-guess levels without discussion or explanation.\n\n\n\nMinor comments:\n1. Describing VisuRiddles as “real-world data” is misleading since the benchmark primarily consists of synthetic, 2D, geometry-based tests.\n2. Clarify the distinction between Position and Spatiality dimensions.\n3. Specify whether few-shot evaluation was used for baseline models.\n4. The description of prior benchmark limitations in Section 2.1 (“partial reliance on external knowledge and lack breadth in reasoning coverage”) is too vague—consider providing examples.\n5. Section 2.2 should explicitly highlight how PAVR differs from prior approaches.\n6. The claim “we target the most challenging part of AVR tasks” (Section 3.1) is unsupported—please justify what makes these dimensions the most difficult.\n7.
