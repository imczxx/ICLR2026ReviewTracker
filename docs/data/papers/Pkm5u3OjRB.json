Here we avoid these computations by representing the drift in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, reducing the learning problem to solving linear systems. The key challenge becomes selecting kernels with sufficient expressiveness for the drift learning task. We address this by constructing kernels from pretrained drift or score functions, leveraging the fact that our linear systems depend only on gradients of kernel features---not the features themselves. Since pretrained drifts provide these gradients directly, we can build expressive kernels without access to the underlying feature representations. This enables seamless combination of multiple pretrained models at inference time and cross-domain enhancement through the same framework. Experiments demonstrate competitive sample quality with significantly reduced computation, consistent ensemble improvements, and successful cross-domain enhancement---even cheap, low-quality models can match expensive high-quality models when combined through our framework.", "tldr": "Training-free generative modeling by building kernels from pretrained diffusion models, enabling model combination and domain adaptation through linear solves instead of neural network training.", "keywords": ["generative models", "diffusion models", "stochastic interpolants", "kernel methods", "RKHS", "training-free", "model ensembling", "domain adaptation", "pretrained models"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b0e8953ca8642148a51d5cc71d0c349647b1ca2d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a method for ensembling pretrained diffusion models that is inspired by kernel learning. From a kernel learning perspective, the key insight is to solve the score-matching problem within the class of functions that are representable in the form $\\hat{b}_t(x) = \\langle \\nabla \\Phi(x), \\eta_t \\rangle$, where $\\Phi$ is a feature map and the inner product is in the induced RKHS. The authors show that the ground truth score is representable in such a form if the RKHS has a characteristic kernel and that the weights $\\eta_t$ can be learned by solving a system of linear equations. In practice, the authors replace the gradients $\\nabla \\Phi(x)$ with the velocity fields or score functions of a set of pretrained diffusion models, which reduces the learning problem to learning a set of global weights for each model and then sampling using linear combinations of the pretrained velocities/scores.

As the authors note, there is no guarantee that these velocity fields are in fact gradients in practice and that the resulting kernel is characteristic. This makes the theory seem somewhat superfluous: Can one use this theory to make meaningful predictions about the behavior of the method's practical implementation? Does it add much value relative to beginning with the (admittedly heuristic) ansatz that one should ensemble a set of diffusion models by taking a linear combination of their velocity fields and simply deriving the solution to the learning problem under that ansatz (i.e. lines 218-236)?\n\nIt's also unclear to me whether this in fact is a sensible strategy. For instance, wouldn't it make more sense to learn space- and time-dependent weights $\\eta^i_t(x)$? It seems to me that at sampling time, one should weight each pretrained model according to some measure of their \"confidence\" in their prediction at $x$. For instance, if each model has learned a unimodal distribution and one wishes to sample from a multimodal distribution, then $\\eta^i_t(x)$ should be large for models whose mode is close to x.\n\nBuilding on the previous point, the authors might consider adding a simple baseline for their method: Simply fix uniform weights $\\eta^i_t = \\frac 1 P$ and otherwise sample as in Algorithm 1.

Theorem 2.5, which is central to this work, relies on a relatively strong assumption that the kernel is *characteristic*. This is not that of a big problem when we have full freedom to choose which kernel, or equivalently the features, to use. However, once we get into the \"weak-to-strong\" tasks (building the drift function $b_t$ using weak pretrained models), we no longer can guarantee that the kernel is characteristic, and being able to recover $b_t$ only makes sense if $b_t$ is in the span, or at least very close to the span, of $\\nabla \\Phi_i$s. The only scenarios I can think of this happening is either (1) we use a massive amount of pretrained models so that the span gets sufficiently large, (2) when the \"weak\" models are actually already expressive enough (although this seems somewhat contrary to the set-up under consideration), or (3) the dataset lies in a very low intrinsic dimension, enough to guarantee that the true drift varies primarily in a low-dimensional subspace, so that a small ensemble of weak model suffices. Otherwise, the learned drift will be the projection of $b_t$ onto the span of $\\nabla \\Phi_i$, which can be very different from what we want to learn. This seems to be a critical gap between theoretical explanation and the actual proposed method, and I would like to hear how authors think about this. \n\n2. I can see where the naming *\"training-free\"* comes from; the \"training\" part, in practice, reduces to solving a system of linear equations. However, it seems like the training cost is just transferred to the inference part; now during inference, we have to get inference results from all of the weak models, in order to take the linear combination of them. Can we say for sure that this approach has a clear advantage over paying the cost once in the training phase? \n\n3. I am quite skeptical about the validity of the experimental results for a few reasons: (1) there are no quantitative results regarding the sample quality and the report only relies on the visual aspects, (2) only a handful of samples are shown for each experiments, not fully convincing that the model is performing well, and (3) the experiments are only on \"relatively easy\" datasets such as MNIST and Celeb-A. Testing on easier datasets is not that of a big problem, as they can serve as a proof-of-concept for a theoretical result, but the first two points are much more critical and should be discussed carefully when doing so, which the paper currently lacks.
