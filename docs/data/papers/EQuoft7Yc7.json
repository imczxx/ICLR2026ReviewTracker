Since the key contribution is to introduce modern positional encodings (PE) for representing TSP inputs in transformer-based neural solvers, **it would be more convincing to explicitly replace the coordinate projection layers in classical NCO models** (e.g., AM-Kool [ICLR 2019], POMO) and recent strong baselines (e.g., BQ, LEHD) with the proposed positional encodings, while keeping the rest of the model unchanged. Such controlled experiments would clarify whether the improvements, particularly in generalization, stem from the PE themselves.\n\n2. **The experimental results raise some concerns**. In Figure 4, the performance of **CoordNS** appears unusual. According to the paper (p.6, line 299), CoordNS essentially corresponds to a “**standard transformer backbone**.” Yet, when trained on TSP-100, it achieves only a **1.51%** gap relative to Concorde on TSP-1000—surpassing BQ, LEHD, and even [1], where [1] trains directly on TSP-1000 but still reports a **1.95%** gap. Such strong performance using raw coordinates alone seems noteworthy and warrants deeper investigation. It is unclear why the authors did not further analyze or discuss this unexpectedly strong result.\n\n3. The paper **lacks sufficiently strong SOTA baselines**. The included comparisons with BQ, LEHD, and INViT are somewhat outdated. For instance, [1], which is also attention-based, achieves competitive or better performance: its **runtime** on TSP-1K is **far lower than PENS**, with only slightly worse performance, and on TSP-10K it outperforms PENS in **both runtime and solution quality**. While PENS is trained only on TSP-100 and generalized to 100–10K, whereas [1] is trained separately at each problem size, it would still be much more convincing to report results from stronger baselines under the same setting (trained on TSP-100 and tested across scales), including both **runtime** and **optimality gap**.\n\n---\n\n**Based on the above three points, I suggest that the authors conduct controlled experiments by replacing the linear projection layers in existing models with these two PEs, and then observe whether performance improves. This would provide stronger evidence for the effectiveness of PE itself.**\n\n---\n\n4. The experiments are **limited to TSP**, with no evaluation on other combinatorial optimization problems. It is unclear why the proposed approach cannot be applied to CVRP, for example. Is the limitation due to the fact that the two positional encodings used here cannot directly encode node demands as linear projections do? If the method is inherently restricted to TSP, **the broader significance of introducing positional encodings into NCO would be somewhat diminished**. I recommend that the authors at least **discuss how CVRP demands might be incorporated**. Furthermore, since ATSP only requires a distance matrix, additional **experiments on ATSP** (with [2], [3] as baselines) would strengthen the case for the general applicability and significance of PENS.\n\n5. (minors) To improve rigor, the authors should avoid making absolute claims without sufficient literature coverage, even when qualified by phrases such as “to our knowledge.” For example, on p.2 line 99, the statement “the only ones to use distance matrices directly” is too strong. A simple literature search (or even directly using an LLM to deepresearch) may reveal additional NCO works that employ distance matrices [2,3,4].
