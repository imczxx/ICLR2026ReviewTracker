Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches. Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures. Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical performance.", "tldr": "We uncover a theoretical bridge between deep one-class classification (e.g., Deep SVDD) and a class of normalizing flows called Uniformly Scaling Flows (USFs).", "keywords": ["anomaly detection", "normalizing flows", "one-class classification", "representation learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b03d81395f56c2a32058f5b0608882b2d879d582.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/92ce3625c47d78b40a7e0972236bd98e1c8db377.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper connects Deep SVDD and normalizing flows for anomaly detection by introducing a subclass called Uniformly Scaling Flows (USFs), where the Jacobian determinant is constant across inputs.

In experiments, they replace affine coupling layers with additive USF layers in existing flow-based detectors (FastFlow, CFlow, U-Flow) using frozen pretrained backbones.

Modern benchmarks (e.g., ADBench, MVTec, VisA) consistently show that simple feature-based or transformer-based approaches, contrastive learning, and diffusion-based detectors far outperform Deep SVDD, which is now mostly cited for historical context. As a result, grounding the paper’s core theory around an outdated baseline places it in an awkward position. The conceptual bridge it draws may be elegant, but its practical impact is limited unless validated against current methods.\n-  The paper frames Uniformly Scaling Flows (USFs) as a key innovation for removing input-dependent volume effects, but constant-Jacobian / volume-preserving flows have long existed in the literature (e.g., NICE; FlowSVDD; OneFlow), and have already been applied specifically to anomaly detection to avoid SVDD-style collapse. As such, the only substantial novelty lies in the formal SVDD–USF MLE equivalence and the controlled additive-vs-affine ablations, not in the idea of using constant-determinant flows itself. \n- The empirical section mostly replaces affine coupling with additive coupling in pre-existing architectures (FastFlow, CFlow, U-Flow) using pretrained frozen features. The practical contribution is thus modest. It is more of an architectural ablation than a fundamentally new detection framework. The theoretical bridge to Deep SVDD does not clearly lead to a new practical algorithm beyond this substitution.\n- Each baseline uses a different pretrained backbone (ResNet-18, WRN-50-2, CaiT), so absolute numbers are not directly comparable across architectures; only within-architecture swaps are fair. A shared backbone control would strengthen the empirical claims.\n- In the main text, in Proposition 1, $F_\\alpha(x)=x/(\\alpha||x||)$ gives $||F_\\alpha(x)||\\equiv 1/\\alpha$ for all $x\\neq0$, so the claimed monotonicity $||x||\\uparrow\\Rightarrow||F_\\alpha(x)||\\downarrow$ is false; yet the loss is then (incorrectly) written as $\\alpha^{-2}\\mathbb{E}||x||^{-2}$. In Appendix B.4, $F_\\alpha$ is redefined as the scalar $1/(\\alpha|x|)$ but treated as vector-valued, creating a type mismatch with the Deep-SVDD loss $\\mathbb{E}||F(X)-c||^2$. A minimal fix is the vector-valued radial inversion $F_\\alpha(x)=x/(\\alpha||x||^2)$ with $F_\\alpha(0)=0$, which yields the intended ordering and $L=\\alpha^{-2}\\mathbb{E}\\big[1/||x||^2\\big]=1/\\big(\\alpha^2(d-2)\\big)$ for $d>2$.\n- The citations should be in parentheses using \\citep."}, "questions": {"value": "- How sensitive are the reported gains to the choice of pretrained backbone?
