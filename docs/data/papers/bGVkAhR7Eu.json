However, existing approaches often produce coarse-grained scores and lack detailed reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as zero-shot evaluators, they remain susceptible to bias, inconsistencies with human judgment, and limited transparency in scoring decisions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SAS-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based SAS tasks. SAS-Bench provides fine-grained, step-wise scoring, expert-annotated error categories, and a diverse range of question types derived from real-world subject-specific exams. This benchmark facilitates detailed evaluation of model reasoning processes and explainability. We also release an open-source dataset containing 1,030 questions and 4,109 student responses, each annotated by domain experts. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments with various LLMs, identifying major challenges in scoring science-related questions and highlighting the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in improving scoring accuracy. Our work offers valuable insights into the development of more robust, fair, and educationally meaningful LLM-based evaluation systems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Automated Assessment", "Short Answer Scoring", "LLM-as-a-Judge"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6a6a28854a39701e1b0239661f8d9712fc72b8b1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a new dataset and evaluation framework for automated short-answer scoring (SAS).

It contains diverse question types (science, English, math proofs, etc.) and expert annotations. \n- The experiments include diverse comparisons (e.g., analyses of model size, reasoning approach, and training paradigm) yields important insights.

The former dataset is introduced in the Related Work but not compared explicitly with SAS-Bench, and the paper associated with the latter dataset (Myroslava et al., 2013) is in the reference list but not discussed at all in the paper. The authors claim SAS-Bench is the first benchmark specifically tailored for SAS with LLMs, but they do not articulate how its novelty goes beyond combining known elements (e.g., reference answers and multidimensional scoring) in a new dataset.\n- The performance tables and charts should include a measure of variance. Since LLM outputs can be stochastic, reporting single-run results without any measure of uncertainty means we can’t tell if differences between models are significant or just noise. Similarly, the authors do not report inter-annotator agreement in the form of Cohen's kappa coefficient for their expert labels.\n- The SAS-Bench dataset, while diverse in subjects, is narrow in source. This raises concerns about how the benchmark’s insights would generalize to other contexts; e.g., different countries’ exams, free-form vs. structured answers, etc. The paper does not discuss whether models performing well on SAS-Bench would generalize to other curricula or languages. \n- A portion of student responses were synthetically granted by LLMs, and then annotated, to augment real answers.

As far as I can tell, none of these works deal with SAS, which results in the question: why are these works used as motivation for creating an SAS benchmark? Additionally, the gap presented in Appendix J also seems somewhat insignificant.  In general, it seems like LLMs already perform relatively well (see next point) on the benchmark, which questions the importance of SAS-Bench to the community. \n- Looking at the consistency between experts and LLMs (CCS), it seems like the top model, V3, has a score of over 74\\%.

Reference responses are first generated by only 3 students, thereby lacking diversity. LLMs are then prompted to diversify and introduce errors to generate the final set of positive and negative responses. How well do LLMs perform at this synthetic task? Each LLM-based synthetic step should be evaluated for performance and error analysis. Prior work has shown prompting to be a poor simulator of students, with fine-tuning of real-world student responses required (SMART: Simulated Students Aligned with Item Response Theory for Question Difficulty Prediction, EMNLP 2025).\n* Generalizability to new question banks and domains: Since the error taxonomy, a critical component to get fine-grained analysis,  involves a manual intervention for consolidation and refinement, how generalizable is this scoring approach for fine-grained analysis to Q from other exams/benchmarks? Was a completely automated LLM-based approach (with few-shot human-written examples) tried out?\n* What is the human performance upper bound? No inter-annotator agreement is reported on the error and scoring metrics? Without human performance and agreement, we don’t know whether this task is well defined and how much behind/ahead LLM performance is compared to humans.\n* Motivation: Breaking answers into steps seems intuitive to get fine-grained analysis. However, scoring each step and then adding all scores to arrive at the overall score needs to be justified. Usually, scoring rubrics include key intermediate results needed for different scores, or which missing steps/results would lead in a deduction of points. For example, for reasoning-based domains like math and physics, there could be multiple reasoning paths with varied steps, as well as many steps (max steps for math reported is 25). Students could also include simpler steps or combine or omit them. Won’t this make an alignment between the sum of step-scores and the overall score hard? \n    * Instead of a step-score, simply using binary step correctness seems sufficient to provide fine-grained analysis as well as a useful indicator to arrive at the final score. This could also result in simplified evaluation metrics, with line 313 stating an instability in step-wise consistency evaluation. For example, why does the correct step 1 in Figure 2 get a score of 2, and the other correct steps get a score of 1? Won’t these per-step scoring rubrics be hard to design to avoid variance and ensure high agreement? For math and physics, line 474 states that step-wise labels may mislead the model.\n    * Does adding step-wise evaluation help overall scoring performance (QWK)? The key aim is to improve overall scoring, since even if the fine-grained analysis is useful, if the overall scoring is poor, these models are not practically useful. Line 391 states that adding step-wise consistency introduces additional challenges to the model. Compared with SOTA overall-only scoring baselines, which omit step-wise analysis, how far ahead/behind are SAS-bench-trained models?\n* What is the motivation behind the ECS metric design; does it extend a well-accepted existing metric? Does it correlate with human evaluation? When working with error distributions and frequencies, doesn’t ECS omit the ordering of steps with their errors? Including ordering seems key since an ordered list of steps with errors is being evaluated. Further, results on ECS (table 3) vary notably across different subjects and question types (line 454), showing that a different model is usually the best for different question types, and also has high variance.
