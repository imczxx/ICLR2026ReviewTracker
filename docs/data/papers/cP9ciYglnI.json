In the context of neuroimaging data, the accurate labeling of cortical sulci is crucial for providing deep insights into the link between cortical folding patterns and cognitive functions. Yet, fully automatic methods often struggle with labeling small and shallow sulci due to their high anatomical variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. In this context, interactive segmentation may offer a promising alternative by incorporating minimal human input to refine labels. However, recent learning-based interactive approaches often rely on 2D projections of surface data, typically designed for generic and relatively small 3D meshes. This dimensional simplification inherently limits their ability to capture subtle folds and deeply buried structures of cortical surfaces. In this paper, we introduce a shape-adaptive guidance signal for interactive cortical sulcal labeling using spherical convolutional neural networks. Thanks to the use of spherical mapping, our approach preserves structural information without the need for sacrificing anatomical details. To effectively encode user clicks along cortical folding patterns, we solve the eikonal equation with a speed function that incorporates the mean curvature of the cortical surface unlike conventional encoding schemes using equidistance. This curvature-aware signal captures fine-grained anatomical details to guide the neural network focus on the intended refinement. Experimental results on 72 subjects with 17 sulci on the lateral prefrontal cortex show that even a single click using the proposed encoding scheme outperforms fully automatic methods and equidistance schemes, while achieving both efficiency and improved labeling accuracy.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Spherical CNN", "Interactive Segmentation", "Cortical Sulci", "Lateral Prefronal Cortex"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f1926095e35c9d52987d4a61234c4d0cf4527b25.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focused on a shape-adaptive guidance signal for promptable segmentation of cortical sulci.

Generalization to new tasks is key in interactive segmentation methods, but the paper does not evaluate performance for previously unseen regions.\n\nFor interactive tools, efficiency is also an important consideration. Yet no runtime or real-use performance stats are provided.\n\nThe baseline setup in Section 4.2 is unclear on whether these methods are retrained on the same 17 labels and data splits outlined in Section 3.3, or if they are used off the shelf. While no prior interactive sulcal-surface labeling baselines exist, numerous interactive image segmentation tools do. A comparison against a universal model such as SAM, using planar projections of sulcal and curvature maps as input, would help clarify whether a specialized approach is necessary.\n\nThe paper suggests that the chosen $\\sigma$ values for the ADT and disk-based guidance signals are sufficiently small to capture fine-grained sulcal branches. However, many interactive segmentation methods perform well using single-pixel click encodings. It is not convincing that the selected $\\sigma$ values are small enough, as Figure 4 shows continued improvement as ADT $\\sigma$ decreases.\n\nThe introduction provides a solid overview but is overly long. The contribution could be presented far more quickly, with background details moved to a structured Related Work section.\n\nFigures also need attention. The plots in Figure 4 are hard to interpret (some x-axis labels are missing, the scaling is not optimal, improvements are masked by stacked bars). Figure 2 introduced negative clicks, but there is no in depth methodological or experimental discussion of this.\n\nOverall, while the problem is important, the focus on shallow sulcal regions gives the work a relatively narrow scope. Many cortical labeling tasks involve regions that span multiple sulci or gyri or rely on feature maps other than the three considered here."}, "questions": {"value": "Line 335: \"To ensure labels were constrained to sulcal regions, outputs with negative curv values were discarded\" Could the authors clarify this step? It seems important but is not clearly explained\n\nSince the same targets are used for evaluation, how does the model perform without any signal guidance at all (i.e. when trained directly for multiclass segmentation)?\n\nIn Figure 6, it seems that manual labels closely follow sulcal map borders. Instead of solving the eikonal equation with a speed function, why not simply mask the ADT or disk signal using the positive sulcal map?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "WKykNNDdEw", "forum": "cP9ciYglnI", "replyto": "cP9ciYglnI", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18472/Reviewer_AYyV"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18472/Reviewer_AYyV"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18472/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761952345928, "cdate": 1761952345928, "tmdate": 1762928162457, "mdate": 1762928162457, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
