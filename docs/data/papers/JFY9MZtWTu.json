Multi-model serving further complicates these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees and general applicability.\n\nWe present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the optimal trade-off in polynomial time.\n\nWe validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy–latency trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and cascaded models.", "tldr": "T-Tamer optimally balances accuracy–latency trade-offs in cascaded inference using recall-based dynamic indexing.", "keywords": ["Cascaded Inference", "Early-Exit Models", "Multi-Model Serving", "Provable Optimality"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5d523701f2cc514d906b3df9b4f9b6a57e50b664.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a theoretical framework to tackle trade-offs in ML serving when there are two objectives.
