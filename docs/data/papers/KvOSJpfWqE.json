Existing research has overlooked the systematic assessment of LLMs’ criminal potential in realistic interactions, where criminal potential is defined as the risk of producing harmful behaviors such as deception and blame-shifting under adversarial settings that could facilitate unlawful activities. Therefore, we propose a unified framework PRISON, to quantify LLMs' criminal potential across five traits: False Statements, Frame-Up, Psychological Manipulation, Emotional Disguise, and Moral Disengagement. Using structured crime scenarios grounded in reality, we evaluate both criminal potential and anti-crime ability of LLMs. Results show that state-of-the-art LLMs frequently exhibit emergent criminal tendencies, such as proposing misleading statements or evasion tactics, even without explicit instructions. Moreover, when placed in a detective role, models recognize deceptive behavior with only 44\\% accuracy on average, revealing a striking mismatch between expressing and detecting criminal traits. These findings underscore the urgent need for adversarial robustness, behavioral alignment, and safety mechanisms before broader LLM deployment.", "tldr": "To assess harmful behaviors in adversarial contexts, we propose PRISON, a framework measuring LLMs’ criminal potential and anti-crime ability, showing that advanced models often display such traits but fail to reliably detect them.", "keywords": ["Large Language Models (LLMs)", "Criminal Potential", "Behavioral Safety", "Social Impact"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f8777e5bd1b43296aa681d2d6892d18f40a677c1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces PRISON, a novel framework for assessing the capabilities of LLMs to a) develop criminal strategies and b) detect criminal acts.

The first aspect of the study explores whether LLMs can come up with valid, illegal/harmful strategies given the individual setting.

The findings that there exists a mismatch between criminal actions and criminal detection are intriguing. I also like that the paper not only distinguishes between criminal/non-criminal but also analyzes the different kinds of criminal traits.\n- The experimental evaluation covers multiple LLMs (8 different models) and settings.

While I understand the intention behind the dataset, I am not fully convinced that the evaluations genuinely assess a model’s criminal capabilities. When looking at examples in the Appendix (e.g., Table 5), it often feels as if the model is writing a novel. On one hand, such narrative-style outputs could indeed be misused for criminal purposes. However, I am not sure whether these outputs are actually harmful, since it remains unclear to what extent the proposed strategies go beyond straightforward ideas or common scenes from movies. While, in another context, detailed instructions for building a bomb could clearly cause harm, suggesting to push a car into a lake (which requires no expert knowledge) seems more like repeating a movie or book scenario. I understand that we want LLMs to avoid producing such suggestions, but given that the model appears to be engaging in creative writing, this behavior might be acceptable in some cases.\n- The crime detection capabilities of LLMs are not compared against a human baseline. Since LLMs have less information than the “God-setting,” a human baseline would help quantify the actual performance gap. Given that some contextual information is missing from the detection model’s input, it might be that certain actions cannot be reliably classified as criminal.\n- As the framework is based on only ten movies, the diversity of scenarios may be limited.\n- No large reasoning models, such as Qwen3 or DeepSeek-R1, are evaluated. It would be interesting to see whether stronger reasoning capabilities improve a model’s ability to either generate or detect criminal content.\n\nSmall remark:\n- There is a missing space in L046."}, "questions": {"value": "- How does a human baseline perform on the detection task compared to the LLMs?

Grounding the five-trait taxonomy in established psychometric instruments from criminal psychology  provides a strong theoretical foundation that is often lacking in other safety benchmarks.

The PRISON framework is a valuable addition, offering a creative way to stress-test models' tendencies toward criminal expression and their ability to detect manipulative behavior.

For humans as well, generating deception is often easier than detecting it, since detection requires background knowledge and reasoning about intent. It would strengthen the paper if the authors could further analyze whether this gap truly indicates a model limitation or simply the inherent difficulty of the task.\n\n---\n(2) Use of Film-Based Scenarios:\n\nLines 220–221 mention that the scenarios are adapted from films. However, film plots are not necessarily realistic representations of real-world criminal behavior. Why not use more authentic materials such as court transcripts, online forums, or real-world investigative documents to improve realism and ecological validity?\n\n---\n(3) Lack of Technical Analysis:\n\nThe performance gap essentially reflects two underlying technical issues:\n- insufficient safety alignment, since the model still tends to follow harmful or deceptive instructions; and\n- limited long-context understanding, as detecting criminal or deceptive behavior often requires reasoning over extended context.\nIt would be helpful if the authors could analyze these aspects more deeply to clarify the technical reasons behind the observed gap."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "kcRkRGljXr", "forum": "KvOSJpfWqE", "replyto": "KvOSJpfWqE", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16169/Reviewer_sCDD"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16169/Reviewer_sCDD"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16169/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762401185592, "cdate": 1762401185592, "tmdate": 1762926331862, "mdate": 1762926331862, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
