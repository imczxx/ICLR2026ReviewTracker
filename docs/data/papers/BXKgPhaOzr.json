However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce an evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. In our extensive experiments totaling over 5,154 GPU-days, we explore full, partial, and parameter-efficient adaptation methods across various task formats, context lengths, sampling methods, and data compositions. The resulting evaluator achieves parity with task-specific baselines using a single unified checkpoint. Human studies across seven diverse environments confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a lightweight, adaptable, and semantics-aware evaluator for world models.", "tldr": "We propose a protocol for evaluating world models and introduce UNIVERSE, a method that adapts vision-language models to support it via unified finetuning", "keywords": ["world models", "vision-language models", "generative models", "adaptation", "evaluation protocols"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/04fb20181d5220a0c24e627bf17ebd22db0545c1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes UNIVERSE, a new VLM-based method for the evaluation of \"action recognition\" and \"character recognition\" tasks over world model generations in a visually-rich game (Bleeding Edge).\nPerformance on these tasks are considered as a proxy metric / indicator of world model generation quality.\n\nThe paper conducts an extensive empirical case study on a visually-rich game (Bleeding Edge).\nFirst, the authors investigate performance on ground truth data, validating alignment on valid frame and action sequences, and comparing to simple VLM baselines.\nThen, the authors investigate design choices such as data composition for tuning the performance of the approach.\nLastly, the authors study the evaluation quality of the proposed method on the two tasks on data generated by world models by conducting a human study, where humans rate the outputs of the algorithm."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The idea of using VLMs for semantic tasks evaluation as a proxy for generation quality evaluation is new and interesting.\n- The method presents multiple options for training / fine-tuning different subsets of parameters.

The appendix is detailed and includes further results and analysis to support the method and the design choices.\n- For the included experiments, the methodology is generally solid.\n- Open source code, evaluation data, and human annotation data."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "`W1`: The paper only presents VLM baselines for world model evaluation, which, according to the authors, were never used before for that purpose. How the method compares to simple world model evaluation approaches such as measuring mean squared error or FVD (between generations and ground truth using a prefix as initial context) using a held out test set, or training control policies under various reward signals (goals) through world model interaction and measuring success via cumulative returns? The paper should include a comparison to existing evaluation baselines.\n\n`W2`: The results in Fig. 9 suggest poor accuracy of the method on setting 8, which involves data generated by a smaller model. The authors attributed this to a \"resolution mismatch\". However, I suspect that since smaller models tend to generate trajectories that deviate more significantly from the ground truth, the results could indicate that the method is perhaps more indicative for correct or higher quality generations, while it may be failing to identify cases where the world model generations diverged from the ground truth, which are the more important subset of cases to capture. \n\nThis is also related to the rollout filtering concern below.\n\n\n`W3`: Rollout Filtering: I am concerned that the filtering procedure in the paper may filter out poor generation cases, leaving mostly high-quality, simpler (and easier to classify), rollouts. Importantly, in cases where the world model failed to generate the correct dynamics given the sequence of actions (conditioning), the output could be among the filtered sequences. Thus, the results may be indicative for successful generations, but not for poor ones. \n\nGiven the significant efforts put into this paper, I would suggest to collect a reasonable test set of cases where the generated content (dynamics) deviates from *the ground truth*, i.e., the actual dynamics under the same \"raw\" actions (for conditioning) starting from the same context, in a deterministic environment. Then, demonstrate that the proposed approach reliably captures these cases. \nPreferably, also consider inaccurate world models such as the small model used in the paper. Aim for generating both (1) poor reconstructions examples (blur, artifacts, etc.), and (2) incorrect but convincing dynamics that look valid but deviate from the ground truth.\n\n\n`W4`: The proposed evaluator outputs are given in natural language. Given only the description in the paper, it is unclear how this method would be applied in a practical world model evaluation setting (e.g., in a new environment). Specifically:\n1. Does the method requires to collect some test set of trajectories from the real environment serving as reference trajectories? \n2. How would the questions and answers automatically adapt to a new environment? \n3. Suppose that we have generated a set of trajectories (inference) with a world model. The proposed evaluator emitted a corresponding set of answers / strings. How the approach determines the quality of the generations? (suppose each generated trajectory could be long and span multiple 14-frame segments). How performance is aggregated over a single trajectory that spans multiple segments?\n4. Is the approach valid only for evaluating very short trajectory segments? \n5. What exactly is required for applying this method in an independent application? and how to obtain a single aggregated score that reflects the generation quality?\n\nThe paper should includes the answers to these questions clearly.\n\n\n`W5`: The method seems to rely heavily on the \"Description Generation\" step (line 188), for converting sequences of frames and raw actions to language form. It is non-trivial to assume that such an approach would work reliably in general domains. Here, inferring character movement direction in third person view could be much easier than intricate finger movements in first person view for example.\n\nIt is unclear how reliable this step is, i.e., how reliably it captures cases where the actions are not aligned with the generated frames (which typically occurs when the world model is given an action sequence that leads to a novel dynamics behavior that was not sufficiently explored / observed and thus is not properly represented in the training data). I suggest to carry a specific study on this aspect, similarly to that I proposed in `W3` above, and show that (hopefully) the proposed approach is indeed reliable.\n\n\n\n`W6`: Claiming for effective world model quality evaluation method, as the paper title and abstract suggest, requires several diverse benchmarks (environments / games) with diverse dynamics (between benchmarks), studies that show evaluation quality over longer horizons (could be aggregated scores over 14 frame segments in your case), and more extensive studies, as suggested above. Demonstrating that a method works on a single game (although with multiple \"stages\" / \"maps\") does not sufficiently support such a general claim. \n\n\n`W7`: While the motivation and claims suggest a very general method for world model evaluation, e.g., \"a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints\" (abstract) and \"establishing UNIVERSE as a lightweight, adaptable, and semantics-aware evaluator for world models.\" (abstract), in practice the approach is only valid for video environments, and only evaluates action and character recognition over very short horizons. I expect that the claims would represent the method more accurately, i.e., limit the scope of the claims.\n\n\n\n`W8`: \"Assesses whether generated sequences accurately reflect the effects of agent actions ***at each timestep***\" (line 173).\nThis claim is inaccurate, as the method was only validated at a coarser action granularity (language description).\n\n\n`W9`: line 1454, the variable letter `R` was abused, re-defined for both recall and the set of response n-grams.  \n\n\n`W10`: line 1768: large-scale and small scale models swapped?\n\n\n`W11`:\n> The task distribution favors Action Recognition (αAR = 0.8) ***due to its stronger causal grounding*** (line 255)\n\nPlease support this claim, it is non-trivial.\n\n\n`W12`: The binary vs. multiple-choice vs. open-ended comparisons are presented throughout the results. First, it is not clear enough that these are complementary sets of QA (the comparison could also suggest that you compare different formats of presenting the Q/A). Second, while presenting the results for all QA types provide empirical insight, I think it is not the most important aspect of the work and thus it is somewhat confusing as it takes a very significant real-estate in the main paper. I believe that the result would be clearer by presenting aggregated scores first, to indicate overall performance clearly, in the same way that the final generation quality evaluation (score) is given, and present the results for the separate QA types later (or in the appendix). \nTo be clear, I do not consider this as a major weakness."}, "questions": {"value": "`Q1`: in \"Rollouts Generation\" (line 1774), how exactly the action sequence used for conditioning is determined? How the 1 sec context was chosen?\n\n`Q2`: \"d = Describe(c(1:L), m).\" (line 1223). How exactly `Describe` works? Is it trained specifically on data of this game? Is it necessary to train such model in order to use the method to evaluate world models in practice? \n\n`Q3`: How the performance of UNIVERSE on character recognition in Figure 1 align with those in Figure 2 (right)? i.e., 99%+ vs. 84%?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "hmjbmdxmXU", "forum": "BXKgPhaOzr", "replyto": "BXKgPhaOzr", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20311/Reviewer_dQyk"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20311/Reviewer_dQyk"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20311/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760867919878, "cdate": 1760867919878, "tmdate": 1762933775523, "mdate": 1762933775523, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a method for training a VLM to evaluate the action and character consistency of a world model.

I would strongly encourage the authors to provide such comparisons, specifically measuring how different evaluation protocols correlate with human judgments on identical rollouts. This would substantiate the claim that UNIVERSE offers necessary improvements over existing tools.\n\n2. **Unclear positioning of methodological contribution:** The core technical approach—fine-tuning only the projection head—appears to be a well-established practice in VLM training literature (often called the \"alignment stage\"). While applying this effectively to a new domain is valuable, I suggest the authors clarify whether this represents a novel discovery or an effective application of known techniques. This would help readers better understand the nature and scope of the contribution.\n\n3. **Incomplete coverage of foundational related work:** I notice that the paper does not cite some foundational work in the \"model-as-judge\" paradigm, particularly Zheng et al.

Since UNIVERSE directly extends this paradigm to multimodal evaluation, I recommend including this reference to provide clearer intellectual lineage.\n\n4. **Limited scope of generalization validation:** While the paper evaluates 8 settings, all data comes from a single game (Bleeding Edge) environment. I observed that performance degrades noticeably at lower resolutions (Setting 8: 56.55% on AR), suggesting sensitivity to distribution shifts. I would encourage testing on more diverse world model types (e.g., autonomous driving, robotics) to better understand generalization capabilities.\n\n5. **Potential circular reasoning in baseline comparisons:** The \"task-specific baselines\" mentioned in the paper appear to be other variants trained by the authors rather than established external methods.
