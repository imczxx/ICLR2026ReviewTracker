To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD, a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations, all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~3.8x speedup in image generation and ~10x speedup in video generation compared to standard AR decoding, without any degradation in output quality.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["speculative decoding", "jacobi decoding", "autoregressive visual generation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1004cbf1e4bdb8879c998d49b9425fc359afa467.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f31b71a90b6ce0ff4216ac09a7a23206c597973f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the slow inference of autoregressive (AR) visual models by improving Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD).

The Y-axis is restricted to an extremely narrow range (59.0–61.0), which makes the \"strong correlation\" difficult to confirm. The argument would be far more compelling if SJD, GS-SJD, and MC-SJD were all plotted on the same graph. This direct comparison would clearly visualize whether the proposed methods truly shift performance toward lower token difference and lower NFE, which is central to the paper's hypothesis.\n\t\n2. **Apparent Discrepancy Between Theory and Results**\n\t* An interesting discrepancy arises in Table 1 ($L=32$), where the theoretically suboptimal $\\pi_{GS}$ (Gumbel Coupling) achieves a better NFE than the \"optimal\" $\\pi_{MC}$. The paper fails to provide any analysis for this critical discrepancy, undermining its own central argument.\n\t\n3. **Incomplete Experimental Reporting**\n\t* Tables 2 and 3 report results for an ambiguous \"Ours\" metric, failing to specify whether $\\pi_{MC}$ or $\\pi_{GS}$ was used. As established in Weakness 2 (and Table 1), the performance trade-off between $\\pi_{MC}$ and $\\pi_{GS}$ seems inconsistent and setup-dependent. Therefore, it would be necessary to report results for both methods to provide a complete and transparent comparison.\n\t* Table 3 (Janus-Pro) omits wall-clock latency. This is a critical metric for evaluating the method's practical benefit, especially given the computational overhead of $\\pi_{MC}$ and $\\pi_{GS}$ observed in Table 1.\n\t* The validation for each task is confined to a single dataset (MSCOCO2017 for images, real-state-10k for video), which limits the assessment of the method's generalizability.\n\n4. **Lack of Limitation**\n\t* The paper does not provide any discussions regarding limitations."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The paper speculates that Gumbel Coupling ($\\pi_{GS}$) promotes \"long-range stabilization\". Could the authors elaborate on this concept? Specifically, what is the mechanism of this stabilization (e.g., how does sharing the same Gumbel noise across all iterations achieve this effect), and what is its concrete role in the decoding process? Does it, for example, help the entire sequence trajectory converge to a stable state more quickly?\n\n2. Following the first question and weakness 2, Table 1 shows that at $L=32$, $\\pi_{GS}$ achieves a better NFE than the theoretically optimal $\\pi_{MC}$. Does this finding suggest that the \"greedy\" optimization of $\\pi_{MC}$ (maximizing immediate $t$ vs. $t-1$ collision) is not always the globally optimal strategy for minimizing total NFE? Does it imply that, depending on the setup (like window size L, model, or task, etc), the \"long-range\" approach of $\\pi_{GS}$ can actually be the superior strategy?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "VyawTGJI84", "forum": "7a95PGL0Up", "replyto": "7a95PGL0Up", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3615/Reviewer_cQ2e"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3615/Reviewer_cQ2e"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3615/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761982096123, "cdate": 1761982096123, "tmdate": 1762916873278, "mdate": 1762916873278, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors show that the bottleneck in Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD), low acceptance due to independent draft sampling, can be removed by coupling the draft distributions across iterations.
