Operator learning approximates their solution operators, enabling fast inference after training across diverse problem instances and strong generalization. While recent advances have proposed unsupervised methods that mitigate the cost of data generation, classical neural network–based approaches remain computationally expensive for high-dimensional operators and fine-resolution problems. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum--classical hybrid framework for unsupervised spectral operator learning. Our approach predicts spectral coefficients using quantum circuits, with gate parameters mapped from PDE instances (e.g., forcing functions or PDE parameters) via a classical neural network. To improve efficiency and feasibility, we introduce a training objective that requires fewer measurement repetitions than standard variational quantum linear solvers (VQLS). With this, we design shallower circuits by replacing controlled-unitary gates with direct Pauli measurements, which in turn allows grouping of commuting measurement operators for further reduction in runtime. The objective also resolves the sign ambiguity inherent in standard VQLS and guarantees recovery of the correct solution sign for PDEs. Overall, our framework reduces the computational cost and improves solution accuracy of VQLS, while also demonstrating the potential efficiency and scalability advantages of quantum operator learning over classical machine learning approaches. We validate our framework on one- and two-dimensional reaction--diffusion, Helmholtz, and convection--diffusion equations under diverse boundary conditions, achieving relative errors below $1\\%$.", "tldr": "We propose a novel quantum--classical hybrid framework for spectral operator learning that reduces computational cost and efficiently solves diverse PDEs.", "keywords": ["Variational Quantum Linear Solver", "Spectral Operator Learning", "Operator Learning", "Quantum Machine Learning", "Spectral Methods"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4255c392c96644d707ef90253ac3345f6723d8ff.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/1c1fa8e21652a563a05f1f8f6c65b2e7060532c7.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The author provides a hybrid quantum-classical method to solve the PDE by incorporating the classical neural network parameterised quantum states, the VQLS solver, and the improved loss function.

A Novel and Critical Improvement to VQLS: The paper's most significant contribution is the new \"overlap cost function\" (Eq. 7). This is a genuine and valuable innovation. It correctly identifies two crippling flaws in the standard VQLS (Eq. 5): its $O(L^2)$ complexity and its \"sign ambiguity\" (due to the fidelity loss $\\propto |\\cdot|^2$). The proposed loss function elegantly solves both problems simultaneously: it is linear (not quadratic), thus preserving the solution's sign, and its numerator reduces the complexity to a single summation $O(L)$. This makes VQLS a much more viable algorithm for physical problems like PDEs.\n2. Intelligent Hybrid Framework Design: The proposed AI-quantum architecture is well-motivated. It correctly identifies the $O(K^2)$ bottleneck of purely classical spectral operator learning. The proposed \"division of labor\"—using a classical NN for the \"easy\" $K \\to n$ (where $n=\\log K$) parameter mapping and a quantum circuit for the \"hard\" $n \\to K$ state preparation—is a theoretically sound and intelligent approach to tackling this classical scaling challenge."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Despite the strength of its proposed loss function, the paper's central claim of a \"quantum advantage\" (i.e., the $O(K \\log K)$ complexity) rests on a fatal theoretical assumption that is never justified. Furthermore, the experimental validation is methodologically flawed, failing to provide convincing evidence of the model's true accuracy.\n1. The \"Quantum Advantage\" Claim is Based on an Unjustified Expressibility Assumption: The paper's entire $O(K \\log K)$ complexity argument is built on a \"missing\" assumption: that a shallow quantum circuit with $O(\\text{poly}(n)) = O(\\text{poly}(\\log K))$ parameters has sufficient expressibility to approximate the $K$-dimensional solution $\\alpha$ to a high degree of accuracy.\n2. The Core Complexity Claim is Theoretically Unsound: This assumption is well-known to be false. The quantum variational algorithm literature has established that for an ansatz to be \"universal\" (i.e., able to approximate any state in the $K$-dimensional space), its depth must scale exponentially with $n$, i.e., $O(\\text{poly}(K))$. A shallow $O(\\text{poly}(\\log K))$ ansatz can only represent a vanishingly small fraction of the solution space. The paper completely ignores this fundamental trade-off between ansatz depth (cost) and approximation error (accuracy), which invalidates its central complexity claim.\n3. Critical Hyperparameters are Omitted: Compounding the theoretical flaw above, the paper is critically vague about its experimental setup. It provides extensive detail on the classical network's architecture (Table 3), but I could not find any mention of the quantum circuit's depth ($l_V$). This is the single most important hyperparameter for determining the model's expressibility and cost, and its omission is a serious flaw in reproducibility and transparency.\n4. Inappropriate Plotting for True Solution: While interpolation plotting for the predicted solution is acceptable due to the resolution limitations of the model, it is problematic that the true solution also seems to use interpolated plots. This raises concerns regarding the validity of the error calculations, as it is unclear whether the true solution was computed at the same resolution as the predicted solution or at a higher resolution. The authors should clarify this issue and ensure that the true solution used in error computations is based on a numerically reliable resolution."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "U9A1L5vFZk", "forum": "92yJJKmx5s", "replyto": "92yJJKmx5s", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18987/Reviewer_873B"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18987/Reviewer_873B"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18987/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761986930489, "cdate": 1761986930489, "tmdate": 1762931041650, "mdate": 1762931041650, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a novel resource-efficient quantum-classical approach called the neural variational quantum linear solver (NVQLS) that combines neural operator learning with the efficiency of quantum linear solvers.
