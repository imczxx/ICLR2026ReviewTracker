Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance. Our codes will be released upon acceptance.", "tldr": "Discovering interpretable and deployable symbolic policies for traffic signal control", "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning", "traffic signal control", "Monte Carlo tree search"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cc11ffbf343d05a479a760dc4011550738b5e883.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/8bae87a87bcfae82bdf87e68a4f3773646d300f9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposed a Monte Carlo Tree Search method to improve the interpretability of traffic signal control.

I still give the paper a good rating for clarity because -- once I understood the method -- I think the organization makes sense. So this weakness is more about, \"could the paper have been more clear?\" My confusion was that MCTS is usually not a learning method itself but is a decision-time search method. So at first I expected the method to use MCTS to select the next phase. There then appeared to be no learning in the paper which would make it out of ICLR's scope. Ultimately, I see that MCTS is used **offline** to learn a fixed priority function. This is not a major weakness but I believe more clarity could be added in this regard.\n- Table 1's font is difficult to read without zooming in a lot.\n- It wasn't fully clear how datasets are being used.
