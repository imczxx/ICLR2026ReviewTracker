Data poisoning represents a standard approach for embedding triggers into victim models. Current backdoor detectors struggle to separate trigger-injected samples from the poisoned dataset, which severely suffer from two dilemmas. (1) Modern backdoor features are usually highly coupled with benign features. Existing detectors are almost pixel-based methods, which critically hinder the recognition performance of backdoor features. (2) Owing to the prior lack of poisoned sample distributions, most detectors are restricted to employing approaches akin to unsupervised clustering-based methods. Thus, they heavily rely on sufficient clean samples and deficient artificial priors to efficiently search for poisoned samples with poor generalization across various attacks. This paper introduces a brand-new perspective to reformulate the attackers' objective, ***i.e., backdoor attacks lead the victim models to classify the trigger disturbed by images into the target label***, to identify the community of attacks. Specifically, we propose the concept, ***Disturbance Immunity*** of triggers, and ***theoretically demonstrate that benign and backdoor features exhibit significant classification probability discrepancies across varying perturbations of clean image classes and intensities***. Subsequently, a few known conventional attack patterns are applied to label the poisoned dataset, and then the labeled dataset is perturbed in the above manner to drive the detector to learn the Disturbance Immunity of triggers. Thus, traditional unsupervised clustering-based detection can be transformed into a simple labeled binary classification task. Finally, we train and present an effective ***G***eneral ***C***ross-attack ***B***ackdoor ***D***etector (***GCBD***). With few clean images $(\\leq 10)$, GCBD exhibits ***S***tate-***O***f-***T***he-***A***rt (***SOTA***) detection performance with satisfactory generalization on various SOTA attacks. Additionally, GCBD also supports direct toxicity detection in unseen samples during training, as proved by a more challenging test-time validation approach.

Conceptual and methodological clarity**\n\nThe overall pipeline is unclear and conceptually confusing. The paper lacks a coherent and complete description of how GCBD operates end-to-end. Starting with Algorithm 1, the pseudocode does not clearly specify the algorithm's final output, how the so-called \"sequence dataset\" (D) is constructed and used during training, or how the resulting model generates the final detection scores. It is also unclear what model is being trained in Algorithm 1. Is it the LSTM-based classifier mentioned elsewhere in the text? Furthermore, the paper does not explain how the extracted \"scores\" or \"sequences\" from the victim model are transformed into binary detection decisions.\nIn addition, the defense pipeline itself, including whether it is applied once or iteratively during the sanitization process, is never explicitly defined. Even Figures 1 and 2, which are meant to illustrate the overall framework, are visually dense and fail to convey a clear flow of information. In particular, it remains unclear how the disturbance generation, labeling, and classification stages interact within the proposed mechanism.\n\n**2. Missing source code and reproducibility**\n\nTo further complicate understanding of the proposed framework, the authors do not share their code, which could clarify the pipeline and the rationale for many key experimental details (e.g., hyperparameters, data generation specifics, trigger parameters) that are missing.\n\n**3. Theoretical claims without proofs**\nAlthough the paper repeatedly claims to “theoretically demonstrate” the Disturbance Immunity property, the provided “Observations 1 and 2” are actually assumptions, not proofs. In particular, no formal derivation or theorem is provided beyond high-level equations that restate assumptions. Hence, the theoretical contribution is misrepresented. These are empirical intuitions, not proven results. The theoretical contribution claim is thus false and overstated. \n\n**4. Weak experimental gain**\n\nThe paper shows limited or marginal improvements over strong baselines such as TeCo and AC when considering dynamic or unseen triggers (e.g., Input-Aware attack). The “cross-attack” claim is therefore overstated.\n5. Experimental inconsistencies and weak justification\nThe poisoning rates used across attacks are inconsistent (ranging from 0.05% to 8%) without justification or tuning rationale. It is unclear whether these choices are fair or matched to prior baselines.\nThe proposed “test-time detection” setup (Section 4.2) is poorly explained: when does the defender have access to the test images? How does this differ from the prior evaluation in Section 4.1? The purpose of this stage is ambiguous, and it remains unclear whether it represents a realistic deployment scenario.\n\n**5. Questionable novelty**\n\nThe claimed “new perspective” that backdoor effects rely on trigger presence rather than image content is not new. This is already well established in the backdoor literature (e.g., BadNets, SentiNet). Thus, the conceptual novelty of “Disturbance Immunity” is limited; it repackages a known observation with new terminology but without new theoretical or empirical depth.\n\n**Minor**:  Figure 3 is missing the x and y-axis description. \n\n**Actionable Points**\nHere is a list of actionable points for the authors to improve the paper from my perspective:\n\n- Provide a precise, formal, and algorithmic description of the GCBD framework.\n- Reframe Observations 1 and 2 as hypotheses or assumptions and remove any claim of theoretical proof unless formal derivations are added.\n- Ensure consistent experimental settings across all baselines, and include more detailed hyperparameter choices.\n- Explain when test-time detection is applicable, its difference from training-phase detection, and whether it represents a realistic use case."}, "questions": {"value": "How is the defense classifier trained?\n\nIs the proposed defense applied once to the dataset for sanitization, or iteratively?\n\nHow were poisoning percentages chosen across attacks?\n\nHow does GCBD handle cases where new triggers differ structurally from those used in training? The Input-Aware results suggest no competitive advantage over the other approaches at the state of the art. \n\nSince Observations 1–2 are assumptions, not formal proofs, can the authors provide any empirical ablation to support these claims?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "QMK22agdJt", "forum": "PluWBC86I4", "replyto": "PluWBC86I4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4476/Reviewer_PvKf"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4476/Reviewer_PvKf"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4476/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761832349441, "cdate": 1761832349441, "tmdate": 1762917388898, "mdate": 1762917388898, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposed a backdoor detector based on the disturbance immunity of triggers.
