In this turnstile setting, a recent work of Jain, Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova, Sivakumar, and Smith (NeurIPS '23) showed that for streams of length $T$, polynomial additive error of $\\Omega(T^{1/4})$ is necessary, even without any space restrictions. We show that this additive error lower bound can be circumvented if the algorithm is allowed to output estimates with *multiplicative* error. We give an algorithm for the continual release of the number of distinct elements with $\\text{polylog} (T)$ multiplicative and  $\\text{polylog}(T)$ additive error. We also show a qualitatively similar phenomenon for estimating the $F_2$ moment of a turnstile stream, where we can obtain $1+o(1)$ multiplicative and $\\text{polylog} (T)$ additive error. Both results can be achieved by polylogarithmic space streaming algorithms where some multiplicative error is necessary even without privacy.

Past work showed a lower bound of $\\Omega(T^{1/4})$ (Jain et al., 2023a) (event-level) and gave an algorithm running in $\\tilde{O}(T^{1/3})$ (Jain et al., 2023b) (item-level), both on the additive error achieved by the algorithm. This paper circumvents the lower bound by considering mixed error guarantees which are also *multiplicative*, showing that $\\mathrm{polylog}(T)$ additive error is possible if $\\mathrm{polylog}(T)$ multiplicative error is tolerated.

The problem of (DP) counting distinct elements on a turnstile stream is easy to motivate, and a fundamental problem in DP.

The techniques/ideas used are natural, and the proofs in the appendix that I checked seemed correct (up to constants, see questions).\n4. The message that polynomial additive errors can be replaced by polylogarithmic additive errors at the expense of (potentially non-trivial) multiplicative error, and sometimes in low space, is relatively clean and nice.

A $\\mathrm{polylog}(T)$ multiplicative guarantee will not always be competitive with the pure additive error guarantees parametrized in e.g., flippancy (Jain et al. (2023a)) or total flippancy (Henzinger et al. (2024a)). Many natural streams are prone to exhibit low flippancy (e.g., tracking occupancy in a store). The multiplicative guarantee can potentially offer an improvement in pathological cases where the flippancy is very high, e.g., when updates are concentrated in a few items, but it is not clear to me how realistic/interesting a setting this is.\n2. The paper only considers event-level DP, rather than item-level DP. It is not clear how (or if) the techniques could be extended to work for item-level DP.\n3. The techniques used in the paper, and how they compare to techniques used in past work on DP counting distinct elements on turnstile streams, are insufficiently discussed. This paper is not the first to use sketching in the context of DP more broadly, see e.g., [1,2,3,4]. [1] for example appears to solve the same problem in the setting where only the final number of distinct elements has to be released (i.e., not under continual release), and does so with a multiplicative/additive guarantee. More related still, the key building block in Epasto et al. (2023) is an implementation of CountSketch under continual release.

I recommend it for acceptance, but I have some concerns regarding the novelty of the techniques used (hence my confidence score). I think the paper would benefit from, at least a brief, discussion of how the techniques employed compare to past work.\n\n1. How novel are your techniques over past work for counting distinct elements on turnstile streams specifically? How do your techniques differ?\n2. Can Algorithm 3 be viewed as continual release of CountSketch, in a “high-collision regime”? If so, how does it compare to the continual release of CountSketch employed in Epasto et al. (2023)?\n3. Do you believe your techniques could be extended to work for item-level DP?\n4. Not a severe issue, but I think the inequality you state on line 856 in the proof of Lemma C.1 is wrong. My understanding of the argument is that you enlarge the unit-sized interval to have size $\\sqrt{l}/500$, and then union bound over ~this number of unit-sized intervals, but then the first factor on the right-hand-side should be divided by 500 rather than 50000, right? If this is an error, I think it should only impact constants in Lemma C.1, nothing in the main paper.\n\n*Typos/comments:*\n- General comment: The exact assumption on the hash/random functions involved are not stated clearly. E.g., in Algorithm 1, Step 2 it is a “random hash function” from $[n]$ to $[n]$, Lemma C.1 only specifies that $f$ and $g$ are “random functions”. From the proof of the space usage in Theorem 3.1, you state that pairwise independent hash functions are enough for the analysis in that case, and necessary for the claimed space usage, but it is not stated in the main theorem. It would benefit the clarity of the paper if the requirement on the hash functions was more explicit. Perhaps it could be stated once that e.g., \"all hash functions are assumed pairwise independent and can be stored in space...\", if the requirement is consistent throughout the paper.\n- Line 043-044: References appear twice?\n- Line 150-151: remove “to”\n- Line 318-319: The interpretation of $f_t[k]$ seems wrong to me, that it is the number of elements at time $t$ whose value hash into $[2^k, 2^{k+1})$.

It's good to point that out, but I would still keep CEMMOZ in the discussion.
