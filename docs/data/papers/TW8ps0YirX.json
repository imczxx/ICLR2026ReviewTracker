The dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on household objects, which approach saturation, XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved vision problems in the real-world application. The dataset features metallic and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density, replicating the challenges of industrial bin-picking.\nXYZ-IBD was collected using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view real-world scenes with around 273k annotated object instances, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations.\nWe benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection and 6D pose estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks. By capturing the complexity of real-world bin-picking scenarios, XYZ-IBD introduces more realistic and challenging vision problems for future research.", "tldr": "A High-precision Benchmark for Robust 6D Object Pose Estimation under Real-World Industrial Complexity", "keywords": ["Dataset and Benchmarks", "6D Pose Estimation", "Multi-instance 2D detection", "Industrial Bin-picking", "Clutter Scenes"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1fed25939f79274dad2f5efe11631b497b8bbee2.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6576004b7374b684b4b22afe6d19f2d3ae66cd67.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce a new dataset for benchmarking 6DOF pose estimation methods.

The core challenges addressed have been partially covered by these prior works. The distinction from recent work like IPD 2024, which also employs multi-sensor approaches for similar scenarios, remains unclear. While XYZ-IBD achieves higher annotation accuracy, this appears to be an engineering improvement rather than a conceptual advance.\nSecond, the experimental validation appears limited. The benchmarking includes only a constrained set of mainstream methods and lacks comparisons with industrial-specific pose estimation frameworks. The performance degradation observed is not attributed to specific factors. The results would benefit from error analysis categorizing failures by object type, occlusion level, and material properties.\nThird, key technical details are not sufficiently documented. The specific implementation of multi-view depth fusion and ICP refinement in the annotation pipeline is not clearly described. The synthetic dataset generation process, particularly how physics-based interactions are simulated, lacks detail needed for reproducibility. The validation method relying on simulated environments may have limitations due to domain gaps with reality.\nFourth, the use of anti-reflection spray during data collection raises concerns about whether the dataset truly represents unmodified industrial environments. This practice fundamentally alters optical properties and cannot be applied in real industrial testing scenarios, which undermines the practical utility of the benchmark.\nFourth, the discussion of limitations is brief. The paper mentions constraints on working distance and object scale but does not explore how these affect applicability to other industrial scenarios.

The annotators need to manually align 3D CAD models to each object instance in the image via a GUI which is very slow and costly. This is probably the main reason that this dataset is limited in scale.\n- It is unsure how the authors measures the average annotation error correctly, especially when the depth is generated by projected pattern deformation analysis. The depth generation process involves a lot of complex steps and it is hard to judge if the error measurement is correct.\n- The authors applied anti-reflection spray to the objects before collecting the data. This is not OK in my opinion. Anti-reflection spray is indeed good for capturing depth on which the pose annotation relies. However, in real applications, there is no anti-reflection spray applied. The depth sensor signal will be very different, meaning that all the pose data collected with anti-reflection spray will be meaningless. On the other hand, without anti-reflection spray, there is no way to accurately annotate the pose data.\n- The main data for high-precision annotation is collected by industrial-grade high-precision scanners. This limits the application scope of this dataset, since not everyone has the same scanner in their lab as the authors. Though Intel Realsense cameras are also used to collect data, however, I highly doubt if the Realsense is enough to provide sensing signal sufficiently accurate for pose estimation of these small objects.
