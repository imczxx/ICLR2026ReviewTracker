Predicting this mask design is a complex task in the field of inverse lithography. The mapping from wafer to the mask design is ill-posed and requires solving a non-convex optimization task, having multiple potential solutions. Any difference in the setup of the problem (e.g. initialization, patching, or a different discretization scheme) tends to generate inconsistencies. The designed wafer features generally consist of a defined set of basic objects (primitives). Larger features can be built by transforming and aggregating these primitives. Following these observations, we propose a holistic generative approach that utilizes primitive embeddings. We use a model that encodes primitives per type, embeds positional information and then aggregates the feature information. A variational inference approach is then used to take samples of these encodings in the latent space. The samples are transformed by normalizing flows that try to recover the postulated distribution before constructing a mask design. A generative model predicts one of the best mask designs, avoiding inconsistencies and thus allowing for a flexible design approach. Finally we introduce a novel scoring method to fit this probabilistic setup. We assess the performance of this approach for a simplified inverse lithography setup. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the use of primitive modeling in inverse lithography tasks. Although we are not yet able to reach benchmark accuracy within this new setup, results are promising from an application point of view.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["feature embeddings", "inverse lithography", "generative modeling", "primitives", "bayesian inference"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fb6b972b3c05b03e149386dedd4b21fd05091035.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper deals with the mask optimization problem in in context of inverse lithography.

Please find my detailed comments below:\n1. My biggest concern is the experiments, in the semiconductor manufacturing industry, there are already well-defined metrics to evaluate mask optimization: EPE, process windows, Depth of Focus, LWR, LER, MRC, etc. None of these are displayed in the paper to support the method. \n2. The writing needs significant improve. I have no clue what the model is doing in Fig.1 and Fig. 2. What are the inputs what are the outputs. If I give you a chip design after PnR, how do I use your model to get the optimized mask?\n3. There are many inaccurate descriptions in the paper. I recommend that the authors have a more comprehensive literature survey, e.g.:\na. \"In addition, changing a single feature still requires remapping the entire patch.\" Not necessarily true, the scope is defined by the abmit or optical diameter. the changing feature does not propagate that far.\nb. Please include few ill-posed examples, for mask optimization, since we never reach global optimal due to the low-pass filter of lithography system, we will simply pick the best based on the metrics. \nc.\"The space of possible masks Sϕ for full target images is vast and searching it naively with an optimization procedure will take a long time.\"Not ture, mask is limited by MRC's, so it has quite structural similarity to the target design pattern except SRAFs.\n4.

The results fail to support this viewpoint, as Table 13 shows that performance clearly improves after removing primitives. Does this indicate that primitive embedding, as an input representation, actually harms model performance?\n\n(3) The authors only use four types of primitives, which may be insufficient compared to real-world complex IC manufacturing scenarios. The authors should discuss whether more primitive types should be incorporated.\n\n(4) All experiments are conducted on synthetic data, with no validation on any real industrial datasets, which is a serious limitation. The authors also mention that the current dataset is relatively simple. Can the current \"success\" only be achieved on the authors' simple synthetic dataset? We doubt whether the model possesses sufficient generalization capability.\n\n(5) The authors only compare their method with a simple baseline model, without comparisons against other proposed methods.
