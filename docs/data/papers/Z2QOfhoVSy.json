We address this issue with CLARA, a hierarchical learning framework that decomposes node classification into two stages: a coarse subgraph-level classifier that selects regions likely to contain minority instances, followed by a fine-grained node-level predictor within these regions. This design improves sensitivity while maintaining scalability, filtering out irrelevant areas and focusing learning on topologically meaningful neighborhoods. Experiments on benchmark graph datasets demonstrate substantial gains over established imbalance-handling methods, with CLARA reaching an F1-score of 88.3%. The same strategy achieves significant improvements in protein–ligand binding site prediction, underscoring its broad and consistent effectiveness across both biological and general graph learning tasks.", "tldr": "We propose a hierarchical graph learning framework that combines subgraph-level filtering with node-level classification, achieving improved performance on imbalanced graph benchmarks and protein–ligand binding site prediction.", "keywords": ["class imbalance", "graph neural networks", "hierarchical learning", "subgraph classification", "protein–ligand binding site prediction", "structural bioinformatics"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b926fee29aa9c78fad3e961eb30ec8f95114e77e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies the imbalanced node classification problem.

In the introduction, the authors claim that \"minority instances cluster in compact, topologically meaningful subregions.\" However, no empirical analysis is provided to validate this assumption on the datasets used. Including a case study demonstrating that minority nodes indeed exhibit spatial clustering in the datasets used would make this claim more convincing. Also, how does the method perform when minority nodes are uniformly distributed rather than clustered?\n\n2. Subgraph Construction:\n- The k for k-hop neighborhoods appears to be a critical hyperparameter, but guidance is missing. The choice of k-hop neighborhoods (k=3) appears arbitrary. A sensitivity analysis on k is necessary to understand the method's robustness to this critical hyperparameter.\n\n- What is the class distribution within the extracted subgraphs? If subgraph labels remain highly imbalanced, how does Stage 2 benefit from decomposition? Please report imbalance ratios at the subgraph level. Additionally, what is the classification performance of Stage 1? How many subgraphs are filtered out, and how many subgraphs containing minority nodes are incorrectly discarded? \n\n3. The paper states that CLARA-S uses \"subgraph decomposition but omits hierarchical filtering.\" However, I may be misunderstanding the setup. Could you please clarify how CLARA-S is different from a standard GNN applied to each subgraph separately instead of the full graph? If CLARA-S is indeed a vanilla GNN trained on subgraphs without any special imbalance-handling techniques, it is a bit surprising that it consistently outperforms all baseline methods by a margin in Figure 2, as these baselines are specifically designed to address class imbalance. Could you help explain where the improvement comes from? \n\n4. Experiment 1 (Section 4.1) uses an imbalance ratio of 10, which is relatively moderate. Please evaluate performance at higher imbalance ratios (20, 50, 100) to better understand scalability to severe imbalance scenarios common in real-world applications. Also, how are minority and majority classes defined under the multi-class classification setting? Additionally, Table 1 lacks error bars or confidence intervals like Figure 2, which makes it difficult to assess statistical significance of the results.\n\n5.
