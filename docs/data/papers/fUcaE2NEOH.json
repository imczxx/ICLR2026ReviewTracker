The empirical evaluation is narrow: the paper only considers four small-scale benchmark problems and omits comparisons with several established baselines for constrained discrete optimization.\n3. The penalty-based constraint handling (assigning poor values to infeasible points and adding a loss penalty) is a standard technique used widely in both continuous and discrete optimization. Why develop and evaluate the method only in the discrete setting?\n4. It’s unclear whether the points proposed by CA-TD during optimization are guaranteed to be feasible. If not, what fraction of the evaluated points actually satisfy the constraints? \n5. As noted in Section 3.4, CA-TD trains M separate surrogate models.

While PGRAD improves computational scalability over HSDP, the fundamental issue of dimensionality (the \"curse of dimensionality\") remains largely unaddressed. The method is demonstrated on search spaces with a moderate number of dimensions (e.g., up to 8 for Diabetes). A more substantive discussion or preliminary experiments on potential pathways to mitigate this would significantly strengthen the paper.\n\n- The additional comparative study in Appendix E is valuable but highlights a concern. The authors had to use \"scaled-down versions\" of the original NN+MILP tasks to make the comparison feasible. This inevitably raises the question: Is CA-TD's competitive performance a result of its intrinsic merit, or is it simply better suited to these smaller-scale problems? It would be interesting to see a direct comparison on at least one of the larger-scale problems from the NN+MILP paper, even if it requires significant engineering effort or approximation. \n\n- While the POP formulation is elegant, the paper lacks a theoretical analysis of the PGRAD relaxation.
