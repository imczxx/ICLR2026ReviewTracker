However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. The resulting method (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate superior performance on inverse problems in natural image processing and scientific reconstruction, and establish convergence guarantees of the scheme under appropriate assumptions.", "tldr": "We develop a novel transport-based approach to learn a generative model of a data distribution using only access to corrupted observations from a black-box observation map", "keywords": ["generative models", "corrupted data", "inverse problems", "stochastic interpolants"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e915a2c410d3230b7e067e41b4dc2ef160cdb845.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work addresses the problem of restoring clean samples from their corrupted measurements under two key constraints: 1) access is limited to the corrupted data, without corresponding clean samples, and 2) the forward map from the clean signal to the measurements is treated as avilable in a black-box manner. The authors approach this problem using Self-consistent Stochastic Interpolants, an extension of standard Stochastic Interpolants (SI) framework. This method adds a self-consistency mechanism, ensuring that the trained model's outputs map back to the true measurements.

My primary concern relates to the lack of evaluation of the SDE version of the algorithm. The theoretical analysis focuses mainly on the SDE case, so it is natural to ask whether these results translate to practice. Moreover, as the authors also mention, the toy example (section 5.1) indicates the superiority of the SDE-based approach, and it seems counterintuitive that no other non-toy evaluations appeared in the paper. While I understand that it might be more computationally demanding and slower in terms of convergence, some kind of comparison in a standard experiment (section 5.2) should be provided.\n\nW2. Equally concerning is the lack of standard evaluation metrics used in typical inverse-problems-related papers.\n\n1. For the standard benchmarks (Table 1), only LPIPS is used. Methods for inverse problems are typically evaluated with the perception-distortion tradeoff in mind [1], so I would recommend adding PSNR, SSIM (distortion) and FID (perception).\n\n2. For the comparison with other inverse generative models, only FID is provided. This is not crucial, but some metric like the Inception Score [2] should also be provided for a more balanced comparison.\n\n3. For the quasar spectra recovery, no quantitative results are given. I'm not an expert in this subfield, but I expect the authors to provide proper metrics used in the evaluation scheme in such scenarios.\n\nW3. The scope of the chosen baselines is very small. DPS is a good starting point, but as the authors correctly point out, its assumptions largely differ from their work. It would be beneficial for the paper to also include other methods that better cover the spectrum. Examples include: unsupervised methods that make different assumptions about the forward model [3,4], supervised bridge methods that ignore the forward model [5,6,7,8] or assume access to it [9], unpaired-data-based bridges [10,11] and the approaches explicitly cited by the authors as the closest ones in terms of assumptions and recency (lines 044-053). I don't expect the authors to include all of the above, but the comparison should be more representative.\n\nW4. (Minor) I believe that the black-box assumption is lost when the method is additionally using either the mask in the random masking experiment or the compression magnitude in the JPEG one.

While usually, when solving the inverse problem, one knows the *clean* data $x$ and corrupt operator $\\mathcal{K}$, the problem setup authors solve when one knows the *corrupted* data $y$ and corrupt operator $\\mathcal{K}$. Since this setup doesn't have clean data samples, it doesn't allow for the straight application of already developed generative modeling methodologies and requires the development of new ones. \n\nThe authors propose to utilize the Stochastic Interpolants (SI) framework and an iterative  (Expectation Maximization-like) scheme for learning it in a no-clean data setup. The key idea of the method is to build such an SI that the corrupted data distribution $Y$ mapped by SI into clean generated data would be mapped back by the corruption operator $\\mathcal{K}$ to the initial corrupted data distribution $Y$, i.e., self-consistency property, see lines 177-182. The practical algorithm consists of the iterative repetition of: 1) sampling data from the current SI ($\\Theta^{(k)}$), i.e., Expectation step 2) learning the next SI ($\\Theta^{(k+1)}$) on the data generated in the previous step, i.e., Minimization step.\n\nIn addition, the authors provide a theoretical analysis of their iterative procedure under different conditions and provide convergence guarantees of their procedure.\n\nIn practice, the authors evaluate their model on a range of tasks, including toy 2D problems, image inverse problems, and quasar spectrum restoration, and provide comparisons with competing approaches within the image inverse problem setting."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- The SI framework allows for a corruption operator $\\mathcal{K}$ with black box access, which is less restrictive than previous works  and allows for wider range of corruption operators $\\mathcal{K}$.\n- The SI is, in general, known to be a good generative modeling framework for the inverse problem solving [1, 2], so the application of SI to such an inverse problem is very well motivated even in $\\mathcal{K}$  cases, e.g. linear inverse problems, where one can utilize other diffusion methodologies [3, 4]\n- The theoretical analysis is rather comprehensive and convincing. Section 4 results deliver valuable theoretical analysis on the convergence of the method and the possible room for error, which can be helpful in practice and is good as the theoretical result by itself.\n- In the image inverse problems experiments method slightly outperforms DPS method that learns *using the clean data* and outperforms other methods that learn only from corrupted data."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Some results in the paper are made under the assumption that the corruption operator is *injective*. That seems as not a mild assumption. Can authors comment on the restrictions of such an assumption on practice and show some examples of injective/non-injective mappings?\n- The learning procedure is non-simulation free, since one has to sample from learned SI during the \"Expectation\"-step. That leads to a computationally heavy algorithm. Can authors provide an ablation study on the parameters that control the computational demand of the procedure, i.e., the number of procedure iterations $K$ and the number of gradient updates  $T_{tr}$ inside of one iteration.\n- The authors explain the *trade-off* between the condition number $\\mathcal{X}$ and restriction of the SI approximation class $\\mathcal{S}_\\lambda$. This trade-off is shown in Theorem 1, but as far as I understand, authors do not test this trade-off in practice. So, can authors implement the restrictions on SI approximation class in practice and indeed show 1) faster convergence, 2) bigger error. That trade-off and the way to enforce it could be very useful in practice and seems like a useful hyperparameter that hasn't been explored.\n- The method's performance gap with EM posterior in Table 2 is marginal and the comparison of the proposed method with other methods that learn only on corrupted data has been carried out on the generation task. Which is strange, as far as I understand, at least some of the reference methods (Ambient Diffusion, EM Posterior or others) can solve inverse problems by starting from corrupted observations. It would be nice to compare the proposed method to competitors in particularly in the image restoration setup and not the generation setup, i.e., add methods that learn only on corrupted data in Table 1.\n- The applications of the proposed method are not described properly.
