Current methods often neglect shared structural commonalities across identities, which limits their ability to generalize and recognize fine-grained identity details effectively. To address these issues, we propose an Adversarial Dual-Stream Learning (ADSL) framework, which integrates two complementary strategies: mining stable local commonalities and modeling local perturbations. The Cross-Identity Local Consistency Learning (CILL) module builds a memory bank of local features and utilizes clustering-driven similarity learning to balance structural consistency and discriminative granularity. Simultaneously, the Dual-stream Adversarial Perturbation Strategy (DAPS) generates adversarial samples that simulate cross-domain appearance variations while preserving local semantic structures. To further improve robustness to domain shifts, we introduce a Clean-Adv Local Cosine Alignment constraint, which ensures feature consistency between clean and adversarial samples in the local semantic space.

The central innovation lies in the intricate combination of CILL (Cross-Identity Local Consistency Learning) and DAPS (Dual-stream Adversarial Perturbation Strategy), orchestrated under the ADSL paradigm. While both local feature learning and adversarial training are established techniques in Re-ID, their synergistic integration, with a specific focus on simultaneously modeling stable local commonalities and local perturbations, presents a novel approach. This unique amalgamation of techniques results in a distinctive methodological framework that tackles the complexities of DG Re-ID from multiple engineered dimensions, aiming for both improved structural robustness and fine-grained discriminative power.\n2.Quality: The experimental design is rigorous: a multi-source domain transfer setting is adopted, covering a mixed indoor and outdoor scenario; ablation experiments  quantitatively demonstrate that the contribution rate of each module ranges from 18% to 30%. Solid theoretical support: clear formula derivation , and T-SNE visualization intuitively demonstrates the improvement effect of feature distribution.\n3.Clarity: The paper demonstrates strong clarity across multiple dimensions, significantly contributing to the reader's understanding of the proposed methodology: (1)Problem Articulation: The authors present a highly lucid articulation of the core challenges in Domain Generalizable Person Re-identification (DG Re-ID), effectively highlighting issues such as domain shift due to appearance variations, and the critical limitation of neglecting shared structural commonalities across identities. This clear problem definition sets a firm foundation for the proposed solution. (2)Methodological Intent: The intended purpose of the Adversarial Dual-Stream Learning (ADSL) framework, along with its constituent modules, is explicitly and clearly conveyed. The distinct roles of CILL (Cross-Identity Local Consistency Learning) in mining stable local commonalities and DAPS (Dual-stream Adversarial Perturbation Strategy) in modeling local perturbations are well-defined. The overarching goal of improving generalization capabilities and recognizing fine-grained identity details is also unequivocally stated. (3)Modular Functionality and Interaction: The functions of each module are clearly delineated. For CILL, the description of leveraging a memory bank with clustering-driven similarity learning provides a clear mechanistic overview. Similarly, DAPS’s role in generating adversarial samples is readily understood. The synergistic interaction between these modules, encapsulated within the ADSL framework, is also presented in a straightforward manner, allowing readers to grasp how the components are integrated to achieve the stated objectives.\n4. Significance: This work establishes a novel paradigm for the integration of local feature modeling and adversarial learning, paving the way for future research in this domain.The pressing demand for DG Re-ID in applications such as security surveillance necessitates efficient solutions for complex cross-domain scenarios. ADSL offers a potent and effective approach to address these challenges."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.CILL attempts to “mine stable local commonalities”and “balance structural consistency and recognition granularity”, which sounds like searching for visual patterns suitable for cross identity sharing. However, the ultimate goal of Re ID is precisely to distinguish identities. If CILL overly emphasizes \"commonality\", it may blur the subtle differences between different identities, especially the key \"refined details\" that determine identity. For example, if two people with different identities wear similar clothes, CILL may pull their local features too close. The paper should provide a clearer explanation of how the loss function of CILL (such as formulas 2 and 3) emphasizes the key details of distinguishing different identities while maintaining local commonalities. For example, the negative logarithmic term in formula 2 is actually used for maximum likelihood estimation (or maximizing similarity), while trielet loss and CE loss emphasize discrimination. We need to explain how these three work together.\n2.DAPS simulates \"changes in image contrast, brightness or texture details\" by \"randomly applying perturbations to mask areas\". Although this can increase the robustness of the model, this random mask and fixed type of disturbance may not be able to fully capture the complex and changeable cross domain changes in the real world (for example, serious lighting changes, camera noise, resolution differences, seasonal clothing changes, etc.). The paper needs to prove that the confrontation samples generated by the model can effectively promote the generalization of the model to various unprecedented fields in the real world. It is suggested to consider integrating various types of local disturbances (such as color jitter+blur+sharpening, simulated Gaussian noise, simulated low resolution, etc.) into DAPS, or using more advanced countermeasures generation technology to generate more challenging and diverse disturbances. It may provide specific evidence of the diversity of confrontation samples: for example, show some particularly challenging confrontation samples, and the performance of the model in this case.\n3.The ability to “identify and refine identity details” has been repeatedly mentioned in the paper. However, the current experiment lacks indicators to directly measure this ability. It is suggested to design special subtasks, for example, to evaluate by introducing data sets with fine attribute labels (such as clothing patterns and shapes), or to analyze the specific performance of models in distinguishing pedestrian pairs that are “very similar” (mainly depending on local details). This argument will be strongly supported by convincing visual analysis of attention.\n4. Although ablation experiments are mentioned in the abstract, the quantitative analysis of the respective contributions of CILL and DAPS, the discussion of their interactions, and the depth of sensitivity analysis of key super parameters (such as memory size, disturbance intensity, loss weight) still need to be strengthened. A detailed ablation study will reveal the internal mechanism of the ADSL framework and prove the necessity and effectiveness of its various components.\n5. As the author has not open the source code of the paper, I am unable to verify its experimental results. Therefore, I suggest that the author makes the code and experimental data publicly available on platforms such as Github, and provides a detailed description of the experimental setup, in order to facilitate the development of the community."}, "questions": {"value": "1.The CILL module proposed in the article aims to learn \"cross-identity local commonalities\" to enhance domain generalization, while the paper emphasizes that this method can \"identify fine-grained identity details\". Could you elaborate on how CILL strikes a balance between these two aspects? Specifically, what types of local features (such as the overall style of clothing, the relative position of body parts) are the \"commonalities\" it uncovers, and how are the \"fine-grained details\" (such as patterns on clothing, specific textures, minor posture differences of individuals) retained for identity differentiation? Could you provide a specific example to illustrate how CILL achieves accurate differentiation by retaining fine-grained details when dealing with two pedestrians with similar commonalities but different identities?\n2.The DAPS strategy proposed in this paper simulates cross domain changes through \"random local disturbance\". Please specify how the type (such as contrast, brightness, texture variation) and generation method (such as random mask) of this local disturbance fully cover the most challenging real world domain offset in Re ID tasks? For example, can it effectively cope with the subtle visual differences caused by different camera sensor imaging characteristics, different weather (rainy, snowy, haze), different time periods (day, night), and clothing materials (reflective, frosted)? Can you provide some experimental results from public data sets or test sets built by yourself with typical real world domain offsets to prove the robustness of DAPS?\n3.
