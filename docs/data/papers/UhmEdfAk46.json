Existing alignment methods struggle to balance trade-offs effectively, often requiring costly retraining or yielding suboptimal results across the Pareto frontier of preferences. In this paper, we introduce HoE (Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts), a lightweight, parameter-efficient, and plug-and-play approach that eliminates the need for model retraining, while enabling LLMs to adapt across the entire Pareto frontier and accommodate diverse user preferences. In particular, HoE consists of three hierarchical components: LoRA Experts, Router Experts and Weighting Router, reaching optimal Pareto frontiers and achieving a trade-off between parameter size, training cost, and performance. We evaluate HoE across various tasks on 16 objectives and 200 different preferences among 8 benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over 15 recent baselines.", "tldr": "HoE (hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts) is a Multi-objective Alignment approach that enabling LLMs to adapt across the entire Pareto frontier with minimal resources.", "keywords": ["large language model", "multi-objective", "mixture-of-expert", "model fusion"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/da14a6879b6a9a88be3c16b0a0a206f158619f82.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes HoE, a hierarchical mixture-of-experts framework for multi-objective alignment of large language models, enabling them to adapt to diverse and conflicting human preferences without costly retraining.

The paper's central claim is the achievement of \"optimal Pareto frontiers\" and \"superior Pareto-optimal results\". However, the paper provides no evidence that the proposed HOE method actually converges to the true, global Pareto optimal frontier. The theoretical analysis in Appendix G relies on strong assumptions, such as the convexity of the objective functions (Assumption G.1), which are well-known to not hold in the non-convex landscape of LLM optimization. While the use of Tchebycheff (TCH) scalarization is appropriate (as it can find non-convex frontiers), it does not guarantee that the frontier it finds is the optimal one. Therefore, all of the paper's claims of \"optimality\" are purely empirical and lack the foundational theoretical guarantees that the term \"Pareto optimal\" implies.\n\n2. The framework's design is confusing, as it introduces two distinct types of multi-objective components: \"Multi-Objective LoRA Experts\"  and \"Router Experts\". Both components appear to serve the exact same purpose: covering intermediate points on the Pareto frontier. The paper fails to provide a clear justification for why both are necessary.\n\n3. This paper lacks of criticial details. A core component, the Merge function used to create multi-objective experts ($\\tau_{\\lambda}=Merge(...) $), is never defined in the paper.  The \"task-SVD\" compression process is also vague. The example in Appendix E.1  suggests it may involve manual, per-objective hyperparameter tuning, which would severely undermine the \"plug-and-play\" and \"lightweight\" claims. Furthermore, the mathematical formulation for the router optimization is inconsistent between the main text and the appendix, confusing any attempt at re-implementation. \n\n4. There are several issues for the Proof in App. G as well. \n\nFirst, the proof's strongest claims of convergence rely entirely on Assumption G.1 (Convexity). The parameters $\\theta$ being optimized belong to the Router Experts, which are neural network layers within a Transformer. The optimization landscape for LLMs and deep neural networks is well-known to be highly non-convex.\n\nSecond, even if local stationary point convergence is established, a local stationary point is not, by any means, equivalent to a Pareto optimal solution.\n\nThird, Lines 1480-1494 are very confusing. For example: “If none of these conditions hold but assumptions 1, 2, 3, and 4 remain valid...\"\n\n5. Please clarify some mathematical formulations. The main text in Section 3.2 (Eq. (6)-(8)) introduces an Online Mirror Descent (OMD) method for the Tchebycheff (TCH) objective . However, Appendix E.3 (Eq. (12)-(18)) shows a different-looking formulation that is supposedly based on the same TCH and OMD principles. The relationship between Eq. (8)  and Eq. (18)  is unclear, even though both appear to describe the same PPO gradient"}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the Weaknesses above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "uceGcZuss2", "forum": "UhmEdfAk46", "replyto": "UhmEdfAk46", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8936/Reviewer_V6P4"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8936/Reviewer_V6P4"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8936/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761859715134, "cdate": 1761859715134, "tmdate": 1762920679570, "mdate": 1762920679570, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors studied the problem of multi-objective alignment problem in LLMs. To address the problem, they decompose the alignment problem into a number of single-preference subproblems, each of which handled by specialized experts.
