Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates toward constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress toward safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned. Experiments on standard and challenging Safety Gymnasium tasks show that SB-TRPO consistently achieves the best balance of safety and meaningful task completion compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "tldr": "We propose SB-TRPO, which adaptively biases natural policy gradients toward constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement.

The paper proposes extending TRPO to the CMDP setting. The key idea is not to explicitly enforce that the cost is zero (or below a fixed threshold) at every update. Instead, the method introduces a surrogate cost constraint requiring that the cost of the new policy be no greater than that of the previous policy. The algorithm then uses the conjugate gradient method from TRPO to separately compute the update directions for the reward objective and for the surrogate cost objective. It then forms a convex combination of these gradient directions.

CPO already extends TRPO to constrained MDP (CMDP) settings. Therefore, the paper should make explicit what the key differences are between CPO and the proposed method, and which design choices lead to better performance in practice. I did not find a clear discussion of this.\n\n2. My understanding is that CPO provides a performance improvement guarantee, but still performs poorly in hard-constraint settings. This may be due to its approximate solution procedure and the fact that it tries to maintain feasibility at every step. The proposed method also claims a performance improvement guarantee, but I do not see a clear explanation of why it would behave better than CPO in practice under strict (near-zero) safety constraints. This needs to be articulated more clearly.\n\n3. The training curves in Figure 4 suggest that the proposed method still does not consistently achieve both near-zero safety violations and high reward in the hard-constraint setting. It appears that the problem is not fully solved. Please explain, task by task, what is happening in Figure 4 (for example, when cost remains non-zero or reward collapses)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Why do you not report a metric that reflects task completion under safety, such as the cost per successful episode (i.e., episodes that actually reach the goal / complete the task)? The “safety probability” and “safe rewards” metrics you define focus on constraint satisfaction, but if the agent fails to complete the task, then having near-zero cost is not very meaningful. In many safe RL algorithms, when the constraint is enforced as a hard (near-zero) constraint, the agent simply fails to solve the task at all.\n\n2. I am familiar with the Safety Gymnasium tasks. In your Table 1, many tasks have very low or even negative reward values (e.g., Point Push, Point Button, Point Goal, Car Push, Car Circle, Car Goal). This suggests that the policies often fail to complete the task. How should we interpret “safety probability” in such cases? Is the agent just behaving very conservatively and not solving the task?\n\n3. There are no video rollouts or qualitative demonstrations comparing different methods. This makes it hard to judge whether the learned policies are actually completing the tasks versus just being safe by doing nothing. Please provide qualitative evidence (e.g., videos or behavioral descriptions) to show what the learned policies are doing for each algorithm.\n\n4. In Lemma 3, you assume ⟨g_c, Δ_c⟩ ≤ −ϵ. This assumption may not hold in general. Could you justify why this is reasonable in practice? As written, it is not obvious to me that this condition always holds, and the later argument depends critically on it."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "mVfggRNxmQ", "forum": "W6zas5fKle", "replyto": "W6zas5fKle", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10589/Reviewer_XtT1"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10589/Reviewer_XtT1"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10589/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761473981913, "cdate": 1761473981913, "tmdate": 1762921857553, "mdate": 1762921857553, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The manuscript proposes a new optimizer for constrained Markov decision processes, which constitute an important model for safe reinforcement learning.
