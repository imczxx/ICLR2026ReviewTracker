Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, continued fine-tuning (CFT), which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MergeTune) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MergeTune improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. \nOn robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MergeTune surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Vision-Language Models", "Continue Learning", "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning", "Robust Fine-Tuning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e2b14276c5c32b44f68927b2424fac6d21456c02.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a834d2bb7433a33ae2d3dbee8e320fac2764f6e8.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs).

While common, this may not hold for large-scale VLMs like CLIP trained on noisy web data. Could the authors provide empirical validation of these assumptions (e.g., via Hessian spectrum estimation on a subset) or discuss how violations might affect MERGETUNE’s performance?  \n(2) In Table 1, MERGETUNE improves CoOp by +5.58% HM but only +0.36% on PromptKD. The paper attributes this to PromptKD already preserving more knowledge. However, is it possible that MERGETUNE’s ℓ² regularizer toward CLIP inadvertently conflicts with PromptKD’s distillation objective, limiting gains? An analysis of the weight trajectory or feature similarity between CLIP, PromptKD, and MERGETUNE-enhanced PromptKD would help clarify this.  \n(3) The method samples a small number of α values (e.g., 5–10) to approximate the expectation in the LMC loss. How sensitive are results to the number and spacing of these α points? Did the authors experiment with adaptive sampling or importance weighting along the interpolation path to better capture high-loss regions?  \n(4) For adapter-based methods like MMA, which modify model architecture, MERGETUNE is applied only to the linear head (per Section 5.2). This seems inconsistent with the claim of being “model-agnostic.” Can MERGETUNE be applied to the full adapter parameters? If not, what architectural constraints limit its applicability, and how does partial application affect knowledge recovery?  \n(5) The continued model is initialized as a convex combination of w̃₁ and w̃₂ (τ ∈ [0,1]).

Does MERGETUNE include a practical strategy for selecting τ without validation data (e.g., based on fine-tuning loss magnitude or forgetting estimates)?  \n(6) All experiments use CLIP ViT-B/16 (and briefly ViT-B/32). How does MERGETUNE scale to larger backbones (e.g., ViT-L/14) or non-CLIP VLMs (e.g., ALIGN, BLIP)?
