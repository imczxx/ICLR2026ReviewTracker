Although graph neural networks that leverage neuroimaging data have shown promise in depression diagnosis, existing approaches are predominantly data-driven and operate largely as black-box models, lacking neurobiological interpretability. Here, we present NH-GCAT (Neurocircuitry-Inspired Hierarchical Graph Causal Attention Networks), a novel framework that bridges neuroscience domain knowledge with deep learning by explicitly and hierarchically modeling depression-specific mechanisms at different spatial scales. Our approach introduces three key technical contributions: (1) at the local brain regional level, we design a residual gated fusion module that integrates temporal blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics with functional connectivity patterns, specifically engineered to capture local depression-relevant low-frequency neural oscillations; (2) at the multi-regional circuit level, we propose a hierarchical circuit encoding scheme that aggregates regional node representations following established depression neurocircuitry organization, and (3) at the multi-circuit network level, we develop a variational latent causal attention mechanism that leverages a continuous probabilistic latent space to infer directed information flow among critical circuits, characterizing disease-altered whole-brain inter-circuit interactions. Rigorous leave-one-site-out cross-validation on the REST-meta-MDD dataset demonstrates NH-GCAT's state-of-the-art performance in depression classification, achieving a sample-size weighted-average accuracy of 73.3\\% and an AUROC of 76.4\\%, while simultaneously providing neurobiologically meaningful explanations.

Unclear module motivation and mapping between equations and architecture. It is difficult to align the mathematical formulations in Section 3 (Equations 1–21) with the modules illustrated in Figure 2. The description of RG-Fusion, HC-Pooling, and VLCA lacks explicit motivation for each design component — for example, why certain fusion mechanisms, Gumbel-Softmax hierarchical assignments, or causal attention structures were chosen. The rationale for these designs should be better explained or visualized in connection with the biological circuits they represent.\n2. Ambiguity in ROI-to-circuit mapping. The paper uses AAL116 for ROI definition, yet defines five circuits based on functional organization. It remains unclear how the authors aligned AAL ROIs to these five circuits. This mapping is problematic because AAL includes cerebellar regions, which are not part of these circuits. The paper should clarify how such ROIs were handled or reassigned — were cerebellar nodes excluded, or mapped to the nearest cortical network based on spatial proximity?\n3. Lack of comparison with related literature. The authors cite several interpretable GNNs but omit discussion or comparison with relevant recent studies that also integrate community structure [1-3] or causal learning [4] in brain graphs. \n4. Limited experimental scope. Experiments are only conducted on a single dataset. Given the claim that the model is neurocircuitry-inspired and generalizable, evaluation on at least one other psychiatric or neurological condition (e.g., ASD, AD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) would better demonstrate the adaptive ability and robustness of the proposed framework.\n\n\n[1] Community-Aware Transformer for Autism Prediction in fMRI Connectome.

First, only a single dataset is used. Why not evaluate on other MDD datasets such as SRPBS, OpenNeuro, or even the UK Biobank? It would also be more convincing to train on one dataset (for example, REST-meta-MDD) and test on another (for example, SRPBS) to assess the generalization ability of the proposed approach. \n\nIn addition, the comparisons with prior work are neither rigorous nor fair. The results of several state-of-the-art methods appear to be directly copied from the original papers, even though the experimental setups differ substantially. For instance, BrainIB used a 10-fold cross-validation scheme, while the current work adopts 5-fold cross-validation, which makes the comparison unreliable. You should rerun these methods in your own environment for a fair evaluation, especially since many of them have released official implementations. Furthermore, even the baseline results reported here differ from those in other published replications, which raises concerns about reproducibility and evaluation consistency.\n\nThe network design appears overly complicated and seems to contradict the stated motivation for interpretability. From a neuroscience perspective, researchers generally prefer architectures that are simple, easy to use, and supported by clear clinical evidence or interpretability. Although you attempt to incorporate circuit-level priors (which might be the only clinically grounded component), the overall network design (especially with several components insufficiently explained) undermines the interpretability of the entire framework."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Although the integration of three levels of information is conceptually reasonable, the current ablation study, which incrementally adds one module at a time, does not clearly reveal which component contributes most to the final decision. My question is: among the node-level, circuit-level, and network-level information, which source or combination of information plays the dominant role in the diagnostic performance?\n\n2. The network design is not clearly explained. For the RG-Fusion module, there are two inputs, $X^1$ and $X^2$, but it is unclear why they are fused in such a complicated manner. It appears that $X^1$ and $X^2$ are first fused, and then another branch fuses information from $X^1$ again. The motivation for this structure should be clarified. In addition, is the feature dimension $d$ consistent between Equations (1) and (5)?\n\n3. The loss function contains three regularization terms. How are the different $\\lambda$ values tuned in practice? It is unclear whether a single set of $\\lambda$ values can generalize across different datasets, and I suspect that the optimal configuration might be highly dataset-dependent.\n\n4. I acknowledge that other approaches do not explicitly consider low-frequency oscillatory patterns in BOLD signals. However, it is unclear why you claim that your method captures such information. From my understanding, you simply add a new input (the raw BOLD signal) and apply a basic Transformer architecture. Do you attribute the ability to capture low-frequency oscillations solely to the Transformer design? \n\n5. It is difficult to clearly understand the source of the reported performance gain. The proposed model takes two inputs, the functional connectivity (FC) matrix $X^1$ and the BOLD signal $X^2$, which effectively makes the framework a multi-view learning system. If I understand correctly, most existing GNN-based approaches use only $X^1$. Since multi-view learning has recently gained attention in neuroscience, it is important to clarify whether the performance improvement primarily stems from introducing an additional input modality rather than from the proposed complex network design itself?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "fBMK8bqhrw", "forum": "NmFsKxhhlc", "replyto": "NmFsKxhhlc", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15631/Reviewer_d3rB"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15631/Reviewer_d3rB"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15631/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761949938240, "cdate": 1761949938240, "tmdate": 1762925892512, "mdate": 1762925892512, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents NH-GCAT, a neurocircuitry-inspired model designed for explainable depression identification using fMRI data.
