The conditional value at risk of a random variable $X$ at a given parameter $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1$ is the quantity $\\mathbb{E} [X \\mid X \\geq q_{1 - \\alpha}]$ where $q_{1 - \\alpha}$ corresponds to the $1 - \\alpha$-quantile of $X$. In this paper, the authors derive estimates of this quantity from another random variable whose cdf is close $X$. The authors provide upper and lower bounds on the CVAR of $X$ as a function of those of $Y$. Additionally, they derive finite sample guarantees which assume access to a small set of samples from $Y$.\n\nMy main concern with the paper is that it is unclear what the main contributions of the paper are. The proofs of the CDF-closeness to CVAR closeness results are quite standard and the extensions to finite-sample settings also rely on well-known concentration inequalities. Furthermore, the empirical utility of these bounds is also challenging to evaluate given the limited experiments in the paper. Finally, the motivation of the paper is also not clearly explained. It would be great if the authors could provide some clarification on this. It is not clear when access to a random variable of interest is limited but an easy to obtain surrogate is readily available and satisfies the pre-conditions of the theorems proved here.
