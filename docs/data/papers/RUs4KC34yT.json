However, current studies only measure the accuracy of the translation of NL logic into formal TL, ignoring a system’s capacity to ground atomic propositions into new scenarios or environments. This is a critical feature, necessary for the verification of resulting formulas in a concrete state space. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic Benchmark (VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark for automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of three unique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications and their corresponding formal temporal logic specifications. Moreover, the benchmark contains sample traces to verify the temporal logic expressions. While the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that many frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting,  ii) grounding, iii) translation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after each of these steps to enable researchers to improve and evaluate different substeps of the overall problem.  \n Using the benchmark, we evaluate several state‑of‑the‑art NL-to-TL translation models and frameworks, including nl2spec, NL2TL, NL2LTL, Lang2LTL, sequence-to-sequence translation, and various LLM prompting techniques. Our evaluation confirms that existing work is capable of reliably performing lifting and translation with high accuracy, while it exposes their struggles to ground the translation into a state space, which stems from the lack of existing datasets.", "tldr": "We present VLTL-Bench, a benchmark unifying lifting, grounding, translation, and verification for NL-to-LTL.

The metrics are clearly defined and appropriate."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "A) Limited Template Diversity and Generalization\n\nThis is my biggest concern with this work. The benchmark is built from only 43 linguistic and logical templates (36 from nl2spec + 7 new). While thousands of examples are generated through instantiation with different actions/arguments, this approach has some limitations. 43 templates cannot capture the rich diversity of natural language specifications in real-world applications. Human stakeholders express requirements in countless syntactic structures, with varying referring expressions, negations, conditionals, and quantifiers. The high translation accuracy (99.9% for NL2TL in Table 4) likely reflects template memorization rather than robust understanding. Additionally, Table 8 shows a significant imbalance. E.g., \"next\" appears ~10 times more than \"until\" across domains. This distribution may not reflect real-world specifications and could bias evaluation toward overrepresented operators. Finally, Models trained and evaluated on template-instantiated data may learn to recognize surface patterns rather than develop compositional understanding. \n\nB) Missing Analysis on Semantic Knowledge vs. Compositional Reasoning\n\nThe paper does not adequately address whether LLMs leverage pre-training knowledge for grounding, which is crucial for understanding the grounding bottleneck. It's well known that modern LLMs are trained on massive corpora, potentially including robotics documentation, LTL tutorials, warehouse management systems, and traffic control specifications. Additionally, GPT-4 models may have encountered the nl2spec benchmark (36 templates) during pre-training, artificially inflating performance on lifting and translation while grounding remains poor because it requires scenario-specific knowledge. Can they exploit this semantic knowledge for this benchmark? A possible solution would be to follow PlanBench's approach for PDDL planning. SImilar to it, the paper must include obfuscated versions where semantically meaningful names are replaced with arbitrary symbols. E.g., replace search(apple) with act_3(obj_17) then ask queries like \"perform procedure Z on target Q\" instead of \"look for the red fruit\". This would isolate compositional reasoning from semantic shortcuts, and test pure grounding ability based solely on scenario configuration. It might also mitigate data contamination concerns (nl2spec templates are publicly available). This is a major gap that significantly weakens the paper's contributions.\n\nC) Weak Grounding Baselines\n\nGiven that grounding is identified as the critical bottleneck (Table 5 shows 5.0%-68.6% AP-Dict accuracy), the baseline approaches are surprisingly simplistic. The baselines use a basic few-shot prompting without even the basic additions like chain-of-thought reasoning, structured output constraints like JSON, iterative refinement with verification feedback using provided traces, and self-consistency or ensemble methods. THis might inflate the efficacy of this benchmark."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Why 43 templates? Can you provide empirical or theoretical justification that 43 templates provide adequate coverage of natural language and logical diversity? What would performance look like with 10 templates vs 100 templates?\n2. Will you add obfuscated variants (replacing meaningful names with symbols like \"act_3(obj_17)\") to isolate compositional reasoning from semantic knowledge? This is standard practice in planning benchmarks (PlanBench) and seems essential here.\n3. Have you verified that the nl2spec templates and your scenarios don't appear in GPT-4's training data? Can you test on models with verifiable training cutoffs before your dataset creation?\n4. Why didn't you explore chain-of-thought prompting, iterative refinement with trace verification, or fine-tuned models for grounding given it's the identified bottleneck?\n5. How were the positive and negative traces chosen for each specification? Are they minimal, typical, or adversarial examples?\n6. Current scenarios have flat type systems.
