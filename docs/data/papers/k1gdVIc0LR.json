Leveraging inductive parameter-based transfer, models are transferred based on geographic proximity, topographic classification, dominant wind direction, and random assignment. Several architectures are evaluated, including recurrent, convolutional, attention-based, and dense networks. Results indicate that structured transfer strategies do not consistently outperform non-transfer baselines. This lack of improvement can be largely attributed to significant distributional differences in wind speed across stations, which hinder model transferability. These findings highlight the challenges posed by domain shift in a geographically heterogeneous insular context and emphasize the need for more refined similarity criteria, hybrid transfer strategies, and spatially-aware modeling, notably through graph neural networks. The results also call for a critical reassessment of commonly held assumptions about the benefits of transfer learning in complex meteorological environments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["transfer learning", "deep learning", "fine-tuning", "wind forecasting", "negative transfer"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/23b157fc29c41d30e16ecb9d2ff2e4901e164fc7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This study investigates the utility of several transfer learning strategies reported in past studies for wind speed forecasting across meteorological stations in Corsica.

While the experiments seem solid, it is hard to claim that transfer learning does not work well in meteorological experiments in general. Transfer learning may not perform well in the Corsica case, but it worked well in other cases in past work. The Discussion section explains this based on the complex topography of Corsica, but more general claims should be verified. Finding one \"counter example\", though important, is not impactful enough to meet the standards of ICLR in my personal view. \n\n---\n**Technical Contributions**\n\nIn my understanding, this study does not offer any technical contributions, not proposing a new model, evaluation framework, or training recipe to make transfer learning work in the Corsica case. The major contribution seems to be meteorologically meaningful, but the impact on the machine learning community is limited (even as an application paper). \n\n---\nI feel the paper is still half-way.

The authors train several neural architectures (FFN, LSTM, Conv-LSTM, Conv-Dense, encoder-only attention) and test station-to-station transfer based on four heuristics: distance, topographic class, dominant wind direction, and random. Performance is measured by RMSE over a 24-hour horizon (direct multi-step), with gains computed versus the same architecture trained without transfer. Across nearly all of the settings, structured transfer rarely helps and often hurts performance.

Clear, negative-result study on a practical forecasting task. Systematic TL setups across multiple architectures, with transparent training/validation/test splits and a year-ahead test set (2023). Results call into question commonly held beliefs about transfer learning and its viability for modeling complex environmental processes.\n\n2. Multiple, interpretable transfer heuristics, based on geography and wind regimes, help show that even very similarly located stations with similar wind patterns may not be transferable. The \"random transfer\" setting also serves as an interesting secondary baseline.\n\n3. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov heatmap provides a plausible explanation for negative transfer and makes an explicit connection between domain shift and TL failure.\n\n4. The wide range of architectures and transfer methods demonstrate that this phenomenon is not due to a single, poorly chosen or poorly trained model."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited insight into “why”. The analysis (Table 1 and discussion) largely stops at “large distribution shift implies no transfer.” While this finding is true on the whole, it does not help to quantify when and where transfer learning might still be helpful. This analysis would strongly benefit from dissimilarity-benefit plots e.g. how transfer gains vary with KS distance or forecasting lead time. Other possibilities include: frequency-domain comparisons (are low- or high-frequency components mis-transferred?) or seasonal/diurnal stratification (transfer may fail differently by season or hour of day). These types of analyses could help reveal the full scope of transfer learning's feasibility on this problem.\n\n2. Limited scope. The study is confined to Corsica, whose wind patterns are strongly shaped by complex topography / orography and by highly regional flows (Mistral/Tramontane), which might limit the scope of these findings to Corsica. Whether these results would still hold in more settings with flatter terrain and consistent wind patterns, or even other mountainous regions, is not clear. This would need to be shown in a cross-region evaluation (e.g., mainland France), which could also help isolate whether transfer learning, as conduced here, works in relatively \"easy\" settings.\n\n3. External validity. This work only considers transfer learning within Corsica, rather than externally from other regions. It would be quite interesting, and strengthen the claims of the article, if it were shown that a strong, previously published wind model (e.g. Transformer or GNN based approach (e.g. Mehrkanoon, (2024)) could not be transfer learned onto Corsica data. I.e. if the fine-tuned TL variant was no better than the Corisca only variant. Many of these approaches are spatiotemporal models, which would also help broaden the scope of the analysis.\n\n4. Limited time lag. By considering only a very short time lag / context window (3 time steps), there is limited information for the neural networks to exploit. It may be possible that the models simply don't have enough information for TL to be effective. A longer history could allow for the model to capture diurnal/weekly cycles and low-frequency variability, which might be more amenable to transfer learning.\n\n5. All experiments use per-station models, yet station series are spatially correlated. Spatio-temporal approaches are very commonly used for wind forecasting; including one such baseline would help determine whether negative transfer stems from parameter reuse or from the lack of spatial inductive bias. This could likely be included along with an external validation by transfer learning a pre-existing model."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Given the KS plot in the discussion, is transfer learning in this situation in this manner possible? These results seem to suggest that no method may be able to overcome the high divergence between the neighboring series. I would be really curious to see if a spatiotemporal model can help here though.\n\n2. Please add a single figure showing transfer gain vs a measured divergence (e.g., KS) for every source–target pair, plus a simple fit of the model to confirm they are fully trained. Also show the same plot per a few different lead times to see if this changes over the forecasting horizon (1…24h).\n\n3. Can you fine-tune a strong published wind model, trained elsewhere, onto Corsica and compare to its Corsica-only version.\n\n4. Add one spatio-temporal graph model (train from scratch and with your TL framework) to separate “parameter reuse is unhelpful” from “the model lacks spatial inductive bias.”\n\n5. Repeat your main table with longer input histories (e.g., 12, 24, 72 steps) to test whether TL benefits change when the model can exploit diurnal/low-frequency structure.\n\n6. Alongside the aggregated RMSE, can you break down these results into per lead time statistics? I'm wondering if some the TL benefits may only be seen over very short forecasting horizons."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "uiNrWWp2AE", "forum": "k1gdVIc0LR", "replyto": "k1gdVIc0LR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19226/Reviewer_deyX"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19226/Reviewer_deyX"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19226/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761962502258, "cdate": 1761962502258, "tmdate": 1762931209576, "mdate": 1762931209576, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper evaluates transfer learning strategies for wind speed forecasting across 22 meteorological stations in Corsica using deep neural networks.
