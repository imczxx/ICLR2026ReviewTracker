This\npaper presents a computer vision system that enables industrial robots to detect and\npick up pen components in arbitrary orientations without the need for structured\ntrays, while maintaining robust performance under varying lighting conditions.\nWe implement and evaluate a Mask R-CNN-based approach in a complete pen\nproduction line, addressing three key challenges: object recognition without positional constraints, robustness to extreme lighting changes, and reliable performance\nwith cost-effective cameras. Our system achieves 95% recognition accuracy under\ndiverse lighting conditions and eliminates the need for structured component placement, resulting in significant improvements in manufacturing flexibility and overall\nrobustness. This approach has been validated through extensive experiments under\nfour distinct lighting scenarios. These results demonstrate its practical applicability\nfor real-world industrial deployment.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Industry 4.0; computer vision; Mask R-CNN; object detection; smart manufacturing; variable lighting; industrial vision; robotics"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5b382883c7c33cccce9b56aa05596ba295845e9e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper aims to address a real-world object detection problem in a pen production line.
