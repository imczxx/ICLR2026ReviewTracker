Yet, despite shared 3D spatial patterns, current approaches remain fragmented, with models narrowly specialized for specific domains and unable to generalize across tasks or scales.\nWe propose Uni-3DAR, a unified autoregressive framework for cross-scale 3D generation and understanding. At its core is a coarse-to-fine tokenizer based on octree data structures, which compresses diverse 3D structures into compact 1D token sequences. We further propose a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x.\nTo address the challenge of dynamically varying token positions introduced by compression, we introduce a masked next-token prediction strategy that ensures accurate positional modeling, significantly boosting model performance.\nExtensive experiments across multiple 3D generation and understanding tasks, including  small molecules, proteins, polymers, crystals, and macroscopic 3D objects, validate its effectiveness and versatility.

Models were trained independently for each task and dataset, meaning no cross-scale information was actually shared.

Unfair Efficiency Comparison: Was any post-processing or rejection sampling used to filter the generated outputs to meet conditional constraints (e.g., in CSP or molecule generation)? If so, the reported inference times are misleading and not a fair comparison to one-shot diffusion models, as the true cost (generation + filtering) could be substantially higher. I strongly encourage the authors to make their source code available.\n\n4. Generality of Speed-up: The reported speed-up is for a single task (unconditional QM9 generation).
