The authors effectively motivate the need for a principled merging strategy by highlighting the competitive and cooperative dynamics observed across different SMoE layers and architectures (Figure 1, Figures 6, 8, 9).

The definition of NAMEx (Definition 3.3) and the algorithms (Algorithm 1 and 2) are clearly presented.

This principled method for balancing cooperation and competition among experts is highly original.\n- Enhanced Convergence via Complex Momentum: The successful integration of complex momentum into the expert propagation mechanism (NAMEx-Momentum) accelerates convergence and provides needed stability, particularly addressing limitations found in EP-CAMEx. The theoretical convergence guarantee further enhances this contribution.\n\nThe central claims—that expert merging can be framed as a bargaining game and that NBS provides a principled solution—are adequately supported with both theoretical derivation and comprehensive empirical evidence.\nThe paper formalizes NAMEx as the Nash solution to the Bargaining of Expert Merging Problem, derived from the Nash product maximization objective. The authors provide a proof sketch, which establishes the Nash Bargaining equation $G^\\top G \\alpha = 1/\\alpha$ for computing the optimal update direction. Furthermore, the introduction of complex momentum is backed by a convergence guarantee.\nThe empirical methodology is thorough, testing NAMEx and its momentum variants against baselines across four distinct domains. The consistent performance superiority shown across small, medium, and large-scale models confirms the effectiveness and scalability of the method. The supplementary analysis showing NAMEx yields faster and more stable convergence compared to EP-CAMEx (Figure 5) validates the motivation for using complex momentum.\n\n**Originality and Significance**: The core innovation of framing expert merging as a bargaining problem solved via the Nash Bargaining Solution is highly original and offers a principled alternative to existing heuristics. This perspective enables a derived weighting mechanism ($\\alpha$) rather than a heuristic one.\n\n**Quality of Results**: NAMEx variants consistently deliver superior performance across various benchmarks.\n\n**Clarity and Insight**: The paper is clear in its definitions and provides insightful empirical analysis, such as visualizing how NAMEx steers outcomes closer to the Pareto surface than linear averaging (Figure 11). The investigation into complex and quaternion momentum further pushes the boundaries for stability in expert propagation.\n\n**Theoretical Foundation**: The theoretical proof of convergence for NAMEx-Momentum underpins the method's stability and provides a foundation for future analysis."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I don't find any major weakness in the paper. \n\nHere are two typos.
