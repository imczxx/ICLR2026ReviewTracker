However, many smart contracts have been found to contain vulnerabilities and errors, leading to the loss of assets within the blockchain. Despite a range of tools that have been developed to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts at the source code or bytecode level, most rely on a single modality, reducing performance, accuracy, and limited generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning approach, MultiCFV, which is designed specifically to analyze and detect erroneous control flow vulnerability, as well as identify code clones in smart contracts. Bytecode is generated from source code to construct control flow graphs, with graph embedding techniques extracting graph features. Abstract syntax trees are used to obtain syntax features, while code comments capture key commentary words and comment features. These three feature vectors are fused to create a database for code inspection, which is used to detect similar code and identify contract vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively combines structural, syntactic, and semantic information, improving the accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection and clone detection.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["multimodal learning", "code clone", "vulnerability", "smart contract"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/84ca5b52c9af07aa5abbeea635600f9c806112c0.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/5f13c9b9733ffa847e3ad8833be6df7dbffd7fa7.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces MultiCFV, a deep learning framework for detecting control-flow-related vulnerabilities and code clones in smart contracts.
