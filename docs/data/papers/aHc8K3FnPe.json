In clinical applications, a transparent, step-by-step reasoning process provides physicians with strong evidence to support decision-making. While reinforcement learning has effectively enhanced reasoning performance in medical contexts, the clinical reliability of these reasoning processes remains limited because their accuracy and validity are often overlooked during training. To address this gap, we propose MedCEG, a framework that augments medical models with clinically valid reasoning pathways by explicitly supervising the reasoning process through a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG).\nWe curate a dataset of challenging clinical cases and algorithmically construct a CEG for each sample to represent a high-quality verifiable reasoning pathway. \nTo guide the reasoning process, we introduce a Clinical Reasoning Procedure Reward, which evaluates Node Coverage, Structural Correctness, and Chain Completeness, thereby providing a holistic assessment of reasoning quality. Experimental results show that MedCEG achieves competitive performance across multiple medical benchmarks while generating more clinically sound reasoning chains, offering a promising step towards more reliable medical AI reasoning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Medical Reasoning; Medical Large Language Model"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/db11eb3c4766aa2c5404bc2c83d1800fc022bda5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/18f3a419d943332fbc9ed1646688c64d454678c5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MedCEG, a framework that enhances medical reasoning in large language models by supervising their reasoning process through a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG).

The entire pipeline heavily depends on several powerful LLMs for generating reasoning processes, constructing graphs, computing rewards, and even performing model evaluation (via LLM-as-a-judge). None of these steps involves natural linkages or expert verification, which raises concerns about cumulative noise and inherited bias.\n\n2. The evaluation design is largely self-referential. GPT-OSS-120B is used to generate reasoning traces for SFT training in the cold-start stage, and the same family of models is later reused for process parsing, reward computation, and judgment. This may introduce model preference bias, as prior studies have shown that LLM judges tend to favor their own outputs or those from similar architectures.\n\n3. The comparison with baselines may be unfair. The cold-start phase essentially distills GPT-OSS-120B into a smaller base model, while other baselines do not benefit from such distilled supervision.\n\n4. The results lack statistical analysis. It is unclear whether the reported improvements are statistically significant or robust across runs.\n\n5. The description of human annotation is vague; there’s no information on annotator background, quality control, or consistency checks.\n\n6. Some implementations lack sufficient details.

Whether this is intentional or not, it needs to be corrected. For instance, for each benchmark, it is unclear why the best-performing models were not reported. In MedQA, GPT-4 achieves 90% accuracy, while MedGemini reaches 91%. However, the best performance reported in this work is only 75.41%. This represents a 15% gap between the current state-of-the-art and the contribution of this work. Therefore, the claim that this method “achieves SOTA performance with 58.59 on in-distribution tasks and 64.09 on out-of-distribution tasks” is incorrect. The method is far from achieving state-of-the-art performance. Please correct all tables to include SOTA performance for each benchmark\n\nOther concerns:\n\n1. Heavy reliance on LLMs to build supervision: CEGs and triplets are partly generated/extracted by large models, raising questions about noise, circular supervision, and bias propagation. For example, if the best average performance models can get on the evaluated benchmarks is 64% how can authors guarantee that the dataset is not correct at most 64% of the time?\n\n\n2. Limited human expert validation:  The paper does not clearly quantify clinician involvement or error-rate analysis in graph construction, **critical for the medical reliability claims**. For example, prior work has extensively shown that LLMs can output the correct answer while providing incorrect clinical reasoning traces. Given that this dataset is both generated and evaluated by LLMs, how can the authors ensure its quality? I believe it is not possible to make such claims without clinical involvement \n\n3. Evaluation focuses on QA benchmarks: Reasoning quality is mostly assessed via internal metrics and QA outcomes. This paper needs stronger real-world or expert-rated studies if claims of \"produces more clinically sound reasoning chains, showing significant improvements in reasoning quality compared to existing methods\" are made.\n\n4.

The authors described their work as verifiable medical reasoning, but this concept is not clear to me. From what I understand, the method aligns the LLM’s reasoning process with the Critical Evidence Graph (CEG). However, there is no guarantee that the CEG itself is correct or based on accurate medical knowledge. In my view, verifiable medical reasoning should mean that the model reasons based on verified external knowledge sources. Since the model does not interact with any reliable knowledge base, I don’t think this can be considered true verifiable medical reasoning.\n2. I’m very interested in the graph-based reward design. I’m particularly curious about the relationship among the node reward, structural reward, and chain reward mentioned in Formula (4). Could the authors explain how these parameters are defined? From the appendix, I noticed that the node weight is 0.5, while the structural and chain rewards are 0.3 and 0.2, respectively. If reasoning chains are important, why does the node reward receive the highest weight?\n3. It also seems that the overall reward is mainly optimized by the answer itself (with a weight of 0.6). Could the authors provide additional evidence to show the effectiveness of the reasoning reward?\n4. Could the authors compare the nodes in the CEG with the medical concepts mentioned in the question? I’m curious why the node features are so important in the results—especially in Figure 5. Is it because the generated CEG includes more medical concepts than the original question?\n5. Is the backbone LLM used in this work LLaMA 3.1-8B?\n6. The authors mention that the cold-start version is obtained by fully fine-tuning the model. Is full fine-tuning necessary? Also, why does the fully fine-tuned model perform worse than the SFT model in the in-distribution setting?\n7.
