But how robust are these reasoning traces to disruptions that occur within them? To address this question, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that perturbs a model’s own CoT at fixed timesteps. We design seven interventions (benign, neutral, and adversarial) and apply them to multiple open-weight RLLMs across MATH, SCIENCE, and LOGIC tasks. Our results show that RLLMs are generally robust, reliably recovering from diverse perturbations, with robustness improving with model size and degrading when interventions occur early. However, robustness is not style-invariant: paraphrasing suppresses doubt-like expressions and reduces performance, while other interventions trigger doubt and support recovery. Recovery also carries a cost: neutral and adversarial noise can inflate CoT length by more than 200%, whereas paraphrasing shortens traces but harms accuracy. These findings provide new evidence on how RLLMs maintain reasoning integrity, identify doubt as a central recovery mechanism, and highlight trade-offs between robustness and efficiency that future training methods should address.", "tldr": "Reasoning LLMs mostly recover from disruptions using doubting mechanisms, but paraphrasing hinders this and recovery raises reasoning cost.", "keywords": ["large language model", "reasoning model", "robustness", "chain of thought"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/00f469bc8af2fe1780db2b80b6e62df32b8c5a7b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies how robust are reasoning models to disruptions of their own reasoning traces.

Other two types of adversarial reasoning contain incorrect information, whereas this type does not.

While identifying \"doubt\" is a major strength, the analysis relies on an LLM-based classifier to label sentences. This approach, while pragmatic, is somewhat superficial. The paper would be significantly strengthened by a deeper investigation into how \"doubt\" is represented internally. The activation analysis in the appendix is a good first step, but it feels underdeveloped. A more detailed analysis connecting specific internal states to the expression of doubt would benifit the contribution of the work.\n\n2. The interventions are all single-step disruptions. In many real-world scenarios (e.g., interacting with a faulty tool), errors can be more subtle or cascading. For instance, a model might accept a slightly incorrect tool output and then build several subsequent reasoning steps upon it. The current framework does not evaluate robustness to such persistent or multi-step correlated errors, which may be harder for the model to detect and recover from.\n\n3.  The paper excels at diagnosing the problem but is light on proposing solutions. The conclusion suggests that future training methods should address these weaknesses (e.g., style invariance, recovery efficiency), but it offers no preliminary experiments on how this could be achieved.

Regarding the LLM-based \"doubt\" classifier: How was its performance validated?

Have you considered experiments with multi-step interventions or cascading errors (e.g., where a wrong fact is introduced and then used logically in the next step)?

It suggests models overfit to a particular reasoning \"style.\" Based on this, what are your thoughts on potential training strategies to mitigate this? Would training on a more stylistically diverse set of CoTs (e.g., via paraphrasing augmentation) be a promising direction?\n\n4.
