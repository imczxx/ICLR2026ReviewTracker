Existing implicit methods often suffer from local minima under noisy supervision and lack physical interpretability, while explicit approaches rely on predefined constitutive equations, limiting generalizability. To address these issues, our framework, **PhyCo**, introduces two key innovations. First, we propose *Edge-Aware Depth Consensus Anchors* to establish robust geometric constraints from sparse observations, circumventing unreliable pixel-level supervision. Second, a *Multi-Hypothesis Physics Verifier* integrates classical constitutive models as differentiable hypotheses, providing strong physical priors to regularize the optimization while preserving the flexibility of implicit modeling. This unified approach ensures physical plausibility without sacrificing generality. Extensive experiments on synthetic, real-to-sim, and real-world datasets demonstrate that **PhyCo** significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in learning accurate and generalizable physical dynamics from monocular videos.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Gaussian splatting", "physics-informed learning", "implicit constitutive laws"], "primary_area": "neurosymbolic & hybrid AI systems (physics-informed, logic & formal reasoning, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0e6e8f6d5ff5ee4fb2bf6abae49ea1d19f5c9991.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/831d2a297e1a2ec1a3e64d35f8a5d86acb52a56b.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a method to learn the implicit constitutive laws of deformable objects via monocular video observation.

This mechanism ensures high-quality geometric reconstruction, providing a solid foundation for subsequent physical parameter inversion.\n2.\tOne of the core contributions of this paper is the design of MHPV, which embeds known physical conservation laws (such as momentum conservation) as hard constraints into the training of implicit constitutive laws. This ensures that the learned constitutive functions are physically reasonable and reliable, greatly enhancing the model’s interpretability — something that purely data-driven methods can hardly achieve.\n3.\tThe PHYCO framework successfully combines the efficient rendering capability of GS with the expressive power of implicit functions, enabling the direct learning of complex, nonlinear, and non-elastic constitutive laws from monocular videos. This avoids dependence on traditional predefined explicit constitutive equations and significantly broadens the model’s generalization and modeling capability for various complex materials and physical phenomena."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "However, I do have several concerns about this work:\n1.\tThe core components of the framework rely on several pre-trained modules.

However, if these selected material models do not adequately approximate or represent real material physics, the “physical rationality” constraints imposed by MHPV might become counterproductive rather than optimizing PHYCO.
