While existing approaches rely on redundant sensors or multi-modal fusion, they struggle with rare edge cases and require extensive datasets for training. We propose LLM-ADF, a Large Language Model-based Autonomous Driving Framework that leverages few-shot learning to enhance robustness against perceptual anomalies. Our key innovation lies in constructing a specialized autonomous driving space through information geometry-guided dimensionality reduction, decoupling high-dimensional text embeddings into driving-relevant features while preserving contextual reasoning capabilities. We introduce a manifold-based reasoning mechanism that connects the text space with the driving space, enabling LLMs to perform spatial-temporal inference even under corrupted inputs. The framework incorporates a self-correction database that enables continuous learning from historical anomalies, dynamically adjusting the manifold structure through Fisher information metrics. We construct an adversarial dataset with 2,730 anomalous frames simulating sensor failures and adversarial attacks. Experimental results on UniAD and ST-P3 benchmarks demonstrate that LLM-ADF achieves 24.93% average collision rate on UniAD, outperforming GPT-Driver by 22% under normal conditions and showing 14.9% degradation under anomalies compared to 17-21% for existing LLM-based methods. Our approach represents a paradigm shift towards few-shot learning in safety-critical autonomous systems, providing theoretical foundations and practical solutions for L4 autonomous driving deployment.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Information manifolds", "Large language models", "Adversarial robustness", "Autonomous driving", "Feature disentanglement", "Geometric projection", "Perception uncertainty", "Few-shot learning"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9c7a553aaeef0acaa14eb994e707f677a58f5332.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an innovative framework for autonomous driving systems that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for few-shot learning and anomalous input processing.

While this paper claims that \"ur method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory\", it does not mean that existing methods cannot detect the attack. If it is finally observable, we may not need a special design to capture it. In their empirical evaluation, I cannot see a clear improvement by addressing these limitations. This paper should provide more evidence that their method can particularly address the limitations in prior works more clearly.\n\n### Limitations when deploying to real-world applications\n\nWhile this paper also acknowledges, their method has primary limitations stemming from the static nature of some of its core components.
