We revisit fairness through the lens of homophily using CSBM-S, a synthetic model that independently controls label homophily $h_y$ and sensitive homophily $h_s$, enabling precise and repeatable evaluation of group fairness. CSBM-S reveals two key observations: (i) group disparity peaks when $h_y \\approx 0.5$; and (ii) bias consistently diminishes as $h_s \\rightarrow 0.5$. Guided by these insights, we propose FairEST, which enforces $h_s \\approx 0.5$ by flipping the sensitive attribute and its most correlated features during training. Across diverse benchmarks and backbones, FairEST attains the lowest bias on most encoder-dataset pairs with comparable accuracy, yielding average absolute reductions of 1.63% ($\\Delta \\mathrm{SP}$) and 1.28% ($\\Delta \\mathrm{EO}$) over the prior state-of-the-art.

My main concern about this work is that it largely uses methods and insights already well established in the literature. Moreover, the authors do not offer enough arguments as to how their work explicitly differs from these methods, sometimes missing citations all together. A few examples are: \n    \n    - Homophily and fairness are already well connected in the literature. As far as I can tell, the authors do not explicitly address how their work builds on, or \"revisits\", these previous findings [1, 2, 3].\n    - Beyond just connecting homophily and fairness, the proposed CSBM-S model and analysis in section 4 are highly similar to that in [2], both from the model design of manipulating label and sensitive attribute homophily, as well as the resulting takeaways. \n    - The idea of flipping the sensitive attribute, aiming to \"debias\" the message passing process, does not seem sufficiently different from previous methods which manipulate the graph structure to encourage different treatments across sensitive attributes [3, 4].\n\n2. For the majority of the experimental results, while the fairness metrics are decent, the accuracy drops are sometimes quite large. Given my points above, I think significantly more effort needs to go in to remedy this issue and establish more novelty in the method. \n\n3. While trying to assess whether the author justified the performance drops, I realized there are instances in section 6.2 which do not seem to correspond to Table 1.

The idea that message passing propagates sensitive signals via edges with attribute correlation is well-established (Wang et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2022; Dai & Wang, 2021). The notion of balancing sensitive attribute distributions (making $h_s \\approx 0.5$) is just a graph-level rephrasing of feature decorrelation or resampling. FairEST’s “flip and reflect” procedure is essentially a stochastic data augmentation trick, not a theoretically or algorithmically novel approach. As such, the manuscript somewhat overstates the conceptual novelty of the approach by framing it as a “homophily-centric fairness framework,” when the underlying idea remains relatively straightforward.\n\n2. In Section 4.4, the analysis appears to restate known results from mean-field diffusion analysis. The authors find that bias is largest when label information is weak ($h_y \\approx 0.5$) and when sensitive channels dominate (extreme $h_s$). While this observation is intuitively consistent, i.e., bias tends to increase when sensitive features drive predictive signals. It does not seem to offer new theoretical insight into why or how GNN architectures amplify fairness issues.\n\n3. Despite proposing CSBM-S, the paper does not use it to uncover deeper causal or structural insights about fairness dynamics in graphs. The synthetic experiments are mainly limited to grid-sweep heatmaps and a few straightforward observations, without quantitative analyses of robustness, sensitivity to graph topology, or comparisons with alternative fairness mechanisms. As a result, the proposed “homophily-centric toolkit” currently functions more as a synthetic data generator than as a framework for deeper theoretical understanding."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
