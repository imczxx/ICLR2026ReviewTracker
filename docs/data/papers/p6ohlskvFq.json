For instance, while §2.2 defines d(\\theta,\\theta') and justifies arc-over-chord, the work does not clearly illustrate how class prototypes/decision regions would actually look in the polar space or how geodesic fusion moves ambiguous points relative to Euclidean fusion on real samples. Stronger mechanistic evidence (e.g., before/after angular distributions, prototype geometry) would make the insight more convincing.\n\n(2) Key steps are scattered between main text and appendices (e.g., gradient gating by resultant length, complex-to-real interface for attention, and exact reliability logit formation).

Cross-dataset transfer, domain shift, or multilingual settings that are common in MER are not fully covered, and the authors themselves note scope limits. \n\n(4) While reproduced baselines are fair internally, the set (MulT, MemoCMT, MultiEMO) omits several recent robust-fusion or missing-modality MER approaches; literature-reported numbers are intentionally not used for significance, but this also narrows the external positioning of PGN.\n\n(5) The on/off ablations (no geodesic, no Transformer) and order test (PGT vs PTG) are helpful, but finer-grained ablations are missing: e.g., (i) remove reliability weighting but keep circular mean; (ii) replace geodesic mean with chord/Euclidean on the unit circle; (iii) vary masked-softmax temperature and the phase-gradient gate systematically in main text (some sweeps are in appendix but not tied to core claims)."}, "questions": {"value": "(1) Why polar per-dimension?

The core components, i.e., polar coordinate representations and geodesic fusion via the circular mean, are well-established concepts in directional statistics and geometric deep learning. The paper primarily applies these ideas to multimodal emotion recognition rather than introducing a fundamental innovation. The actual architectural novelty, specifically the integration path, feels incremental.\n2. I think the biggest flaw of this paper is the integrity and validity of the experiments. First, the compared methods are only three; this is incredible for the MER field. This field has been developing for decades, for example, the IEMOCAP dataset used in this paper was proposed in 2008. Therefore, the three compared methods are definitely insufficient. Secondly, the three compared algorithms do not have references, which is not friendly to beginners.\n3. The decision to use a unified frozen-backbone protocol, while ensuring fairness, severely constrains the model's representational power and may not reflect real-world performance where fine-tuning is common. More critically, all baseline comparisons are based on the authors' own reproductions. Without direct comparisons to officially reported results using their original code and hyperparameters, it's impossible to verify if the baselines were implemented optimally, introducing a potential source of bias that undermines the claimed superiority.\n4. The ablation study reveals a critical weakness: removing the subsequent Transformer causes the largest performance drop. This suggests that the proposed geometric fusion alone is insufficient and that the model heavily relies on a standard Transformer to capture the necessary dependencies, thereby reducing the perceived standalone contribution of the geometric components."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see Weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "biu9XVgnFh", "forum": "p6ohlskvFq", "replyto": "p6ohlskvFq", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22329/Reviewer_4Psi"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22329/Reviewer_4Psi"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22329/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761657318048, "cdate": 1761657318048, "tmdate": 1762942171677, "mdate": 1762942171677, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes the Polar Geodesic Network (PGN), a geometry-aware multimodal emotion recognition framework operating in polar coordinates.
