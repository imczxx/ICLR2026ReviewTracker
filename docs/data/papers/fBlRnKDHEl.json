Although existing Domain Generalization (DG) methods have shown promise in enhancing model robustness, they often neglect the spatial structural relationships of objects during the learning of domain-invariant features, thereby limiting their effectiveness in object detection tasks compared to classification tasks. From the perspective of Preserving Phase Invariance (PPI), we propose a novel methodology that aims to enhance model generalization while preserving accurate object localization. This methodology comprises three complementary modules: Mix Normalization Perturbation (MNP), which synthesizes diverse styles to improve robustness; Sensitive Channel Perturbation (SCP), which suppresses domain-specific features at the channel level; and Attention on Amplitude (AOA), which applies spectral attention to the amplitude component. Together, these modules promote phase-invariant representations and contribute to improved cross-domain detection performance. Our approach fundamentally reduces the domain generalization gap in classification and detection by maintaining the integrity of key structural information. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Single Domain Generalization Object Detection benchmarks, even outperforming most recent state-of-the-art Domain Adaptation techniques.

For instance, in line 426 (\"noise sampling\") and line 377 (\"Observation\"), it is unclear whether these terms should be bolded or placed on separate lines. Consistency in formatting should be maintained throughout the manuscript. In addition, several figures and tables, such as Figure 4 and Tables 5–8, are presented in a cluttered and inconsistent layout, which affects overall readability and visual coherence.\n\n－ There are numerous spelling, grammatical, and formatting errors throughout the manuscript. For example, \"Table .2.2\" in line 110 and \"Table. 2.3\" in line 146 contain formatting issues, while line 282 includes grammatical mistakes. Inconsistencies are also observed around Figure 7 and line 198. Similar problems appear in other parts of the paper and should be carefully checked and revised to ensure overall accuracy and consistency.\n\n－ The analysis of frequency-domain information using the attention mechanism and the demonstration of phase invariance in Table 7 are interesting. However, as shown in Table 7, MNP appears to play the dominant role, while AOA contributes relatively less. I suggest the authors further investigate the AOA mechanism and strengthen the ablation study, for example, by designing a more innovative AOA structure, analyzing feature distribution changes before and after AOA, and evaluating detector performance under different domain conditions.\n\n－Some methodological descriptions are vague and symbol definitions are inconsistent. For example, in the MNP module, the noise sampling process and the values of the mixing parameters ($w_1$, $w_2$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$) are not clearly specified. Additionally, in line 274, the spatial feature map is defined as f, while in Figure 4 the output is denoted as x, which is inconsistent. Clarification and consistency are recommended.\n\n－As noted in Section 4.2, FFDI, UAV-OD, and HybridAugment++ also aim to preserve phase invariance. It is recommended that the authors include experimental comparisons with these methods.\n\n－In Tables 1 and 2, the authors claim that existing domain-invariant or consistency-based methods typically increase per-object classification accuracy while degrading localization quality. However, the limited number of compared methods reduces the persuasiveness of this claim.\n\n－UDA methods are now well established and achieve strong performance in C2F and Real-to-Artistic scenarios. In Tables 3 and 5, the number of compared methods is limited, and the performance gains on C2F are modest. It is therefore recommended that the authors focus primarily on the single-domain generalization task.\n\n－ There are inconsistencies in the reported results, for example, the mAP values in Table 7 of the main text differ from those in Tables 12–15 in the appendix.
