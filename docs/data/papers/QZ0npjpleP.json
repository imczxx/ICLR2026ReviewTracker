However, their applications in cryptography, which serves as a foundational pillar of cybersecurity, remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose AICrypto, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cryptography capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprises 135 multiple-choice questions, 150 capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and 18 proof problems, covering a broad range of skills from factual memorization to vulnerability exploitation and formal reasoning. All tasks are carefully reviewed or constructed by cryptography experts to ensure correctness and rigor. To support automated evaluation of CTF challenges, we design an agent-based framework. We introduce strong human expert performance baselines for comparison across all task types. Our evaluation of 17 leading LLMs reveals that state-of-the-art models match or even surpass human experts in memorizing cryptographic concepts, exploiting common vulnerabilities, and routine proofs. However, our case studies reveal that they still lack a deep understanding of abstract mathematical concepts and struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning and dynamic analysis. We hope this work could provide insights for future research on LLMs in cryptographic applications.

Helper scripts change the original CTF question. For many CTFs, the benchmark injects helper.py/.sage, which meaningfully lowers parsing/IO friction relative to human play and could inflate LLM success on certain categories. An ablation “with vs. without helper” would quantify this effect.\n2. Proof scoring is manual and single‑pass. While the authors explain why LLM‑as‑grader is unreliable, the paper does not discuss inter‑rater agreement or rubric calibration across graders. Given that subtle logic gaps are a core finding, reporting inter-annotator metrics would bolster credibility. Moreover, manual grading makes running on the Proof subsection not scalable.\n3. Limited # of Questions. Each subsection contains only a limited number of questions per sub-category. For example, DLP (under CTF) just contains 10 questions, while there are just 18 Proof Questions (all sub-categories combined), making the results not significant. Reporting the significance of the results or adding more questions would greatly improve the reliability of the benchmark.\n4. Saturation on MCQ subset.
