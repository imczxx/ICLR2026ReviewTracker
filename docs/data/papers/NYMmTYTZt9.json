Despite significant progress in the area, extracting accurate tight-layout wireframes from remotely sensed data remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce Pix2Plan, a single-stage end-to-end set prediction transformer for wireframe parsing using two-level polygon queries and junction matching. Pix2Plan employs a DETR-style encoder-decoder transformer to predict a set of two-level polygon queries and a global set of junction vertices. The polygon vertex proposals are matched to the predicted junctions in the scene to obtain a wireframe as a planar graph. Thus, Pix2Plan can retrieve the building roof / indoor room polygons in the wireframe in a tight layout. Evaluation on several challenging planar graph datasets demonstrates that Pix2Plan achieves state-of-the-art performance across precision, recall, and shape quality metrics while exhibiting high efficiency.", "tldr": "We present a DETR-style network for extracting building roof wireframes and indoor floorplans from remotely sensed data in a planar graph format.", "keywords": ["wireframe parsing", "building roof extraction", "indoor floorplan extraction"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7f69c01f4752bc5db173ceb3390cc97cc9f5f136.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces Pix2Plan, a single-stage, end-to-end transformer model for wireframe parsing of built environments from remotely sensed data such as LiDAR or RGB-D scans.

Besides, the combination of corner junction and polygon segment detection through the Vertex-Junction Matching module is kind of trivial.\n2.

Specifically, evaluation results on floorplan reconstruction benchmarks (*Structured3D* in `Tab.2` and *SceneCAD* in `Tab.3`), do not demonstrate a clear superiority over existing methods. \n3.

Please also refer to `Q2`.\n4. A comparison with *HEAT* on *Building3D* in `Tab.1` is missing. It is essential since the proposed method builds upon the architectures of both *HEAT* and *RoomFormer*, yet a comparison with *HEAT* is omitted for this specific dataset.\n5.
