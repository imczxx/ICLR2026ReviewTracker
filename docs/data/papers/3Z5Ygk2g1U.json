Our key idea is a \\emph{run-wise certificate}: we couple each node's key to the \\emph{same} exponential race that realizes leaf perturbations, so the standard halting rule---stop when $\\max_{v\\in\\mathcal{F}}\\Key(v)\\le B^{\\ast}$, where $B^{\\ast}$ is the incumbent realized leaf value---soundly certifies the realized run. We provide two certified modes on context-indexed prefix--DAGs whose children partition the leaf set. \\emph{Exact} mode (known counts) implements lazy offset propagation with winner reuse; \\emph{Surrogate} mode (upper bounds only) disables winner reuse and uses a parent-anchored surrogate race; keys are conservative online and can be tightened ex post by a validator via $\\kappa=\\log(N/\\Nub)$. A small compiler enforces the partition property, and an admissible, race-independent $M_\\tau$ keeps keys sound. A replayable ledger records uniforms, counts, and tie handling; privacy follows from post-processing. Experiments on synthetic graphs and a small real tool-use pipeline show tight stopping, deterministic replay, and low overhead.\n\\end{abstract}", "tldr": "We prove when a tool-use router can safely stop—and log a ledger so anyone can replay and verify the run.", "keywords": ["LLM tool-use routing", "perturb-and-MAP", "best-first (A*) search", "certified inference", "local differential privacy", "graph search on DAGs", "large language models", "auditing and reproducibility"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5dde4b6b5aa261986d605d0bdb60d68de3391849.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/1408b126234fdaab253d0e3b0690e1731977c8e5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper appears to present something, but it is not entirely clear what.
