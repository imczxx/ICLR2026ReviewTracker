The core innovation lies in establishing a physical connection between the intrinsic dynamics of the rPPG signal and a specific neural network architecture. The authors rigorously derive the underlying physiological dynamics from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, simplifying it to a second-order Damped Harmonic Oscillator Ordinary Differential Equation. Crucially, they prove that the discrete solution of this ODE is equivalent to a causal convolution, thus providing a solid theoretical basis for employing a TCN. PHASE-Net integrates three key modules: a Gated TCN for modeling the physics-driven pulse dynamics, a Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper for zero-cost spatial feature mixing, and an Adaptive Spatial Filter for dynamically focusing on signal-rich regions and explicitly encoding local pulse velocity.

The paper claims to be a \"physics-grounded\" model; however, only the GTCN module is directly derived from physical principles (ODE → TCN).

Although the theoretical derivation is innovative, the performance comparison with recent methods (such as PhysMamba, RhythmMamba, etc.) needs to be more comprehensive. The paper should more clearly articulate in which specific aspects it surpasses these state-of-the-art methods.\n\n3. ZAS is shown to be effective, but it is essentially a spatial permutation operation.
