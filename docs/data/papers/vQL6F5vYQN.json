However, spectral GNNs that utilize a global eigenbasis or high-order polynomial surrogates for filtering rely upon dense, non-orthogonal, non-local bases that blend signals from distant, semantically unrelated regions. This results in small clusters connected to large homogeneous hubs becoming indistinguishable and overshadowed by continuous global mixing, exacerbating oversmoothing. To address these limitations, in this paper, we present Hierarchical Multi-view Haar (HMH), a locality-first, multiresolution framework for learning frequency signal region-by-region.HLH estimates diffusion neighborhoods and constructs a diffusion barrier to identify incompatible neighbors that are weakly connected under diffusion (i.e., connected by long, low-weight paths), preventing incompatible clusters from being merged together.A lightweight MLP layer is applied on the bottom-K eigenspace of a multi-view Laplacian (which combines topology and feature affinity), generating soft node scores for coarsening the graph into a hierarchy.Rather than a full graph-wide eigendecomposition, at each level, we create a strictly local, degree-aware, block-sparse orthonormal Haar basis that consists of a low-pass scaling wavelet and a high-pass inter-/intra-cluster wavelet. This sparsity enables near-linear operations per layer while preserving strict locality. The multi-scale unpooling layer combines coarse and fine signals to preserve small, high-contrast local structures while maintaining global context. The hierarchy reduces effective path lengths for message passing, preventing oversquashing. Empirically, HMH attains state-of-the-art performance with linear scalability, enhancing node classification by up to 3\\% on heterophilous benchmarks and up to 7\\% on graph classification tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph Kearning", "Deep learning", "Clustering."], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1e7b5222ccea9b2e8274ba643cc9d782b061d8c8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/863e0e2ba48addfeb907b6f7b3a31420b6b90f19.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a hierarchical, multiresolution framework called Hierarchical Spectral Learning (HSL) for mitigating oversmoothing and oversquashing in graph neural networks.

The paper uses \"conductance\" and \"local homophily ratio\" as inputs to the lightweight network $g_\\theta$ for learning Laplacian mixing weights $\\alpha_C$, but fails to specify their exact computational definitions: - Conductance is not tied to a standard metric (e.g., the ratio of cut edges to total edges in a cluster). - \"Local homophily\" is not clarified (e.g., whether it uses label-based $H_{lab}$ or feature-based cosine similarity). Additionally, the architecture of $g_\\theta$ (e.g., number of layers, activation functions) is unmentioned, risking inconsistent reproducibility across different implementations. \n2. The mixing weights $\\alpha_C$ are claimed to balance topology and feature contributions, but no analysis is provided on their distribution across heterogeneous scenarios (e.g., high-heterophily Chameleon vs. high-homophily Cora). It remains unproven whether $\\alpha_C$ adaptively adjusts (e.g., reducing $\\alpha_C^{(2)}$ for feature-noisy graphs) to align with data characteristics. \n3. Theorem 2 requires $\\lambda \\geq \\Delta_{mix}/\\Psi_{min}$ (where $\\Delta_{mix}$ is the mixed-geometry gap and $\\Psi_{min}$ is the minimal incompatibility mass) to avoid spurious co-clustering. However, $\\Delta_{mix}$ and $\\Psi_{min}$ depend on **ground-truth clusters $S^*$**, which are unknown in real-world tasks (e.g., molecular graphs, social networks).

While HSL claims linear complexity, it only tests scalability on REDDIT-12K (average 233 nodes per graph). There is no comparison of training time/memory overhead with baselines (e.g., EigenPool $O(n^3)$, DiffPool $O(n^2)$) on **extra-large graphs** (e.g., Amazon Reviews with $10^5+$ nodes).
