Linkers for these platforms must be custom-engineered to each biological mechanism, demanding geometric precision and physicochemical profiles far beyond those of conventional small-molecule linkers. However, existing PROTAC, ADC and PDC datasets remain nonstandardized, lack high-quality conformations and rely on inconsistent evaluation protocols and metrics, hampering robust model development. To address these gaps, we introduce HBDrug3D, the first benchmark dataset for heterobifunctional drug linker design. Firstly, we aggregated and stringently filtered raw data from three sources. Secondly, we harmonized storage formats and usage conventions across both chemical and engineering domains to establish a unified data-representation space. We then generated low-energy conformations with the OPLS4 force field and filtered out redundant or invalid structures. Thirdly, we leveraged our programmatic evaluation pipeline to survey diverse metrics, define HBDrug3D-specific criteria and benchmark state-of-the-art models. Results and case studies demonstrate that, while current methods can produce valid heterobifunctional linkers, substantial gains remain in overall performance and cross-modality robustness. Finally, we release an open-source codebase covering data preprocessing, model training, sampling and evaluation to lower adoption barriers and spur further research.", "tldr": "We present HBDrug3D, the first curated 3D benchmark for heterobifunctional drug linkers, standardizing data, conformations, and evaluation to advance AI-driven PROTAC, ADC, and PDC design.", "keywords": ["Drug Discovery", "Heterobifunctional Molecule", "Linker Design", "Dataset"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/645340822d51d121d3e8ec2e9ae308ae40b0902b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces HBDrug3D, a benchmark dataset for AI-driven heterobifunctional molecule design, covering PROTACs, ADCs, and PDCs.

The \"Evaluation Metrics\" section is overly brief and lacks formal definitions. It is unclear, for example, whether validity is determined by RDKit sanitization and valence checks and how novelty and uniqueness handle canonicalization, stereochemistry, or tautomers.\n\n2. Although the paper presents four baselines (DeLinker, 3DLinker, DiffLinker, and LinkerNet), only DiffLinker and LinkerNet are successfully evaluated. DeLinker and 3DLinker are reported to have “failed to generate valid linkers”, yet no quantitative evidence or adaptation attempts are provided. The absence of a failure analysis makes it unclear whether the problem arises from dataset complexity, model capacity, or implementation details.\n\n3. While the authors emphasize a unified heterobifunctional framework, all experiments are conducted separately for the PROTAC, ADC, and PDC subsets. No multi-task or cross-modality training is explored. As a result, the “unified” aspect appears to apply only to data formatting rather than to modeling or analysis."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Although PROTACs, ADCs, and PDCs can all be categorized as heterobifunctional molecules, their linker design objectives differ substantially. For instance, PROTAC linkers must maintain a stable ternary complex geometry, whereas ADC linkers require controlled cleavage to release the payload. What is the biological or modeling justification for combining them into one unified dataset?\n\n2. How is the scaffold defined in the “scaffold-based strategy” (Line 320)? Which cheminformatics package and normalization procedure were used? Is the scaffold split applied to the entire heterobifunctional molecule or only to the linker portion? Given the large size of ADCs, is this strategy appropriate, and how is potential data leakage avoided when the same linker occurs with different fragments?\n\n3. Since the baseline models require 3D conformations as input, they must rely on pre-existing datasets or internal conformation-generation pipelines.

The raw molecular structures are sourced from established public databases.\n\n2. **Lack of Comparative Benchmarking:** The evaluation demonstrates that existing models struggle with the HBDrug3D dataset. However, all models were retrained exclusively on HBDrug3D. A more compelling experiment would be to compare the performance of models trained on HBDrug3D against the same models trained on more general small-molecule datasets like ZINC. This would more directly validate the necessity and benefit of a specialized dataset for designing heterobifunctional molecules.\n\n3. **Absence of Ternary Complex Structures:** The dataset is composed of isolated molecules (PROTACs, ADCs, PDCs). However, the function of these molecules, such as PROTACs, is critically dependent on the formation of a ternary complex (e.g., Target Protein-PROTAC-E3 Ligase). The conformation of the linker is heavily influenced by the protein-protein interface it is mediating. By providing only the molecule's structure in isolation, the dataset omits the most critical biological context for rational linker design. Notably, databases like PROTAC-DB, which was a source for this work, do contain an increasing number of experimentally determined and predicted ternary complex structures."}, "questions": {"value": "1. A quantitative analysis of the accuracy of the generated conformations would strengthen the paper. While the OPLS4 force field is a standard method, it would be beneficial to compare the generated low-energy conformations against any available experimentally determined structures (e.g., from the PDB) for a subset of the molecules to provide a measure of how well the computational method recapitulates reality.

The paper benchmarks existing generative models (DeLinker, 3DLinker, DiffLinker, and LinkerNet) trained from scratch on HBDrug3D.

The comparison between DiffLinker and LinkerNet in Table 6 and Figure 6 lacks statistical rigor. The authors draw performance conclusions solely from visual and descriptive trends without conducting any statistical tests or confidence analyses to verify whether the observed differences in SCRDKit similarity are significant.\n\n3. Table 6 is largely redundant because it reports the same SCRDKit similarity distributions already visualized in Figure 6. The figure conveys the performance gap between DiffLinker and LinkerNet more clearly, making the detailed numeric table unnecessary for the main text.\n\n4. The paper does not clearly emphasize which evaluation metrics best represent model performance. Core metrics such as validity, recovery, and 3D similarity (SCRDKit) should probably be prioritized, as they directly measure whether generated linkers are chemically correct, structurally faithful, and geometrically realistic for real-world drug discovery.
