However, most existing methods, including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a central server to coordinate model updates which creates a bottleneck and single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully decentralized clustered Federated Learning algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.", "tldr": "We propose DFCA, a fully decentralized federated clustering algorithm designed to operate effectively in low-connectivity networks with heterogeneous client data distributions.", "keywords": ["Federated Learning", "Decentralized Federated Learning", "Clustered Federated Learning", "Communication-Efficient Learning"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0370b738291182bc34548dcb1ccaba6a445fced4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4e4aa39cd1965eea97a5efba609525389200fe50.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors present a new clustering method for decentralized FL extending the core idea of IFCA in absence of a central server.

The DFL framework is interesting and I appreciate the effort of trying to extend IFCA to this scenario, however the similarities concerns me about the novelty of the proposed approach.\n\n2.

I am concerned that in large scale scenarios  where the number of clusters drastically increases the memory cost of storing all the models explodes. \n\n2a. The algorithm does not prevent from forming degenerate clusters, i.e. a cluster with a single client. In this case the model of the clusters coincides with the individual model of the client. Hence, this would imply that a client stores the individual information of another client, which is privacy concerning, with respect to standard FL privacy assumptions.\n\n3. Since the number of clusters is fixed a priori as input of the algorithm, similarly to IFCA, why they evaluate the algorithms with $k = 4$?
