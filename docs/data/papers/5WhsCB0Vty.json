It builds upon Quasimetric RL (QRL), which frames GCRL as learning a quasimetric (a shortest-path distance function) $d(s, g)$. The key insight of this paper is to reformulate QRL's discrete, trajectory-based local consistency constraint (i.e., $d(s, s') \\le \\text{cost}$) into a continuous-time Partial Differential Equation (PDE) constraint.\n\nBy assuming simplified unit-speed, isotropic dynamics ($f(s,a) = a$), this PDE constraint reduces to the Eikonal equation: $||\\nabla_s d_\\theta(s, g)|| = 1$.

This makes it an effective regularizer and highly suitable for offline RL.\n\nTo address the limitations of the isotropic dynamics assumption in complex environments, the authors propose Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL). This method uses the efficient, trajectory-free Eik-QRL as a high-level planner to propose subgoals in a simple abstract space (e.g., $(x, y)$ coordinates) where the Eikonal assumption holds.

A major practical strength of Eik-QRL is that it is trajectory-free, only requiring i.i.d. state and goal samples. This makes it more data-efficient and better suited for offline learning from unstructured datasets than the original QRL, which requires transition tuples.\n3.  The paper clearly identifies the main weakness of its own Eik-QRL formulation (the strong isotropic dynamics assumption) and proposes a very logical and effective solution: use Eik-QRL as a high-level planner in a simple abstract space where the assumption *does* hold, and use a standard model-free controller for the complex low-level dynamics."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  The paper's strongest results are in navigation tasks (pointmaze, antmaze, humanoidmaze). In the antsoccer and manipulation tasks (Table 2), the performance gains vanish, and Eik-HiQRL is only \"comparable\" to baselines. The paper acknowledges this but it suggests the method's applicability is currently best suited for tasks where a simple Cartesian abstract space is available.\n2.  The success of Eik-HiQRL appears to be highly dependent on the choice of the high-level abstract space $\\overline{\\mathcal{S}}$, which must be one where the Eikonal (unit-speed) assumption holds. For navigation, this is intuitively the agent's $(x, y)$ coordinates. For manipulation, the paper states this is a \"latent space learned end-to-end\", but details on *how* this space is learned and *how* it is constrained to satisfy the Eikonal properties are not in the main paper. This choice seems critical and non-trivial for applying the method to new domains.\n3.  The paper derives HJB-QRL (Eq. 7) as a general PDE constraint, but quickly simplifies it to Eik-QRL by assuming $f(s,a)=a$. The justification is that HJB-QRL is \"ill-conditioned\" and still relies on transitions. This simplification is what limits the method to isotropic dynamics. An alternative, underexplored direction would be to keep the HJB-QRL formulation and use a learned local dynamics model."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  The performance gains are most pronounced in navigation tasks. In manipulation and antsoccer, where the abstract space $\\overline{\\mathcal{S}}$ is a \"latent space learned end-to-end\" (for manipulation), the method is only on par with baselines. Could you elaborate on how this latent space is learned? How do you ensure this learned space adheres to the 1-Lipschitz / unit-speed properties required for the Eik-QRL high-level planner to be effective?\n2.  Following on from Q1: How sensitive is Eik-HiQRL to the quality of this abstract space? If the abstract space does not accurately reflect the geometry of the underlying state space (e.g., it thinks two states are close when they are separated by a wall), does the Eikonal constraint still provide a useful learning signal?\n3.  The jump from HJB-QRL (Eq. 7) to Eik-QRL (Eq. 8) is a key step, motivated by numerical stability and removing the reliance on transition tuples. Did the authors experiment with a middle ground? For example, using the HJB-QRL formulation but with a *learned* local dynamics model to estimate $f(s, a)$ (or $s' - s$), rather than simplifying the dynamics to $f(s,a)=a$?\n4.  In Appendix C.2, the paper discusses two optimization methods: the constrained Lagrangian (Eq. 21) and the soft penalty (Eq. 22), ultimately choosing the soft penalty for stability. Does using a soft penalty risk the Eikonal constraint not being fully enforced (i.e., $||\\nabla_s d_\\theta|| \\neq 1$)?
