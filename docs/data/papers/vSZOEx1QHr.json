Recently, OOD detectors trained on synthetic outliers, especially those generated by large diffusion models, have shown promising results in defining robust OOD decision boundaries. Building on this progress, we present Non-Linear Class-wise Invariant Sampling (NCIS), which enhances the quality of synthetic outliers by operating directly in the diffusion model's embedding space, rather than combining disjoint models as in previous work, and by modeling class-conditional manifolds with a conditional volume-preserving network, allowing for a more expressive characterization of the training distribution. We demonstrate that these improvements yield new state-of-the-art OOD detection results on standard ImageNet100 and CIFAR100 benchmarks and provide insights into the importance of data pre-processing and other key design choices. We will make our code available upon acceptance.", "tldr": "We present NCIS, which can generate informative outliers for out-of-distribution detection by modeling class-conditional manifolds in diffusion embedding space.", "keywords": ["Out-of-Distribution Detection", "Outlier Synthesis", "Diffusion Models"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0d40d87b47d05d7b3f9265ee5f7fcf21e05e90eb.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/86cc5b2bfd2a3823e01e33deb94e0718f87e1362.pdf"}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
