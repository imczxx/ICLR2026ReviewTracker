Such evaluations assess each policy independently, overlook correlations and interactions, and fail to explain why strategies ultimately persist or vanish in evolving markets. We shift to an ecological perspective, where trading strategies are modeled as adaptive agents that interact and learn within a shared market.\nInstead of proposing a new strategy, we present \\textbf{FinEvo}, an ecological game formalism for studying the evolutionary dynamics of multi-agent financial strategies.\nAt the individual level, heterogeneous ML-based traders—rule-based, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language model (LLM) agents—adapt using signals such as historical prices and external news. At the population level, strategy distributions evolve through three designed mechanisms—selection, innovation, and environmental perturbation—capturing the dynamic forces of real markets. Together, these two layers of adaptation link evolutionary game theory with modern learning dynamics, providing a principled environment for studying strategic behavior.\nExperiments with external shocks and real-world news streams show that FinEvo is both stable for reproducibility and expressive in revealing context-dependent outcomes. Strategies may dominate, collapse, or form coalitions depending on their competitors—patterns invisible to static backtests.\nBy reframing strategy evaluation as an ecological game formalism, FinEvo provides a unified, mechanism-level protocol for analyzing robustness, adaptation, and emergent dynamics in multi-agent financial markets, and may offer a means to explore the potential impact of macroeconomic policies and financial regulations on price evolution and equilibrium.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multi-Agent Financial Strategies;Ecological Market Games;Evolutionary Dynamics;LLM Agents"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/412538cd7df7d09cfa6299c853ae5032686af93b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, the authors introduce FinEvo, an ecological game framework for evaluating financial trading strategies in dynamic, multi-agent markets.

Wilmott, Volume 2017, Issue 89, May 2017\nYour agents are conditioned on previous prices alone – presumably just some mid-price. Real trading agents look at order books in depth, and include multiple price levels and – importantly – volume of trades.\n\nThe SDE for the value process is a standard drift diffusion SDE, the same as price evolution. I see no reason for this choice. Likewise the SDE for selection, innovation and perturbation is chosen rather than derived. Why this choice?\n\nHow are all the hyperparameters in the models set? \n\nThe comparisons with ABIDES and PyMarketSim use \"ecological\" metrics (entropy, HHI) but not financial performance measures (returns, volatility, or PnL distributions etc). Hence the claim of FinEvo’s superiority is qualitative rather than quantitative.\n\nyour “phase change” measure is interesting but undefined in economic terms. is it volatility clustering, or strategy regime switching or what?\n\nYou present results for just 1 day of real data. This should be extended to show the approach works in general. Does it also work across markets/assets?\n\nWhile the paper includes “real-world news” experiments, the price series and market dynamics are synthetic. The mapping from news sentiment to returns lacks empirical grounding - is there a deeper economic understanding? The conclusions about LLM agents’ dominance could therefore be effects of simulation assumptions.\n\nYou mention scientific investigation of markets, not building trading algorithms. What other investigation of market dynamics is there if not to build trading models?\n\nThe financial realism remains limited: The market clearing and execution mechanisms are simplified. No empirical calibration or validation against actual historical price series beyond qualitative correspondence. Economic feedbacks such as liquidity constraints, transaction costs, or regulatory requirements are minimal. As a result, FinEvo is a conceptual testbed but not yet a predictive or policy-relevant model.

Significance of the Contribution: This paper offers a significant improvement over traditional, isolated strategy backtesting by proposing a comprehensive evolutionary framework. This framework is designed to study strategy interaction and evolution across diverse market environments.\n\n2. Rigorous Theoretical Framework: The paper introduces a set of strategy evolution equations built upon a rigorous mathematical foundation. These equations decompose market dynamics into three interpretable components—selection, innovation, and perturbation—thereby enhancing the model's interpretability.\n\n3. Comprehensive Experimental Design:\n - a. Heterogeneity: The study incorporates four distinct agent types (rule-based, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and LLM), \nreflecting the realistic composition of modern markets.\n- b. Multiple Scenarios: The model is tested across a variety of conditions, including artificial shocks, real-world news events, and different market cycles (bull/bear), which provides comprehensive evidence of its robustness.\n- c. Ablation Study: An ablation study targeting the three core mechanisms (selection, innovation, and perturbation) compellingly demonstrates that all three are indispensable for maintaining a realistic and adaptive ecosystem"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited Scope of the Evolutionary Framework: While the framework is presented with rigorous definitions, its evolutionary mechanism is predominantly payoff-driven. This approach overlooks micro-level strategy propagation dynamics (such as diffusion through adjacent nodes). Furthermore, the study confines its analysis to competition among a fixed set of predefined strategies, rather than employing methods like genetic algorithms to evolve new, and potentially superior, hybrid strategies.\n\n2. Opaque Initial Parameter Design: The paper lacks a detailed justification for the initial parameter settings of the agents (e.g., learning rates, information window lengths). This omission is critical because, given a high sensitivity to initial conditions, the agents' subsequent performance could be significantly impacted by these choices. This influence may introduce experimental artifacts rather than reflecting the intrinsic dynamics the study aims to capture.\n\n3. Potential Data Contamination for the LLM: The LLM's training window potentially overlaps with the experimental time period. The study's market data includes the bear market phase from January to October 2022. The training corpus of GPT-4o-mini likely contains data from this period, which could provide it with prior information unavailable to the other agents.
