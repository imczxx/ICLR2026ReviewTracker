We tackle this critical issue from a dynamic system perspective, in which the inherent sequential nature is transformed into a parallel sampling process. \nSpecifically, we first reveal that the sequential integral solver of the diffusion model can be approximated by a full linear solver, enabling efficient computation for parallel integral solvers of DPMs. Based on such a linear formulation, we then introduce a unified framework that reformulates the original nonlinear sequential integral process of diffusion model as a system of partial linear equations. Moreover, we further develop an immediate update strategy and an adaptive stopping criterion to solve the system. In addition, we prove that (1) the system admits a unique root corresponding precisely to the trajectory of the sequential integral solver; (2) solving the system guarantees convergence to the trajectory of sequential integral solvers in equal or fewer iterations. \nBuilding on these insights, we present \\textit{ParaSolver-Turbo}, a partial linear parallel integral solver to accelerate a broad class of sequential and parallel sampling methods such as DDPM and ParaSolver.\nExtensive experiments validate that ParaSolver-Turbo achieves up to \\textbf{71.4$\\times$ speedup} in terms of wall-clock time without measurable quality degradation.

Combining parallel sampling and diffusion solver is a relatively new idea.\n2. Introducing a linear system to reduce computational cost sounds a reasonable method."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. My major concern lies in the experimental results and settings.\n    - As shown in the main table, compared with traditional solvers, the iteration compression ratio of ParaSolver-Turbo is generally smaller than its speedup ratio (e.g., for DDIM with 25 steps, the iteration compression ratio is 25/11=2.27<3.1). However, in my understanding, since parallel computation increases the computation amount per iteration, the speedup should not exceed the iteration compression ratio. Could the authors provide explanation to this?\n    - From my experience, image generation is typically a computation-intensive task, where the actual computation cost dominates the inference time rather than the number of model calls, especially for large models like Stable Diffusion. Therefore, the actual speedup ratio should correlate more with NFE than with iterations. Achieving a speedup through parallel sampling seems strange to me. \\textbf{I suggest reporting the batch size per GPU and GPU utilization, and adding comparison results with fewer-step solvers in Table 2.} \n        - Moreover, for video generation tasks, diffusion models contribute an even larger portion of the computation cost, so this approach appears to have limited scalability for such larger tasks.\n    - Some of the baselines compared in this paper are somewhat outdated. Current traditional sequential solvers have long achieved 5–10 step sampling [1–4], and the authors should discuss or compare the proposed method with these methods. Some of the claims about speedup are still made against the earliest 1000-step DDPM, which seems overclaimed.\n\n2. I suggest the authors add a more detailed discussion on ParaSolver-Turbo in relation to previous parallel sampling methods, such as ParaSolver, ParaDiGMS, and ParaTAA.
