Continuous symmetry detection and enforcement for machine learning are two related topics that have recently been explored using the Lie derivative along vectors fields, which vector field approach has led to improved outcomes. However, though image data is replete with continuous symmetries under which image classifiers are meant to be invariant, the application of the Lie derivative for the detection and enforcement of continuous symmetries for image data remains under-explored. In this work, we derive vector field infinitesimal generators for various continuous symmetries for image data. We then use these generators to enforce continuous symmetry in image classifiers. We also demonstrate vector field symmetry detection in image data, obtaining close similarity with the ground truth symmetry.", "tldr": "In this paper, we enforce continuous symmetry in image classification, and we discover continuous symmetry from training image data.", "keywords": ["Image Processing", "Image Classification", "Symmetry", "Infinitesimal Generators", "Invariance", "Group Actions", "Symmetry Discovery", "Symmetry Enforcement"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c0969e197974f6726532543dc5713679f8b8b956.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper discusses several potential issues in discovering and enforcing continuous symmetries for image data, including algebraic nonclosure and other violations of algebraic constraints from the discovered infinitesimal generators, the exponential growth of the number of transformations required for data augmentation with respect to non-Abelian symmetry groups, etc. The experiments evaluate some relevant methods, such as regularization and data augmentation for the power law symmetry in MNIST, and a preliminary result of symmetry discovery by inspecting the gradient of a trained predictor and finding its orthogonal vector field."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper reviews and discusses some important related works in symmetry discovery and enforcement, particularly for image data.

The contributions, if any, are very unclear. To see this, the related work section spans up to four pages, and even in the methodology section, Sec 3.1 and 3.2 are still restatements from existing work. The **contribution** paragraph at the end of Sec 1 states that the paper \"provides a mathematical framework for the extension of continuous symmetry discovery and enforcement for image data\", but no such framework is clearly presented in the current paper. Also, the paper is titled \"... for image data\", but most of the contents do not specify what is special about the symmetry in image data. Also, there is no explanation why existing methods would not work on image data. In fact, a lot of related work, whether mentioned in this paper or not, already showed results of symmetry discovery on image datasets as parts of their experiments.\n\nFrom the narrative of the paper, Sec 3.3 and 3.4 is supposed to introduce some new methods for symmetry enforcement and discovery. However, I regret not finding any valuable new insights. For multi-parameter symmetry groups, stacking the tensors from multiple generators is a standard and straightforward technique which is already used in past works [1, 2]. For data augmentation w.r.t non-Abelian groups, I agree that augmenting with parameters on a fixed grid can result in at most combinatorial and exponential sample complexity. However, a simple yet effective alternative approach would be to randomly sample the group parameters. Finally, Sec 3.4 is titled \"symmetry discovery\", but the content of the subsection focuses elsewhere and has not clearly described any method for symmetry discovery.\n\nApart from the previously mentioned ones, there are other important missing references in this paper. For symmetry discovery, LieGG [3] trains a predictor and solves the symmetry of the predictor algebraically; LaLiGAN [4] parameterizes vector field symmetry by a composition of an autoencoder and a linear action. These are closely related to the subject of this paper and should be discussed and possibly compared against in the experiments.\n\n### References\n\n[1] Symmetry-Informed Governing Equation Discovery.
