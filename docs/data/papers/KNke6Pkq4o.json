In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228k, a large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen models. The dataset includes both text–motion pairs and text–video–motion triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.", "tldr": "This work introduces a unified framework of spanning data (ViMoGen-228k), modeling (ViMoGen and ViMoGen-light), and evaluation (MBench), to advance generalizable 3D human motion generation by transferring knowledge from other generative fields.", "keywords": ["Motion Generation", "Generalizable"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/636c353829b565773ec978a18bf783d2a1385e8d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a comprehensive framework of data, models, and evaluation to address the generalization capability of 3D human motion generation (MoGen).

ViMoGen-228K leverages a mixture of three data sources: high-fidelity MoCap, alongside in-the-wild and synthetic videos. The filtering process for the in-the-wild data yields an extremely low retention rate (a reduction from 60M to 40k clips). This raises the question of whether in-the-wild video data, in itself, is inherently unsuitable for human motion extraction. Compounding this, based on Table 5, the \"Visual Mocap Data\" component does not appear to yield significant improvements. \n\n2. Regarding the generalization capabilities discussed (relative to ViGen), the 228k (370h) dataset used for MoGen is still considerably smaller than ViGen's pre-training corpus. How do the authors think MoGen's generalization capabilities compared with ViGen's generalization?\n\n3. The primary quantitative results (Table 2) are reported on MBench, a benchmark concurrently introduced by the authors. While MBench appears to be well-designed, this presents a potential risk: namely, that the new data and the proposed model may have \"overfit\" to the specific evaluation criteria of this new benchmark."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Regarding the data filtering pipeline, neither the main paper nor Appendix D.2 provides a detailed procedure. Key details are missing, such as the specific quality assessment filters employed and the retention ratios (or absolute clip counts) at each filtering stage. This lack of transparency makes the drastic data reduction (from 10M to 40k clips) , raises concerns.\n\n2. In Appendix D.2.3 (Synthetic Data), the authors state they \"compiled a list of action verbs and descriptive nouns.\"\nIt is recommended that the authors provide this complete list in the appendix and, crucially, conduct a comparative analysis against the vocabulary used in MBench (to ensure the generation vocabulary does not overly align with the benchmark).\nAdditionally, clarification is required on how potentially ambiguous verbs (e.g., \"have\") were programmatically handled or disambiguated during text prompt generation.\n\n3. ViMoGen-light: Table 2 reveals a substancial performance gap between ViMoGen-light and the full ViMoGen. The primary source of this discrepancy is not clearly analyzed.\nFurthermore, the distillation (referred to as \"distill\") used to create ViMoGen-light is critically underspecified.

Take Fig.4 for example, for several samples, the SMPL frame shots are highly overlapped and the resolution are too low for the readers to compare the visual qualities, e.g. doing jumping jacks, martial arts, climbing a ladder. Similar issues can be observed in the qualitative results figures throughout the paper. Also, the axe or reference for temporal direction should be mentioned alongside.\n\n1. No demo videos are provided. Given the limitations of static frame shot figures, it’s crucial to provide convincing video demos of the generated samples and dataset samples to justify the qualitative comparison. However, the authors haven’t provided any video demos in supplementary materials. \n\n1.  In the proposed gating diffusion block, the T2Mbranch seems to be totally parallel with the M2Mbranch, performing totally different tasks with only one shared self-attention layer.  And the adaptive branch selection at inference relies heavily on alignment scores from external VLM to determine which branch to go with. It’s then questionable whether the two branch can really benefit from each other in learning the underlying distribution, or the performance is mainly gained from the external VLM assessment and selection for the task to proceed with.\n\n1. The training pipeline is not clear. The curriculum approach mentioned in line 204 - 207 is worth elaborated:\n    - “we simulate video motion references by perturbing ground-truth motions with controlled noise.” — What is the controlled noise mentioned here? And it’s very confusing to me how perturbing the ground-truth motions can simulate the video motion references. \n    - For training with text-motion pairs of high quality MoCap data,  would there still be a z_video for M2Mbranch? If so, how to ensure the alignment of the z_video and ground-truth high quality motion? The video generated from the same text may contain totally different motion from the ground-truth motion.\n\n1. The details of inference phase is not clear either:\n    - How to assess if the alignment scores from VLM is high or low? Through a scalar threshold?\n    - What are the differences and advantages of using the M2Mbranch, other than extracting the MoCap motion directly from the generated videos and performing motion refinement with a SOTA refinement method? Any empirical results on this?\n\n1. The benchmark metrics haven’t been fully evaluated whether it aligns with human perception or not. Although Appendix C.1.2 presents the alignment results for the temporal motion quality, the human preference study for the abstractive metrics (motion generalizability and motion-condition consistency) based on VLM are not provided.\n\n1. The frame-wise quality seems to replace the old distribution-based metrics (e.g. FID) with another “new” distribution-based metrics, except that the definition for the underlying distribution is different. Why would it be better to set up this way? Moreover, any empirical results of why this whole set of motion quality metrics is more reliable and robust than before? \n\n1. The baselines and ablations in Table 3 are not very convincing. Practically, the M2Mbranch is playing the role of a motion refinement module in this context, so the compared baseline should additionally includes text-to-video +  a SOTA motion refinement, to clearly evaluate the power of M2Mbranch. \n\n1. To fairly ablate the impact of external VLM assessment during inference, there should also be a specific ablation for not using the gated diffusion block, and instead only use the external VLM alignment scores to select from a SOTA T2M model and a SOTA text-to-video + motion refinement model, and other two ablations with replacing the one of two models with T2M or M2M respectively. \n\n1.
