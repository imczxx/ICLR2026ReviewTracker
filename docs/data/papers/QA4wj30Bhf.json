Recent studies present significant results regarding its usage in document annotation tasks; in some cases, the model is comparable to human annotators. In our work, we evaluate LLM's in-context few-shot learning capability on a legal NER, assessing its usage in an annotation task process with humans. To do so, our study is based on the most extensive corpus known in Portuguese dedicated to the legal NER. In our experiments, we tried six different LLMs in various setups, and the results showed that an LLM can produce highly accurate annotations; the best model achieved an F1 score of 0.76. Moreover, through a detailed manual inspection of the divergence cases, we identified opportunities for improvement in the annotation process that produced the corpus, with a significant portion of these issues being correctly addressed by the evaluated models. Thus, our results show that the models can assist annotators, reducing the time, effort, and errors produced during the annotation process.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Model", "Named Entity Recognition", "Legal", "Few-shot Learning", "Data Annotation"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e67ccd50db68b6fe80761a18fcd67742dcf9190a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper evaluates the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for in-context few-shot learning on legal Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, specifically focusing on Portuguese legal documents.

The stated motivation is to build a pipeline that could assist human annotators in labeling legal texts. The pipeline handles long-document segmentation and compares six off-the-shelf LLMs (both open and closed-source) under zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning. Results show that LLMs achieve competitive F1 scores even with random few-shot sampling, and that retrieval-based selection (RAG-style) offers no measurable benefit.\n\nOverall Recommendation: Reject\nWhile the paper is clearly written and applicable for this niche usecase at a surface level, it lacks originality, depth, and analytical rigor for ICLR. Its findings that LLMs perform reasonably on few-shot NER and that random sampling rivals similarity-based retrieval, are well-established in prior work. The human-in-the-loop (HiTL) framing is also not substantiated through workflow design, user studies, or quantitative cost analysis. The result is an incremental replication of known patterns in a narrow domain.\n\nReviewer LLM Usage:\nI have read the paper in full and written the review myself. Large Language Models (LLMs) were used only for writing polish, clarity improvements, and to refresh memory of (public) related work or references.

Interesting premise: The hypothesis that models trained on judicial corpora may encode “judicial reasoning” offers a speculative direction for future exploration."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Lack of novelty and analytical depth:\nThe paper confirms previously known findings: LLMs perform adequately for few-shot NER, and retrieval-based example selection rarely outperforms random sampling. No new prompting paradigm, retrieval method, or model adaptation technique is proposed.\n\n2. Partial and shallow error analysis\nAlthough the authors provide per-entity metrics, special-marker error counts, and a manual review of 193 misclassifications by five annotators, they stop short of deeper analyses such as confusion matrices, span-offset distributions, or nested-entity handling.\n\n3. Unsupported HiTL framing\nThe work’s central claim, assisting human annotators, is not explored at all. There is no workflow description (pre-seeding, confidence based triaging to humans, uncertainty sampling, etc.), no usability study, and no productivity or cost metrics. The only cost discussion concerns API token pricing, not annotation effort. Thus, the HiTL style assisted annotations claim remains unsubstantiated.\n\n4. Missing supervised baselines and limited data\nNo fine-tuned NER baselines (e.g., BERTimbau [Souza et al., 2020], XLM-R) are compared. BERTimbau is used only as an embedding encoder for retrieval. Moreover, evaluation covers just 5 validation documents  and 53 test documents, which is insufficient for stable generalization.\n\n5. Narrow scope and simplified labeling\nBy restricting the task to four coarse entity types, the study avoids typical hierarchical NER challenges like nested entities, sub-type confusion, and overlapping spans. Consequently, the reported performance overestimates true real-world difficulty for their task which also has a second layer (which is considered out of scope).\n\n6. Missing literature and context\nThe paper omits key prior work that already demonstrates effective few-shot and prompt-based NER: TANL [Paolini et al. 2021], PromptNER [Jie & Lu, 2022], InstructUIE [Wang et al., 2023] and cross-lingual benchmarks like XGLUE [Liang et al., 2020] and LEXTREME [Niklaus et al., 2023]. This omission overstates the novelty of the contribution.\n\n7. Retrieval finding lacks explanation\nStatistical tests (ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis) confirm no significant difference between random, similarity, and cluster-based selection, yet the authors provide no analysis of retrieved-example quality or similarity distribution to qualitatively explain intuitively why this occurs.\n\n8. Terminology\nThe phrase “mixing the LLM as independent agents by entity” simply denotes per-entity model ensembling not genuine multi-agent reasoning or tool use. So rigor in terminology is diluted."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Replace references to “multiple agents” with “multiple LLM runs” or “ensemble of LLMs.”\n2.
