This quantity is generally unidentified without additional assumptions. To link the observed and unobserved potential outcomes, we work with a cross-world correlation function $\\rho(x) = \\operatorname{cor}(Y(1), Y(0) \\mid X = x)$ that quantifies their dependence given the covariates. Plausible bounds on $\\rho(x)$, often informed by domain knowledge, enable a principled approach to this otherwise unidentified problem.

However, as Barber et al. (2020)---which the authors themselves cite---establishes, conditional coverage is generally impossible in finite samples without very strong assumptions. Moreover: (i) the experiments rely on CQR, which only delivers marginal coverage; (ii) their own theoretical analysis shows that their interval inherits conditional validity if the baseline has it --- but CQR does not have it. So why lead with a conditional guarantee that cannot be satisfied in practice? The paper should be reframed entirely around marginal coverage guarantees, which are actually achievable (or suitable modifications of conditional coverage in the spirit of Gibbs et al. 2023). The current presentation misleads readers about what the method delivers.\n\nb) Theorem 1 claims the $C_\\rho$ intervals are \"optimal\" (smallest valid sets) and $\\hat{\\mu}_\\rho$ minimizes MSE. However, this holds only under a ``perfect asymptotic scenario'' requiring: (i) Gaussianity; (ii) Oracle nuisances; (iii) conditionally valid baselines. It is not clear when this result would be relevant. (i) is unrealistic; (ii) does not apply in finite samples where estimation errors matter; and (iii) cannot generally be satisfied. More broadly, the paper does not provide an actual finite sample coverage theorem, which is the standard for conformal inference papers. \n\nc) The paper claims early on that \"Given $\\rho$, we develop a consistent estimator and valid prediction intervals.\" As written, this suggests that specifying only the correlation (plus the marginals) is sufficient to identify $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1) \\mid X=x, Y(0)=y]$. This is not true in general since specifying only $\\rho(x)$ does not pin down the full joint distribution of $(Y(0), Y(1)) \\mid X=x$. Without additional assumptions (e.g., Gaussianity), the conditional mean $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1) \\mid X=x, Y(0)=y]$ is at best partially identified ---multiple joint distributions can share the same marginals and correlation but differ in their conditional expectations. But the paper is written as if this is more general. Furthermore, I don't see how the authors address the validity of the intervals if this quantity is partially identified.  \n\nd) The correlation $\\rho(x)$ is also unidentifiable. But the paper provides very little guidance on how it could be reasonably chosen in practice. This is always the central challenge in sensitivity analysis frameworks -- is there a strategy for which this can be empirically calibrated? How might we elicit this information from practitioners?

The contribution hinges on the correlation between potential outcomes, which cannot be learned from observed data. Without a credible way to estimate or even bound the dependence between the two potential outcomes, the method just reduces to a sensitivity analysis rather than a learnable model.
