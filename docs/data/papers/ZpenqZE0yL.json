As the foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance; generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third, the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\\% when given additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the benchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the datasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.", "tldr": "We extend GeoBench benchmark to evaluate cross-band generalization of remote sensing foundation model", "keywords": ["Remote Sensing", "Vision Transformer", "Generalization", "Benchmark"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bf0dd739f788b6763b56fdcf6699513382e1613d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces GeoCrossBench, an extension to the GeoBench benchmark designed for evaluating the cross-satellite generalization of remote sensing models.

Through extensive experiments, the authors find that even strong foundation models (DOFA, TerraFM) fail to outperform general-purpose models (e.g., DINOv3) in-distribution; that performance drops substantially (2-4x) when generalizing to unseen satellites; and that ChiViT yields the best results in the no-overlap setting.

An interesting part of the paper is this paragraph : \"One of the reasons for the relatively strong performance of ChiViT compared to other multispectral models might be the trick of sampling of the bands during pretraining. The models might learn to rely less on band-specific features and instead focus on patterns shared across bands, which then improves cross-band generalization performance. Sampling of channels during fine-tuning might also be beneficial.\" Sadly, this is not tested. Could the authors add a vizualization, or experiments, that could strengthen these claims? I think this would add greatly to the paper.\n\n**Minor comments**\n1. The goal of the paper is to demonstrate that the proposed architecture / training strategy shows better transfer ability than existing approaches. In this context, I believe that Table 2 is unclear. All metrics are very similar, the coloring seems to be global (e.g. column 1 is compared to column 5, is it meaningful?) where I would assume that the performance is only evaluated for one setup (i.e. within a column, and not between columns). There, the most important columns are those in \"No-overlap\", and indeed, the authors report a better metric than concurrent methods. At the moment, this column is barely stressed, due to the color scheme pointing more towards the in-distribution + superset approaches..."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "85cxCArnNp", "forum": "ZpenqZE0yL", "replyto": "ZpenqZE0yL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21033/Reviewer_hRxA"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21033/Reviewer_hRxA"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21033/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761993558007, "cdate": 1761993558007, "tmdate": 1762940613884, "mdate": 1762940613884, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "GeoCrossBench introduces a benchmarking paradigm (Fig. 1) that evaluates geospatial foundation models (GFMs) on their capacity to fine-tune on classification, semantic segmentation, and change detection downstream tasks such that at those GFMs are tolerant to an input of different spectral bands.

For example biomass (cf. `x-cashew-pantation` and `x-SA-crop-type`) is sensitive to the (normalized) difference of the red and the near-infrared channels. Randomly replacing RGB-channel-fine-tuned inputs with random channels in the invisible range, including wavelength as far off as C-band radar is a bold step that requires careful ablation studies to understand the model's behavior, cf. some questions related below. However, I agree that domain-specific GFMs should meet the expectations to outperform general vision models not tuned towards Earth observation such as DINOv3.\n\nGiven the two arguments above, I hesitate to recommend this work for publication at ICLR at its current state: a significant part of the presented work has been published elsewhere, and the benchmark design protocol raises questions about the physical interpretation.
