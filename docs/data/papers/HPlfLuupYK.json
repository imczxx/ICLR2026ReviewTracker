While auto-regressive models build molecules sequentially, they're limited by a short horizon and a discrepancy between training and inference. Conversely, synchronous diffusion models denoise all atoms at once, offering a molecule-level horizon but failing to capture the causal relationships inherent in hierarchical molecular structures. We introduce Equivariant Asynchronous Diffusion (EAD) to overcome these limitations. EAD is a novel diffusion model that combines the strengths of both approaches: it uses an asynchronous denoising schedule to better capture molecular hierarchy while maintaining a molecule-level horizon. Since these relationships are often complex, we propose a dynamic scheduling mechanism to adaptively determine the denoising timestep. Experimental results show that EAD achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D molecular generation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Molecular generation", "Diffusion models", "Autoregressive models"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/78c95a835348395f38cd3fb0f567a6f0587b3dbc.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Synchronous diffusion models struggle to capture the inherent causal relationships within the molecular hierarchical structure.

Failure to address the core challenge of asynchronous training: The paper acknowledges that fully asynchronous diffusion models suffer from combinatorial explosion. To mitigate this, the authors restrict training to a \"narrow asynchronous interval\"—implying the maximum timestep difference between different dimensions is limited to 2C. This creates a trade-off: A large C exacerbates training difficulty. A small C makes the method barely distinguishable from fully synchronous training, diminishing the value of the \"asynchronous\" design.\n\n2. Lack of experimental justification for the need for synchronization: The sampling strategy is intuitive: it retains high noise for less-converged molecular dimensions to align denoising progress across all dimensions. However, from a research logic standpoint, the authors should add an experiment to quantify the misalignment of denoising progress across dimensions in the original synchronous generative model. This would directly justify the necessity of the proposed synchronization mechanism."}, "questions": {"value": "1. What value of C was used in the experiments? Could you provide an ablation study to demonstrate how varying C impacts model performance (e.g., generation quality, training efficiency) ? \n\n2. Why is the sampling time longer than that of EDM? Could you specify the actual diffusion schedule used (e.g., SNR decay rate, timestep count)? Additionally, please provide case studies to verify if the method can to some extent \"establish a hierarchical structure within molecules (e.g., preferential emergence of molecular scaffolds)\"—as claimed in the introduction for AR methods.\n\nSome further discussions:\n\n3. Given the combinatorial explosion issue mentioned in Weakness 1, could it be possible to propose priors to constrain the timestep combinations across dimensions and reduce complexity? For example: Leveraging chemical domain knowledge (e.g., training heavy atoms first, then hydrogen atoms) to prioritize dimension-wise timestep order. Making the timestep intervals between dimensions learnable (rather than fixed by C) to adapt to data characteristics?\n\n4. While EDM is a classic baseline, its performance is relatively low compared to recent advances. Several studies have improved EDM and achieved better results (e.g., GeoBFN, UniGEM(BFN), Straight-line diffusion model(SLDM)).

Asynchronous diffusion scheduling has been explored in other domains (e.g., text, video), and this work is a direct application of that concept to molecules.\n* The motivation of interpolating between auto-regressive (AR) and standard diffusion to capture molecular hierarchy seems to be an overclaim. The training window $C$ is very small ($C \\approx 9$ for QM9) compared to the total timesteps ($T=1000$). It is unclear how such a narrow, local-in-time window can act as a meaningful \"interpolation\" between AR and diffusion, or capture global hierarchical properties like scaffolds vs. functional groups.\n* The method is extremely sensitive to its key hyperparameters. Table 5 shows that straying slightly from the ($\\lambda=0.8, w=2$) configuration causes performance to collapse (e.g., $\\lambda=0.6$ drops stability from 90.3% to 64.7%; $w=5$ drops it to 80.4%).

Key metrics like uniqueness, novelty, and computational cost (runtime/NFEs) are missing.\n    * The \"accelerated\" claim in the title is unsubstantiated. The paper shows similar runtime on QM9. (0.20 sec/sample for EDM 0.21 sec/sample for EAD which shows it's even slower than the baseline) and provides no runtime analysis for GEOM-Drug.\n    * The performance gain over other SOTA methods (e.g., UniGEM) is marginal (Table 1).

Does this not suggest the method is a brittle heuristic rather than a robust adaptive principle? How can users be expected to tune this for new datasets?\n* Why was the $L_2$ velocity (Eq. 12) chosen as the criterion for \"stalling\" an atom? Were any chemically-motivated metrics (e.g., based on valence, interatomic forces, or energy) considered?\n* For the GEOM-Drug results, could the authors please provide the missing metrics: uniqueness, novelty, and runtime (sec/sample)? Without these, it is difficult to assess the method's utility on larger molecules.\n* The motivation is to capture hierarchy.
