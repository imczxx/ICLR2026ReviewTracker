Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal. Leveraging the high-quality data from FigureBench, we conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of AutoFigure against various baseline methods.

Figure 1 mentions InstructGPT but doesn't mention how that relates to this work in any way. Still, it makes it seem like AutoFigure consists of a single instruction-tuned model which they train themselves (even though the instruction-tuning examples inside the figure are unrelated to the task at hand). But nowhere in the paper is a training process described. Instead, Sections 4.1 and 4.2 make it seem more likely that AutoFigure consists of a model pipeline of prompted VLMs and text-to-image models.

However, the original InstructGPT paper does not mention any examples related to relativity, suggesting that AutoFigure may have extended the content beyond the source text. Moreover, there is an error in the generated example (“ravity” instead of “gravity”), indicating that in some cases, the framework may pay more attention to aesthetic appeal than scientific accuracy.\n\n- As mentioned in the paper, scientific illustrations are meant to help readers grasp the main ideas quickly and avoid misinterpretation. However, in Figure 4, the diagrams appear confusing — the corresponding subfigures are not well aligned (e.g., Step 2 in the Offline Phase), and the textual elements are cluttered and disorganized. In fact, an effective scientific illustration should focus on clarity and accuracy of information, rather than emphasizing visual decoration such as color or stylistic patterns.\n\n- The paper mentions a process of fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) using human-selected text–figure pairs. However, the details of this process remain unclear — specifically, like which LLM was used and what the input–output format of the fine-tuning procedure was. Moreover, given that the dataset contains only 300 samples, it raises concerns about whether such fine-tuning could improve the quality of the paper selected.\n\n- For the Style-Guided Aesthetic Rendering process, AutoFigure employs style description text to guide the rendering. However, as shown in Figure 4, the illustrations generated from diverse academic texts appear visually similar, often consisting of sub-block structures, similar color schemes and patterns. This raises concerns about whether the style cues truly exert a meaningful guiding influence on the rendering results.\n\n- Some details of this work are not clearly illustrated:\n(a) What are the prompts used for all the LLMs used in this work?\n(b) The VLM evaluates the generated images across three dimensions with eight sub-metrics, but these metrics are not explicitly defined or described in the paper.\n\n- Regarding the human evaluation, only 10 participants were involved, and they assessed merely 21 papers in total.

There should be a human evaluation for all the metrics (\"Visual Design,\" \"Communication Effectiveness,\" \"Content Fidelity,\" and \"Blind Pairwise Comparison\") to make sure they align with the VLM’s scores. A correlation or alignment study between human and model judgments would make this more reliable.\n\nThe method uses many LLMs in different steps, so the cost of running the system must be very high, especially since all the models are commercial.
