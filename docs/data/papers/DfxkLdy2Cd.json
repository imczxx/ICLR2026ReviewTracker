A Study of Answer Attribution on Large Reasoning Models", "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors: problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval mechanism as a shortcut, effectively \"hacking\" the reward signal and undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

In Section 3.1, I am considering whether SFT can serve as a reasonable method for directly modifying a model’s memory. While SFT does increase the probability of target tokens during deep-layer processing, evidence from mechanistic interpretability research [1, 2] suggests that it does not directly alter the MLP-stored factual knowledge or modify the model’s internal retrieval mechanisms. Therefore, the reliability of SFT as a means of memory intervention has a direct impact on the validity of the experimental conclusions in this work.\n\n2. The investigation of the reasoning mechanism in LRMs is limited to injecting misleading cues into the CoT and observing the model’s response across domains. However, the paper does not examine the **intrinsic** reasoning behavior of LRMs within those domains. For instance, in mathematical tasks, the interplay between the model’s **inherent** mathematical reasoning and its memory recall mechanism is not explored.\n\n3. Similarly, the study of retrieval mechanisms introduces new “memory” through SFT, rather than examining the model’s inherent knowledge retrieval capabilities. \n\n4. The experiments are restricted to multiple-choice tasks.
