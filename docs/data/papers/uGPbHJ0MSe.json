Recently, Agentic XAI systems that integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged to make explanations more accessible for non-expert users through natural language. \nHowever, a critical limitation of the existing systems is their failure to address explanation faithfulness.\nThis is problematic because many XAI methods are often unfaithful for complex models, and LLMs can amplify this incorrect information, ultimately misleading users.\nTo address this limitation, we propose Faithful Agentic XAI (FAX), a framework that actively enhances explanation faithfulness. \nFAX introduces a systematic verification process where an LLM agent cross-checks claims against inherently faithful tools. This process filters out unreliable or contradictory evidence and leads to more faithful explanations.\nFor evaluation, we propose CRAFTER-XAI-Bench, a benchmark framework built on an open-world reinforcement learning environment. The benchmark features complex models with diverse goals and challenging test scenarios, enabling a rigorous assessment of explanation faithfulness under realistic conditions. \nExperiments demonstrate that FAX significantly improves the faithfulness of explanations, marking a crucial step towards faithful and trustworthy Agentic XAI.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Explainable AI"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f16b199e7e4c84cf88dbb96db934d341ad412dd5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4378663f1d22c6ba54ed45742520bc1f8a4e6bd7.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This study proposes an explainable AI agent named “FAX”, which can explain actions of a RL agent (LLM) trained on “Crafter, an open-world RL environment”.

After carefully considering the valuable feedback provided by all three reviewers, we have decided to withdraw our submission to incorporate your suggestions and further strengthen our work for future submission to another venue.\n\nBelow is a summary of the feedback and our plan for improvements:\n\n### Summary of Strengths\nWe are encouraged that the reviewers recognized the value of our work in several key areas:\n1. Timeliness and Importance: Reviewers agreed that addressing unfaithful explanations in Agentic XAI is a critical and timely issue.\n2. Effectiveness of Verification: The proposed six-stage workflow was acknowledged for delivering substantial quantitative improvements in faithfulness without sacrificing fluency.\n3. Importance of the proposed benchmark: The introduction of the CRAFTER-XAI-Bench were highlighted as positive contributions.\n\n### Addressing Concerns & Future Plan\nWe have taken note of the major concerns raised and have established a clear plan to address them:\n\n1. Faithfulness Metric & Simulation: We acknowledge the concern regarding whether model simulation performance sufficiently proves faithfulness. We realize our original manuscript did not clearly articulate the causal link between simulation outcomes and the model's internal decisions. In our revision, we will rigorously rewrite this definition to clarify how the metric guarantees alignment between the explanation and the model's actual behavior.\n2. Technical Novelty & Generalizability: We understand the critique regarding the incremental nature of the verification step and its limitation to the Crafter environment. We plan to conduct additional experiments in broader domains (e.g., NLP or Vision) to demonstrate that our FAX framework is a generalizable research contribution, not just an engineering solution for a specific RL task.\n3. Evaluation Bias & Cost: We will also address the concerns about LLM-as-a-judge bias and add a detailed computational cost analysis.\n\nThank you again for your constructive feedback. Your feedback has provided a clear roadmap for evolving our research into a more robust contribution."}}, "id": "fqBrDZ0Ot9", "forum": "uGPbHJ0MSe", "replyto": "uGPbHJ0MSe", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17836/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17836/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17836/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763723563255, "cdate": 1763723563255, "tmdate": 1763723563255, "mdate": 1763723563255, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "gkFo0XPJEH", "forum": "uGPbHJ0MSe", "replyto": "uGPbHJ0MSe", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17836/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17836/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763729578435, "cdate": 1763729578435, "tmdate": 1763729578435, "mdate": 1763729578435, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes two main things, a workflow for faithful Agentic XAI systems called FAX, and an evaluation framework called CFAFTER-XAI-Bench.

It is not surprising to me that adding an additional stage for this kind of verification would marginally improve a metric like model simulation.

Instead of blindly trusting whatever XAI tool output the agent gets, FAX runs a six-stage workflow where the initial explanation draft is actually cross-checked using what they call “inherently faithful” XAI methods (like counterfactuals, state edits, feature importance). It’s kind of like giving the LLM a sanity check loop so it doesn’t hallucinate explanations.\n\nThey also introduce CRAFTER-XAI-Bench, a reinforcement learning–based benchmark designed to test explanation faithfulness in more dynamic, realistic environments, and an LLM-based simulation metric that quantifies how well an explanation predicts model behavior. Results show that this verification process boosts faithfulness scores quite a bit (around 2× over structured Agentic XAI) while still keeping explanations fluent and relevant.

The verification stage, while effective, functions primarily as an additional structured prompt rather than a fundamentally new mechanism. The notion of “faithful tools” is loosely defined, and the evaluation relies on a small, curated set of XAI methods, limiting claims of generality beyond the RL environment. The dependence on LLM-as-a-judge metrics raises concerns about evaluation validity, as the same model family is involved in both explanation and assessment. The absence of human or independent verification weakens the empirical grounding. Finally, the paper does not discuss computational cost or scalability, and the six-stage pipeline may introduce significant overhead.
