As a simple counter example, v=u^3 is a monotone mapping, but shorter intervals in u, does not necessarily lead to shorter invervals in v. You can see that intervcal of size 0.5 in u can lead to intervals of size anywhere from 1/8 to 7/8 in v. It's the magnitude of the change of rate (slope) of the mapping at different u that counts, not just that the slope is always positive (monotonely increasing).\nBecause of this disagreement, I have some doubt on the cutoff optimization strategy in section 2.3.

Note that FACTOR seeks a transformation (ended up using normalizing flow) of y|x into random vector that follows the Uniform distribution on a p-dimensional ball; CONTRA learns a normalizing flow that transforms y|x into a p-dimensional standard normal random vector. Both methods then define the non-conformity score as distance of transformed variable to the origin and obtained empirical quantile to construct conformal regions for new data points.\nI think a key difference is that in learning the NF, FACTOR tried to minimize the KL divergence between transformed and reference distributions, while CONTRA tried to minimize negative log likelihood.
