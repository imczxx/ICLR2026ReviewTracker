Driven by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they have made great progress in architecture and data curation, while the holistic paradigm is still limited to SSC, {\\em i.e.}, single input, singular embedding, contrastive supervision, which collapses rich, multifaceted inputs into monolithic embeddings and fails to fully exploit MLLM capabilities. In this paper, we tailor one \\textbf{P}arallel \\textbf{D}ecoupling \\textbf{F}ramework (PDF) for multimodal embedding learning, by utilizing the proprietary steerability of MLLMs, {\\em i.e.}, their ability to flexibly generate quite differentiated response under explicit instructions. Concretely, PDF conditions a shared MLLM backbone on distinct, learnable prefixes to roll out multiple parallel paths for one input, then relies on these paths to obtain parallel embeddings. To promote full parallel diversity, we employ Mutual Information Minimization (MIM) as an explicit constraint, coupled with per-path contrastive supervision to maintain semantic alignment. Such dual-objectives force PDF to yield robust semantic coverage and a generalizable embedding space. Ultimately, the remarkable embedding space are accessible at inference via one single forward pass, incurring negligible computational overhead. We instantiate PDF on multiple MLLM backbones and prove its effectiveness on MMEB benchmark. Significant gains are consistently achieved across various resolutions and model sizes, {\\em e.g.}, boosting the VLM2Vec-LLaVA-1.6-LR model by a remarkable +8.9\\% (7B), and the VLM2Vec-Qwen2VL models by +4.2\\% (2B) and +3.1\\% (7B). In terms of efficiency, our 2B model surpasses its baseline by +2.6\\% using only half the computational budget.

The main idea is to exploit the steerability of MLLMs by generating multiple parallel embeddings for a single input. This approach is realized by conditioning the MLLM backbone on distinct, learnable prefixes, which in turn create multiple parallel paths for embedding generation. Here is the core contributions of the paper:\n\n1) Parallel Embedding Generation: The paper proposes using a shared MLLM backbone with multiple parallel paths, each conditioned by unique prefixes. This allows the model to generate diverse embeddings, fully utilizing the input's semantic richness.\n\n2) Mutual Information Minimization (MIM): To avoid collapse into redundant embeddings, the paper introduces a mutual information minimization objective. This explicitly minimizes statistical dependencies between parallel embeddings, enhancing diversity and ensuring robust semantic coverage.\n\n3) Training Efficiency: The framework introduces minimal computational overhead during inference, as the system can select a single path for inference, maintaining the benefits of parallel training without extra cost.\n\n4) Empirical Validation: The PDF framework is instantiated on several MLLM backbones, such as VLM2Vec with LLaVA and Qwen2VL, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks (e.g., MMEB), with gains ranging from +4.2% to +8.9% over baseline models.

In terms of originality, it presents a fresh reformulation of multimodal embedding learning by replacing the conventional Single input–Singular embedding–Contrastive supervision (SSC) paradigm with the proposed Single input–Parallel paths–Parallel outputs (SPP) paradigm. This idea, realizing multiple, decorrelated embeddings via deep prefix injection and mutual information minimization, creatively leverages the inherent steerability of MLLMs, representing a novel and well-motivated contribution. In terms of quality, the technical design is rigorous: the dual-objective optimization (contrastive loss + variational MIM) is theoretically grounded, experimentally validated across multiple MLLM backbones, and supported by comprehensive ablation, efficiency, and zero-shot evaluations. In addition, the paper is well organized, with clear figures and consistent notations that make complex mechanisms (e.g., prefix-based parallel paths and MI estimation) easy to follow. Regarding significance, the proposed framework achieves notable gains (up to +8.9% on MMEB) while requiring negligible inference overhead, suggesting strong practical impact and potential influence on future MLLM embedding research. Overall, the work is a empirically convincing contribution to representation learning for multimodal foundation models"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Most experiments are conducted on the MMEB benchmark, with limited evaluation across other multimodal embedding datasets (e.g., MSCOCO, LAION-Aesthetics, or ImageNet-Text retrieval). This restricts the evidence for generalization and may introduce benchmark-specific bias. Adding results on diverse domains would better demonstrate robustness and transferability.\n\n2. The paper proposes learnable prefixes for parallel embedding generation but provides little insight into how prefix dimensionality, initialization, or number of paths 𝑁 affect performance. A systematic analysis (e.g., scaling 𝑁=2, 4, 8) could clarify whether improvements stem from architectural diversity or training regularization.\n\n3. The framework is demonstrated for multimodal retrieval and classification, but its applicability to downstream generation or reasoning tasks is not discussed. Since MLLMs are often used in generative settings, evaluating or at least discussing potential extensions to instruction-following or captioning would broaden the paper’s impact.\n\n4. The baselines largely include VLM2Vec and a few classic models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP2). However, more recent multimodal embedding approaches (e.g., MM-VLM, EVA-CLIP, E5-V, MME5) are not included or discussed in depth. A more thorough comparative evaluation would improve contextual positioning and claim of novelty.\n\n5. Every method has limitations. For example, perhaps in data-scarce settings, adding many paths could over­fit; or perhaps for very simple inputs, parallel embeddings may be redundant. The paper would improve by including a short discussion of when the proposed method might not offer gains (and perhaps empirical evidence of such cases)."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "oMRCRAOyFO", "forum": "4YAHuBtzHb", "replyto": "4YAHuBtzHb", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1211/Reviewer_9b5b"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1211/Reviewer_9b5b"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1211/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761142354557, "cdate": 1761142354557, "tmdate": 1762915709023, "mdate": 1762915709023, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The key idea is to replace the standard “single input–single embedding” paradigm with a deep prefix injection mechanism that conditions multiple parallel paths through learnable prefix vectors injected at each transformer layer."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.
