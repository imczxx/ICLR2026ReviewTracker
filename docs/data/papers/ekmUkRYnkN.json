While approaches using multi-task Gaussian processes or deep kernel transfer exist, the performance improvement is marginal when scaling beyond a moderate number of tasks. We introduce **BOLT**, an initialization-only transfer strategy that distills prior BO runs into an LLM which proposes candidates for new tasks, while the surrogate at test time remains single-task. The LLM is periodically fine-tuned on top solutions from completed runs, creating a closed loop where better BO outputs yield better initializations over time. This decoupled design scales to roughly 1500 tasks without the saturation observed for shared-surrogate MTBO and adds only a small, amortized overhead relative to the BO inner loops. We evaluate on two domains: database query optimization and antimicrobial peptide design. We demonstrate that LLM-generated initializations steadily improve and accelerate BO, and with sufficient fine-tuning, a few LLM samples often match or surpass full ''from-scratch'' BO with far fewer oracle calls.", "tldr": "Using large language models to enhance very large scale multi-task Bayesian optimization.", "keywords": ["Bayesian optimization", "large language models", "protein design", "meta learning", "scientific discovery"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/65249b19637247ca144f8611a2b6fdb0c9a64019.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "While this article claims to consider multi-task Bayesian optimisation, really it's about transfer learning within a class of Bayesian optimisation problems.

In particular points 2,3, and 4 are worth prioritizing for the authors to receive an upgraded score.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**__MAJOR POINTS__**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. In terms of the structure of the paper, the background on the problem settings on page 3, namely antimicrobial peptide and database query plan optimization would be better placed in the appendix. Given that the authors are introducing a general purpose optimization methodology at a machine learning conference, readers are more likely to be interested in comparable optimization methods rather than the specifics of the applications considered. Given that the authors leverage LLMs, an expanded related work section on meta learning and/or transfer learning in BO as well as other attempts to use LLMs for BO may be more appropriate.\n\n2. The absence of an anonymous GitHub or similar in the submission raises concerns for the reproducibility  of the current work e.g. the description of the architecture for the network in Section C.1 is not complete. What was the choice of activation function?\n\n3. The problems considered by the authors feature optimization over structured input spaces via latent space BO. Following on from point 2 above some of the details of VAE training are missing. Do the authors periodically retrain the VAE? As I understand the authors use the same initialization set as the BAO algorithm for database query planning? Why not use random initializations and report errorbars? For the peptide problem the authors mention they curate L=1000 sequences partitioning 100 of these to the validation set. Is the VAE trained on the 900 sequences comprising the training set?\n\n4. It would be worth adding a random search baseline across the VAE latent space as a sanity check.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**__MINOR POINTS__**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. In terms of the opening statement, \"Multi-task optimization seeks to use related, previously solved tasks to accelerate the optimization of new ones.\" I would disagree with this definition. Related tasks do not necessarily need to be \"solved\" to provide benefit to the optimization of a new task.\n\n2. When citing domains in which multitask optimization problems occur, it would be useful to provide reference works for the domains mentioned.\n\n3. Line 64, the acronym MTBO for multi-task Bayesian optimization is introduced before it is defined.\n\n4. Line 64/64, the source papers for Optformer and LLAMBO should be given upon first mentioning the methods.\n\n5. Line 86, when introducing Bayesian optimisation it would be worth citing the originating papers for the methodology [1,2] as discussed in [3] in place of the references given.\n\n6. Line 89, the notation $y$ should be defined as a noise-corrupted version of $f(\\mathbf{x})$.\n\n7. The source paper for the VAE [4] should be cited when introducing it on line 96.\n\n8. On line 97 when introducing the idea of latent space Bayesian optimization, the source paper should be cited [5], as well as close follow-up works on the topic [6, 7] which were published before Eissman et al.\n\n9. Line 124, the citation to Leis et al. should be parenthetical e.g. (Leis et al. 2015) as opposed to narrative since the author's name is not part of the sentence. It would be worth correcting this across the manuscript.\n\n10. When describing structured input spaces it would be worth explaining what the authors mean by \"structured\" as this may not be apparent to layreaders. Something akin to a \"non-numerical, discrete input\" may be appropriate together with examples such as images, molecules, or amino acid sequences.\n\n11. Line 148, the acronym for LLMs has already been defined earlier in the manuscript.\n\n12. In Algorithm 1, the notation $X_t^*$, $X_{init}$, $y$ etc. should be defined. $y_{init}$ should be denoted as a vector. Additionally, $y$ and $y_{next}$ should also be denoted as vectors for generality in the batch setting. On line 177, $x$ should also be a vector. $\\alpha$ should not be a subscript on the argmax.\n\n13. In Algorithm 2, it would be better not to use the variable $T$ for the number of iterations since it overloads the use of $T$ as the number of tasks. Additionally, $x$ and $y$ should be bolded as vector quantities $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$.\n\n14. Line 198, $x$ should be a vector.\n\n15. There is a missing full stop at the end of Equation 2.\n\n16. There are missing capitalizations in the references e.g. \"bayesian\" in place of \"Bayesian\".\n\n17. There is a missing arXiv reference for Eggensperger et al. 2020.\n\n18. There are missing conference references e.g. Haluptzok et al. was published at ICLR 2023.\n\n19. It would help the reader if the authors described roughly what the DKT and FSBO methods were instead of forcing the reader to read the source papers.\n\n20. In the related work on language models as optimizers it would be worth discussing the relation of the current work to [8].\n\n21. The source paper for AdamW [9] should be cited given that it is used.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**__REFERENCES__**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[1] H.J. Kushner (1962).

On line 155, the authors state that each training task comprises the top-K observations from the trajectory for each of $t$ tasks. Are these the top-K optimal observations or simply the top-K observations identified in a BO procedure. If the latter, how does one ensure consistency in the efficacy of the BO procedure used to generate the traces for each training task? Update: This is clarified to be the latter on page 4 of the paper. In this case it may be worth running a sensitivity analysis on the BO runs used to initialize the LLM with the top-K observations albeit this would be costly from a compute perspective.\n\n2. In Figure 1, it is not clear how different tasks are treated. How does the number of oracle calls given in the x-axis related to the number of test tasks? What are the errorbars reported over?\n\n3. I take it that BOLT-10, BOLT-20 etc. refer to the number of training tasks the LLM has been fine-tuned on? It might be worth emphasizing this for the reader in the experient section or the figure captions since the meaning of the BOLT-T notation appears only to be provided in Section 3. Update: This appears to be explained in the caption of Figure 2 but not in Figure 1.\n\n4. For self-augmentation I fail to see the point of saving time on BO computation under the assumption that querying $f(\\mathbf{x})$ (scoring under the problem's oracle in the authors' words) is a more expensive process relative to re-training the BO surrogate. Obviously the authors' BO runs were computationally intensive but is there an implicit assumption that for self-augmentation to be useful, evaluating $f(\\mathbf{x})$ must be relatively cheap compared to the cost of running BO?\n\n5.
