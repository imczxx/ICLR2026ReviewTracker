In scRNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), destructive measurements yield irregular, high-dimensional samples of cell states, obscuring how populations evolve. Existing trajectory inference methods either use graph heuristics or cast alignment as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem. However, they treat cells as independent points, ignoring intercellular interactions. \nIn this work, we ask whether incorporating cell–cell interactions can improve the reconstruction of cellular dynamics from scRNA-seq snapshots. We introduce IADOT  (Interaction-Aware Dynamic Optimal Transport), which integrates cell-cell interaction networks into an OT objective and then learns a time-continuous vector field via Conditional Flow Matching. Across a synthetic task and diverse scRNA-seq datasets, we find that incorporating interaction structure can improve snapshot alignment and inference of cellular dynamics versus feature-only baselines. IADOT also supports in-silico ligand–receptor perturbation analyses: we show on lung cancer data that inferred trajectories are sensitive to edits of the ligand–receptor catalog, consistent with known effects of targeted pathway inhibition.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["cell dynamics", "cell cell interaction", "optimal transport"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/48929df530ff6fbc2f1d2177830d09908bf1db4b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes IADOT, a two-stage pipeline for inferring cellular dynamics from scRNA-seq snapshots by (i) computing a structure-aware cross-snapshot coupling with a Fused Gromov–Wasserstein (FGW) objective that combines expression distances with a cell–cell interaction (CCI) prior derived from ligand–receptor (LR) expression, and (ii) fitting a time-dependent velocity field with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) induced by the coupling.

This problem is important."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Scope and novelty**. This method can be viewed as substituting the feature-only OT coupling commonly used in CFM-style trajectories with an FGW coupling that incorporates a CCI term, and then fitting dynamics via standard CFM on the resulting affine interpolants. The paper does not seem to introduce a new dynamic objective beyond this substitution, and the theoretical discussion primarily shows that CFM reproduces the coupling-induced linear path rather than establishing guarantees for transporting the empirical endpoints under a broader dynamic optimality principle for FGWOT. Making explicit what is (and is not) guaranteed would strengthen the positioning. From this perspective, the technical contributions are incremental. “Interaction-aware” is implemented as a generic FGW structure term, not a CCI-specific dynamic model. The framework turns LR information into static multi-channel adjacency and then optimizes a generic FGW objective; this idea is not specific to CCIs—any typed graph prior could be dropped in. Similar ideas have also been presented in Moscot and many spatial OT alignment methods.\n2. **Static CCI assumption** The method constructs snapshot-wise static tensors and encourages their cross-snapshot persistence, yet cellular neighborhoods and communication partners typically reconfigure between times. The static-graph prior may bias trajectories when transient interactions matter.  \n3. **Sensitivity to CCI false positives.** Single-cell LR-based CCIs may contain a high rate of false positives. The sensitivity analysis (Table 3) shows that shuffling CCIs or using random LR catalogs could change interpolation performance, which may suggest some dependence on the specified CCI structure and could be influenced by the CCI false positives. \n4. **Computational cost and parameter selection.** The method introduces several hyperparameters—most notably the trade-off weight $\\alpha$ between feature and structure terms, and Hill-function parameters $K_g$, $h_g$—whose values are chosen empirically by grid search on interpolation metrics. The paper does not provide principled guidance or sensitivity analysis for these settings. Moreover, the FGW solver and subsequent CFM training add considerable runtime and memory overhead.\n5. **Lack of unbalanced and stochastic modeling.** The proposed framework assumes balanced mass transport and deterministic dynamics, yet biological systems often involve cell proliferation, death, and stochastic transcriptional noise. Ignoring unbalanced or stochastic components limits the model’s biological realism and comparability to Schrödinger Bridge or unbalanced OT (UOT) formulations, which explicitly capture mass creation or diffusion effects.\n\nKlein, Dominik, et al. \"Mapping cells through time and space with moscot.\" Nature 638.8052 (2025): 1065-1075."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **Clarity of theoretical contribution** The dynamic formulation appears to reuse the standard Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) objective with an FGW coupling that includes CCI information. Could the authors clarify what theoretical advances this introduces beyond substituting the coupling step? In particular, does the proposed FGWOT formulation guarantee valid optimal transport of endpoint distributions? If so, could the authors formally state and prove it?\n2. **Specificity of “interaction-aware” modeling** Since the FGW structure term could accept any typed graph prior, to what extent is the method specific to cell–cell interactions rather than general structured alignment?\n3. **Static CCI assumption** The model constructs snapshot-specific static CCI tensors and enforces persistence across time, but cellular communication networks typically reconfigure dynamically. Could the authors discuss how this static assumption affects trajectories when transient or time-varying interactions are present?\n4. **Sensitivity to CCI noise** Given that single-cell LR-based CCIs often contain false positives, Table 3 suggests that interpolation quality changes when CCIs are shuffled or randomized. How robust is the method to such noise in the LR catalog, and could uncertainty propagation or perturbation analysis be added to quantify sensitivity?\n5. **Computational cost and hyperparameter robustness** The approach relies on several empirically tuned parameters (e.g., $\\alpha$, $K_g$, $h_g$) and involves a computationally intensive FGW solver. Could the authors report runtime, memory scaling, and parameter sensitivity, or discuss practical guidelines for applying the method to larger atlas-level datasets?\n6. **Perturbation design** The in-silico perturbation experiment modifies only the CCI matrix (by removing selected LR pairs) while keeping expression data fixed. Is this design biologically justified? Would jointly perturbing expression or signaling outputs yield different dynamics, and how robust are the current results to that modeling choice?\n\nMy comments are based on my current understanding. At this stage, I find it difficult to be more positive, but I would be happy to reconsider my evaluation if the authors provide a thorough and convincing rebuttal addressing these points.\n\nOnly language polishing was assisted by an LLM; the review’s analysis and conclusions are the reviewer’s own."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "0albiLo6cY", "forum": "8H1L06TGNS", "replyto": "8H1L06TGNS", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20800/Reviewer_ja6u"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20800/Reviewer_ja6u"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20800/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761547239596, "cdate": 1761547239596, "tmdate": 1763000002720, "mdate": 1763000002720, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents IADOT, a method for inferring cellular dynamics from scRNA-seq snapshots by incorporating cell-cell interaction (CCI) networks into the computation of OT couplings.

The difference lies in the specific biological priors, not the methodology itself.\n- Directly using CFM to construct dynamic trajectories is also not novel. Here the dynamic paths are constructed using linear interpolation. However, if the population of cells is truly considered as an interacting system, then the trajectory of one cell will be influenced by others. Thus, the linear interpolation is questionable, as **it still considers each cell as an independent particle by enforcing straight lines.** Moreover, as the constraints of CCI patterns are only applied at endpoints, it is also questionable **whether these patterns can be preserved along the whole interpolated trajectories.**\n- From a biological perspective, the CCI matrix is constructed from dissociated single-cell data, which removes the spatial context. In biological tissues, cells typically communicate within a local neighborhood. By ignoring spatial proximity, the method is likely to infer a large number of **false positive interactions** between cells that would never be in contact in vivo. This raises concerns about whether the CCI prior being used is biologically meaningful.\n- From an empirical perspective, the improvement of incorporating CCI information in real world datasets is marginal, and seems to be **sensitive to different $\\alpha$ across different datasets.** The authors should provide a clear guideline for selecting $\\alpha$ on new datasets and report the computational cost required for this tuning process.\n- The connection between results in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 is unclear.
