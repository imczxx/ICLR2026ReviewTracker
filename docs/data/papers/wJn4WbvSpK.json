Furthermore, we explore reweighting and single-label classification strategies to facilitate future investigation on structure-based methods for this task. \nLastly, we showcase the powerful interpretability of structure-based methods through a case study on the Golgi apparatus, where we discover a decisive localization pattern $\\alpha$-helix from attention mechanisms, demonstrating the potential for bridging the gap with intuitive biological interpretability and paving the way for data-driven discoveries in cell biology.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Subcellular Localization", "Human Protein", "3D Structure"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bb18c2200423a10d513898ef297199c34aed9445.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a subcellular localization dataset called CAPSUL that offers comprehensive 3D structural information with detailed subcellular localization annotated by domain experts.

This constitutes a valuable empirical reference for the community.\n* The dataset’s **fine-grained, hierarchical labeling** reveals that localization is a multi-stage process, aligning with known biological transport hierarchies (e.g., generic targeting → organelle entry → sub-organelle retention). This suggests natural directions for **hierarchical or multi-task learning architectures**.\n\n**Technical quality**\n\n* The benchmark suite is broad and technically sound: eight representative models spanning sequence Transformers, geometric GNNs, and graph Transformers.\n* Ablations on randomised coordinates convincingly isolate the contribution of geometric structure.\n* The exploration of reweighting and single-label training provides concrete, actionable strategies for imbalance mitigation.\n* Interpretability analyses identify α-helix transmembrane motifs consistent with established Golgi localization mechanisms—an impressive validation of biological fidelity.\n\n**Clarity and reproducibility**\n\n* The paper is well organised and carefully written; data processing steps are fully documented with evidence codes and validation statistics.\n* Supplementary material provides sufficient implementation detail for replication.\n\n**Impact**\n\n* CAPSUL is likely to become a **standard benchmark** for structure-aware protein models.
