Conventional mouse whole-brain models are typically constructed from coarse-grained regional or voxel-level connectivity, without considering single-neuron biological plausibility in the mouse brain connectome. In this study, we build a mouse digital twin brain (mouse DTB) at single-neuron resolution with large-scale spiking neural network, able to support complex behavioral tasks at whole-brain scale. We developed the mouse brain connectivity at single-neuron resolution through a data-driven pipeline that integrates high-resolution axonal projection data and spatial distributions of cells from the mouse brain cell atlas. The resulting neuronal connectivity is coupled with leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons and conductance-based synapses to form a large-scale spiking neural network of the mouse brain. The mouse DTB successfully reproduced blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals observed in both resting state and olfactory Go/No-Go discrimination task with high correlation, and exhibits correct behavioral responses aligned with perceptual odor inputs. This model leverages diffusion ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF) and hierarchical Bayesian inference for parameter estimation. Our work provides a single-neuron resolution, whole-brain mouse DTB, offering a powerful tool for studying neural dynamics, behavior and cognition underlying mouse intelligence during complex tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["digital twin brain", "whole-brain modelling", "mouse brain connectome"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8dd8e15d9d367470bcd443d35cd3a4aeae7adb94.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3afc90813fd7a3922f65441177b2ffc57d0a74a2.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a simulation spiking network attempting to match the statistics, connectivity and properties of an actual mouse brain.\nThe method consists of 3 steps:\n1.

The limitations of the method are not adequately reflected, they are not even mentioned in the main text. For example, a clear limitation is that inhibitory cell types usually operate at 2 different timescales, with PV cells being faster than SST cells, which is currently not a part of the model (all cells are just modelled as inhibitory) (see corresponding citations for PV and SST in [1]). Additionally, the modelling is only done at the level of brain regions and more fine-grained structures (for instance, the layers of visual cortex) are not modelled.\n2. **Method validation on known connectomes is missing**. Modelling a whole mouse brain is an ambitious task and due to the lack of real single-cell ground truth data it is impossible to check if the modelling is correct. However, we do have a digitalised brain of a Drosophila [2] and trying to reconstruct its brain using same governing principles as for mouse and comparing it with the measured average atlas could be a good sanity check / proof-of-concept for the method.\n3. **The description of model fitting lack details**. The hierarchical Bayesian/EnKF assimilation description is too high-level - it’s unclear which parameters were optimized, how priors were chosen, and what constraints ensure biological interpretability.\n4. **fMRI is not enough**. The model is constrained and validated by fMRI BOLD signals, which are a slow, indirect measure of neural activity. So it is unclear if the elecrophysiological activity of the MouseDBT is actually realistic on faster (e.g. calcium or spiking) timescales, especially due to the iterative optimization process enforcing a uniform distribution of out-degrees to match the fixed in-degrees (which is not true for all of the cell types). Some single neuronal data from different brain areas could be used from IBL dataset [3], for instance. Also, some typical cell microcircuit motifs are knows [1, 4] but they have not been cross-checked in the model (if they emerge during optimisation).\n\nReferences:  \n[1] Bos, Hannah, et al. \"Untangling stability and gain modulation in cortical circuits with multiple interneuron classes.\" eLife 13 (2025): RP99808.   \n[2] Dorkenwald, Sven, et al. \"Neuronal wiring diagram of an adult brain.\" Nature 634.8032 (2024): 124-138.  \n[3] Angelaki, Dora, et al. \"A brain-wide map of neural activity during complex behaviour.\" Nature 645.8079 (2025): 177-191.  \n[4] Jiang, Xiaolong, et al. \"Principles of connectivity among morphologically defined cell types in adult neocortex.\" Science 350.6264 (2015): aac9462."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Recently a reconstruction of a cubic millimiter of mouse brain has been published, including connectivity data. Why you have not used this data in your study? To the best of my knowledge it is the largest and publicly available connectivity dataset for mice\n2. What are the limitations of your method? For example, what are the limitations of the hierarchical mesoscale data assimilation that you use for parameter inference?\n3. You report that simulations are done on a cluster with 640 GPUs (lines 279-281) - is it needed for both training and inference? Is there a possibility to optimize the compute requirements as not many academic labs have access for this type of infrastructure?\n4. How independent is the validation data from the assimilation data? Were some voxels or sessions held out entirely during fitting?\n5. Given the scale of the model, how do you address potential overparameterization or lack of identifiability in the assimilation step? Specifically, the model has tens of millions of neurons and billions of synaptic parameters, yet the data used for fitting are low-dimensional fMRI BOLD signals (thousands of voxels). Because BOLD is a slow, spatially blurred proxy for neural activity, many distinct combinations of micro-level parameters (synaptic weights, time constants, background currents, etc.) could produce very similar BOLD outputs. How big are the differences between the derived models if they are fitted several times (like training classic DL models on several seeds)?\n6.

The effectiveness of the digital twin mouse brain should be evaluated, since task performance is poor.

More seriously, Behavioral decoding accuracy was only 55.56±9.39% (barely above chance). The hit rate was only 24.45±20.14%, indicating that the model struggled to capture Go responses. The paper attributes this to \"assimilation quality\" and \"decoder overfitting\" (lines 1330-1341), but this exposes fundamental limitations of the model.\n4. Lack of neuronal-level validation. Only BOLD signals at the population level were validated. No comparison with actual electrophysiological recordings (spike trains, LFP).
