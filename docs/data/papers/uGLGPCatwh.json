This approach enables the policy to adapt to new settings with only a few training steps. While many Meta-RL methods have demonstrated success, they often rely on the assumption that unobserved confounders can be excluded \\emph{a priori}. This paper investigates robust Meta-RL in sequential decision-making, given confounded observational data collected across multiple heterogeneous environments. We introduce a novel augmentation procedure, called Causal MAML, which employs partial identification methods to generate posterior counterfactual trajectories from candidate environments that align with the confounded observations. These counterfactual trajectories are then used to find a policy initialization that produces strong generalization performance in the target domain. Theoretical analysis reveals that our causal Meta-RL approach is guaranteed to yield a solution that minimizes generalization loss.", "tldr": "Causal MAML uses partial identification to construct counterfactual trajectories from confounded data, enabling robust policy initialization that adapts quickly in target domains.", "keywords": ["causal inference", "meta-learning", "graphical models"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f6e7c808d7ee7eda013077f861eda1d404430660.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles unobserved confounders in Meta-RL via partial identification methods to generate counterfactual trajectories from candidate environments that align with the confounded observations."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "This paper addresses an important challenge in reinforcement learning: the presence of unobserved confounders, approached from a causal inference perspective.

This establishes a clear and principled target for the algorithm.\n2. This paper focuses on the challenge of confounding robustness in Meta-RL, a highly relevant yet often overlooked issue in real-world applications. The introduction of causal inference into Meta-RL sounds interesting."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The proposed practical algorithm (Algorithm 1) is built on a foundation that is not scalable. The core \"Counterfactual Bootstrap\" step requires MCMC sampling from the posterior over all possible MDPs (ρb(M | Di_obs)). This is computationally infeasible for any non-trivial environment. The method's success in the paper is an artifact of using toy domains where this step is barely possible. This reliance on an unscalable sampling procedure makes the proposed algorithm impractical for real-world application.\n2. The Windy Gridworld and Causal Pendulum used in the paper are essentially \"toy problems\", characterized by low-dimensional state spaces and simple dynamics models. While these environments help illustrate the concept of \"confounding\" intuitively, they are far removed from the complexity of real-world problems. \n3. The most concerning shortcoming of the paper is the complete absence of any direct evidence demonstrating that its causal inference module actually learns meaningful information about the confounder. The paper's core claim is that it \"infers and utilizes the confounding variable $U$,\" yet the experimental section only reports final task rewards without any analysis or visualization of the learned latent variable $U$.\nIn a controlled environment where the ground truth of the confounding variable is known, such validation is straightforward and necessary. For instance, the authors should visualize the relationship between $U$ and the true confounder. In the absence of such validation, the causal inference module becomes an uninterpretable \"black box.\" We cannot determine whether the performance improvement stems from successful causal inference or merely because the VAE structure happened to learn a useful—but causally irrelevant—abstract representation in these simple tasks. This significantly undermines confidence in the methodological core contribution.\n4. The comparisons in the paper are limited to standard MAML and a simple pre-training baseline. This overlooks a substantial body of related work in unsupervised/self-supervised RL, which focuses on learning latent representations or skills from reward-free interactions (e.g., SMM, DIAYN). These methods are typically evaluated on more complex and widely adopted benchmarks (e.g., DeepMind Control Suite, MuJoCo). The failure to compare Causal MAML against such methods, or at least test it in environments of comparable complexity, makes its contribution appear somewhat isolated and raises serious doubts about its scalability."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
