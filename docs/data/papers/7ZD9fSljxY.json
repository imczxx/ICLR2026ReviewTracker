Forecasting their evolution is computationally challenging due to high dimensionality and is further complicated by measurement noise and uncertainty in the network topology. We address this problem by studying the predictability of graph time series under random topology perturbations, a problem with major implications that has remained largely unexplored. In the limit of large networks, we uncover distinct noise regimes: systems that are predictable with arbitrary accuracy, systems predictable only up to limited accuracy, and systems that become entirely unpredictable. Motivated by this characterization, we propose a time series forecasting framework based on a probabilistic representation of network dynamics, which leverages Bayesian coreset approximations for scalable and robust dimentionality reduction. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy and robustness under topology uncertainty, while significantly reducing computational costs.", "tldr": "We propose a forecasting scheme for network time series that is robust to topology perturbation.", "keywords": ["Robust Learning", "Network Forecasting", "Bayesian Coresets", "Model Reduction"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/707ac2b83fdf14de2ddde6595d4ceaa468022984.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/623476eb9f47dea5e42d9a8ec0d66bcc77815b3d.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the critical and challenging problem of forecasting network dynamical systems, such as traffic or epidemic networks, in the presence of topology perturbations. The authors make two primary contributions. First, they provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes the predictability of graph time series under random topology perturbations. Second, motivated by this analysis, the paper proposes a novel and robust forecasting framework named Network Coreset Forecasting (NCF). NCF utilizes a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encoder to generate node embeddings, applies Bayesian coresets for scalable and robust dimensionality reduction by selecting a representative subset of node embeddings, models the latent temporal dynamics using an RNN, and finally reconstructs the full graph state via a GCN decoder. Empirical results on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that NCF significantly outperforms baselines in accuracy and robustness under topology uncertainty, while also being more computationally efficient."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The model relies on a two-stage training approach rather than a full end-to-end optimization. This may lead to sub-optimal representations, as the GCN encoder and the RNN are not jointly optimized. The rationale for this design choice over an end-to-end approach is not fully justified.\n\n2. The theoretical analysis and experiments primarily focus on i.i.d. random noise (Bernoulli or Gaussian). This does not capture more structured or adversarial perturbations (e.g., targeted node/edge removal, regional sensor failures) that are common in reality, thus narrowing the scope of the \"robustness\" claim.\n\n3. The paper lacks a qualitative analysis of the nodes selected by the Bayesian coreset. It is unclear what properties these nodes possess (e.g., high centrality, high dynamic variance) and how this selection mechanism practically contributes to robustness.\n\n4. Lack of baselines.

The theoretical results assume predictability becomes worse with the topology perturbations going larger, yet the coreset-based abstraction explicitly removes nodes and edges, potentially amplifying perturbations. Moreover, GCN encoder-decoder may still rely on the (possibly perturbed) original adjacency matrix in order to estimate all the nodes, so the claimed robustness is partial and bounded by the sensitivity of these components to the matrix. \n3. The RNN module is tied to a specific coreset node set. When the topology or node count changes, the coreset must be recomputed and the trained RNN becomes incompatible with new size of the coreset, preventing inference on unseen graphs.
