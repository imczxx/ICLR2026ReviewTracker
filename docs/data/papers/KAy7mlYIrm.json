We focus on a challenging setting in which one such subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable. Naively ignoring this unobserved group can result in biased estimates and degraded predictive performance. Despite this structured missingness, we show that the prediction in the target domain can still be recovered. Specifically, we rigorously derive both background-specific and overall prediction models for the target domain. For practical implementation, we propose the distribution matching method to estimate the subpopulation proportions. We provide theoretical guarantees for the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, and establish an upper bound on the prediction error. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method outperforms the naive benchmark that does not account for this unobservable source subpopulation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["unsupervised domain adaptation", "unobservable subpopulation", "out-of-distribution"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/215f617bbc4763a09148d54283ca2774e18cc1bd.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a new unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting where one source subpopulation, defined by a combination of label and background variables, is completely missing.

Subpopulation shift has been studied previously [1,2,3,4,5], and it is not convincing to claim novelty merely by considering an extreme case of the open-set subpopulation problem—where one subpopulation is entirely missing from the source domain but may exist in the target domain—and presenting it as a new problem setting.\n\nThe proposed method relies on the assumption that the conditional distribution is identical across the two domains, which can be easily satisfied under simplified conditions. However, this assumption oversimplifies real-world domain adaptation scenarios, where both severe domain shifts and label shifts often exist, making it difficult to ensure an invariant and target-discriminative conditional distribution.\n\nTo align with this restricted problem setting, the experiments are also limited in practicality and scope. Although the paper discusses historical and facial datasets to motivate the problem, only one real-world dataset (Waterbirds) is actually used. Moreover, the selected baseline adaptation methods are not representative, overlooking both prior subpopulation shift approaches and several mainstream adaptation methods such as distribution matching and self-training.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] A Theory of Label Propagation for Subpopulation Shift.
