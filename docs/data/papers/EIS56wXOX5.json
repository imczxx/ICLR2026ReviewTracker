While I understand that your setting does not assume state features, consider for a moment state features and actions having preconditions (in the simplest form, which of the state features are true) and effects (change in state features), as in e.g., classical planning. Then, an action would \"produce\" a feature that some other actions along the way would \"consume\" (require in the precondition). But it does not have to be pairs of actions, in the sense that a single action can achieve precondtions used by multiple actions along a plan (e.g., two doors opened by the same key), there can be alternative plans of the same cost that would use different actions that consume the same precondition (like two alternative doors). My point is, this property is not a property of action pairs. Looking at action preconditions and effects makes you see it more clearly. There was quite a body of research in planning on causal links, might worth a look.\nAnother closely related topic is action justification on a plan (e.g., [2,3,4,5,6]), talking about the reason for an action to be on a plan (providing some precondition for at least one following action or achieving a goal fact). The literature describes perfectly justified plans as a plan that cannot be reduced by removing actions and keeping it a plan. It seems like the authors are looking for similar concepts.\n\n\n# Soundness\n\nThe main idea, strategic link score, as defined in Equation (4) does not make sense for planning in general, for the reasons described above. For instance, it is not hard to craft examples where the score will not drop when only one \"pay-off\" action is blocked. Of course, there are families of problems for which that is not possible, but I am not sure how to characterize such problems. \n\n# Novelty\n\nNovelty is limited, for the reason expressed above.\n\n# Scholarship\n\n[1] Weld, D.

There seems to be a critical issue with the proposed method, which is that the strategic link score seems to fail whenever there exists more than one possible future pay-offs.\n  - To give a concrete example, consider a GridWorld environment similar to that in Figure 3a. But now, instead of having a single door, there are two neighboring doors unlocked by the same key leading to the shortcut. Now, if we block one of the doors, the agent can still access the other door, so picking up the key is still part of the optimal strategy. Then, the probability of picking up the key is not decreased, and the strategic link score is 0, failing to connect the action of picking up keys to either of the future doors. \n  - Then if we were to perform strategy-aware recommendation in this setting, it is possible for the agent to adopt the recommendation of picking up the key without adopting the actions of opening doors, causing a failure similar to pick-and-choose.\n  - Whenever the future pay-off of a set-up can be realized in more than one way, the strategic link score fails to link the set-up to future pay-offs. This is because the score can only handle one-to-one correspondence of set-up and pay-off, and is incapable of linking a set-up to a combination of parallel/independent pay-offs.\n2. The strategic link score seems to be limited to small tabular environments.\n  - Assuming access to a planner (e.g., an RL algorithm) that returns a policy given an environment, to compute the strategic link score, you first use the the planner to return a policy, which is then used to generate a trajectory that is most likely under the returned policy. Then, for every state-action pair $(s, a)$ in the trajectory, you re-solve the environment while forbidding $(s, a)$ from being chosen by the policy. Then, the complexity of the method is $O(TP)$, where $T$ is the length of the trajectory, and $P$ is the complexity for the planner to solve the environment. In RL, for example, you would need to run an RL algorithm to solve MDPs $T$ times.\n  - Such computation seems intractable for large MDPs that's costly to solve, and MDPs that have a long/infinite horizon. \n  - Also, can the authors comment on the method's application on continuous state or action spaces? Is there a way to forbid an action in a continuous action space?\n3. In relation to the above weakness, limitations is under-discussed in the paper. \n4.

The paper writes: \"This is by definition of link scores; every decision is strategically linked to itself with a score one.\" However, by Eq. 4, isn't the link score of a state-action pair $(s, a)$ to itself $\\pi(a | s) - 0 = \\pi(a | s)$?

A link score $𝑆_{𝑠,𝑎→\\tilde{s},\\tilde{𝑎}}$ measures how much the policy’s probability of taking an earlier “setup” action $(𝑠, 𝑎)$ drops if a later “payoff” action $(\\tilde{s},\\tilde{𝑎})$ is made unavailable. Intuitively: “Would the agent still bother doing step 1 if it couldn’t later do step 2?” \n\nThe paper argues this reveals strategic dependencies between actions, in a way that reward attribution / value explanations don’t. The paper (1) visualizes these links to interpret behavior in GridWorlds, chess, and traffic and (2) uses them to build “strategy-aware decision support,” where instead of recommending individual actions to a human operator, the system recommends bundles of linked actions so that partial compliance is less dangerous.

Clear, appealing problem statement.\nThe paper frames a real gap: existing explanations in RL mostly tell me why an action is “good long-term,” but not “this action is only worthwhile if we’ll later do that other action.” The authors focus on action-action contingency, which is intuitive to humans (“I grabbed the key only because I planned to open the door”). This is a crisp interpretability goal.\n\n### 2. Actionable downstream use.\nThe decision-support angle is compelling. It’s not just interpretability for storytelling; the paper operationalizes it by grouping linked actions into bundles and shows that this “strategy-aware” interface can improve worst-case outcomes when a human only partially follows the agent’s advice, especially in environments with fragile multi-step maneuvers (Shortcuts), and at least does not hurt in a clinically flavored hypotension scenario.\n\n### 3. Breadth of domains.\nThe method is demonstrated in (i) toy GridWorlds with keys and doors, (ii) a structured traffic network, (iii) a chess sequence with castling and follow-up play, (iv) a simplified ICU hypotension management setup. That breadth helps argue generality and shows the method isn't tied to a single planner or reward function."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "### 1. Novelty vs existing ideas is under-defended.\nI am not fully convinced (yet) that “strategic link score” is fundamentally distinct from prior notions like (i) causal influence of future constraints on earlier policy choices, (ii) credit assignment / Q-value sensitivity, (iii) options / skills / subgoal discovery. One might say: “You’re just measuring how much I stop wanting setup action A if payoff action B is impossible,” which sounds like standard counterfactual policy sensitivity. The paper needs a sharper, explicit contrast with causal RL explanations and hierarchical RL. Right now, that contrast is mostly implicit and could be challenged. \n\n### 2. Scalability / practicality.\nComputing the link score requires re-planning under counterfactual interventions that forbid specific future actions at specific future states. That’s cheap in tabular / toy planners and in the softmax-over-Stockfish construction, but it’s unclear how this scales to high-dimensional continuous-control agents or giant neural policies without a fast differentiable planner. There is no complexity analysis, runtime table, or approximation method.\n\n### 3. Validation is mostly qualitative.\nEvidence that high link scores correspond to “true strategy” is presented as visual heatmaps (e.g. keys↔doors, shortcut pre-commitment, chess piece mobilization) and narrative interpretation. There’s no quantitative benchmark like precision/recall of discovered links against ground-truth enabling relations in GridWorld / Shortcuts, no human annotation study (“does this look like a setup-payoff pair?”), and no false-positive / false-negative analysis. That leaves room for the criticism that this is anecdotal. \n\n### 4. Chess experiment credibility.\nThe chess case study may look less impressive to experts, because the “policy” is generated by softmaxing Stockfish evals over legal moves rather than reading Stockfish’s true multi-ply principal variation. So it is not obvious that it is revealing latent plans; it might just be reconstructing obvious tactical follow-ups visible from engine eval deltas."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Positioning / novelty. How is the strategic link score not just causal influence / Q-value sensitivity / option precondition discovery? Can you provide (a) a small formal example where traditional credit assignment says two actions are related but your link is zero, and vice versa, and (b) a concise statement of what is genuinely new?\n\n2. Computational tractability. What is the computational complexity of computing all pairwise link scores along a trajectory of length $T$? How many re-plans do you need, and how does this behave for large neural policies where replanning is nontrivial? Do you have an approximation approach (e.g. masking logits in a learned policy network instead of full replan)?\n\n3. Quantitative evaluation. Can you report precision/recall or AUROC for recovering “true” enabling relations (e.g. key→door, shortcut-setup→shortcut-payoff) vs baselines such as (i) temporal proximity, (ii) pure co-occurrence frequency, or (iii) reward-drop ablations? This would turn your qualitative figures into measurable impact.\n\n4. Robustness / false positives. Does a high link score always imply that the setup action is useless without the payoff, or can it also just mean that disabling the payoff collapsed a whole profitable branch of future behaviors that share structure with that payoff? In other words: how specific is S? Are there systematic false positives?\n\n5. Clinical external validity. In Hypotension, the “reward” is a shaped physiological stability score rather than actual patient-centered outcomes, and the human decision-maker is simulated by randomly dropping some actions from the agent’s bundle. How confident are you that this result will generalize to (a) real ICU objectives like mortality and (b) real clinician partial adoption patterns (e.g. “I’ll titrate fluids but I won’t start pressors yet”)? Can you discuss limitations here explicitly, so readers don’t overinterpret?\n\n6. Black-box setting. Section 6 is very interesting. Under what assumptions does the IRL-based reconstruction of strategic links match the ground-truth planner’s links (e.g. identifiability or coverage assumptions)? Right now Fig. 12 suggests performance can improve with more stochastic behavior, but this is only briefly described.
