Classical optimal transport (OT) distances, including Wasserstein and sliced Wasserstein, are sensitive to rotations and reflections, while Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) is invariant to isometries but computationally prohibitive for large datasets. We introduce Rigid-Invariant Sliced Wasserstein via Independent Embeddings (RISWIE), a scalable pseudometric that combines the invariance of NP-hard approaches with the efficiency of projection-based OT. RISWIE utilizes data-adaptive bases and matches optimal signed permutations along axes according to distributional similarity to achieve rigid invariance with near-linear complexity in the sample size. We prove bounds relating RISWIE to GW in the Gaussian case and empirically demonstrate dimension-independent statistical stability. Our experiments on cellular imaging and 3D human meshes demonstrate that RISWIE outperforms GW in clustering tasks and discriminative capability while significantly reducing runtime.", "tldr": "a rigid invariant distance for shape registration via independent sliced Wasserstein, with promising empirical performance and scalable computational cost", "keywords": ["optimal transport", "Wasserstein", "geometric embedding", "pseudometric", "PCA"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/07198bd941d138a5d248ae69e7ea68bcd2ef9e50.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/312fab0a2c4e1562461bc32c44600051ddc7c770.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The classic optimal transport (OT) problem and its computationally efficient variant, the sliced OT version, are known to be non-invariant with respect to isometries in feature space.
