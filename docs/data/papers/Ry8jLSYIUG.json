Such plateauing progress raises the question: how far are we from the fundamental limits of image watermarking? To this end, we present analysis that establishes upper bounds on the message-carrying capacity of images under PSNR and linear robustness constraints. Our results indicate theoretical capacities are orders of magnitude larger than what current models achieve. Our experiments show this gap between theoretical and empirical performance persist, even in minimal and amenable to analysis setups.\nThis suggests a fundamental problem. As a proof that larger capacities are indeed possible, we train ChunkySeal, a scaled-up version of VideoSeal, which has 4x larger capacity, i.e.,  1024 bits, all while preserving image quality and robustness. These findings demonstrate modern methods have not yet saturated watermarking capacity, and that significant opportunities for architectural innovation and training strategies remain.", "tldr": "Our theoretical bounds show watermarks can encode orders of magnitude more bits than they currently do.

While we have answered each reviewer’s comments individually, we would like to summarize the main questions and updates to the manuscripts.\n\nWe noticed a mistake in the ChunkySeal model size in the original manuscript which we have now fixed. The reported values were for a smaller 512 bit model. We have now updated them to the actual values for the 1024 bit model: 1022.7M parameters for the embedder and 773.7M for the extractor. We apologize for this oversight.\n\nWith regard to the model size, Reviewers GG8c and 851W expressed doubt that scaling watermarking models is a sustainable approach. Prior to us training ChunkySeal it was far from obvious that it is even possible to embed 1024 bits with such high quality and robustness. As such, scaling serves the purpose of scoping what is feasible. But we absolutely agree with the reviewers: practically usable models would need to stay small. This is one of the main messages that we want to communicate with this paper. We have shown through extensive experiments that the culprit is most likely the architectures that we tend to use and we offer a set of sanity-checks for next-gen watermarking models to achieve high performance without excessive scaling.\n\nReviewer GG8c was concerned with the depth of our literature review on information-theoretic methods and us not referencing a prior steganography method. We added that method and significantly expanded our extended literature review appendix significantly.\n\nReviewer Rj44 was curious to see evaluations on more advanced attacks. As such, we ran additional experiments on emoji overlays, meme text, text overlay and combined augmentations.\n\nReviewer 851W had several clarification questions about our theoretical results which we have further elucidated."}}, "id": "DdkdGkdyev", "forum": "Ry8jLSYIUG", "replyto": "Ry8jLSYIUG", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1493/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1493/Authors"], "number": 6, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1493/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763722406088, "cdate": 1763722406088, "tmdate": 1763722406088, "mdate": 1763722406088, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
