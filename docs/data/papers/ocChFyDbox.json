While effective, this design introduces substantial computational overhead in attention layers.\nTo mitigate this drawback, we present an efficient text-based image editing method called TokenDrop by dropping source tokens partially, where the selection of tokens to drop is adaptively guided by difference between the source and the clean estimate.\nImportantly, by reformulating the flow ODE as a latent optimization problem, we can reflect information of dropped tokens to the solution of regularized optimization. Thanks to the closed form solution, this optimization does not introduce additional computational cost.\nAcross FluxKontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, our training-free method achieves an average 22.4\\% improvement in inference speed on PIEBench, while better preserving non-edited regions.

The key idea rests on the assumption that image editing typically modifies only a small subset of visual tokens corresponding to localized semantic changes; thus, only the informative tokens should be preserved while redundant ones can be pruned. Technically, TokenDrop formulates the pruning process as a latent optimization problem, adding a time-varying regularization term to the flow ODE that enforces consistency with the source image at the locations of dropped tokens. This is adaptively guided by a mask computed from the difference between the source image and the predicted clean edit.

Unlike naive token dropping that sacrifices consistency, its adaptive masking (guided by clean estimate-source differences) and flow ODE reformulation effectively avoid non-edited region distortion, filling the gap between efficiency and consistency in existing methods.\n2. **Strong Theoretical Foundation with Clear Mathematical Formalization**: The method rigorously reformulates the flow ODE as a latent optimization problem with a closed-form solution for the regularization term. Propositions on random mask convergence and trajectory error bounds provide solid theoretical support for adaptive masking and regularization, enhancing the credibility of the framework’s design logic.\n3. **Comprehensive Ablation Studies Validate Component Efficacy**: Ablation experiments systematically verify the necessity of key components—source consistency regularization, adaptive masking, and Gaussian blur preprocessing for masks. By comparing variants without these components, the study clearly demonstrates how each module contributes to balancing speed and consistency, strengthening the persuasiveness of the method.\n4. **Good Compatibility and Practicality**: As a training-free post-hoc optimization strategy, TokenDrop can be easily integrated into existing transformer-based flow models (e.g., Flux Kontext, Qwen-Image-Edit) without modifying model architectures or retraining. This compatibility, combined with its efficiency gains that scale with resolution, makes it highly applicable to real-world high-resolution editing scenarios.\n5. **Rigorous Experimental Validation with Diverse Metrics**: Experiments cover multiple benchmarks (PIEBench, GEdit-Bench) and evaluation dimensions (quantitative metrics like PSNR/LPIPS, human preference studies).

The threshold-tuning process relies on manual adjustment, lacking an adaptive mechanism, which may hinder its usability in practical deployment.\n3. **Incomplete Comparison with State-of-the-Art Efficiency Methods**: The paper only compares TokenDrop with naive random token dropping and full-token baselines, but omits comparisons with other advanced efficiency-optimized editing methods.
