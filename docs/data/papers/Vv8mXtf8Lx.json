There are several emerging theories of LLM performance, among them that LLMs lack world modeling ability, that they have an undesirable bias towards an autoregressive prior, and that they struggle on more novel problems. The existing literature on LLM input novelty has focused on tasks of relatively high complexity, studying perturbations of canonical but complex problems. In this paper, we attempt to minimize complexity in order to isolate novelty as a factor in LLM underperformance and investigate the power of in-context-learning. To this end, we consider an extremely simple domain: next token prediction on simple language tasks. The twist is that these language tasks are wholly unseen, as they are randomly drawn from a large, parsimoniously defined set of languages arising from simple grammar rules. This experimental setup allows us to evaluate ICL independently of models' parametric knowledge. We find that LLMs uniformly underperform n-gram models on this task, both when used as next token predictors and in chain-of-thought.", "tldr": "To explore the effect of task novelty on LLM performance in the absence of other factors, we evaluate LLMs on simple language tasks involving randomly sampled regular languages, and find that LLM in-context learning underperforms simple ngram models.", "keywords": ["large language models", "evaluation", "regular languages", "benchmarks"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ae833bbfbff87d732cf8a03b50261d8f8afe24e5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper evaluates the in-context learning (ICL) capability of large language models (LLMs) on tasks pertaining to regular languages recognized by 3-state deterministic finite automata (DFAs).

The novelty of the findings in this paper is rather limited and does not justify the claims made in Section 1 (contributions). In particular, the authors claim that they introduce an LLM ICL benchmark for novel tasks using the regular languages, but do not justify the motivation for such a new benchmark when compared to existing works, such as RegBench in [1]. Also, no experiment/result discusses the effects of RLHF on the ICL performance. I would suggest a rephrasing of the claims to avoid such confusion.\n\n2. The transductive task can also be treated as a symbolic reasoning task without associating any language with it. The task considered in this paper is to check if there is an even number of a's\" in the string or not. Similar character counting tasks have been explored in [2] as well (which can be treated as a variant of the prompt where the task is revealed in the instruction). To this end, I believe that the experiments in this work are rather incremental and lack a strong motivation. \n\nI am willing to engage in a discussion and better understand the author's perspective on this matter. Furthermore, since an LLM has to be trained on multi-lingual data for solving multi-lingual tasks, it is evident in the literature that it is not learning a general theory of language. Also, because the transductive tasks can be framed as symbolic reasoning tasks, I am not convinced of the importance of the current results and the importance of framing such tasks as \"random language tasks\".\n\n[1] Akyürek, Ekin, et al. \"In-Context Language Learning: Architectures and Algorithms.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

What the authors show is a clear existence of a problem which can be templated within the language domain on which LLMs struggle. However, a discussion along the lines of *no free lunch* would have been quite helpful, in fact it is not unbelievable that such models would struggle on a lot of language-based tasks which are, in some sense, not well encapsulated within their pre-training methodology. The benefit of ICL is not that they can solve *all* possible problems but that they can solve a number of novel problems that are of interest to us. In fact, if one was to think of ICL as a learning mechanism one can come up with tasks where a general learner like SGD would fail; the benefit of SGD (or ICL) is that it is just generally good at tasks of interest to us.\n- There was a lack of analysis into task complexity, in particular from the draft we know that LLMs struggle with regular languages in-context and we also know that in general language tasks they have shown tremendous progress. It would have been nice to see some analysis on how such models behave going from Type 3 to Type 0 languages, and also within Type 3 language going to a small state DFA to a larger state DFA.\n- Given that there are no consistent trends between model size and performance, whether it be across or within a model family, it suggests that the phenomena the authors are seeing is a consequence of just the evaluation task being quite out-of-distribution from the training regime. The lack of trends between Basic and CoT prompting, among other variants, also reinforces this hypothesis. In light of this, I would appreciate if the authors could comment on the downstream usefulness of their finding, except highlighting just the existence of a task on which LLMs fail?"}, "questions": {"value": "- LLMs are in general somewhat sensitive to how the prompts are formalized as well as the overall template in which observations are provided.

Mainly, the n-gram baselines achieve over 90% accuracy, indicating that simple pattern copying can result in a near-perfect performance on this task, without any knowledge of the grammar structure. Isn't this a weakness of this benchmark for assessing the model's capability in capturing \"world model\"?\n\n2. **Number of in-context examples**: It may be the case that LLMs can learn the task in-context, but are not sample efficient. If so, providing only a few in-context examples might underestimate their ability to pick up the underlying transition patterns. \n\n    Figure 5, which explores the impact of increasing the number of examples, partially addresses this. However, since LLM performance improves much more sharply than the n-gram baseline as the number of examples grows, I wonder whether LLMs could eventually catch up with enough in-context data. \n\n3. **Novelty of the completions**: Other than generating a valid output/completion, another performance metric for uncovering the ICL mechanism is to check the novelty of the generated outputs themselves: When a model produces a correct completion, is it simply copying a pattern present in the in-context examples, or is it generating a new suffix consistent with the underlying grammar? \n\n    One possible diagnostic would be to compare the valid LLM completions with those pattern(s) matched by the n-gram model to check whether the LLM is reproducing existing context patterns or generating genuinely new suffixes that reflect partial inferred structure (partial, since the performance is not perfect).\n\n4. **Line 478**: ``We believe our results suggest that LLMs have learned individual models of particular languages, but not a general theory of language.'' Could you clarify this statement? What does it mean that LLMs “have learned individual models of particular languages,” and how is this conclusion supported by the presented results?\n\n5. **Minor**: Could you clarify the *common-suffix* baseline?
