Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can mitigate this, existing retrieval methods are caught in a fundamental granularity trap: query-guided search leads to wasteful redundancy, while clue-guided traversal struggles with contextual reasoning in multi-hop scenarios.\nTo address these limitations, we propose Guidance-Graph-guided Knowledge Exploration (GG-Explore), a novel framework that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries and structured knowledge retrieval. This Guidance Graph acts as a lightweight semantic blueprint, abstracting the structure of potential answers to constrain the search space without sacrificing contextual breadth.\nLeveraging this graph, GG-Explore employs a hybrid pruning strategy, combining a model-free Structural Alignment that filters candidates using graph constraints with a Context-Aware Semantic Alignment module that refines the results by enforcing semantic consistency.\nExtensive experiments show our method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating practical value.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["knowledge graph", "LLM", "guidance graph", "question answering"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/03ef482239eda8adc35deb9b50a19bbfb7129a49.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9d933cbafb6f75c5fdf2ab1f2ad6edb4b05c4370.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the challenge of granularity mismatch in KG-based question answering, where natural language queries provide high-level semantic cues while KG exploration requires precise structural navigation. The authors propose GG-Explore, a two-stage framework that first constructs a Guidance Graph — a lightweight, query-specific semantic graph that extracts specific and generic keywords and encodes them as a structured reasoning blueprint — and then performs guided KG traversal via a combination of structural alignment (fast pruning based on graph constraints) and context-aware semantic alignment using LLM judgment. This approach explicitly bridges semantic intent and KG structure, reducing redundant exploration and improving multi-hop reasoning efficiency on WebQSP, CWQ, and a large agricultural KG, outperforming baselines such as PoG and FiSKE, and enabling small LLMs to match or surpass GPT-3.5 in complex KG navigation tasks."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. Clear problem formulation — The paper clearly identifies the gap between semantic query interpretation and structural KG traversal and motivates the need for an intermediate reasoning representation rather than direct retrieval.\n2. Guidance Graph as a structured semantic scaffold — Introducing a query-specific semantic graph as a blueprint before KG exploration is a neat idea that balances flexibility (LLM reasoning) and precision (structured navigation), improving interpretability.\n3. Effective two-stage alignment mechanism — The combination of structural pruning followed by context-aware semantic filtering provides a principled way to reduce KG search space while preserving answer coverage, rather than relying on purely semantic matching.\n4. Lightweight yet effective implementation — The method does not require large LLMs or heavy graph neural modules, yet achieves notable improvements, showing that guidance and structure can outperform raw model scale.\n5. Strong empirical results on both standard KG QA benchmarks and a large real-world agricultural KG, with particularly strong gains on multi-hop tasks, demonstrating robustness beyond toy settings."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Novelty is somewhat incremental. While the paper positions Guidance Graph as a new semantic-structural bridge, many prior works utilize intermediate graph-like cues for KG traversal. The distinction between those “cue graphs” and the proposed Guidance Graph is not sharply articulated, making the conceptual contribution appear more like a refined engineering pipeline than a fundamentally new formulation.\n2. Pipeline complexity is relatively high. The full system involves keyword typing, semantic blueprint construction, structural pruning, semantic filtering, and multi-step KG search, which makes the approach heavyweight compared to more elegant end-to-end retriever–LLM paradigms. The paper does not show whether all components are necessary or whether a simpler guidance signal could achieve similar gains.\n3. Generalization beyond curated KG datasets is unclear. The method requires structured KG traversal under strict graph constraints, but it is not evaluated on open-domain, incomplete, or noisy graphs, where structural guidance may be brittle or misaligned with real graph topology.\n4. Efficiency vs. complexity trade-off is under-discussed. The structured pruning may reduce KG expansion cost, but the overhead of constructing Guidance Graph + LLM semantic alignment steps may offset the gains, especially in large-scale industrial KG settings. No clear computational cost breakdown is provided.\n5. Limited discussion of failure modes / robustness. If the Guidance Graph extracted by LLM is partially wrong or incomplete, it is unclear whether the system recovers or gets stuck due to hard structural filtering—a potential failure mode not analyzed in the experiments."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "6VUdF8jISi", "forum": "vm8TSA37Na", "replyto": "vm8TSA37Na", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23056/Reviewer_3mVo"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23056/Reviewer_3mVo"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23056/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760558921165, "cdate": 1760558921165, "tmdate": 1762942493527, "mdate": 1762942493527, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "An LLM-based KGQA method is proposed.

The evaluation also needs to be enriched with a broader range of KGs. Freebase, as a Web knowledge base, already has well-equipped ontologies, making the work less compelling.
