These priors represent structural cues about plausible future trajectories and are fused with the current input’s representation via a lightweight gated module. The design reframes forecasting from a purely extrapolative problem into an interpolation-like one, using approximate structural knowledge from correlated historical patterns to stabilize predictions.\nEmpirical results on six datasets (ETTh1/2, ETTm1/2, Exchange, and ILI) with three backbones (DLinear, TimesNet, PatchTST) show consistent improvements in MSE/MAE, particularly for lightweight models (e.g., DLinear).

The method’s simplicity and plug-and-play nature increase its potential impact—especially since it can attach to diverse backbones with negligible overhead.\n\n- The ratio-style operator ($R = (F-H)/(H+\\epsilon,\\text{sign}(H))$) is clearly defined, and the retrieval and softmax-weighted fusion mechanisms are mathematically specified.\n\n\n- The Lipschitz interpolation theorem is formally derived in Appendix A and conceptually motivates the approach.
