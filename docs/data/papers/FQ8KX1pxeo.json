Binarization represents the most extreme form of quantization, yet binarized models still contain redundancy that can be further removed. Pruning provides a natural way to eliminate such redundancy, but naïve combination with binarization often results in severe performance degradation. In this paper, we propose Progressive Binarization with Semi-Structured Pruning (PBS$^2$P), a novel post-training framework that seamlessly integrates binarization and semi-structured pruning. We first propose Stepwise semi-structured Pruning with Binarization Optimization (SPBO), which progressively introduces sparsity while optimizing binarization parameters to jointly reduce pruning and quantization error, yielding more stable and accurate compression. Additionally, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Search (CFS) that first allocates pruning ratios and then refines element selection, further enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families show that PBS$^2$P consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) binary post-training quantization methods in both perplexity and downstream accuracy. We will release all the code and models.", "tldr": "PBS$^2$P enables accurate sub-1-bit LLMs via seamless integration of semi-structured pruning and binarization.", "keywords": ["LLM", "Binarization", "Pruning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/810d21fed7548a13bf0d91fe0266c54c1cfb9dec.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/0d3e3b2f2041fd163a4d44c1eae745cc42103bc8.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a pipeline for jointly applying 1-bit quantization and semi-structured pruning to Large Language Models (LLMs). The method is built upon a layer-wise closed-form solution for 1-bit quantization, governed by two control parameters, which minimizes the reconstruction error under the Frobenius norm. For pruning, a global strategy assigns layer-specific sparsity ratios based on inter-layer similarity, and the Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) framework is used to select the weights for removal. A key aspect of the pipeline is the iterative update of the quantization parameters after each pruning step to maintain accuracy. The constituent techniques are established, the key contribution lies in the integration of these methods into an end-to-end pipeline.  However, given that SparseGPT also supports joint quantization and semi-structured pruning using the OBS framework, the similarities between the two methods should be explicitly clarified.

The methodological description lacks clarity in key areas, such as the handling of activation flow during compression (independent vs. sequential) and the specific role of hyperparameters like the block size. The technical foundation is questioned, particularly the choice of the cosine similarity metric without a clear strategy for handling negative values or empirical validation of its distribution. The experimental validation is limited in scope, relying heavily on WikiText2 and older model families like LLaMA, while omitting stronger recent baselines and a thorough comparison to the closely related SparseGPT. Finally, the paper would benefit from a discussion of the method's applicability to broader architectures like MoE and diffusion models."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Regarding the formulation in Equation 2, it appears the compression objective for a linear layer uses the original, unmodified activations. Could you clarify the following? (a) Is each linear layer's compression treated as an independent objective, using the original network's activations? (b) Or is the compression applied sequentially, where the input to a layer comes from the already compressedprevious layer?\n\n2. You use cosine similarity, which ranges from [-1, 1], to gauge layer importance. Could you please clarify how your algorithm handles cases where the cosine similarity is zero or negative? The subsequent use of a reciprocal (i.e., 1/similarity) in your global pruning ratio assignment would be undefined or invert the intended importance ranking in such scenarios. Was this encountered in practice, and if so, how was it addressed?\n\n3. Could you show some empirical results of the cosine similarity values computed for the layers of a model (e.g., Llama-2 7B)?\n\n4. The results (Tables 1 and 2) indicate the use of a block size of 128. Could you please clarify the role of this parameter in your method? Specifically, is this block size exclusively for the 1-bit quantization process?\n\n5. The experimental evaluation currently reports perplexity results primarily on WikiText2. To more thoroughly and fairly assess the generalizability of the proposed method, it would be beneficial to follow the common practice established by your cited baselines (e.g., GPTQ, BiLLM). Could you please include perplexity results on additional standard datasets, such as PTB and C4?\n\n6. The experimental validation is conducted on established model families like LLaMA (1-3) and OPT. To further demonstrate the relevance and effectiveness of the method, it would be valuable to include results on more recent and widely-used models, such as the Qwen series.\n\n7. The method is presented in the context of standard dense transformer-based LLMs. Could you comment on its potential adaptability to other important model classes (e.g., MoE models, diffusion models)?\n\n8. From a general perspective, the goal of jointly performing quantization and pruning is also a key feature of the SparseGPT [1] framework. Specifically, SparseGPT supports various quantization bit-widths alongside semi-structured pruning, and similarly utilizes the OBS framework for weight selection and error minimization. Given these high-level similarities, could you please provide a more detailed discussion of the fundamental differences between your method and SparseGPT?\n\n9. The experimental comparisons would be strengthened by including recent state-of-the-art methods that support extreme low-bit quantization of LLMs, such as ​​OmniQuant [2]​​ and ​​ParetoQ [3]​​.\n\n10. The paper reports computational savings based on the latency of a single matrix multiplication operation. However, in real-world deployment, end-to-end inference time, which includes I/O overhead, memory access patterns, and other system-level bottlenecks, is a more meaningful metric for evaluating efficiency. Could you please provide measurements of the end-to-end inference latency (e.g., tokens/second) for a complete forward pass on a standard benchmark?\n\n[1] Frantar, Elias, and Dan Alistarh. \"Sparsegpt: Massive language models can be accurately pruned in one-shot.\" International conference on machine learning.
