If that is the claim, the evaluation seems inadequate, since there are no comparisons to standard UQ baselines such as heteroscedastic neural networks [5], ensembles [6], dropout-based Bayesian approximations [2], or fully Bayesian neural networks [1].  \n   If instead the true contribution is a *new analytic Gaussian propagation approximation*, then the chosen baselines (linearization, mean-field, unscented transform) are more reasonable, but the framing should be explicit about this narrower scope.  \n   As written, the paper makes claims about introducing a novel UQ method, while in practice it only proposes a new way of propagating Gaussian input distributions through a network. Moreover, all reported baselines are themselves approximation schemes of this propagation task, rather than established UQ methods, which makes the positioning and evaluation misaligned.\n\n\n2. **Missing ground-truth baseline** A clear benchmark should be included, a simple Monte Carlo sampling: draw many samples from the Gaussian input distribution, run them through the network, and empirically compute the output mean and covariance. This baseline is straightforward, works with any activation, and—given enough samples—provides a gold standard approximation. While more costly due to multiple forward passes, it would contextualize the claimed accuracy improvements of the proposed analytic method. Its absence makes it difficult to judge whether the gains are practically meaningful compared to this simple and applicable approach.\n\n3. **Computational cost considerations**  \n   The method scales as \\(O(n^3)\\) in layer width (due to covariance propagation), as noted by the authors, similar to linearization methods but higher than a single forward pass (\\(O(n^2)\\)). While cheaper than Monte Carlo with many samples (\\(O(Mn^2)\\)), the trade-off is unclear in practice. Runtime comparisons against Monte Carlo sampling vs the proposed method would clarify the actual efficiency benefits.  \n\n4. **Limited scope of experiments**  \n   - Real datasets are small (≤20k samples, ≤95 features).  \n   - Networks are shallow (≤3 layers, width ≤200).  \n   - Evaluations are therefore small for modern NNs, not representative of modern deep learning architectures (e.g., ResNets, Transformers).  \n\n5. **Narrow focus on input Gaussian uncertainty**  \nThe method appears to model only *aleatoric* uncertainty, while ignoring *epistemic* uncertainty. It is unclear why a practitioner would choose this approach over standard aleatoric uncertainty-aware models—such as heteroscedastic neural networks [5]—where the network learns to predict both the mean and the variance (as opposed to only the mean in standard regression tasks).\n\n\n\n6. **Restrictive activations**  \n   Exact formulas are derived only for sine and probit activations, which are rarely used in modern practice compared to ReLU or GELU. This strongly limits applicability.\n\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n[1] Blundell, C., Cornebise, J., Kavukcuoglu, K., & Wierstra, D.
