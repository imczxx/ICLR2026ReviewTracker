Traditional fairness frameworks become impractical in such cases due to severe data sparsity and computational explosion.\n\nTo overcome these issues, the authors propose a new notion called subgroup-subset fairness, which ensures fairness across sufficiently large and socially meaningful subgroups while maintaining fairness for each attribute. They formalize this idea using the supremum Integral Probability Metric (supIPM) to measure distributional disparities and derive a computationally efficient surrogate formulation.\n\nBased on this, they introduce the Doubly Regressing Adversarial learning for Fairness (DRAF) algorithm, which enforces subgroup-subset fairness using only a single discriminator, avoiding the exponential cost of prior methods. Theoretical analysis shows that this surrogate metric upper-bounds the original fairness measure, providing guarantees without sacrificing efficiency.\n\nExperiments on benchmark datasets (ADULT, DUTCH, CIVILCOMMENTS, COMMUNITIES) demonstrate that DRAF achieves strong trade-offs between accuracy and fairness, particularly when data are sparse. The method successfully aligns subgroup and marginal fairness, offering both theoretical soundness and practical robustness."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper’s major strength lies in its theoretical innovation coupled with practical feasibility. The authors do not simply modify existing fairness metrics but instead derive a new conceptual layer, which is subgroup-subset fairness. It realistically balances statistical soundness and social relevance. This idea acknowledges that enforcing fairness over all possible intersectional subgroups is statistically impossible, and instead directs fairness efforts toward meaningful, estimable subsets.\n\nAnother strength is the mathematical coherence. The connection between fairness and regression-based measures (through the doubly regressing 𝑅^2) transforms a complex adversarial fairness optimization problem into one that is differentiable and computationally manageable.\n\nFrom an algorithmic standpoint, DRAF’s design is efficient. By requiring only a single discriminator, the method retains adversarial flexibility without the exponential cost typical of subgroup fairness models.\n\nEmpirically, this paper includes multiple datasets with varying degrees of sparsity, showing that the method generalizes well."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "While the theoretical development is solid, the paper’s presentation of empirical limitations could be more transparent. Although DRAF achieves strong results on several datasets, the analysis does not deeply explore why it performs better in certain settings or whether there are trade-offs when subgroup distributions overlap significantly. A more detailed analysis of failure cases would make the argument more comprehensive. For example, when subgroup definitions are noisy or when marginal fairness conflicts with subgroup fairness, how is the performance?\n\nThe paper briefly mentions the threshold parameter γ, which decides which subgroups are treated as “active.” However, this choice will strongly affect the fairness results. A clearer explanation or guideline on how to set γ properly would make the method easier to reproduce and evaluate fairly.\n\nAnother weakness is the limited discussion of the robustness of the DRAF. Since this surrogate replaces the original supIPM measure, it is important to know whether it consistently preserves the relative fairness ranking between models. In other words, if one model is fairer under supIPM, is it guaranteed to remain fairer under DR? The paper does not clarify this point. Without such an analysis, readers cannot be certain that the surrogate behaves reliably in all cases. The authors may provide some consistency conditions or give some counterexamples."}, "questions": {"value": "A natural question concerns how subgroup-subset fairness aligns with broader ethical objectives. Because the algorithm deliberately excludes minimal subgroups to ensure statistical stability, what ethical safeguards ensure that such exclusions do not marginalize vulnerable intersections? Could adaptive weighting schemes or uncertainty-aware selection criteria help mitigate this risk?\n\nAnother question arises from the interaction between marginal and subgroup fairness. The authors show that DRAF aligns these two fairness notions empirically, but it would be interesting to formalize the connection: under what theoretical assumptions does ensuring fairness on selected subgroup-subsets guarantee approximate fairness across all subgroups?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "KP2KuXMjCQ", "forum": "17UDRTRLmp", "replyto": "17UDRTRLmp", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18082/Reviewer_bKec"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18082/Reviewer_bKec"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18082/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761843242102, "cdate": 1761843242102, "tmdate": 1762927860019, "mdate": 1762927860019, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes subgroup-subset fairness (enforce fairness only on sufficiently large subgroups plus all marginals) and an adversarial learner DRAF that optimizes a surrogate of a new fairness measure (supIPM) using a single discriminator; proves a generalization bound and that the surrogate upper-bounds supIPM; evaluates on ADULT, DUTCH, CIVILCOMMENTS, and a sparse COMMUNITIES dataset."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Experiments compare to REG, GerryFair, and a sequential post-processor, but these methods don't seem to get extensively discussed in the related work section, e.g., how the proposed method is different from [1]? Also, for multiple sensitive attributes especially in binary classification, there've also been some other literature around, e.g., [2] on binary classification with DP/EO constraints and [3] on EO with adversarial training fashion.\n2. “Subgroup-subset fairness” depends on the chosen W. Provide coverage guarantees: if all first-/second-order marginals are in W, what bound (if any) follows for full subgroup fairness? It would be beneficial if the authors can justify why some W is chosen while others are not (I'm imagining there could be some implied unfairness for unseen tiny groups).\n3. Datasets. I appreciate the comprehensive results on 4 datasets. However, ADULT is overused (e.g., see [4]); please consider newer tabular suites (ACS/Folktables, HMDA, LawSchool) or at least add some discussion on the limitations of these datasets (e.g., the label threshold for COMMUNITIES dataset).In addition, I feel the tasks for these four datasets are to some degree overlapping and limited, is the proposed method only working for binary classification or binary subgroups? If not, it could be more convicing experimenting on diverse learning tasks.\n4. Scalability. One novel point of this paper is that it avoid the exponentially large dimensions of subgroups. Is there any empirical evidence in terms of running time to support this claim? Or, how's the scalability regarding $|\\mathcal{S}|$? \n\n\n[1] Kearns, Michael, et al. \"Preventing fairness gerrymandering: Auditing and learning for subgroup fairness.\" International conference on machine learning.
