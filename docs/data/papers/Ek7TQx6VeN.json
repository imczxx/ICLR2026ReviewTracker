However, this often entails a more complex optimization problem, particularly when navigating potential conflicts between objectives, leading to solutions with higher memory requirements and computational complexity. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (MOGCSL) framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives from offline sequential data. MOGCSL extends the conventional GCSL method to multi-objective scenarios by redefining goals from one-dimensional scalars to multi-dimensional vectors. It benefits from naturally eliminating the need for complex architectures and optimization constraints. Moreover, MOGCSL effectively filters out uninformative or noisy instances that fail to achieve desirable long-term rewards across multiple objectives. We also introduces a novel goal-selection algorithm for MOGCSL to model and identify \"high\" achievable goals for inference.\n\nWhile MOGCSL is quite general, we focus on its application to the next action prediction problem in commercial-grade recommender systems. In this context, any viable solution needs to be reasonably scalable and also be robust to large amounts of noisy data that is characteristic of this application space. We show that MOGCSL performs admirably on both counts by extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets. Also, analysis and experiments are included to explain its strength in discounting the noisier portions of training data in recommender systems with multiple objectives.", "tldr": "This paper applies goal-conditioned supervised learning to the multi-objective recommendation problem by introducing a new multi-dimensional goal.", "keywords": ["Multi-objective Recommendation", "Goal-conditioned Supervised Learning", "Recommender System"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/24ddfdd4b519101fecb37d98ef394689c34a44bc.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents an innovative approach to improving multi-objective recommendation systems by extending the Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (GCSL) framework to a multi-dimensional goal space.

The model structure introduced in Section 3.2 appears very similar to PRL, with the only difference being the addition of an extra MLP layer. Therefore, the improved performance over previous Shared-Bottom and MMoE models may largely stem from this architectural change (since MOPRL also achieves a good result), which weakens the claimed contribution of the paper.\n\n3.
