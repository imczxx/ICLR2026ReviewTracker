Many efforts, either ML-based or heuristic, have been proposed, which seek to optimize certain business goals e.g. overflow (OF) and wirelength (WL) of generated routes. Notably the recent end-to-end neural routers have shown extreme speed advantages in optimizing wirelength yet they struggle in efficiency to reduce overflow. In fact, a good trade-off between the above two metrics has not been achieved, especially the overall efficiency is pursued, as often only a single metric is optimized in existing ML-based methods. To bridge this gap for more practical industry applications, we propose a flow matching-based router for GR called ParetoRouter, to achieve trade-offs between WL and OF and generate highly connected routes in high speed and quality. In the training phase, two differential metric-oriented routing results are utilized to build the training datasets and are leveraged to design an `Average Flow' between initial pins and final routings. A Pareto sampling method based on the Das-Dennis method is also devised to realize trade-offs between OF and WL in the inference phase. Extensive experimental results show that it achieves SOTA performance on the \\textbf{overflow reduction} with \\textbf{less superfluous routes} across all benchmarks with \\textbf{x5} times speedup over the peer SOTA ML-based method.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Global Routing; VLSI; Multi Objective Optimization; Diffusion Model"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0cef553f41868e0277fad265a4d64d5b788a3b4d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces **ParetoRouter**, a novel machine learning-based global routing (GR) method for VLSI design that explicitly addresses the multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem of minimizing both **wirelength (WL)** and **overflow (OF)**.

Jointly optimizing overflow (OF) and wirelength (WL) is common sense in global routing. Considering that global routing is a classic problem in the EDA area, I don't think this insight could be an important contribution.\n2. The comparison with classic methods is too weak to show the capability of their method. Their mentioned works, e.g., DGR, NTHURouter, and NCTU-GR, are all better global routers than GeoSteiner and FLUTE+ES. Meanwhile, DGR, NTHURouter, and NCTU-GR, all consider overflow and wirelength when formulating and solving the global routing problem. Meanwhile, the results about \"LABYRINTH\" are missing in Table 3 (\"OF\") and Table 4 (all metrics).\n3. The survey of current works has errors. DGR (Li et al. 2024) and (Feng & Feng 2025) are not ML-based methods. DRG formulated the global routing as a continuous optimization problem and solved it using the deep learning toolkit, PyTorch, for automatic differentiation. Meanwhile, the objective in DGR includes congestion and wirelength cost, which should be classified as a multi-objective method. Therefore, the authors listed them with explicitly wrong information in Table 1.\n4. The absence of a crucial ablation study. Only the results \"w/o x_1^{NCTU}\" are listed in Table 5.
