In particular, we give sufficient conditions for identifying average controlled micro direct effect and average natural micro direct effect from summary causal graphs in the presence of hidden confounding.

Building on classical notions of controlled and natural direct effects, the authors introduce average controlled micro direct effects and average natural micro direct effects that capture short-lag causal influences within summary causal graphs. The central theoretical contribution is a set of graphical identification conditions establishing when these micro-level effects can be identified nonparametrically, even in the presence of feedback and latent confounders. The framework thereby generalizes existing identification results for nested counterfactuals to a broader class of temporal or cyclic models.

Ambitious theoretical extension. The paper generalizes classical definitions of controlled and natural direct effects to dynamic and cyclic systems through the “micro” formulation, representing a substantial conceptual step beyond standard acyclic mediation models.\n2. Clear linkage to existing theory. The proposed definitions of average controlled and average natural micro direct effects are faithful extensions of established causal inference concepts (Robins & Greenland, Pearl, Avin et al.) into the time-indexed domain.\n3. Potential impact on causal mediation in feedback systems. By providing graphical identification conditions for micro direct effects in summary causal graphs, the paper opens new directions for mediation analysis in recurrent and continuous-time causal models.\n4. Rigor and completeness. The theoretical development is mathematically precise, and the proofs are carefully structured, offering a thorough and internally consistent foundation for subsequent applied or methodological work.\n5. Generality and scope. The results are formulated abstractly enough to encompass a broad class of dynamic systems, including those with feedback and latent confounding, making the framework widely applicable."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Accessibility and clarity.\nThe paper is technically dense, and the intuition behind the key definitions—especially the natural micro direct effect—is difficult to follow without deep familiarity with classical causal mediation theory. More verbal explanation or illustrative examples would help readers grasp the motivation and implications of the results.\n2. Empirical demonstration.\nSection 6 offers a well-chosen conceptual example in epidemiology that clarifies the kinds of settings where the theorems could apply, but it stops short of a genuine data analysis or simulation. The example illustrates applicability but does not substantively validate the framework empirically.\n3.\tConnection to prior identifiability results.\nWhile the paper references Pearl and Avin et al., it could more clearly articulate how its graphical conditions differ from or extend earlier nonparametric identification results for nested counterfactuals. A concise comparative discussion would help situate the contribution relative to existing theory.\n4.\tScope and assumptions.\nThe identifiability results depend on relatively strong structural assumptions about the summary causal graph, and it remains unclear how often those conditions hold in realistic dynamic data. Some discussion of practical plausibility or examples of compliant systems would be useful.\n5.\tPositioning within broader causal literature.\nThe paper would benefit from a clearer discussion of how “summary causal graphs” relate to other frameworks for representing feedback and temporal structure—such as dynamic SCMs or equilibrium SEMs—to help readers integrate this work into the larger causal-modeling landscape.\n6.\tConclusion and synthesis.\nThe conclusion appropriately reiterates the main contribution—extending identification of micro-level direct effects to cyclic and confounded systems—and connects it to applied domains such as epidemiology. However, after a dense theoretical development, it functions more as a summary than a synthesis. The paper would be stronger if the authors distilled the intuitive meaning of the main theorems and clarified concretely what these new identification results enable beyond prior frameworks (e.g., Avin et al., Pearl). The “future work” paragraph, while interesting, somewhat dilutes the central message by listing multiple directions rather than emphasizing the principal conceptual advance."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Clarification of intuition. The definitions of the average controlled and average natural micro direct effects are mathematically precise but conceptually demanding. Could the authors expand the intuitive explanation—perhaps by adding a small time-indexed causal diagram or a simple dynamic example—to illustrate what these effects represent in a concrete feedback system?\n2. Relationship to classical identification results. The natural micro direct effect appears to generalize nested counterfactual identification results from Pearl (2001) and Avin et al. (2005). Could the authors clarify in what sense their graphical conditions differ from, or strictly extend, those earlier frameworks? For example, do their results reduce to the known back-door or mediation-formula cases when the system is acyclic?\n3. Interpretation of summary causal graphs. How should readers interpret the “summary causal graph” formally relative to dynamic structural causal models (DSCMs) or equilibrium SEMs? Is an SCG a representation of lag-specific causal relationships, or does it correspond to an equilibrium approximation over micro time scales?\n4. Practical identifiability. The paper’s identifiability conditions seem strong. Could the authors comment on their practical plausibility—for instance, in what classes of dynamic systems (linear Gaussian, continuous-time diffusion, etc.) do these conditions typically hold?\n5. Potential empirical validation. Even a small simulation illustrating how the proposed identifiability results could guide estimation would greatly help readers. Do the authors plan to test these ideas empirically, or are there conceptual obstacles that currently prevent such a demonstration?\n6. Notation and constants.
