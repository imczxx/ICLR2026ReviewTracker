The Minimum Path Variance Principle for Accurate and Stable Score-Based Density Ratio Estimation", "abstract": "Score-based methods have emerged as a powerful framework for density ratio estimation (DRE), but they face an important paradox in that, while theoretically path-independent, their practical performance depends critically on the chosen path schedule. \n\tWe resolve this issue by proving that tractable training objectives differ from the ideal, ground-truth objective by a crucial, overlooked term: the path variance of the time score.\n\tTo address this, we propose MinPV-DRE (\\textbf{Min}imum \\textbf{P}ath \\textbf{V}ariance DRE), which directly minimizes this missing objective. \n\tOur key contribution is the derivation of a closed-form expression for the variance, turning an intractable problem into a tractable optimization. \n\tBy parameterizing the path with a flexible Kumaraswamy Mixture Model, our method learns a data-adaptive, low-variance path without heuristic selection. \n\tThis principled optimization of the complete objective yields more accurate and stable estimators, establishing new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.", "tldr": "MinPV-DRE analytically minimizes the path-dependent variance in score-based density ratio estimation, learning stable, accurate trajectories without heuristic path selection.", "keywords": ["Density ratio estimation", "minimum path variance principle", "path optimization", "Kumaraswamy mixture model"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1e4a06d0868bee2562ffeae3693dc5c93270c594.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Score-based approaches for Density Ratio Estimation (DRE) have gained interests in recent literature.

I have read (Choi et al., 2022) and have not come across the terminology of \"sliced time score matching\" in the main text. As far I know, (Choi et al., 2022)  just call their cost function \"time score matching\". Is \"sliced\" a terminology that you are adding? If so, it would be fair to explicitly say so. \n\n---\n\n## **Math Questions**\n\n- **Reweighting.**  \n In the time-score matching loss (Eq 6), do you use a reweighting function as (Choi et al., 2022) do?\n\n- **On Section 4.1.**  \n  Is $\\theta^\\*$ the minimizer of the *empirical* loss, the *population* loss, or neither? Is it simply a fixed parameter value of the time-score model? If it corresponds to the *true data parameter*, then shouldn’t $L_{\\text{TSM}}(\\theta^\\*) = 0$, assuming the neural network can perfectly approximate the true time score?\n\n- **On Section 4.2.**  \n  You parameterize general paths between $p_0$ and $p_1$, but it is unclear how you enforce the boundary conditions. Specifically, how do you ensure that at $t = 1$, we have $p_t = p_1$?\n\n- **Potential inconsistency in Section 4.1.**  \n  My understanding is that:\n  $$\n  \\text{estimation error} \\le e^L \\times L_{\\text{TSM}}(\\theta^\\*) \n  \\le e^L \\times (L_{\\text{STSM}}(\\theta^\\*) + \\text{slack}),\n  $$\n  where $L$ is a Lipschitz constant of the path, and the slack term corresponds to the kinetic energy of the path.\n\n  *Issue #1*. The paper states that “to minimize the final estimation error, one must minimize the ideal score-matching loss.”  \n  I believe this is a **sufficient** but not **necessary** condition, since the ideal score-matching loss only provides an upper bound.  \n  If that upper bound is loose, it may be possible to reduce the estimation error without reducing the ideal score-matching loss.\n\n  *Issue #2*. You aim to minimize the estimation error with respect to the choice of path $p_t$ and therefore propose minimizing its upper bound over paths. However, your analysis focuses only on minimizing the *slack term* (the kinetic energy) while seemingly ignoring the term $L_{\\text{STSM}}(\\theta^\\*)$, which also depends on the choice of path. It is possible, for instance, that a path minimizing the kinetic term actually increases $L_{\\text{STSM}}(\\theta^\\*)$, in which case the upper bound (and the estimation error) may not improve.  \n\n---\n\n## **Missing Reference**\n\nThe authors claim that the literature lacks a theoretical analysis of how the choice of path $p_t$ impacts the estimation error of the density ratio.  \nWhile this remains an open and interesting problem, it would be relevant to cite prior work that provides partial theoretical results in this direction.  \n\nIn particular, **Theorem 4 of [1]** derives an upper bound on the estimation error of the density ratio as a function of the path’s Lipschitz constant—closely related to your Lemma 4.1, with a similar proof structure (see Appendix D.3 of that work).  \nThis reference would be highly appropriate to discuss, as it represents the closest known theoretical result to your contribution.  \n\nAnother reference that is less directly related but might be interesting to the authors is [2]. It also investigates the optimal path for reducing the estimation error of a density ratio using the time score identity, in the specific case when all the densities $p_t$ are parameterized only by their normalizing constant $Z_t$. \n\n[1] Yu et al. *Density Ratio Estimation with Conditional Probability Paths.* ICML 2025.  \n\n[2] Chehab et al.
