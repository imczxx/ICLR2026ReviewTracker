Recent work has sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance, and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6$\\times$ longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models, prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust exploratory behavior.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Model", "Exploration"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e001513c9a558909585f1a06b7eef49a595ff15b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates how Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) training paradigms shape the exploration strategies of Large Language Models (LLMs) when solving Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) tasks, treating the LLMs as meta-bandit agents.\n\nI currently think this paper provides a lot of value to the \"learning to learn\" / \"learning to explore\" community.
