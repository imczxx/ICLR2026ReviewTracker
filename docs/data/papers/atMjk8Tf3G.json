The models are typically trained with a large amount of images or image-text pairs, where the text is extracted from the radiology report of the associated images. \nSuch approaches neglect the rich contextual information available in the patient's Electronic Health Records (EHR), such as vital sign measurements and laboratory test results, which may be highly relevant for some modalities and tasks, such as those involving Chest X-Rays (CXR).  Leveraging additional modalities during pre and/or post-training is not straightforward due to the small-scale of paired multimodal datasets.  In this paper, we propose a new modular alignment strategy that leverages EHR data to enhance quality of representations of a pre-trained CXR image classification model, without requiring training from scratch. In particular, the framework employs a cross-modal learning objective to capture both global and localized interactions between CXR and EHR features. We ran experiments using the largest publicly-available multimodal dataset, specifically MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-IV, to propose a new chest X-ray image classification model denoted as MedCAM.  We evaluated MedCAM on several publicly available datasets. Our empirical findings show that it significantly outperforms a variety of SOTA baselines in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results highlight the benefit of leveraging EHR data and illustrate the potential of modular learning for efficient multimodal model enhancements.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["multimodal learning", "self-supervised learning", "foundation models", "machine learning for health"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ac34570e299a5db9af3e7f1b802458a669aa387e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a framework to align x-ray data with EHR.

The temporal scope of EHR inputs is vaguely defined (“resampled at 2-hour intervals”) without specifying whether future observations relative to the imaging timestamp were excluded. In MIMIC-IV, many physiological measurements (e.g., labs, vitals) are backfilled retrospectively — meaning the EHR embedding could inadvertently encode post-image outcomes such as interventions or ICU status changes. This introduces temporal leakage, undermining the causal interpretability of the learned representations. \n- It's still somewhat unclear how does this alignment actually help by conducting ablation study, e.g. via cross-modal retrieval accuracy, embedding similarity metrics, or attention interpretability. Further, the authors claim the adaptation captures “fine-grained interactions,” yet no visualization or ablation supports this. There’s also no control experiment comparing random EHR pairs or shuffled time windows — so it’s unclear whether the model is learning true cross-modal structure or merely benefiting from regularization.\n- The theory is not systematically studied wrt why it works but merely empirically results. Dual contrastive loss (global/local) is not theoretically innovative.

The manuscript includes no figure illustrating the model architecture or overall framework. \n2. The experimental section is poorly organized. Section 5.1 is titled “Evaluation on the MIMIC-CXR Dataset,” yet Table 2 does not include results for image–text baselines on MIMIC-CXR; those results are instead presented in Table 4. This disjointed presentation hinders direct comparison and impairs readability.\n3. Figure 1 is the only figure in the paper, which is of low quality, difficult to interpret, and conveys minimal information.\n\n**II. Methodology and Experiments**\n\n1. Aside from constructing a new dataset and substituting EHR for textual reports, the paper introduces no clear methodological innovation. The combination of global and local alignment strategies has already been thoroughly explored in prior works such as MGCA[1], GLORIA[2], and Prior[3].\n2. The comparison with image–text models is methodologically inconsistent. The visual encoders of the baseline image–text models are trained from scratch, whereas MedCAM employs a pre-trained encoder. This discrepancy likely explains the observed performance gap: MedCAM significantly outperforms baselines on MIMIC-CXR and NIH but underperforms on CheXpert and VinDr.\n3. The selected image–text baselines are outdated. The most recent cited work is MedCLIP (EMNLP 2022). At a minimum, the paper should include 2–3 stronger, more recent baselines from 2024–2025.\n4. Recent studies such as MedBIND [4] and M3Bind [5] have already explored multimodal alignment involving more than two modalities (e.g., image, text, and EHR simultaneously). The choice to replace text with EHR—rather than integrating all available modalities—requires justification.\n5. The paper lacks any form of qualitative or representational visualization (e.g., t-SNE plots), which would help assess the quality of learned embeddings."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
