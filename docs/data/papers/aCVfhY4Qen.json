While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D scene generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties.\nTo address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to generate physically accurate 3D scenes with high complexity.\nSpecifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. \nMoreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations.\nExperimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scenes for robotic manipulation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Physical Scene Generation"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5394cfd24d74a315b4feb4ea7d4bbfb5b8e4bf05.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a scene generation system for complex 3d scenes that prompts an LLM to produce scene descriptions using a scene predicate domain-specific language.

I think the term scene generation used here is misleading. The paper mostly focuses on “object arrangement” [1] or “layout generation” [2], where the goal is to place objects of similar sizes on a given surface (e.g., a bookshelf or a table). This is implied by all the qualitative examples. In contrast, scene generation usually refers to generating larger and more complex indoor scenes containing objects of various sizes and more diverse object relationships, which is not demonstrated in the experiments. I agree that the paper tackles a challenging problem involving arranging a large number of objects in confined space, but it is different from the indoor scene generation problem that the baselines address. If the authors want to keep using this term and still treat Architect / 3D-Generalist as the main baselines, they should provide more results on indoor scenes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.\n2. LayoutVLM [2] is an important missing baseline. This model uses a similar asset library to specify spatial relations between objects. It would be useful to compare these methods. Unlike PhyScenesis, which only leverages an LLM and a physics simulator to avoid collisions, LayoutVLM prompts a VLM to get initial object positions, which may yield more semantically meaningful results.\n3. The technical contribution is limited. SceneCraft [3] also proposes an agentic framework that generates 3D scenes using an LLM to generate Blender code with a feedback loop. Spatial and physical predicates are also used in LayoutVLM [2]. The design of the spatial and physics solvers here is largely heuristic and feels ad hoc. They seem specifically designed for cluttered scenes with small objects, which may limit applicability to other scenarios like full indoor scene generation or settings with fewer objects.\n4. I appreciate the authors’ effort in building such a complex system to achieve good results. However, it would be better to provide more experiments and details to systematically justify the design choices.
