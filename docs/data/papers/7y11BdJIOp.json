Synthetic EMR generation offers a promising alternative, yet most existing methods merely imitate real records without adhering to rigorous clinical quality principles. To address this, we introduce LLM-CARe, a stage-wise cyclic refinement framework that progressively improves EMR quality through three stages, each targeting a specific granularity: corpus, section and document. At each stage, a Critic, an Adviser, and a Reviser collaborate iteratively to evaluate, provide feedback, and refine the drafts. This structured, multi-stage process produces records that better satisfy clinical quality standards. Experiments show that LLM-CARe significantly enhances EMR quality across all levels compared to strong baselines and yields improved performance on real-world clinical tasks such as diagnosis prediction. Unlike prior work, our method requires no real EMRs for training or prompting, demonstrating the effectiveness of stage-wise, cyclic refinement for generating high-quality, privacy-preserving EMR datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Model", "Synthetic Data Generation", "Electronic Medical Record"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/45bf040539e8deea181f54237279658247b59463.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes LLM-CARe (Critic–Adviser–Reviser Cyclic Refinement), a multi-agent, stage-wise framework for generating high-quality synthetic electronic medical records (EMRs) using large language models without access to real data. The framework operates at three granular levels—corpus, section, and document—each involving cyclic collaboration among three agents: a Critic that evaluates, an Adviser that provides feedback, and a Reviser that updates drafts. The stages sequentially enforce corpus-level distributional realism, section-level content completeness, and document-level logical and clinical consistency. Evaluations on a de-identified dataset of 192k EMRs across 302 disease categories demonstrate that LLM-CARe produces synthetic data of significantly higher intrinsic quality and downstream utility than GAN-based, autoregressive, and direct LLM baselines.

The paper’s structure is fragmented: key definitions, evaluation criteria, and implementation details are scattered across main text and appendices. This hampers readability and makes it difficult to follow the end-to-end methodology. \n2. The five quality dimensions (content completeness, medical correctness, context consistency, demographic typicality, knowledge coverage) are not well defined in the main text. Critical terms — e.g., “major” vs “minor” symptoms — are undefined.Additionally, the paper provides insufficient detail about baseline methods (particularly MedSyn, described in only one sentence )\n3. The introduction claims to address “insufficient coverage of less typical clinical cases,” yet the dataset construction retains only common diagnoses (≥500 records) and explicitly excludes rare conditions. This directly contradicts the motivation presented by the authors and undermines the paper’s central claim.\n4. The clinician validation is small (100 records, 4 clinicians) and the paper reports aggregate clinician–LLM agreement without per-criterion reliability (e.g., per-criterion Cohen’s κ, confusion matrices). Given the paper relies on an LLM judge, stronger human validation and per-criterion calibration are needed.\n5. The corpus-level alignment step matches synthetic data to a reference distribution. The paper never specifies whether 𝑇\\_𝑑  is computed from public statistics, synthetic approximations, or the authors’ real EMR dataset. If it is derived from real EMRs, it contradicts their claim that the generation “requires no real EMRs”. The source and exact construction of this distribution must be stated explicitly.\n6. Aligning synthetic data to a reference distribution derived from real data risks reproducing existing demographic or clinical biases. The paper lacks subgroup/fairness analyses to evaluate whether corpus-level alignment amplifies or mitigates such biases.\n7. The experiments predominantly use a single model family (Qwen) for generation, judging, and downstream evaluation, which risks correlated errors and vendor-specific bias. This open the possibility that performance gains may be partially due to vendor/model-specific bias rather than general methodological benefit.\n8. Missing critical details such as exact sample sizes for each downstream task.\n9. The authors provide no statistics on EMR length, number of sections, or content depth, nor do they compare these properties between synthetic and real EMRs. Without such analysis, claims of realism and practical utility are unsupported.\n10. Medical correctness is assessed via surface-level alignment checks rather than deeper clinical plausibility. The evaluation does not test whether records reflect realistic multi-disease interactions or plausible event chronology."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Please clarify whether the corpus-level reference distributions used for alignment are derived from real EMRs, public statistics, or synthetic approximations.
