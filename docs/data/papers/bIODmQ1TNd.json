Weak Motivation. While the paper argues that performance on offline benchmarks fails to generalize to live websites due to temporal changes in web structures, this claim lacks sufficient empirical evidence. For instance, there is no direct comparison showing how existing methods degrade over time on the same websites, nor quantitative data on the frequency or impact of such changes. This undermines the core motivation, as it's unclear whether the offline-to-online gap is as significant as asserted, potentially overstating the need for LIVEWEB-IE.\n2. Reproducibility Undermined. Live evaluation causes inconsistent results across runs/time windows, breaking fair comparison and replicability. Website states can vary at each evaluation (e.g., due to updates in layout or content), leading to inconsistent results across runs. Different systems or papers might be tested in non-overlapping time windows, making it impossible to ensure fair comparisons.\n3. Expenditure and efficiency in VGS. The multi-stage VGS framework relies heavily on VLMs for visual grounding and pinpointing, which could incur significant computational costs and latency, especially for large-scale scraping. The paper does not discuss efficiency metrics (e.g., inference time or resource usage) or optimizations, making it less practical for real-world deployment compared to simpler HTML-based methods."}, "questions": {"value": "No specific questions.
