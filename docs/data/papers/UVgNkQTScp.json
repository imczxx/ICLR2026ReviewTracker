They offer a solid theoretical foundation for enforcing conservation laws in complex machine learning settings. However, their use so far has been restricted to learning tasks where structural constraints can be satisfied with simple, yet inaccurate, physics representations. In this work, we analyze why existing formulations reduce to typical unconstrained reformulations, circumventing physics recovery, and highlight the necessity of incorporating additive structure pertaining to the governing physics of the system. Based on the theoretical insights we first attain, we proceed to the reformulation of the learning problem to enable data-driven physics recovery and employ conditional Whitney forms to turn a Transformer-based architecture into a structure-preserving reduced-order model. We demonstrate the validity of our theoretical insights and the effectiveness of the subsequent proposed reformulation in a range of advection-diffusion systems of increasing difficulty.

The proposed fix (adding a flux reconstruction loss) is a straightforward application of multi-task learning and does not introduce a new methodological or theoretical framework.\n\n- Superficial Theoretical Contribution: The core theoretical contribution (Propositions 1 and 2), while mathematically correct, is conceptually shallow. It demonstrates that an *unconstrained* flux field $\\hat{f}$ can be computed in a post-hoc manner to satisfy a discrete conservation law for any given $u$ and $s$. However, in the original CWF formulation by Kinch et al., the flux is \\emph{not} unconstrained; rather, it is parametrized by a neural network $\\mathcal{NN}(\\hat{u}; \\phi, z_i)$, whose structure and training are tightly coupled with the learning of the partition of unity. The paper fails to prove that this *coupled, learned* system will inevitably converge to the trivial solutions described in the propositions. It only shows that such solutions *exist*, which is a significantly weaker claim. As a result, the presented ``theoretical insight'' is better characterized as an \\emph{observation} regarding underdetermined linear systems, rather than a rigorous analysis of the CWF learning dynamics. Although two propositions are included on the underdetermined nature of the conservation constraint, these results are elementary from a linear algebra perspective and do not offer new theoretical understanding of the approximation properties or behavior of CWFs.\n\n**Major Conceptual Weakness**\n\n- Solution Lacks Physical Intuition and Rigor: The proposed solution, adding an L2-loss on the flux, reduces a hard physical constraint (the conservation law) to a soft, data-fitting penalty. This undermines the primary motivation of using CWF, which is to provide **guaranteed structure preservation**. The method now relies on the balance of a hyperparameter $\\(\\lambda\\)$ to *approximately* satisfy physics, a common paradigm in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) which the authors implicitly critique. A more principled approach would be to impose structure on the flux network $\\(\\mathcal{NN}\\)$ itself (e.g., enforcing symmetry or other physical properties) to restrict the solution space without sacrificing the hard constraint.\n\n- Insufficient Analysis of Trade-offs: The paper does not adequately address the trade-off between structure preservation and model expressivity. For instance, the flux regularization term may force the model to learn overly smooth or simplistic flux representations, especially in highly nonlinear regimes, a concern only briefly mentioned in Appendix C.\n\n\n**Major Technical Flaw**\n\n - Inconsistent Error Metrics Suggest Fundamental Issues: The reported error metrics in Table 1 reveal a fundamental inconsistency that undermines the technical validity of the results. The distribution errors (e-7 to e-10) and flux errors (e-1 to e+0) differ by 7-10 orders of magnitude, which is mathematically implausible given the physical relationship between these quantities ($f$ contains $\\nabla u$). Until this discrepancy is rigorously explained and validated, the central claim, that the original CWF formulation leads to trivial conservation, rests on unreliable evidence, as the observed effect could be an artifact of the evaluation method or numerical instability rather than a profound physical insight. The authors must demonstrate that their error metrics on their $u$ and $f$ predictions are mathematically consistent and that the massive flux error is not a mere consequence of a poorly conditioned numerical scheme.\n\n- Lack of Meaningful Baselines: The comparison is limited to the regularized vs. unregularized versions of their own model. The work lacks comparisons against strong and relevant baselines, such as a pure data-driven model (e.g., a standard Transformer predicting both $\\(u\\)$ and $\\(f\\)$) or other physics-constrained architectures (e.g., conservative PINNs, finite volume-inspired methods). Without this, it is impossible to gauge the actual benefit of the complex CWF machinery over simpler approaches.\n\n- Toy Problems and Linearity: The experiments are conducted predominantly on linear or weakly nonlinear advection-diffusion problems. The claim of enabling \"physics recovery\" is not sufficiently tested against highly nonlinear or chaotic systems, where the identified problem and proposed solution would face a much greater challenge. There is no evidence that the method scales to 3D, complex geometries, or more challenging PDE systems (e.g., Navier-Stokes, wave equations). This severely limits the claimed generality of the approach.\n\n- Grid Dependency: The method is fundamentally tied to the fixed, underlying \"fine-grained partition of unity.\" The paper does not address or even acknowledge the limitation this imposes. It is unclear how the approach would generalize to synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios where training and test data come from different meshes or geometries, a key selling point of neural operators.\n\n\n**Minor issue**\n\n- Inadequate Discussion of Related Work: The discussion of structure-preserving methods is superficial. It does not engage deeply with the trade-offs between different approaches. For instance, how does the performance and guarantee of this method compare to methods that directly discretize and solve the PDEs in the loss function (e.g., FEM-based variational losses)? The claim that CWFs are the *only* framework that allows this transformation with \"minimal architectural intervention\" is strong but unsupported by a thorough comparison."}, "questions": {"value": "- The propositions assume an unconstrained $\\(\\hat{f}\\)$. However, in practice, \\(\\hat{f}\\) is output by a neural network conditioned on $\\(\\hat{u}\\)$. Can you provide empirical or theoretical evidence that the *coupled learning process* of $\\(W(z;\\theta)\\)$ and $\\(\\mathcal{NN}(\\hat{u}; \\phi, z_i)\\)$ is inherently biased towards the \"trivial\" solutions you construct, rather than just being capable of representing them?\n\n- By relaxing the hard physics constraint to a soft penalty, the method no longer provides exact conservation. How do you reconcile this with the stated goal of \"structure preservation\"? What are the quantitative trade-offs between the flux reconstruction accuracy and the exact satisfaction of the conservation law?\n\n- How does the method compare to other physics-informed or structure-preserving approaches (e.g., conservative PINNs, finite volume networks) in terms of accuracy, stability, and computational cost?
