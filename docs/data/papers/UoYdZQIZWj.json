However, existing MPI models face two major challenges. First, the scarcity of labeled molecule-protein pairs significantly limits model performance, as available datasets capture only a small fraction of biological relevant interactions.\nSecond, most methods rely solely on molecular and protein features, ignoring broader biological context—such as genes, metabolic pathways, and functional annotations—that could provide essential complementary information. To address these limitations, our framework first aggregates diverse biological datasets, including molecular, protein, genes and pathway-level interactions, and then develop an optimal transport-based approach to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled molecule-protein pairs, leveraging the\nunderlying distribution of known interactions to guide label assignment. By treating pseudo-labeling as a mechanism for bridging disparate biological modalities, our approach enables the effective use of heterogeneous data to enhance MPI prediction. We evaluate our framework on multiple MPI datasets including virtual screening tasks and protein retrieval tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracies and zero shot ability across unseen interactions. Beyond MPI prediction, our approach provides a new paradigm for leveraging diverse biological data sources to tackle problems traditionally constrained by single or bi-modal learning, paving the way for future advances in computational biology and drug discovery.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Knowledge graph", "molecule protein interaction", "optimal transport"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5b5cafe4966149000b0d37c52cbbdf00fd7e57c5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In the paper, the authors studied methods for predicting ligand-target binding affinity as link prediction problems.

The pseudo labels are enforced to give overall consistency prediction on the entire unlabelled graph by Optimal Transport and the regularization of the similarity between nodes on the latent spaces.\n\n+ the pseudo-labelled graph together augmented with the edges of the large multimodal knowledge graph is then used to train a final link prediction model\n\nIn order to evaluate the proposed approach the author compared there KGOT method with baseline methods that do not use external information on the DUDe and  LIT-PCBA with leakage removal from the training graphs.
