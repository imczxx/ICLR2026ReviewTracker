Convolutional neural networks face a common challenge: how can relevant features be communicated over longer distances? Our architecture facilitates long-distance communication with Geometric Multigrid Convolution (GMC) blocks, which apply convolutions in parallel to features defined on each scale of a multigrid, and enable communication all the way up and down the hierarchy. We observe two major structural advantages of such a network: First, because each GMC operates on every scale, even early stages can make use of coarse information and receptive field grows rapidly with depth. Second, networks built with this backbone have the freedom to route information between different scales, including in ways not possible for other architectures. Because of these advantages, we find that a GMNN can combine the fast training of a shallow network with the greater expressiveness of a deeper, larger network. We build a GMNN from the components of a state-of-the-art U-Net, and find that on real tasks it can match or exceed the accuracy of the base network while using fewer epochs and roughly half the parameter count.", "tldr": "A novel network architecture for point clouds that enables learning over multiple scales by operating on and communicating between all levels of a multigrid hierarchy.", "keywords": ["Neural Networks", "Shape Analysis"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ed89e44c4e9389d328d50fa76f0bf2f69b337437.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Geometric Multigrid Neural Networks (GMNN), a novel architecture for geometric deep learning designed to overcome the fixed information pathways of standard U-Nets.

This is a critical trade-off that is obscured in the abstract and introduction, giving a misleading impression of the method's practical efficiency.\n2.\tThe paper claims its architectural contribution is orthogonal to the convolution operator and suggests it could be combined with other layers, such as Transformers. However, all experiments are strictly limited to two specific operators: PointNet++-style and DeLA-style. It will be interesting to provide evidence or experiments to demonstrate that the GMC block, as a general-purpose module, can be directly migrated to other transformer-based baselines (e.g., Point Transformer).\n3.\tThe paper does not provide any qualitative analysis or visualization of the features learned by its core mechanism (the multigrid hierarchy).
