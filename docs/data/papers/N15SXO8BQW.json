The proposed system integrates lightweight novelty detection with edge-based incremental learning, enabling real-time identification of previously unseen activity patterns while preserving privacy. By decoupling recognition and novelty detection, the architecture supports dynamic label space expansion and distributed consensus validation across resource-constrained devices. The framework operates without transmitting raw data, ensuring compliance with privacy standards. Empirical evaluations in simulated clinical settings demonstrate robust performance under evolving behavioral conditions, establishing a scalable and privacy-conscious solution for adaptive activity monitoring.", "tldr": "We propose a federated edge-based framework for open-set human activity recognition with privacy-aware novelty detection using Wi-Fi CSI.", "keywords": ["Federated Learning", "Open-Set Recognition", "Human Activity Recognition", "Wi-Fi CSI", "Edge Computing", "Novelty Detection", "Privacy-Preserving AI", "Streaming Data"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
