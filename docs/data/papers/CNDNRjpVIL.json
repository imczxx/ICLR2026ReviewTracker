However, their utility is currently limited because EEG decoding often suffers from poor generalization due to distribution shifts across domains (e.g., subjects). Learning robust representations that capture underlying task-relevant information would mitigate these shifts and improve generalization. One promising approach is to exploit the underlying hierarchical structure in EEG, as recent studies suggest that hierarchical cognitive processes, such as visual processing, can be encoded in EEG. Yet, most existing decoding methods rely on Euclidean embeddings, which are not well-suited for capturing hierarchical structures. \nIn contrast, hyperbolic spaces, regarded as the continuous analogue of tree structures, provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical data. In this study, we first demonstrate that EEG data exhibit hyperbolicity and show that hyperbolic embeddings improve generalization. Motivated by these findings, we propose HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network architecture to capture the hierarchical structure in EEG and learn domain-invariant hyperbolic embeddings. To this end, HEEGNet combines both Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders and employs a novel coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple public EEG datasets, covering visual evoked potentials, emotion recognition, and intracranial EEG, demonstrate that HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["geometric deep learning", "transfer learning", "source-free adaptation", "electroencephalography", "neurology", "brain-computer interfaces"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/43b38d56e017b445ed6150cc9be63c21f5aa768c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work focuses on the hyperbolic representation of the EEG signal to enhance classification tasks.

The manuscript claims that EEG, video, and language modalities can all be represented in hyperbolic space, but does not provide sufficient theoretical or empirical justification for why EEG data, in particular, exhibits hierarchical or tree-like properties that make hyperbolic geometry appropriate.\n2. The rationale for combining Euclidean and hyperbolic representations is underdeveloped. It remains unclear what complementary features each space captures and how their joint use specifically benefits cross-domain transfer.\n3. Terms such as “neural information” lack precision, and the formulation of domain adaptation within the SEED dataset (e.g., session-wise vs. subject-wise domains) should be clarified. These ambiguities make it difficult to interpret the mechanism behind improved generalization.\n4. While t-SNE visualizations are provided, they reveal sub-clustering within the same class.

It is recommended to visualize intermediate representations from both Euclidean and hyperbolic branches to more directly show their complementary effects and the benefits of the hyperbolic layer.\n6.
