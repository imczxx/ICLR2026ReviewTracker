Current approaches to conditioning generation, spanning from expensive fine-tuning to lightweight activation steering or basic prompting, are often evaluated with a narrow focus on their effectiveness at injecting or removing a target concept, neglecting critical side effects on the quality of the generation. This paper presents a systematic investigation of these methods in both injection and removal scenarios, introducing a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess generation quality and move beyond unreliable measures like perplexity. Our analysis reveals that the latter is a fundamentally brittle proxy for fluency, often rewarding repetitive text while penalizing well-formed outputs.\nUsing more robust metrics, we find that there is no ``free lunch'' in conditioning: lightweight methods frequently achieve conditioning at a steep cost to expressiveness. Furthermore, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked interaction with the training paradigm: activation steering methods are far less effective on instruction-tuned models than on their base counterparts.\nWhile supervised fine-tuning emerges as the most robust method, it also exhibits significant side effects, such as collateral learning of possibly undesired linguistic characteristics of the training set. Finally, simple prompting might be an alternative to more sophisticated conditioning methods for basic concept injection, but it fails to scale to tasks requiring more thorough output control, such as concept removal. Collectively, our findings challenge common assumptions in the field, providing a more realistic characterization of the conditioning landscape and a simple but principled methodology for future evaluation.", "tldr": "A systematic evaluation of LLM conditioning reveals that no single method provides satisfactory results both in terms of steering success and fluency across different model types and tasks.", "keywords": ["activation steering", "model conditioning", "evaluation"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bdef329fe64df4709754b47d951f9c3fb3a18f1a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the limitation that existing evaluations of conditioning approaches focus solely on their effectiveness, by examining the trade-off between effectiveness and fluency.

Typically, they rely on classifiers or LLM judges to assess whether the conditioning goal has been met. For assessing overall generation quality (here, fluency), metrics like perplexity and MMLU are sometimes used. However, perplexity often rewards repetitive outputs, and MMLU, designed to test factual knowledge across 57 subjects, fails to capture subtle stylistic or persona-related differences in generative responses. In other words, neither metric provides a precise evaluation of conditional generation quality."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Although this paper is intended as an analytical study, it lacks a clear rationale for the chosen metrics and does not provide sufficiently clear insights in the result analysis.\n\n> Metric\n- **POOL OF OBSERVABLES**: The overall correlation remains low (around 0.2) even when included, as reported in the appendix, occasionally exhibiting abnormally high spikes in irregular cases. In such cases, how should the Concept Similarity be interpreted? A higher similarity score does not necessarily imply more effective concept injection. Wouldn’t it be more appropriate to report the proportion of samples exceeding a certain similarity threshold, rather than the raw similarity values?\n  - Given the difference in granularity, it might be more reliable to employ an LLM judge (1 if included, 0 otherwise) rather than Sentence-BERT for evaluation.\n- **Generation Similarity**: To capture redundant or repetitive patterns, it is more appropriate to analyze individual pieces of information at the atomic level rather than at the sentence level. When the relationships between sentences are strong, the metric could also be interpreted as indicating higher coherence.\n- **POS KL**: How can we determine whether the observed changes stem from temperature and sampling stochasticity, or are genuinely induced by the intervention itself? The standard deviation of ITI, in fact, appears to be quite large. Furthermore, the rationale for treating changes in the POS distribution as \"negative\" warrants further clarification. \n- **Type-Token Ratio**: The same concern raised regarding POS KL likely applies here as well.\n- **Generation Length**: Similar to POS KL and the Type-Token Ratio, it is unclear why a reduction in generation length is regarded as negative. A shorter output could simply indicate the removal of redundant adjectives, resulting in text that is more compact and easier to read.\n- I think the validity of POS KL, Type-Token Ratio, and Generation Length would be better understood if considered together with coherence and completeness metrics.\n\n\n> Results\n- In the results section, you focus on describing the validity of the metrics rather than presenting findings that address your main research objectives.

(Or, it could be related to the issue I raised regarding the POOL OF OBSERVABLES metric.)\n- The behavioral differences between instruction-tuned models and base models have already been demonstrated in the original ITI paper.
