This is a creative, biologically motivated, and highly relevant solution that directly exploits the inherent modularity of protein structures. The quality of the method is evidenced by the thoughtful design, particularly the targeted interface-aware refinement strategy, which focuses computational power precisely where inter-chain interactions are most critical, thus optimizing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

The current approach implicitly assumes the intra-subunit structure is largely correct and focuses its efforts on inter-subunit interfaces. The method lacks a mechanism to effectively identify or recover from errors in the internal structure prediction of the subunits themselves. This poses a significant failure mode, as local structural errors within a subunit cannot be easily rectified during the refinement or re-assembly steps, especially if they are far from the interface.\n\n2.Decomposition Robustness and Structural Breaks: While efficient, the PAE-based decomposition strategy carries a risk of introducing structural discontinuities or breaks at the boundaries of the artificially created subunits, particularly in cases of highly dynamic, ambiguous, or tightly interwoven (non-modular) interfaces. This potential for introduced structural artifacts needs a more robust discussion and mitigation strategy."}, "questions": {"value": "1.Addressing Intra-Subunit Errors: Given that the method assumes correct intra-subunit structure, how would HIERAFOLD perform if the base model prediction for one of the subunits was highly inaccurate (e.g., due to novel topology or unusual folding)?

Is it a fixed value, or is it dynamically tuned? Please provide a sensitivity analysis showing the final accuracy (e.g., TM-score, Interface TM-score) as a function of this PAE decomposition threshold to address the concern about structural breaks.\n\n3.Assembly Mechanism for Flexibility: Can the \"confidence-weighted assembly\" mechanism explicitly handle the difference between rigid-body movements of subunits (which require global transformation) and local, flexible changes (which require local backbone/side-chain adjustments)?
