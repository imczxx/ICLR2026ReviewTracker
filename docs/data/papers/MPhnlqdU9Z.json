Although out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and uncertainty estimation have been widely studied, they often rely on the assumption that neural networks learn high-quality features. However, this assumption may not hold in practice, potentially leading to undetected failures.\nIn this work, we introduce the concept of monitorability, which captures the intrinsic ability of a model to highlight potential inference errors through internal activations. We provide a formal definition of monitorability and propose the Monitorability via Input peRturbAtion (MIRA) Score, a practical measure that quantifies this property without requiring access to external OoD data. \nOur method accounts for the behavior of the model near the decision boundary by applying norm-bounded input perturbations and evaluates how distinguishable the resulting internal representations are by using Mahalanobis distance.\nSince no established baseline exists for monitorability, we validate MIRA by comparing it against the best achievable OoD detection performance across three representative methods.\nThrough experiments across multiple architectures and domain applications, we show that the MIRA Score correlates with the strongest actual detection performance, providing a tool for evaluating and comparing monitorability across different models.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first formalization and quantitative measure of monitorability. Our findings offer both theoretical grounding and empirical insight into the conditions under which model failures become detectable.", "tldr": "We propose the MIRA Score, a metric that quantifies a neural network’s ability to expose its own failures by perturbing inputs and measuring feature separability.", "keywords": ["Neural Networks", "Monitorability", "Out-of-Distribution Detection", "Anomaly Detection", "Runtime Monitoring", "Activation Patterns"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/39aeaf204c0c02f739ec2c9b74a8a5e0bfbb78bc.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work presents MIRA, a monitorability measure for neural networks based on feature space analysis.

The authors formalize the concept of monitorability and an associated MIRA score, which is intended to highlight inference errors at the internal model layer level, rather than merely relying on a black-box assessment. The score quantifies this property by applying norm-bounded input perturbations and measuring the separability of resulting feature representations using Mahalanobis distance.

Specifically, the missing multi-layer analysis has huge architectural dependence and implications. The experimental results show comparisons for the monitoring methods across different classes, but not across different layers. The authors should: (1) provide empirical evidence and theoretical justification for selecting a specific layer (e.g., final layer) as representative or (2) develop a principled aggregation scheme that accounts for the cascading effects of these networks. Investigating how MIRA scores vary across different layers within the same network would be a valuable insight.\n\nThe claim of not requiring external OOD is a lucrative one, however, it is undermined by the requirement for a user-defined distribution for perturbation magnitudes p(epsilon) in definition 2 on page 4. While Appendix B.6 proposes a threshold-based heuristic (selecting epsilon to reduce accuracy below pre-determined thresholds), this approach introduces domain-dependent choices (50% for some datasets, 15% for CIFAR-100, and 75% for NLP) without principled guidance on how this should be selected in practice. Since perturbation magnitudes may vary significantly across test domains, the lack of a principled selection strategy for p(epsilon) represents a critical gap. The authors should provide: (1) a theoretical or empirical justification for p(epsilon) choices and/or (2) an adaptive method for automatically determining p(epsilon) across datasets."}, "questions": {"value": "On page 2, the alignment of the Mahalanobis distance with the softmax classifier remains specific to this type of classifier. Does this assumption hold for other types of classifiers? The broader question is about the generalization of the method to other model architectures.\n\nOn page 4, the perturbation delta(x,epsilon) needs to move x toward the decision boundary -> how is this perturbation selected in practice? Taking this further, in definition 2 on the same page, p(epsilon) is a user-defined probability distribution over perturbation magnitudes. It is not clear as to how the user should select this probability distribution. Are there any insights here that can be leveraged? \n\nIn practice, the magnitude of perturbations is not known and hence this is a critical assumption. So, while no external OOD data is required, the perturbation magnitude distribution, which is assumed to be user-specified, is unknown and a principled method to obtain this should be explored further and formalized. While section 4.2 on page 5 provides details on the use of FGSM to obtain perturbations, it is not clear as to why the authors \"consider this as a better choice.\"\n\nThe authors state on page 4 that MIRA is not intended for runtime detection, but rather as a pre-deployment evaluation metric. It is not clear, then, how this is used downstream at runtime. Can models be explicitly trained to improve their MIRA scores?\n\nThe evaluation creates a somewhat circular argument: the MIRA metric is validated by showing it correlates with detection performance, but monitorability is itself defined as detectability. I understand there is a lack of baselines in the space, however, is there a theoretical justification that can be provided here to back up the results? Addressing the multi-layer analysis would help.\n\nNo error bars or confidence intervals are provided for MIRA scores or OOD detection performance.
