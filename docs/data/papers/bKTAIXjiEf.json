GPCRs are membrane proteins acting as cellular \"sensors\" which trigger a cascade of intracellular processes upon binding a diverse set of molecules. Human GPCRs account for nearly $30$% of targets of approved drugs, and approximately half of them are olfactory receptors (ORs). Beyond their role in smell perception, ORs are increasingly linked to diseases such as obesity, diabetes, asthma, and cancer. The core interest and difficulty in modelling the molecule-induced response of ORs and GPCRs lie in predicting activity and potency (i.e. half maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}$). In this paper, we propose a new way of modelling these properties. Instead of direct regression on $EC_{50}$ values, we mimic in vitro dose-response assays by sampling binary activity labels for a protein-molecule pair $(s, m)$ at a molecular concentration $c$. Then we design a novel model that learns the activation probability $P(active|s,m,c)$ at any given $c$. Finally, querying the model across concentrations enables fitting a logistic curve, from which both activity (curve maximum) and $EC_{50}$ (inflection point) are derived. On test sets of $1155$ protein-molecule pairs, our framework improves activity prediction by $10$%  over the state-of-the-art. For $EC_{50}$ estimation, it achieves an error of $0.725$ log units, reducing the error by $40$% compared to a regression baseline and surpassing the affinity module of Boltz-2 by 0.35 log units. Notably, our approach effectively identifies novel active scaffolds, demonstrating its potential to replace expensive in vitro primary screening. The proposed framework is protein-agnostic and can be extended to a broad field of drug discovery.", "tldr": "We reframe GPCR activity and EC50 prediction as 1. sampling binary activity labels at a concentration $c$, 2. training a model predicting activity at any $c$ and 3. fitting a dose-response curve on the activity at a range of concentrations.", "keywords": ["protein–molecule interaction", "GPCRs", "olfactory receptors", "dose–response modeling", "EC50 prediction", "protein language modelling", "graph neural networks"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/de203aeaed8df0e8dab6e5d3459f54e4bb1605c5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4f2c4d8bdd86a79cf957fbdee11e23cecf61d820.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a novel framework for predicting EC50 of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).

I do not understand why the standard paradigm needs to be challenged (as stated on line 80).\n   There has been evidence that multi-task learning can benefit tasks in drug discovery (e.g. Mayr et al., 2014),\n   but I would have expected EC50 values to follow a Gaussian-like distribution,\n   in which case regression is a sensible thing to do.\n - From my experiences, graph neural networks bring little to no benefits when working with small molecules.\n   Typically, pre-computed fingerprints work just as well or better for most machine learning tasks.\n   It seems like the GNN embedding network could be easily replaced by fingerprints.\n - In general, it is not clear how much of the performance comes from the novel paradigm\n   and how much performance is due to the network architecture.\n   An ablation study, where the SVM, RF or BiLSTM are used in the new paradigm\n   might be helpful to provide some insights here.\n - There is no information on how the hyper-parameters were chosen and what alternative architectures were considered.\n - The results in Table&nbsp;1 indicate that this model is not competitive with an SVM from 2020 for activity prediction,\n   even though this SVM model is likely much simpler than the proposed multi-block architecture with GNNs and cross-attention.\n   This seems to indicate that this model is not going to be useful for practial activity prediction tasks.\n   As a result, the claim in the abstract that the model improves state-of-the-art with 10% on activity prediction is completely unwaranted.\n - The baselines for the EC50 prediction seem to be models mainly optimised for activity prediction.\n   Therefore, it is unclear how competitive these baselines are.\n   Furthermore, it seems reasonable to expect that a multi-task setup enables reasonable EC50 prediction,\n   however, no \"plain\" multi-task models have been included in the comparison.\n   Simply adding a second \"head\" to predict the EC50 values should give a good idea.\n   This would allow the SVM, RF and BiLSTM model to be included as baselines in Table&nbsp;2.\n -
