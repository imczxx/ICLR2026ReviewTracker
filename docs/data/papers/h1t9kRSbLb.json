Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length.\nWe introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality.\nWe further extend this design with R-Stitch$^+$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of $3.00\\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, $3.85\\times$ on 14B, and $4.10\\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding.

The method is conceptually incremental to speculative decoding, differing mainly in using entropy for routing rather than token-level agreement. Moreover, the connection between entropy, confidence, and uncertainty has been explored in prior work [1], yet this paper neither cites nor compares against them.\n\n- The evaluation setting (batch size = 1) is unrealistic and potentially misleading. In real deployments, systems run with batch sizes > 1 to maximize GPU utilization, especially in frameworks like vLLM, which fully support batching. Running with batch = 1 may exaggerate latency gains, and the authors should justify this design choice.\n\n- The evaluation scope is narrow. All experiments and entropy analyses are restricted to mathematical reasoning tasks. Since the paper claims general acceleration of chain-of-thought reasoning, results across other reasoning domains (e.g., code, logical reasoning, or QA) would make the findings more convincing.\n\n- The paper ignores the memory overhead of maintaining both the LLM and SLM simultaneously. This dual-model setup increases GPU memory consumption and can reduce the number of requests processed in parallel. It’s possible that this constraint is why the experiments use batch size = 1, which should have been discussed explicitly.\n\n- The method is not compared to alternative reasoning optimization approaches such as early termination or compression-based techniques, which also shorten reasoning traces. A fair evaluation should include or discuss these baselines to clarify the relative contribution.\n\n- The approach’s robustness to entropy misprediction is unclear. If entropy fails to reflect uncertainty accurately (e.g., when the SLM is overconfident in incorrect outputs), the routing may degrade accuracy or fail to switch appropriately.\n\n- The computational overhead of computing token entropy is not thoroughly analyzed. Although entropy can be obtained from logits, its per-token computation and switching logic could add nontrivial latency, which should be measured or discussed.\n\n[1] Efficiently serving llm reasoning programs with certaindex.

Speculative decoding relies on high draft–target consistency for acceleration, and even same-family pairs may still exhibit insufficient consistency to yield strong speedups. This is reflected in the table: when consistency is higher (the * pairs), speculative decoding improves but remains limited.\n2. Because speculative decoding fundamentally depends on strict token-level agreement, it cannot leverage community SLMs that are concise but distributionally inconsistent with the LLM. In contrast, R-Stitch removes this constraint and can exploit such concise SLMs to shorten the reasoning trajectory and achieve larger acceleration gains that speculative decoding cannot obtain.\n3. Open-sourced reasoning LLMs such as Qwen tend to produce verbose chains, and same-family SLMs inherit this verbosity, limiting acceleration. R-Stitch can use concise SLMs even with lower consistency to reduce reasoning length.\n\n**Q2.** Batch size and evaluation realism (Reviewers 7aFp, saCs)\n\n**A2.** We clarify the effect of batch size on R-Stitch performance. The extended discussions have been added to Appendix A.10 in the revised manuscript. \n1. Since R-Stitch dynamically switches between the SLM and LLM at the token level, its acceleration ratio naturally decreases as batch size increases. **This trend is common to all speculative decoding–style methods, where alternating model invocations reduce GPU utilization as requests must synchronize at switching steps.**  \n2. We evaluate R-Stitch and speculative decoding on the MATH dataset using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B within vLLM, with τ = 0.02. The full LLM achieves 86.00% accuracy, while both acceleration methods reach 87.00%, showing no accuracy degradation. Latency values represent average per-sample latency after completing the dataset under each batch size. As shown below, latency increases with larger batches and the benefit of acceleration diminishes, but **R-Stitch consistently achieves lower latency than speculative decoding** across all settings. Its entropy-guided, bidirectional routing better leverages the concise reasoning behavior of small models, while speculative decoding’s strict consistency constraint limits its efficiency.\n\n| **Method / Batch** | **1** | **2** | **4** | **8** | **16** | **32** | **64** | **128** |\n|:-------------------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|\n| **LLM** | 38.34 | 31.58 | 22.07 | 16.11 | 11.08 | 8.42 | 6.52 | 5.97 |\n| **SpecDec** | 36.86 | 31.61 | 24.29 | 22.04 | 19.20 | 17.88 | 15.32 | 14.01 |\n| **R-Stitch** | 16.61 | 20.48 | 17.98 | 14.98 | 12.02 | 10.61 | 7.43 | 6.55 |"}}, "id": "vmZXQdjY7Y", "forum": "h1t9kRSbLb", "replyto": "h1t9kRSbLb", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4293/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4293/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4293/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763723445787, "cdate": 1763723445787, "tmdate": 1763723660775, "mdate": 1763723660775, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focuses on efficient generation for long-CoT LLM.
