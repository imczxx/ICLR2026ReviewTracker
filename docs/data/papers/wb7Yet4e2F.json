Moreover, the relationship among the window size L , the standard deviation σ , and the privacy hyperparameter η in determining the total privacy budget is not clearly explained. While the authors present empirical results in Figures 3 and 4, a theoretical formulation describing how these parameters influence the total privacy budget would strengthen the argument.\n3. The evaluation tasks are too simple compared to real-world LLM applications. Current LLMs are typically used for generative tasks such as open-ended question answering or image generation, while the experiments in this paper focus only on classification tasks. Evaluating the proposed methodology on more realistic generative tasks would make the results more convincing.\n4. The assumed adversarial attackers appear to be limited. The authors only consider token inversion attacks, however, in real-world scenarios, more advanced attackers may not reconstruct user inputs token by token. Instead, they could feed perturbed text into powerful LLMs and let the LLMs infer the original private content. Considering a wider range of attack techniques would make the evaluation more comprehensive."}, "questions": {"value": "1.\tWhy the name of the algorithm in Line 219 is STENCIL mechanism rather than 𝑑𝜒-STENCIL mechanism?\n2.\tAs stated in Line 249, the authors use GloVe as the embedding lookup table.
