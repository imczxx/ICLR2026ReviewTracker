Current approaches fail to develop an efficient solver for this orienteering problem variant with discrete and continuous variables. In this paper, we propose a two-stage DEcoupled discrete-Continuous optimization with Service-time-guided Trajectory (DeCoST), which aims to effectively decouple the discrete and continuous decision variables in the OPTWVP problem, while enabling efficient and learnable coordination between them. In the first stage, a parallel decoding structure is employed to predict the path and the initial service time allocation. The second stage optimizes the service times through a linear programming (LP) formulation and provides a long-horizon learning of service time estimation. We rigorously prove the global optimality of the second-stage solution.  Experiments on OPTWVP instances demonstrate that DeCoST outperforms both state-of-the-art constructive solvers and the latest meta-heuristic algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency, achieving up to 6.6x inference speedup. Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with various constructive solvers and consistently enhances the solution quality for OPTWVP.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Learning to optimize", "vehicle routing problem", "orienteering problem"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/40cbe433ae7d1f163ef5741038d52fb83c12ff19.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper develops a two-stage algorithm for solving the OPTWVP, where the first stage determines the order nodes are visited and the second stage determines how much time to spend at each node.

So this contribution really only seems important to communities that deeply care about this optimization problem.\n* The novelty in the combination of the RL policy with the polynomial-time algorithm seems to be OPTWVP-specific (generally, the idea of combining NCO with traditional optimization is not novel, but specific combination based on fixing the route is), which might be of limited interest to ICLR.\n* The discussion on lines 72 to 76 seems misleading. The references argue that transformers are ill-suited for continuous time series. However, this paper considers a discrete set of variables (scheduled times) that may have continuous values, which is very different, and which should not be an issue for transformers. The paper does not make it clear what the supposed issue with \"hybrid decision variables\" is. In the end, the proposed RL-based approach is a fairly straightforward one (graph transformer with discrete and continuous action heads); so there does not seems to be a \"hybrid decision\" challenge.\n\nThe presentation of the paper needs to be revised to improve its readability. The following is a non-exhaustive list of major and minor issues:\n* The paper should provide at least an informal definition of OPTWVP in the introduction for readers who are not familiar with the problem. There is currently no definition or explanation.\n* References should be \\citep instead of \\cite when the names of the authors are not used as subject or object.\n* Figure 1(a) and its description are not particularly clear, e.g., it is not obvious how the problem is mapped to OPTWVP. Perhaps present a more straightforward, vehicle-routing example.\n* The features and architectures of the learned policy are not described in the main text in adequate detail. Without reading the appendix, it is not clear how the Routing Decoder and STD work together. There is limited space in the main text, but these seem like important details.\n* Notation is inconsistent. On line 199, $P$ and $C$ are introduced, but they are later typeset in calligraphic font $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{C}$. On line 204, subscript $5n$ is never explained (why 5? what is $n$?).\n* The constraint on line 213 does not seem to make sense. What does the expectation of inequality mean? Later, it seems that the constraints are strict, so what is the point of the expectation?\n* Also, most of the notation introduced in lines 199 to 214 is never used later, so what is the point of introducing them?\n* On line 224, $G$ and $M$ are never introduced or explained. Typo for $\\mathcal{G}$? Batch size $M$?\n* Equation (1) would be simpler if it used the notation $R(\\tau_i | G)$, which is introduced anyway.\n* Lines 226 to 228 discuss coupling again.

Specifically,  the discrete components refer to the routing decisions (i.e choosing which locations to visit and in what order) while the continuous components concern the time variables, such as how long to spend at each location and when to start service within the allowed time windows. The DeCoST algorithm first determines the discrete route and then optimizes the continuous service times through a linear program to maximize the overall reward. In the first stage, DeCoST employs a parallel decoder to generate a feasible route and an initial estimate of service times, enhanced by spatial encoding and feasibility masks that respect time-window constraints. A profit-weighted time allocation ratio (pTAR) is introduced in order to learn the trade-off between travel time and service time allocation for the initial service time assignment. In the second stage, given the fixed route, a linear programming (LP)-based Service Time Optimization (STO) algorithm computes globally optimal service times. \nExperiments show that DeCoST consistently outperforms both heuristic and neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) baselines.
