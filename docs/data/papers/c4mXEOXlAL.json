While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node’s representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["oversquashing", "associative memory", "graph neural network"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/045a94ef9c898488755d74b664c4df3ff1d19e30.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper redefines *over-squashing* in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as two distinct failure modes: **insufficient sensitivity** and **storage capacity saturation**, arguing that existing evaluations often conflate the two.

While the motivation is reasonable, most design components are directly inherited from prior LSTM or xLSTM works. The paper feels more like an engineering extension rather than a fundamentally new GNN architecture. The authors should clearly articulate what is truly new in the design beyond re-using LSTM elements.\n\n2. Although the idea of using LSTM to control message passing is intuitive, the technical motivation for several design choices is insufficiently explained. For instance, the roles of 𝑛𝑢 and 𝑚𝑢 on graphs are not clearly defined—are they merely borrowed normalization and stabilization terms from xLSTM, or do they have specific graph-theoretic meaning? This ambiguity makes it difficult to understand how these terms contribute to mitigating over-squashing.\n\n3. The paper lacks a clear description of the datasets and settings. Although LRGB and synthetic graphs are mentioned, there is no systematic list of datasets, splits used or how baselines are chose. It remains unclear how results generalize to standard benchmarks such as OGB datasets or larger real-world graphs.\n\n4. The main analysis of over-squashing is performed on the synthetic NAR task. While this toy setting helps isolate capacity effects, it is unclear whether the claimed improvements hold on realistic graphs. Results on real-world datasets are necessary to substantiate the claim.\n\n5. Recent Graph Transformers and other scalable GNNs have been shown to alleviate over-squashing via global attention mechanisms. However, these models are not compared, leaving it unclear how gLSTM performs relative to current state-of-the-art methods.\n\n6. The proposed design may introduce significant computational overhead due to additional gating, normalization, and memory matrices. No runtime or complexity analysis is provided, especially for large graphs such as papers100M.\n\n7. Although the empirical intuition is sound, the paper lacks a rigorous theoretical justification for why the LSTM-style mechanism fundamentally reduces over-squashing. A formal analysis would strengthen the claims.\n\n8. The experiments only include graph-level classification and synthetic tasks.
