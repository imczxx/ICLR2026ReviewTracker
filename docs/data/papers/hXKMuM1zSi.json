Advanced countermeasures have introduced secure aggregation protocols, which are broadly classified as centralized (server-dominated) or fully distributed (server-free). The former risks adversarial server interference, while the latter avoids central threats but suffers from poor energy efficiency due to coordination overhead. Neither approach offers an ideal solution. This paper introduces SVAFD, a secure co-aggregation protocol that ensures privacy protection and verifiability by redefining the responsibility boundaries between server and client in line with their respective requirements and resource capabilities. Specifically, SVAFD allows clients to perform lightweight encoding of logits and achieve locally partial aggregation, while the server converges all partial results for global decoding and generates aggregation proofs. By shifting from unilateral dominance to multilateral client/server co-aggregation, SVAFD guarantees that no vanilla clients’ privacy can be inferred while providing with an unforgeable aggregation proof for process checking, even in the presence of server collusion with a subset of clients. Moreover, SVAFD is resilient to stragglers and reduces the complexity for each aggregation from three rounds (Armadillo, NeurIPS’24) or more in recent protocols to only two rounds, chieving a ~1.32× reduction in computation consumption.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Secure Aggregation", "Federated Distillation", "Verifiable Computing", "Privacy Protection"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/490c13400f694655673efb8c3513157814a6fb2c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/19ea50549bee5d79c568fd93c101e88448a09927.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Support for arbitrary polynomial aggregation $\\mathcal{h}(\\cdot)$ of degree $\\deg(\\mathcal{h})$.\n\nKey technical contributions:\n--MM-LCC (Multi-to-Multi Lagrange Coded Computing) enabling homomorphic share aggregation.\n--Two-stage co-aggregation with client-side privacy-critical ops and server-side coordination.\n--Verifiable proofs with low client overhead.\n--Empirical results show 1.32× lower computation than Armadillo (NeurIPS’24) and 2.37× less client-side workload, with robustness to 10% dropout and 10% malicious clients."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "Originality: Co-aggregation paradigm + MM-LCC is a creative and principled synthesis of coded computing and secure aggregation.\nQuality: Sound theoretical foundation (Theorems, Lemmas) with matching experiments.

(2) Janus: Dual-Server Multi-Round Secure Aggregation with Verifiability for Federated Learning). How does the proposed scheme compare with such approaches in terms of advantages?
