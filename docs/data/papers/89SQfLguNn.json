Additionally, the authors demonstrate experiments to show that they can handle 1M graph nodes comfortably by using a single GPU.\n\nThe writing of the paper is excellent and easy to follow, balancing clarity and conciseness for graph random features (GRFs), which contain many subtle details.\n\n(Half strength, half weakness) GRFs are an interesting extension of random features from the Euclidean domain to the graph domain. It is pleasant to see the use of GRFs in machine learning tasks. On the other hand, this paper mostly concerns applying the concept, weakening the contribution. Moreover, as graph neural networks (GNNs) become so widely used for the tasks concerned in this paper, the advantages of GRFs are unclear."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "On the theoretical side, given the prior work on GRFs and the machinery to perform GP inference and parameter estimation by using random features, the contribution of this work primarily lies in applying the former to the latter. A majority of the background for this application is known (e.g., the concentration of GRF in Theorem 1, the parameter estimation method in Eqn (8)--(11), and the posterior inference in Eqn (12)). To be fair, the authors do provide new results, such as the $O(N^{3/2})$ complexity for inference due to the $O(N)$ spectral norm of the kernel, but this contribution is less significant than the establishment of the GRF itself.\n\nOn the practical side, it is unclear how kernel/GP methods fare with GNNs. There are no such experiments in the paper. GNNs scale better than kernels and they are data-efficient for node-level problems. For example, for the Cora graph and the classification task that the authors discuss in Section 4.4, GNN can achieve over 80% accuracy with 20 training nodes per class (a labeling rate of 5.2% only). Can GRF be as data-efficient?\n\nAnother practical question is the Bayesian optimization over graphs, which has a finite search space. Since predicting the graph signal on each node is cheap and relatively accurate by using a GNN given a small training set, a natural heuristic is that one does not use Thompson sampling for the acquisition but only picks the best GNN predictions. The practical value of the paper can be strengthened by experimenting with such a simple baseline."}, "questions": {"value": "See comments above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "E7H5XyWscX", "forum": "89SQfLguNn", "replyto": "89SQfLguNn", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6344/Reviewer_e8Qw"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6344/Reviewer_e8Qw"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6344/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761854745268, "cdate": 1761854745268, "tmdate": 1762918635774, "mdate": 1762918635774, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Graph Random Features (GRFs) to construct learnable graph node kernels which estimate the sparse GP covariance function reducing the cubic computational complexity of exact GPs and applying these graph-based approximation technique for sparse GP estimation for Bayesian optimization via Thompson sampling.
