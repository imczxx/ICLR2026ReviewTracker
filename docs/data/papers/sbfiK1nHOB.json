Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been gained popularity for improving model performance by ensuring structured outputs that follow a logical sequence. In this paper, we first investigate how current abstention methods perform with CoT outputs, finding that direct use of reasoning traces can degrade performance of existing abstention methods by more than 5%. As a result, we introduce a new framework for thinking about hallucinations in LLMs not as answering a question incorrectly but instead as LLMs answering the *wrong* question. Based on this framework, we develop a new class of state-of-the-art abstention methods called **Trace Inversion**. First, we generate the reasoning trace of a model. Based on only the trace, we then reconstruct the most likely query that the model responded to. Finally, we compare the initial query with the reconstructed query. Low similarity score between the initial query and reconstructed query suggests that the model likely answered the question incorrectly and is flagged to abstain. We perform extensive experiments to find impressive performance gains with our Trace Inversion methods.

However, there is no clear winner as to which distance measure works best.

How should someone who wants to apply Trace Inversion to a model decide which to use?\n* \"Reliable Accuracy\" seems improperly specified, and would reward over-abstention (a trivial example would be abstaining for all but one answerable questions). A more appropriate choice, given the threshold-based formulation in section 3.1, would be something like an Accuracy-Rejection Curve.\n* No large-scale, API models are evaluated. While this is perhaps understandable given cost constraints, several of the abstention methods provided could be used on closed models.

The authors demonstrate that while Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning accuracy, it consistently harms abstention reliability by making models more prone to overconfident or misleading answers. Across eight established benchmarks and five model families, they show that adding CoT reduces both reliable accuracy (accuracy when answering) and abstention accuracy (correctness of abstain or answer decisions). To address this, they introduce Trace Inversion, a new abstention framework that treats hallucination as the model “answering the wrong question.” Instead of relying on confidence scores, Trace Inversion reconstructs the question implicitly answered by the model’s reasoning trace and measures its similarity to the original query; if misaligned, the model should abstain.

To address this, it introduces an elegant and effective method called Trace Inversion.

Trace Inversion is particularly compelling because it frames model errors as instances of “answering a different question,” offering a meaningful bridge between interpretability and uncertainty estimation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The approach relies heavily on the reconstructed query and on the hypothesis that hallucinations arise when a model answers an incorrect question. However, this assumption may not always hold. The reconstructed query itself can be inaccurate or incoherent, leading to spurious or unjustified abstentions.\n\n- Using semantic similarity to compare the original question \n𝑞\n and the reconstructed question \n𝑞\n′\n is a fragile proxy for alignment. Similarity metrics may conflate paraphrasing with correctness and fail to capture deeper logical or causal mismatches. How is this handled? \n\n- Trace Inversion still depends on the model’s Chain-of-Thought, making it unable to detect or correct flawed reasoning that appears coherent on the surface. If the CoT itself is wrong, inversion merely reflects that error.\n\n- The paper does not analyze how model accuracy changes with or without Chain-of-Thought. Exploring this trade-off could reveal when one might prefer a model that is slightly less accurate but more cautious or better at abstaining.\n\n- All the models experimented upon are trained with instruction tuning to generate a reasoning chain. My assumption is that they may struggle to generate an answer directly. Wouldn't experiments with base models work better? \n\n- The presentation of the results and experimental variants is somewhat difficult to follow. Clearer tables, visualizations, or structured explanations of the baselines and Trace Inversion variants would make the work more accessible.\n\n- Overall this is an interesting paper and I'm happy to reconsider once my concerns have been addressed"}, "questions": {"value": "In weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "MVHMYNBAKn", "forum": "sbfiK1nHOB", "replyto": "sbfiK1nHOB", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13714/Reviewer_ohYZ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13714/Reviewer_ohYZ"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13714/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762134501476, "cdate": 1762134501476, "tmdate": 1762924261087, "mdate": 1762924261087, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
