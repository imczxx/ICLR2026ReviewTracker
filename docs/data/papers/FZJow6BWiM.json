Diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, but these models are typically adapted from image generation frameworks and overlook inherent higher-order topology, leaving them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff), a principled framework that progressively generates plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. HOG-Diff follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum guided by higher-order topology and implemented via diffusion bridges. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks.

It would be relevant to examine how the model scales with graph size (the SBM dataset, while described in the paper as large-scale, is of relatively modest size) and how conditional generation could be incorporated alongside the higher-order structures."}, "questions": {"value": "- **Hierarchical time windows:** What is the specific role of the number of hierarchical time windows $K$ in the model? If it is treated as a hyperparameter, how is its value determined and how it is related to the number of noising steps? How do changes in $K$ affect the model‚ as generative dynamics?\n\n- **Computational cost:** The model introduces several components that could significantly impact computational efficiency, such as the Cell Complex Filtering operation, the injection of noise into the Laplacian instead of the adjacency matrix (which requires recomputing the Laplacian at each noising step), and the different modules in the score network (GNC and Transformer blocks). Although the authors provide a theoretical argument that the framework converges to the target distribution at an equal or faster rate than classical models, there is no empirical evidence supporting this claim. Having this analysis would be particularly relevant, as the reported performance gains over existing methods are not substantial. Therefore, demonstrating that the added complexity of using higher-order structures translates into practical efficiency or quality improvements (beyond the provided ablation) would strengthen the paper.\n\n### Minor questions\n\n- Why do the authors use different sets of baselines across experiments? Is there a specific reason for this?\n\n- The authors claim that existing graph generative models are ill-suited to capture topological properties because they are largely adapted from image generation frameworks. They further argue that the adjacency matrix quickly degrades into a dense matrix with uniformly distributed entries, which is detrimental to graph structure preservation. However, the paper would benefit from clearer empirical or theoretical evidence supporting these claims. In particular, several recent graph diffusion models employ diffusion processes on discrete state-spaces that are adapted for graph generation and have shown strong performance in maintaining graph topology. As a justification for the need to learn higher-order topology, the paper mentions that the framework should ensure equivariance. However, many existing graph generative models already satisfy equivariance, so this motivation is a bit unclear. In particular, it would be relevant to have proof that the proposed model respects equivariance.\n\n- Could the higher-order information be further exploited to enhance scalability, for example, by incorporating higher-order structure generation within a latent diffusion framework?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "JxHPmiTHLw", "forum": "FZJow6BWiM", "replyto": "FZJow6BWiM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12542/Reviewer_NCCR"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12542/Reviewer_NCCR"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12542/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761982944396, "cdate": 1761982944396, "tmdate": 1762923403186, "mdate": 1762923403186, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces HOG-Diff, a novel diffusion framework for graph generation.

The notation, in particular, seems inconsistent and potentially overloaded. For instance, Proposition 2 introduces the $p$-cell complex filtered graph $G_p$, where the subscript $p$ denotes the cell dimension. However, in subsequent sections, graphs are denoted as $G_t$, where $t$ represents time. It is unclear if $G_t$ retains a connection to a specific $p$-cell filtration or if this notation is dropped. This ambiguity makes the methodology difficult to follow, thus hinders a precise understanding of the manuscript’s main contribution and the relevant algorithm design. \n- **Justification of Core Motivation and Theoretical Bound.** The central motivation of the paper is that lifting graphs to a higher-order space improves generative fidelity, which I believe requires stronger justification. While higher-order representations are beneficial for systems with inherent group-level interactions (e.g., co-authorship networks), this does not mean converting graphs to their high-order counterpart would be beneficial for downstream tasks. As shown in [1], a hypergraph and its corresponding graph clique expansion can be information-theoretically equivalent in certain contexts. The paper does not sufficiently argue why this lifting operation provides a superior inductive bias for learning the data distribution. This concern extends to the primary theoretical result (Theorem 4). The analysis demonstrates that the final step of the HOG-Diff curriculum (from $\\tau_1$ to $0$) achieves a sharper error bound than a classical model's entire process (from $T$ to $0$). This comparison does not seem equitable. The proof relies on $\\tau_1 < T$ and a superior (coarsened) starting point which induces $\\mathcal{E}(\\tau_1) \\le \\mathcal{E}^{\\prime}(T)$. A more convincing analysis would compare the entire $K$-step generative process of HOG-Diff (from $T \\to 0$) against the classical $T \\to 0$ process, rather than isolating the final, and arguably simpler, refinement step. I might have misunderstanding on the theoretical bound and would appreciate if the authors can correct me. \n- **Critique of Diffusion Model Baselines.** The paper's motivation appears to be based on a critique of graph diffusion models. The claim that diffusion models are \"ineffective at modeling the topological properties\" (Lines 70-72) overlooks recent successes in discrete-state diffusion. Similarly, the criticism that \"the graph adjacency matrix quickly degrades into a dense matrix\" (Line 72) and that injecting \"isotropic Gaussian noise...is detrimental\" (Line 76) primarily applies to early continuous diffusion models. This critique does not hold for more recent discrete frameworks such as DiGress [3], Cometh [2], and DeFoG [4], which deviate from the Gaussian noise paradigm. The paper should position its contribution against these more relevant state-of-the-art discrete models, as the problems it claims to solve have, to a large extent, already been addressed.\n- **Significance and Fairness of Empirical Evaluation.** The empirical evaluation lacks significance due to the omission of standard benchmarks for graph generation. Datasets such as SBM, Planar, and Tree graphs are critical as they possess ground-truth topological properties (e.g., planarity, acyclicity). Evaluating validity on these datasets is fundamental to assessing a model's ability to capture intrinsic graph patterns. The paper's reliance on statistics ratio (degree, clustering) and molecular validity (which is basically valency validity) does not sufficiently demonstrate that the model can learn and respect these fine-grained topological constraints, especially in plain graph generation tasks. Furthermore, the comparison to existing work is incomplete. Key SOTA diffusion models, such as Cometh [2], are not included. In the molecular benchmarks (QM9, ZINC250k), the reported improvement over DeFoG [4] appears marginal, but a proper comparison is impossible as standard deviations are not provided.\n- **Scalability and Computational Complexity.** Scalability remains an unanswered question. All experiments are conducted on relatively small-scale graphs. Standard, larger benchmarks (e.g., MOSES, GUACAMOL for molecules; SBMs, the larger version of COMM-20) are absent. This is critical as the core premise of HOG-Diff relies on computing higher-order structures. It is unclear (1) whether computing these structures is computationally feasible for large graphs, and (2) how the performance and complexity of HOG-Diff scale relative to standard graph generation models on such data. Although Appendix D discussed computational complexity, it would be good to see empirical validation as well. \n- **Clarity of Algorithmic Details.** The paper would benefit from a more precise definition of its algorithmic settings in the main text. Key details, such as the exact dimensions and representations of $G$ and $G_p$, are not sufficiently clear. This lack of detail hinders a rigorous analysis of the algorithm's space and time complexity.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] B. Tang et al. Training-free message passing for learning on hypergraphs.
