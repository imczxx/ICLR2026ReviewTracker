In this work, we show that short-task benchmarks may give an illusion of slowing progress, as even marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential improvements in the length of tasks a model can successfully complete. Then, we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. So, we propose isolating execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to solve a long-horizon task. First, we find that larger models can correctly execute significantly more turns even when small models have near-perfect single-turn accuracy. We then observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations---curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect---models become more likely to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns. Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. But, we find that thinking mitigates self-conditioning, and also enables execution of much longer tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on the length of tasks they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time compute for long-horizon tasks.", "tldr": "We measure long-horizon execution capability of LLMs, identify a failure mode where models self-condition on their own errors, and show benefits of increasing model size and sequential test-time compute", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Long Horizon", "Agents"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/892d77bc8fd82bbc1fe55714619ba607c25cdf81.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/827c95d15ad303bf2e0f3da164d6cee1a2269aae.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the scaling properties of Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-horizon tasks.

Real-world execution is not typically the N-th repetition of the exact same retrieve-then-compose operation. It involves varied actions, changing states, and error correction based on new observations. Because the task is so far removed from the real-world tasks it claims to model, it is impossible to know if the findings (especially \"self-conditioning\") would generalize.

While this consists of planning and then execution, the paper strips away the planning part via controlled tasks where the model is given detailed instructions and \"knowledge\", to only test the ability to execute. The paper studies three factors: (1) the impact of model strength/scaling, (2) the impact of correct executions of earlier steps in the context (called self-conditioning in the paper), and (3) the impact of thinking.\nFor (1), it starts with a simple formal analysis that assumes constant and independent accuracy per step, that indicates strong gains from improving accuracy per step. The paper itself later shows that the assumptions of this analysis are not always true. To obtain a controlled empirical setting, the work uses a simple lookup and prefix-sum task, where the \"dictionary\" is provided. Regarding (1), they find that first, even models that are very good at one lookup or addition step can perform much worse on the long-horizon task, possibly indicating problems with state tracking. The per-step accuracy diminishes with the length of the task. Second, still, better models indeed are better at long-horizon execution. For (2), the paper shows an experiment that helps distinguish between failure due to task length versus due to errors in the execution trace, by controlling the errors in the trace. All tested models are sensitive to the errors in their history. (3) For thinking models, this sensitivity appears to go away.

The idea of treating planning and retrieval as \"key value\" problems is unique, and it allows the authors to \"provide\" the plan and knowledge at each step as appropriate.\n\n* Some of the results are quite surprising and creatively supported by the authors with explanation hypotheses. E.g., that single-step accuracy decreases with task length seems very unintuitive at first sight, but then the authors try out two hypotheses and find their combination to be a useful explanation of this phenomenon."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* The synthetic task proposed here boils down to retrieving and summing up (all prefix subsequences of) $t \\times K$ numbers, where each number has 2 digits. While this task fits the authors' desire to isolate out planning and retrieval issues, it's **not exactly a sequential task** as referred to by the authors when discussing some experiments. This is important as, while sequential tasks are known to benefit from \"reasoning\" tokens or chain-of-thought, this is not really the case for adding $N$ numbers. Formally, this problem is well-known to lie in the complexity class $TC^0$ of *fully parallelizable* problems! This is a bit counter-intuitive, but happens to be true --- that one can add $N$ $N$-bit numbers completely in parallel in just a few steps. In fact, when a Transformer-based LLM compute attention over $N$ previous tokens, this sum is precisely what it computes. Thus, in a way, the synthetic task here isn't quite the perfect fit for what the authors really need. (An alternative task would be where 2-digit numbers are replaced with $5 \\times 5$ size *matrices*, and instead of sum, the task is to *multiply* the matrices; this is *not* known to be fully parallelizable, making it a better fit for some of the authors' narrative around CoT and reasoning tokens being helpful.)\n\n* That said, the experiments even with the proposed \"prefix sum\" task do seem to support the authors' claims in practice. I do find some details a little hard to believe/understand, though. For instance, Fig 7(a) seems to suggest that without CoT, strong models like Deepseek-V3 an Kimi-k2 can barely add 4-6 numbers of 2 digits each. I would have expected them to be able to handle longer sequences.\n\n* The discussion in section 2.1 (diminishing returns) feels not very convincing or deep. For one, Proposition 1 seems to follow directly from the observation that if each step *independently* succeeds (a strong assumption) with probability $p$, then $T$ steps will succeed with probability $s = p^T$. If this is the reasoning, it would be better to spell it out in the main text, as readers will readily connect with this common understanding of single-step errors compounding in multi-step scenarios.\n\n* Similarly, it is well-understood that single-step errors compound in multi-step uses. It would be helpful for the authors to discuss this. The common \"use\" of this observation is that a small *decrease* in single-step accuracy often leads to a large *drop* in multi-step accuracy. What the authors are saying is really the same statement, looked from the other direction: namely, a small *increase* in single-step accuracy often leads to a large *increase* in multi-step accuracy. These kinds of connections both help understand where the proposed observation is coming from and why it's reasonable. Yet, the discussion is not framed this way.\n\n* In the same section, in Fig 2, the claim that a small increase in step accuracy (x-axis) leads to a large increase in horizon length (y-axis) appears to really be only true when the slope of the curve is significantly larger than 1, which happens when step accuracy is already in the range of 90% to 100%. Note that for long-range tasks to be meaningfully solved, $H_{0.75}$ or $H_{0.9}$ are much more realistic measures than $H_{0.5}$. In other words, the exponential increase observation (with small increases in step accuracy) seem to \"work out\" only when single-step accuracy is already very high, in the 90%+ range. This seems important but is not discussed."}, "questions": {"value": "Could the authors comment on the points raised in the weaknesses section and how they might address it?
