In this setting, strict-ternary forward passes help on-device efficiency, but the dominant bottleneck remains shipping dense gradients or parameters each step. We instead use a hypernetwork that generates sparse, masked weight-update proposals from a low-dimensional latent, keeping quantization strict-ternary with a global threshold. Training is bilevel: an inner loop adapts the latent to each mini-batch by gradient descent, and an outer loop updates the hypernetwork with an accept-if-better mechanism for stability. This approach enables efficient distributed training because devices only communicate low-dimensional latent codes instead of full parameter updates. Our experiments demonstrate competitive accuracy while achieving significant communication efficiency - reducing the data exchanged between devices from the size of all model parameters to just the size of compact latent representations.", "tldr": "We develop a bilevel training method for ternary networks using hypernetworks to learn efficient parameter updates, achieving competitive accuracy with reduced communication costs", "keywords": ["Ternary quantization", "Hypernetworks", "Neural network compression", "Adaptive quantization", "Bilevel training", "Edge computing", "Distributed Training"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2f8f63df1dcb5ae7fca113d140a8a6e366cdada5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "vXb6Teh0Vp", "forum": "SnQ5PSuQqi", "replyto": "SnQ5PSuQqi", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14142/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14142/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760727790281, "cdate": 1760727790281, "tmdate": 1760727790281, "mdate": 1760727790281, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
