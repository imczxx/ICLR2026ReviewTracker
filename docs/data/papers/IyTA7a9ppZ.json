This absence of self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically over time. We introduce Echo Planning (**EchoP**), a new self-correcting framework that establishes an end-to-end Current → Future → Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, \\ie, not only generated from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories. Experiments on nuScenes show that the proposed method yields competitive performance, reducing L2 error (Avg) by -0.04 m and collision rate by -0.12\\% compared to one-shot planners. The approach also scales to closed-loop evaluation, i.e., Bench2Drive, attaining a 26.52\\% success rate. Notably, EchoP requires no additional supervision: the CFC cycle acts as an inductive bias that stabilizes long-horizon planning. Overall, EchoP offers a simple, deployable pathway to improve reliability in safety-critical autonomous driving.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["End-to-End", "Autonomous Driving", "Planing", "Temporal"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0eeaac3daf33382395bcf694f1cd7190be21190d.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ce635f5333a6b38cf09639402817bccb6583bc8a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an end-to-end planning algorithm that predicts future trajectories to generate corresponding future BEV features.

In the abstract, Figure 1(d), and Table 1, the paper seems to give the impression that the proposed method is self-supervised and does not rely on auxiliary task supervision (such as detection or mapping) shown in Figure 1(a,b). However, as I understand it, the BEV module still depends on these supervised tasks. This is also mentioned in line 161: “…are transformed into a BEV representation using BEVFormer…”, where BEVFormer indeed relies on such supervision to generate BEV features. Therefore, I think the related statement about \"self-supervision\" could be somewhat misleading.\n2. The proposed approach involves forward and backward BEV feature prediction (resulting in four BEV feature maps in total). Since these predictions inevitably contain errors, it is questionable whether performing supervision on these imperfect BEV features can truly provide a benefit. Although ablation studies are provided, the results on the nuScenes dataset (which is dominated by straight-driving scenarios) are not very convincing.\n3. When reconstructing the current BEV features based on predicted future BEV features, ego-motion naturally leads to blank or noisy regions near the boundaries (areas unobservable at the current time). Using these imperfect features to reconstruct the current BEV may cause information loss or distortion. Consequently, aligning these with the BEV features encoded directly from surround-view images may be unreliable, which raises doubts about the effectiveness of such a supervision strategy."}, "questions": {"value": "1. I find the motivation of this paper difficult to understand. It is unclear why predicting future BEV features based on the predicted trajectory, then reconstructing the current BEV features from these predicted future features (conditioned on the inverted predicted trajectory), and finally enforcing consistency with the real current BEV features would lead to improved performance. The underlying reasoning for why this bidirectional prediction and consistency supervision should provide meaningful benefits is not well justified.\n2. In line 224, the paper states that the reverse instruction “go straight” remains unchanged. However, this could be ambiguous. During the backward reconstruction of BEV features, the instruction actually refers to moving straight backward, not forward. If the same instruction token is used for both forward and backward processes, it is unclear how the SceneTokenLearner distinguishes between these two different contexts."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "8N78TYIHe5", "forum": "IyTA7a9ppZ", "replyto": "IyTA7a9ppZ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3118/Reviewer_zGu8"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3118/Reviewer_zGu8"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3118/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761107625921, "cdate": 1761107625921, "tmdate": 1762916558609, "mdate": 1762916558609, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces EchoP, a self-correcting trajectory planning framework for autonomous driving that enforces bidirectional temporal consistency through a Current→Future→Current (CFC) feedback cycle; unlike conventional one-shot planners that predict a future trajectory from a single scene snapshot, EchoP first generates a future trajectory from the current Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation and then inversely reconstructs the current BEV state from this predicted future, using the discrepancy between the reconstructed and actual current BEV as a self-supervised signal to penalize implausible trajectories.
