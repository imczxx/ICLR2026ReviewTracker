However, document chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized evidence-dense question answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing the overall performance of RAG systems.", "tldr": "HiChunk improve RAG by constructing hierachical chunking, outperforming existing chunking methods across various metrics and datasets.", "keywords": ["Retrieval Augmented Generation", "Information Retrieval", "Hierarchical Chunking​"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4d16106db29ecdd89caa79f91fb1651cefd0e6bd.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This study proposes the HiChunk framework, which employs a fine-tuned LLM to parse the hierarchical structure of documents, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional linear chunking.

Studies such as LongRefiner[1] have already proposed leveraging the hierarchical nature of documents to optimize RAG. The HiChunk framework presented in this paper shares similarities with such hierarchical document optimization approaches.\n2. The merging decisions of the Auto-Merge algorithm rely on a series of sophisticated rules. However, the paper does not provide ablation experiments or sensitivity analyses for these critical design elements. This renders the algorithm akin to a product fine-tuned for specific tasks, and its robustness remains to be further verified.\n3. Furthermore, the paper does not explore whether a LLM can achieve equally proficient hierarchical structure parsing solely through prompting. It is likely that the fine-tuned model is merely reproducing capabilities it already possesses, thus casting doubt on the necessity of fine-tuning.\n\n**reference**\n\n[1] Jin, Jiajie, et al. \"Hierarchical document refinement for long-context retrieval-augmented generation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2505.10413 (2025)."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
