Although circuit simulators like SPICE can deliver accurate signal integrity analysis, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for large-scale designs. In this paper, we propose Si-GT, a novel transformer-based model for fast and accurate signal integrity analysis in IC interconnects. Our model elaborates three key designs: (1) virtual NET token to encode net-specific signal characteristics and serve as net-wise representation, (2) mesh pattern encoding to embed high-order mesh structures at each node while distinguishing uncoupled wire segments, and (3) intra-inter net (IIN) attention mechanism to capture structures of signal propagation path and coupling connections. To support model training and evaluation, we construct the first interconnect signal integrity dataset comprising 200k delay examples and 187k glitch examples using SPICE simulations as the golden reference. Our experiments show that our Si-GT surpasses state-of-the-art graph neural network and graph transformer baselines with substantially reduced computation compared to SPICE, offering a scalable and effective solution for interconnect signal integrity analysis in IC design verification.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph Transformer", "Integrated Circuit", "Signal Integrity"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/30d5661ac7c778c97fe33a01720f6de18c91eeb8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper is trying to make better Graph transformers for modeling analog-level effects in circuits, which is quite a pressing problem.

Yes, it can be represented as a graph, but it is a highly regular, patterned graph. One can represent an image as a grid graph, but that does not make the graph neural network ideal for images. Why is it obvious that we need to solve this problem via GT ?\n\nEval : The dataset is mostly simulation-level, and it's very unclear that it reflects the industrial circuits (I understand that the standards are Intel/Synopsys based, but that does not mean the random sweep generates circuits relevant to industry). Further, the paper is evaluating its own methods on its own dataset, which makes it impossible to gauge impartially. (I do agree it is kind of a chicken and egg problem, which is why selecting pre-existing datasets will ease the question of impartiality). The baselines are fairly ad hoc and \"generic\" GT/GNN models, which may not be suitable. The layers also look a bit deep for this problem (GNNs are well known to suffer with depth)\n\nRelevance : In analog or digital IC, there are already pre-existing tools that can create the labels in question (indeed the paper uses them). The abstract says that this is not always feasible due to computational costs (true) but then the question becomes : what is the computational tradeoff of the papers' models vs running the tool itself ? This is not studied. We are of course ignoring the fact that even slight losses in accuracy relative to industrial standards are generally considered unacceptable."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the \"weaknesses\" section - in particular - the questions about industrial relevance and benchmarking to other methods."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "dKNcLwuesI", "forum": "orO5727bSh", "replyto": "orO5727bSh", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5028/Reviewer_DwGg"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5028/Reviewer_DwGg"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5028/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761699619448, "cdate": 1761699619448, "tmdate": 1762917831166, "mdate": 1762917831166, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work proposed a fast interconnect signal integrity analysis by graph transformers.

Dataset Limitations and Lack of Clarity:\n(1)\tThe paper does not state whether the dataset will be open-sourced, which is essential for reproducibility and community adoption.\n(2)\tThe synthetic data is based on a highly simplified topology of “2 aggressors + 1 victim”, which fails to reflect the complex multi-net coupling scenarios in real VLSI layouts. In contrast, recent work like GraphCAD (ISPD '25) uses real post-routing circuits from design contests, offering far greater realism and diversity.\n(3)\tThere is no quantitative comparison with statistics from prior datasets (e.g., number of nets, coupling density, net length distribution), weakening the claim of being “large-scale” and representative.\n2. Inadequate Baseline Comparisons:\n(1)\tThe paper omits comparison with task-specific SOTA models, notably GraphCAD (2025) and Routing-Free Crosstalk Prediction (Liang et al., 2020) , both of which directly address crosstalk modeling. This is a major oversight.\n(2)\tSi-GT uses a “GNN → Transformer” pipeline, yet it does not compare against generic GNN-Transformer hybrids (e.g., GraphTrans or GraphGPS variants with GNN preprocessing), making it unclear whether gains stem from architecture or the proposed inductive biases.\n3. Questionable Experimental Design:\n(1)\tIn ablation studies (Table 5), different Si-GT variants (e.g., Si-GT-GCN, Si-GT-GAT) use different GNN backbones, introducing confounding variables. A fair ablation should fix the GNN type.\n(2)\tThe performance gains over strong baselines like GraphGPS are marginal, raising questions about the practical significance of the added complexity.\n(3)\tThe paper adds Graphormer-style shortest-path (SP) and edge biases on top of IIN, but provides no justification for this design choice or analysis of potential redundancy/conflict between SP bias and the intra-net resistance-based bias.\n4.

Please add experimental results comparing Si-GT against these task-specific SOTA models.\n3. Attention Bias Design: The model combines IIN bias with Graphormer’s shortest-path (SP) and edge biases.
