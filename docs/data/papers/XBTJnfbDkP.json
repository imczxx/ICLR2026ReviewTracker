TRL is designed for offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as in principle it only requires $O(\\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in TD learning) to handle a length-T trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming. Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL algorithms.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "goal-conditioned rl", "offline rl"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ff5706716718c08f370628bab0972b93395eaf78.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d00ee95c14c14e35d485f82dc13bd1ec01bc053a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a method called Transitive RL for offline goal-conditioned RL.

Accordingly, **the paper’s framing should be revised to emphasise the offline goal-conditioned setting, rather than starting broadly from off-policy RL**.\n\nI find this submission interesting; however, the presentation and narrative could be improved. The paper lacks a smooth transition from the problem statement (and background) to the proposed idea, and then to the corresponding solution."}, "questions": {"value": "1. In Table 1, TRL significantly outperforms the selected baselines. However, I encourage the authors to include more recent offline GCRL methods, such as HIQL [1] and WGCSL [2].\n\n2. It would be preferable to combine Sections 5.1 and 5.2, as they largely overlap, and move the ablation studies to the main pages.\n\n3. Section 5.1 shows that TRL performs well on large-scale, long-horizon tasks. However, this evidence alone is insufficient to demonstrate that the performance gain arises from the divide-and-conquer value learning. The authors should design more detailed experiments to verify that the value function learned by the proposed method is indeed more accurate and less prone to overestimation, as stated in line 256.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Park, S., Ghosh, D., Eysenbach, B., \\& Levine, S.
