Effective pruning can be achieved by criteria to identify redundant parameters, and the SHAP Value (SV) has been considered such a criterion, which is interpreted as averaging the marginal contributions across all possible parameter accumulation paths. However, we find that its averaging process systematically overweights redundant parameters, failing as a decision-making agent. Instead, quantifying the speed of decay of the marginal contribution can serve as a more effective decision criterion for model pruning. We show that it is more effective to count the number of cooperative contributions of parameters for pruning parameters in backward elimination, leading to a more optimal set of remaining parameters.", "tldr": "We propose a new criterion, cooperation Index, for effective model pruning to improve both generalizability and interpretability of the model..", "keywords": ["Parameter Importance", "Model Pruning", "SHAP value"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/77538c68af99ef2ca2006fb93820f2085a048936.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/11e0b5b6f476df6bed039cbd6b9946050726468e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a Cooperation Index for pruning that measures how often a parameter’s marginal contribution exceeds its own Shapley average along sampled permutations.

Pruning is useful for making large and computationally expensive models more efficient. However, the authors exclusively test their method on small models like VGG and ResNet-18 that are already fast and do not have any need for pruning. It is unclear why one would develop a pruning method that scales poorly with the number of parameters and cannot be easily applied to large models that need the pruning the most.\n2. Evaluation is limited to very old and small-scale ConvNets (VGG-16 and ResNet-18) and entirely ignores transformers, which currently represent the dominant paradigm.\n3.  Authors do not include a ViT-tiny model. My suggestion that if this model is too expensive to run for this algorithm, then they need to scale it down even further, but the experiments for the transformer must be presented.\n4. The paper fails to compare against modern pruning methods. For instance Wanda [1], which is a simple, fast, and highly effective method for large models. Its absence makes it difficult to judge the practicality of the proposed method against the current state of the art. \n5. Missing baselines from NLP. For instance, authors could have included tiny version of BERT and GPT.\n* **Runtime**: despite proposing a two-step approximation scheme, the paper provides no empirical runtime to quantify its computational cost. This is especially concerning as the method inherits the factorial complexity of Shapley values, which is fundamentally at odds with the scaling laws (the more parameters the better). I believe the authors need to provide an actual runtime of the algorithm and compare it with a runtime of the competing baselines.\n\n\n[1] A Simple and Effective Pruning Approach for Large Language Models, Sun et al., 2023"}, "questions": {"value": "The dominant trend in deep learning shows that model performance scales predictably with size, favoring methods with low polynomial complexity in terms of the number of parameters.

This narrow scope fails to demonstrate the method's scalability and performance at higher, more practical levels of sparsity.\n- Flawed Statistical Reporting: The paper lacks statistical rigor by explicitly reporting the \"best performing result in terms of accuracy\" from five runs, rather than the mean and standard deviation. This practice of \"cherry-picking\" results may significantly overstate the method's true performance.\n- Dependence on Approximation Accuracy: The CI calculation is critically dependent on the accuracy of the regression function used in the two-level approximation scheme. The study does not sufficiently analyze the method's sensitivity to potential errors introduced by this approximation eg. the convergence of CI is shown only for the first few filters.\n- Ambiguity in Tie-Breaking: The illustrative toy example shows identical CI scores (0.25) for four of the five parameters in the initial stage. The paper fails to explain the tie-breaking mechanism used to select $w_4$ for pruning, making the selection criteria ambiguous.\n- Rigid Contribution Threshold: The Cooperation Index relies on a strict binary threshold (above or below the mean SV) to classify contributions. This rigid classification may inaccurately assess parameters whose marginal contributions are consistently very close to the average.\n- Limited Dataset Variety: The evaluation is restricted to a few datasets . The conclusions would be strengthened by validation on a more diverse set of datasets, such as Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, KMNIST, STL-10, Caltech-101.\n- Incomplete Baseline Comparison: The MCI baseline method was prematurely dismissed from the main experiments based only on poor performance in the synthetic example.
