The reviewers recognize GAC's novelty (Contribution: 4 - excellent from Reviewer HAcA) and theoretical grounding (Soundness: 3–4 across reviewers). We have carefully addressed all concerns and provide key clarifications below.\n\n---\n\n**The fundamental problem we address:**\n\nModern continuous control methods overwhelmingly rely on Gaussian policies, which exhibit three structural limitations in bounded, high-dimensional action spaces:\n\n1. **Unbounded support** requiring tanh squashing, creating regions of diminished gradient flow (our analysis shows 46.4% of samples in low-gradient zones |tanh'| < 0.1, though SAC compensates via entropy regularization)\n2. **Density-based regularization** relying on entropy terms and Jacobian corrections\n3. **Isotropic sampling** lacking directional structure for efficient exploration\n\nGAC addresses these through principled geometric decomposition:\n\n$$\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{r} \\odot \\text{normalize}\\big(w(\\kappa) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu} + (1 - w(\\kappa)) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\big)$$ where $\\mathbf{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is per-dimension scaling (Eq. 6), $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ is learned direction, $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\sim \\text{Uniform}(\\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$ provides uniform spherical noise, and $w(\\kappa) = \\sigma(\\kappa)$ controls exploration. \n\n**Why geometric approaches outperform Gaussians in high dimensions:**\n\nThe mismatch between Gaussian's unbounded support and bounded action spaces becomes increasingly problematic:\n\n- **PPO:** Entropy regularization diminishes under Bellman updates, potentially reducing exploration\n- **TD3:** Adds unstructured noise to deterministic actions, lacking directional exploration\n- **SAC:** Prevents collapse through aggressive entropy regularization ($\\alpha \\approx 0.2$), but suffers distorted sampling from tanh squashing\n\nThese limitations surface on high-dimensional tasks: Ant-v4 (8D) where GAC outperforms SAC by +37.6*%, and Quadruped tasks (12D) with gains up to +112%, highlighting benefits of saturation-free, geometrically structured policies.* \n\n---\n\n**On vMF comparison** (Reviewers 4Nrh & rszA):\n\nWhile vMF distributions are theoretically elegant, they're rarely used in practice due to computational barriers: rejection sampling with <50% acceptance in high dimensions, and modified Bessel function evaluation. GAC achieves equivalent directional concentration (validated in Appendix A.2) through simple geometric operations. Our revised appendix includes empirical vMF comparison, confirming GAC's significant computational advantage while matching concentration control. \n\n---\n\n**Major improvements during rebuttal:**\n\n1. **Extended with learnable per-dimension scaling** (Reviewer 4Nrh's \"active/passive motion\" concern):\n   - Enables fine-grained control impossible for diagonal Gaussians\n   - Walker2d: 5165→5420 (+4.9%)\n   - Just 3 lines of code, minimal complexity\n\n2. **Added 6 DMControl benchmarks** (Reviewers HAcA & 4Nrh):\n   - Validates generalization beyond MuJoCo\n   - SOTA results on high-D locomotion tasks\n   - Results and pretrained models in supplementary materials\n\n3. **Clarified GAC as general geometric policy paradigm** (Reviewer rszA):\n   - Not a SAC/TD3/PPO variant, but new policy representation\n   - Replaces Gaussians with directional spherical sampling\n   - Structured exploration via geometry (not deterministic like TD3, nor isotropic like SAC)\n   - Compatible with any actor-critic framework; we demonstrate with SAC\n   - Computational cost: comparable to TD3, simpler than SAC (no entropy/Jacobian)\n\n---\n\n**Core insight:** \n\nRobust continuous control doesn't require complex distributions—it requires respecting action space geometry. GAC's concentration parameter $\\kappa$ directly modulates exploration without entropy estimates, while spherical interpolation ensures non-zero exploration even as $\\kappa$ increases. This eliminates: (1) fragile entropy-temperature tuning ($\\alpha$), (2) density estimation overhead, and (3) gradient distortion from squashing. Exploration emerges naturally from geometric interpolation with theoretical guarantees (Theorem 1).\n\nBeyond algorithmic improvements, GAC represents a paradigm shift: treating exploration as directional deformation within geometric structure rather than noise-based entropy maximization. We hope this work sparks further research on structure-aware policy representations.\n\nWe believe these improvements address all major concerns and welcome further discussion."}}, "id": "adg1mRkpGq", "forum": "6VqCOnTVXa", "replyto": "6VqCOnTVXa", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1522/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1522/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1522/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763286324560, "cdate": 1763286324560, "tmdate": 1763286324560, "mdate": 1763286324560, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Geometric Action Control (GAC), a distribution-free policy paradigm that generates actions via a mixing operation with a unit sphere, replacing traditional Gaussian policies to avoid gradient saturation.
