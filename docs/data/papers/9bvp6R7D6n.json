Naive joint training often results in gradient conflicts and unstable optimization. We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data into understanding–generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly. We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples, forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality dataset of 16K UG pairs named as PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLMs RL baselines.

This invites spurious cross-instance pairs and makes the weighting arbitrary. No comparison to stronger vision–language similarities.\n\n3. What exactly does similarity buy beyond sampling?

The paper effectively identifies and articulates a critical and timely problem in the development of UVLMs—the optimization conflict between understanding and generation tasks during unified RL. The empirical analysis presented in Figure 1, showing the correlation between gradient cosine similarity and benchmark performance, provides a strong, data-driven motivation for the proposed approach.\n2. The proposed PairUni framework is elegant and logically sound. Tackling the problem at both the data level (through structured pairing) and the optimization level (through similarity-weighted advantages) is a comprehensive approach. The distinction between \"aligned\" and \"retrieved\" pairs is a practical way to balance supervision quality with data scale.\n3. The paper demonstrates consistent and balanced performance gains on a variety of established benchmarks for both understanding (MMMU, MMStar, MME) and generation (WISE, GenEval). The improvements over the powerful Janus-Pro baseline are non-trivial and suggest the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n4. The curated PairUG dataset is a valuable contribution to the community.

Limited Scope of Evaluation Benchmarks: The evaluation primarily focuses on standard VQA/reasoning and text-to-image generation tasks. However, a key capability of modern UVLMs is instruction-following image editing, which requires a tight integration of understanding (the instruction) and generation (the edit).\n\n2. Insufficient Comparison with State-of-the-Art Baselines: The set of compared models, while including the relevant Janus-Pro, could be expanded to include more recent and powerful UVLMs (e.g., Qwen-Edit、Kontext, and Step1X) known for their unified capabilities, particularly in instruction-following and editing.\n\n3. Lack of Clarity in Visualizations: Figure 2, which is central to understanding the data pairing pipeline, is too abstract and lacks the necessary detail to be fully informative. The low resolution and simplistic diagrams make it difficult to grasp the nuances of the alignment, retrieval, and clustering processes.\n\n4. Need for Stronger Evidence of the Method's Novelty: The paper's main contribution is the PairUni framework (PairUG dataset + Pair-GPRO algorithm). While the results on Janus-Pro are strong, the experiments do not sufficiently disentangle the contribution of the method from the choice of the base model.
