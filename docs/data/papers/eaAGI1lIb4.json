This makes it difficult to fully assess XEED’s relative performance or to verify whether its improvements come from the new setting or the framework design itself.\n\n2) XEED’s strongest BiDoT improvements depend critically on synthetic image generation using IP-Adapter + SDXL. The ablation study shows that removing this component causes F-BiDoT to plummet (e.g., from 65.19 → 20.91 on PACS and 33.63 → 4.47 on DomainNet). This dependence implies that the system’s success hinges on access to a large diffusion model and high-quality generation.

Using the pre-trained diffusion model and CLIP. Although this paper is overall good, I have several concerns about using the pre-trained diffusion model. Since a good exemplar or sample for transferring can be generated, the knowledge related to the domains and classes is already encoded in the pre-trained model. As such, do we still need continual learning of another model? Most existing generative replay-based methods train a generative model during the continual learning, which is incremental learning process parallel to the training model. However, if the model needs another model which already has the knowledge of future data, since we already have a good one, what is the meaning of incremental learning of that model? \n2. The proposed method XEED is simple and preserving prompts and prototypes specific to distinct domains or classes has been widey studied in the community of continual learning. \n3. The capability of transferring across domains, the major challenge defined in this paper, seems mainly benefit from the generative replay. It seems that the major problem defined in this paper is solved by introducing knowledge of other models while the other parts of this method have mere innovation. One can argue that with such a replay mechamism, existing CIL methods can be easily transferred to the setting of XIL.\n4. Results on dataset specially designed for the domain and class incremental learning, e.g., CoRE50 [1]. should be included. The datasets used in the experiments are not designed for incremental learning. The CoRE50, which is designed for both the CIL and Domain-incremental learning tasks, can be a good benchmark of XIL.\n\n[1] Vincenzo Lomonaco and Davide Maltoni.

The proposed method assumes that diffusion-based generation can effectively represent unseen domain–class combinations. However, such generative processes may produce low-fidelity or stylistically inconsistent samples, which could introduce noise into the evolving prototype updates and distort the learned feature space. A more detailed analysis of the generation quality—either through visual inspection, quantitative metrics such as FID or LPIPS, or ablation studies—would help validate whether the synthetic exemplars truly enhance domain transfer rather than acting as noisy augmentations.\n\n- Another concern lies in the **high computational cost and reliance on diffusion models**. The method depends on a pre-trained diffusion generator to synthesize cross-domain exemplars, which is computationally expensive due to multiple denoising steps, high GPU memory requirements, and significant I/O overhead. While diffusion models contribute to the quality of generated samples, their use raises questions about scalability and practicality in large-scale or real-time incremental learning scenarios. A discussion of the computational budget, inference latency, and trade-offs between efficiency and performance would strengthen the paper’s experimental transparency.\n\n- Finally, the framework’s **dependence on frozen backbones and domain prompts** may restrict adaptability under severe domain shifts. The feature extractor remains fixed during prompt tuning, assuming pre-trained features are sufficiently general for new domains. In cases where the domain gap is large (e.g., transferring from natural images to sketches or depth maps), this assumption may not hold, leading to suboptimal adaptation even with domain-specific prompts.
