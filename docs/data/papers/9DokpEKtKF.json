Yet in real-world operation, intrinsics drift due to heating, zoom events, mechanical shocks, a single hard landing, or simply incorrect factory calibration, violating the fixed-parameter assumption that underpins most vision and learning pipelines. This induces a distribution shift in the visual input, which in turn degrades the performance of downstream models and tasks that rely on stable camera geometry. We introduce RACE (Real-time Adaptive Camera-intrinsic Estimation), a provably stable online learning algorithm that continually estimates camera intrinsics directly from continuous monocular image stream. RACE updates parameters through a Lyapunov-stable adaptive law, guaranteeing global asymptotic convergence of the reprojection error dynamics and recovery of the true intrinsics under persistent excitation. Unlike prior batch optimization, heuristic self-calibration or learning-based approaches, RACE requires no training data, bundle adjustment, or retraining, and provides the first theoretical bridge between adaptive control and online learning for camera models. Empirically, we evaluate RACE across public benchmarks (EuRoC, TUM, and TartanAir), showing that it matches or surpasses state-of-the-art learning-based calibration while adapting in real time with negligible computational overhead. Our results highlight RACE as a new class of theoretically grounded continual learners for camera intrinsics, enabling robust long-term perception in embodied agents.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Computer vision", "control theory", "online camera calibration"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/42c049fa75b6a92720af2e61527bf0a40a5a73a6.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d1b96542ff1d01876fa70f6c256fb4ce1f8b0d2e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a novel and highly original approach to online camera intrinsic calibration by framing it as an adaptive control problem.

The analysis lacks any robustness guarantees under pose estimation noise, which is unavoidable in practice.\n\n2.Inadequate Experimental Validation:\nUnrealistic Perturbation Model: The use of a \"global scaling\" perturbation for initial offsets is a severe oversimplification. It avoids the core challenge of coupled parameter identifiability and likely overstates the method's robustness. The absence of tests with independent parameter perturbations is a major omission.\nUnfair Benchmarking: The comparisons against state-of-the-art methods are not conducted on a level playing field. A direct comparison against classical online estimators (e.g., Recursive Least Squares, online Gauss-Newton) under the same simplified setting (known poses, same perturbations) is required to isolate the benefit of the proposed control law.\nLack of System Integration Clarity: The paper fails to clearly explain how the RACE module would be integrated into a full SLAM pipeline to break the circular dependency, leaving its practical implementation in doubt.\n\n3.Incomplete Analysis of Limitations:\nThe extension to lens distortion relies on a heuristic \"continual linearization\" approach without providing stability proofs for the resulting nonlinear system.\nThe analysis of failure cases (e.g., on TartanAir) is superficial. The role and effectiveness of the proposed PE-gating mechanism are stated but not quantitatively demonstrated with ablation studies or diagnostic plots.\n\nThe paper presents a promising direction but in its current form, it reads more as a proof-of-concept under idealized conditions than a thoroughly validated practical solution.

Strong Assumption of Known Poses: The most significant weakness is the assumption that the algorithm has access to accurate camera poses and 2D-3D correspondences. The authors state this in Section 3.2 and the limitations. This assumption seems to create a 'chicken-and-egg' problem for the scenarios the paper motivates, like autonomous driving or robotics. In a real-world setting, a drift in camera intrinsics would almost certainly degrade the performance of the pose estimation system (e.g., SLAM or localization). One cannot assume a perfect pose to fix the intrinsics, because the imperfect intrinsics are needed to find the pose. This assumption, while also made by some other works, severely limits the practical applicability of the method as a standalone solution.\n2. Reliance on Persistent Excitation (PE): The method's convergence guarantee depends on the PE condition, meaning the camera must be moving in a way that provides rich visual information. The paper's own results on the TartanAir dataset show that performance degrades in challenging segments (fog, low light) where this condition is likely not met. While the authors propose 'gating' (pausing) the update, this remains a practical limitation for real-world use where long, non-informative sequences can occur (e.g., driving on a straight highway)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Given the reliance on known camera poses, could the authors elaborate on the intended practical deployment scenario? Is this method intended to be integrated into a larger SLAM or visual odometry system?\n\n2. Following up on the first question, Appendix E shows a test with ORB-SLAM3. Can you clarify the setup? Was the RACE algorithm still fed ground-truth poses to estimate intrinsics, which were then passed to ORB-SLAM3? Or was there a joint estimation where RACE used the (potentially incorrect) estimated poses from ORB-SLAM3? How would the stability guarantees be affected if the input poses are noisy or drifting?\n\n3. The paper proposes 'gating' the update when the PE condition is weak. Was this technique used in the TartanAir experiments? How well does the system perform if it encounters a long period of weak PE and then must re-converge when informative motion resumes?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Sk4oKh8noa", "forum": "9DokpEKtKF", "replyto": "9DokpEKtKF", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21580/Reviewer_qHGu"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21580/Reviewer_qHGu"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21580/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761955773735, "cdate": 1761955773735, "tmdate": 1762941842074, "mdate": 1762941842074, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, the authors propose a real-time adaptive camera-intrinsic estimation (RACE) method. \n\nDifferent from previous offline approaches, self-calibration methods with global bundle adjustment (e.g. colmap), and pretrained models, the proposed method updates the intrinsic parameters adaptively based on control theory with a strong assumption that correct 2D-3D correspondences and camera poses are known.\n\nExperiments on public datasets including EuRoc, TUM RGB-D, and TartanAir datasets demonstrate the proposed approach gives smaller reprojection errors than previous methods such as Colmap, DroidCalib which don’t have any assumptions."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "1.\tGood motivation.
