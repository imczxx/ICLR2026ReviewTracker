We introduce *Speak to a Protein*, a new capability that turns protein analysis into an interactive, multimodal dialogue with an expert co-scientist. The AI system retrieves and synthesizes relevant literature, structures, and ligand data; grounds answers in a live 3D scene; and can highlight, annotate, manipulate and see the visualization. It also generates and runs code when needed, explaining results in both text and graphics.\nWe demonstrate these capabilities on relevant proteins, posing questions about binding pockets, conformational changes, or structure-activity relationships to test ideas in real-time. *Speak to a Protein* reduces the time from question to evidence, lowers the barrier to advanced structural analysis, and enables hypothesis generation by tightly coupling language, code, and 3D structures. *Speak to a Protein* is freely accessible at https://www.anonymousplayground.com.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Agentic co-scientist", "scientific discovery", "molecular visualization", "deep reasearch", "drug discovery", "retrieval-augmented generation"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/baf500db70ab778519688c1459bcf2b461cc10f4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents an interactive multimodal AI \"co-scientist\" system called “Speak to a Protein,” designed to simplify protein analysis through natural language dialogue.
