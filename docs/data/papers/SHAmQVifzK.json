Specifically, we first summarize the convergence characteristics of distinct frequency components and designed a specialized dual-branch architecture. \nThe high-frequency branch rapidly captures detailed context by a unet, while the low-frequency branch progressively refines the textureless regions throughout the iteration. \nThese two branches interact via a carefully designed high-frequency preservation update operator and predict the disparity, achieving synchronous optimization of both high and low frequency regions. \nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our Wavelet-Stereo outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and ranks $1^{st}$ on SceneFlow, ETH3D, KITTI 2015 and KITTI 2012 online leaderboards for almost all metrics.

The introduced wavelet decomposition, dual-branch feature extraction, and complex HPU operator likely incur significant overhead, and without a comprehensive comparison of total FLOPs, parameter count, or inference time against baselines, the claim of superior efficiency remains unsupported and potentially misleading.\n\n2.Limited Novelty in Core Concept: The fundamental idea of processing high and low-frequency information separately is not novel. The paper itself cites contemporary works like Selective-Stereo (Wang et al., 2024) and DLNR (Zhao et al., 2023), which explicitly propose very similar frequency-domain or feature-decoupling strategies to address the same core problem of detail loss in iterative stereo matching. While the wavelet-based implementation and HPU are new, the overarching principle of frequency-specific processing is an incremental step.\n\n3.Unclear Practical Significance and Generality: The performance gains, while statistically leading on benchmarks, are often marginal in absolute terms (e.g., EPE reduction from 0.37 to 0.36 on Scene Flow). The paper does not convincingly argue that these incremental improvements translate to a significant, tangible impact in real-world applications like autonomous driving or robotics, especially given the potential increase in model complexity.\n\n4.Inadequate Ablation on the Wavelet Choice: The entire framework is built upon the Haar wavelet for decomposition, but the paper provides no justification or ablation for this critical design choice. It remains unclear whether the observed benefits stem from the proposed architecture or are specific to the properties of the Haar wavelet, and if other wavelet families or even simple filter banks could achieve similar results."}, "questions": {"value": "1.Given the significant architectural additions (wavelet decomposition, dual-branch feature extraction, HPU), what is the total inference time and FLOPs compared to the baseline RAFT-Stereo and MonSter?

The entire method's foundation rests on this choice, yet its justification and sensitivity are not explored.\n\n3.The HPU incorporates both an IFA and an HP-LSTM. Could you provide an ablation study that quantifies the individual contribution of the LSA and HSA modules within the IFA?
