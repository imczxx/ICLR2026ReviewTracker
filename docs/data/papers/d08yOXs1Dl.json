Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for advancing robotic capabilities in dynamic environments. This task presents two fundamental challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately predicting ball trajectories under complex dynamics, and it necessitates intelligent control strategies to ensure precise ball striking to target regions. High-speed object manipulation typically demands advanced visual perception hardware capable of capturing rapid motion with exceptional temporal resolution.\nDrawing inspiration from Kahneman's dual-system theory, where fast intuitive processing complements slower deliberate reasoning, there exists an opportunity to develop more robust perception architectures that can handle high-speed dynamics while maintaining accuracy.\nTo this end, we present \\textit{\\textbf{SpikePingpong}}, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. We develop a cognitive-inspired Fast-Slow system architecture where System 1 provides rapid ball detection and preliminary trajectory prediction with millisecond-level responses, while System 2 employs spike-oriented neural calibration for precise hittable position corrections. For strategic ball striking, we introduce Imitation-based Motion Planning And Control Technology, which learns optimal robotic arm striking policies through demonstration-based learning.\nExperimental results demonstrate that \\textit{\\textbf{SpikePingpong}} achieves a remarkable 92\\% success rate for 30 cm accuracy zones and 70\\% in the more challenging 20 cm precision targeting. This work demonstrates the potential of cognitive-inspired architectures for advancing robotic capabilities in time-critical manipulation tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Robotics", "Imitation Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dfd400fe3c1763a2bb25ff9eb4e16cff39c9ee40.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ea294143b006e73bd855af4900a96a41cf739c09.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper is about a robotic system and related algorithms/models for playing pingpong using a robot manipulator.

Possibly this paper can be accepted by CORL or any other robotics conference or a journal.\n- I believe the claim about a fast-slow system with two components that are working at different temporal frequency is a bit of a stretch, in terms that the system does not have cognition, so its not a cognitive architecture, it is just imitation of a well known cognitive principle (system 1 and system 2).\n- There are no relevant machine learning model training details, for example there is no mention of data splits, cross-validation, or standard machine learning setup, and I believe this is because the paper focuses on the robotics concepts.

Since the Stage-3 action generation (IMPACT) relies purely on imitation learning, the system lacks the ability to adapt to unseen or out-of-distribution ball trajectories, such as those with different spins, velocities, or bounce patterns. The evaluation also appears to be confined to in-domain scenarios, and it remains unclear whether the tests include unseen human/robot launch opponents or novel shot types. Moreover, the demonstration data are said to come from both a ball-launching machine and human players, but the paper does not specify which subsets were used for training and which for testing, nor does it clarify whether the demonstrator shown in the supplementary video is the same person who provided the training data. The robot’s striking behavior in the video further appears to be limited to only two distinct motion patterns, suggesting a lack of diversity and adaptability in the learned control policy. A deeper analysis of how the system handles different incoming trajectories and human play styles, given that variations in hitting points and trajectories across players can be substantial, would greatly strengthen the paper and highlight the system’s robustness beyond demonstration-specific conditions."}, "questions": {"value": "see \"weaknesses\""}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "3EJTwDqxb7", "forum": "d08yOXs1Dl", "replyto": "d08yOXs1Dl", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16484/Reviewer_Yh92"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16484/Reviewer_Yh92"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16484/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762485881322, "cdate": 1762485881322, "tmdate": 1762926584189, "mdate": 1762926584189, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
