However, an activity cliff---a phenomenon where a minor structural modification to a molecule leads to a significant change in its biological activity---poses a challenge in predictive modeling. The activity cliff depends on the interaction between the target and the ligand, which is largely overlooked by previous ligand-centric studies. However, the limited availability of activity cliff data for target-ligand 3D complexes constrains the predictive power of modern deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce DockedAC, a new dataset incorporating the protein target and 3D complex structure information for studying the problem of activity cliffs. By matching protein binding information and ligand bioactivity, we employ molecular docking to generate the complex structure for each activity value. The DockedAC dataset contains 82,836 activity data across 52 protein targets annotated with activity cliff information. This dataset represents a significant step toward large-scale activity cliff research using 3D complex structures. We benchmark the dataset with traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. Our data and benchmark platform are publicly available.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Deep learning dataset", "Molecular property prediction", "AI-aided drug discovery"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5cbf3531d14df1b002304aaa3c808a2f62206216.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces DockedAC, a novel dataset designed for activity cliff (AC) prediction that incorporates 3D protein-ligand complex structures generated via molecular docking.

The provided benchmark is extensive and will be a valuable resource for the community.\n\nRigorous Dataset Construction: The process for building the dataset is well-documented and involves careful steps for data cleaning, AC identification, target-structure mapping, and complex generation. The use of multiple similarity measures and a strict binding site verification process is commendable.\n\nInteresting Empirical Findings: The paper presents compelling results, such as the superior performance of 3D GNNs (like IGN) on AC prediction and the critical influence of the AC ratio in the training set, which highlights the unique challenges of this task compared to general bioactivity prediction."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Lack of Justification vs. Existing Docking Datasets (Major): The paper does not adequately justify why a new docking dataset was necessary, given the existence of several recent, large-scale protein-ligand docking datasets. For example:\n\n    A High-Quality Data Set of Protein-Ligand Binding Interactions Via Comparative Complex Structure Modeling,  DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01170\n\n    SIU: A Million-Scale Structural Small Molecule-Protein Interaction Dataset for Unbiased Bioactivity Prediction, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.08961\n\n    SAIR: Enabling Deep Learning for Protein-Ligand Interactions with a Synthetic Structural Dataset, https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.17.660168\n\n    The unique value of DockedAC lies in its explicit focus on curated Activity Cliffs, but this contribution can be built upon these other resources. \n\n2. Questionable Data Homogeneity (Major): A critical issue is the assumption that bioactivity data collected from different sources and assays across ChEMBL can be averaged and are directly comparable. Biochemical assays can vary significantly in conditions, leading to systematic biases. Aggregating this data without accounting for assay-type or laboratory-of-origin can introduce noise and confound the model's ability to learn true structure-activity relationships. The authors should at a minimum discuss this limitation and consider if assay-aware splitting or normalization could be applied.\n\n3. Incomplete and Outdated Baselines (Major): The benchmark, while comprehensive in some aspects, omits several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that are highly relevant. For example:\n\n    Boltz-2: Towards Accurate and Efficient Binding Affinity Prediction, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.14.659707\n\n    LigUnity: A foundation model for protein-ligand affinity prediction through jointly optimizing virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.17.638554\n\n    The inclusion of these strong baselines is essential to properly position the performance of the tested models and to demonstrate the current challenge level posed by the DockedAC dataset.\n\n4. Clarity of Visualizations: Figure 1, as an example, the protein residues in the 3D structure diagram (Figure 1b) should have atoms (C, N, O) colored differently (e.g., gray, blue, red) to allow readers to unambiguously identify the hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. The current coloring makes it difficult to verify the claimed hydrogen bond interactions."}, "questions": {"value": "1. How does DockedAC docking process specifically complement or surpass existing large-scale docking datasets like BindingNet, SIU or SAIR. Why not generate activity cliff pairs on these existing datasets?\n\n2.

The analysis in the paper closely resembles the MoleculeACE paper (e.g., delta RMSE, impact of AC percentage, dataset set size, protein family analysis), and confirms its findings. Analysis from new perspectives, or discovering new insights, is needed to introduce added value.\n3. The text overstates the contribution of the work. For example, the initial analysis begins with a comparison of 3D methods against only 2D models, emphasizing the importance of 3D information. However, traditional ML approaches using ECFP fingerprints outperform all 2D and 3D models, as shown and briefly discussed in Figure 6. This is not a surprising finding (as written in L431) and reported in the MoleculeACE paper and other literature already. The authors should clearly discuss when 3D models underperform simpler models, and analyze the reasons behind this. The analysis should also start from a comparison against the strongest baselines, not the weakest ones.\n4.

The double-stratified sampling strategy (in Section 3.5) used for dataset splitting can lead to information leakage, as structurally similar ligands may appear in both the training and test sets. This setup prevents a fair evaluation of the model’s generalization ability on unseen small molecules.\n\n2. One of the paper’s main contribution is the construction of protein–ligand complexes. However, the experimental results show that ligand-only models, which do not use these 3D complexes at all, perform better. This discrepancy weakens the logical connection between the paper’s motivation and its findings. The authors should clarify why the 3D complexes fail to improve performance, or provide analyses showing where 3D information offers advantages.\n\n3.

DTA/DTI tasks inherently involve two domains: the small-molecule side and the target protein side. The current work focuses primarily on generalization across proteins but pays limited attention to ligand-level de-duplication and generalization. Since activity cliffs mainly concern fine-grained distinctions between structurally similar ligands against the same target, ligand-side analysis should be emphasized more strongly.\n\n2. The baseline models are relatively outdated. In addition to classical machine-learning and basic GNN models, recent pretrained molecular representation models (e.g., Uni-Mol) should be included for a fair comparison. Similarly, more recent DTA/DTI models could serve as relevant structure-based baselines.\n\n3. How do the authors justify the conclusion that “current deep learning methods underperform compared to traditional machine learning approaches using molecular fingerprints, underscoring the need for next-generation 3D-QSAR algorithms”? There seems to be a substantial gap between the observed results and this claim. For instance, do deep learning models—particularly GNN-based ones—require larger data volumes to outperform traditional models? Is per-target QSAR modeling inherently more effective than cross-target modeling? Or do handcrafted descriptors such as ECFP offer unique advantages for activity-cliff prediction? A more systematic analysis would be needed to substantiate this conclusion."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "4VyGwz6FOl", "forum": "fgooGoezZJ", "replyto": "fgooGoezZJ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15595/Reviewer_pJCr"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15595/Reviewer_pJCr"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15595/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761991254807, "cdate": 1761991254807, "tmdate": 1762925866183, "mdate": 1762925866183, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
