However, the formal definition of the model only considers positive correlations $r\\in (0,1)$, and the experimental datasets involve graphs with positive edge weights. This discrepancy weakens the motivation. Moreover, the influence of node covariates on graph matching has already been studied under models such as the correlated Gaussian-attributed Erdős–Rényi model. The present model thus appears to be a slight variation, primarily chosen for analytical tractability rather than capturing new phenomena.\n\n2) **Novelty of the contribution.** From a technical standpoint, it is unclear what new challenges the proposed model introduces. The proof seems to mimic the approach used by Wu et al. (2022). Because edges and node covariates are assumed independent, the likelihood conveniently decomposes into two independent terms, making the analysis of the key statistic  $Z$ (used to bound the misalignment probability) relatively straightforward.\n\n3) **Presentation and clarity of the writing.** The presentation could be significantly improved by clarifying the motivation and the formal definition of the model (see remarks below) and by providing more explicit comparisons with prior work, especially regarding the proof techniques used to establish the main results.
