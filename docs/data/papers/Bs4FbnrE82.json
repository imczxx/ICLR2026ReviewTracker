The entire formulation assumes that the three sensors directly provide joint rotations r_m. In practice, such rotations cannot be measured without knowing both adjacent body segments’ orientations. This input variable is thus non-observable, and the model seems to operate on dataset-level ground-truth artifacts rather than physically measurable signals. \n2. According to Fig.1, the conditioning joints (head and wrists) are leaves in the kinematic tree. While leaf-joint rotations may be defined as parameters in datasets, they are not constraining in the forward-kinematic chain (i.e., not required to determine downstream positions). Conditioning p(r_M|r_m) on such non-constraining variables makes the setup physically non-closed: the learned dependence is statistical rather than geometrically consistent, weakening the realism and deployability of the approach. \n3. The paper argues that zero-shot generalization is needed because users have different body scales, yet it simultaneously assumes that the new user’s bone lengths are known at inference time. If scale information is already available, a simpler and physically grounded approach would train a scale-free diffusion prior and condition on the user’s scale-dependent skeleton (e.g. scaled T-pose) together with observable head/wrists measurements (if available and physically meaningful). Such a design would achieve the same finetune-free behavior without introducing complicated conditioning mechanisms."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The core motivation is that human skeletons have diverse limb lengths, so a conditional diffusion model fails to be trained on that diverse data. To bypass this problem, the paper proposes to train the diffusion model only on rotational data, which is independent of limb lengths. To realize this idea, the conditional diffusion formulation is separated into two parts, i.e., rotational distribution and locational distribution. The rotational distribution is absorbed in a classifier-free guidance (CFG) formulation and trained on data, while the location part is simply formulated based on geometry. To handle the location part in reverse steps, the pseudo-inverse guidance technique is utilized. This technique requires the transform to be linear, which is not satisfied by the geometric property of the rotations, so the result of the technique is approximated by a Gaussian distribution. Experiments show that the proposed method is much better generalized for diverse data."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- Good design.

The proof only shows that the mean and the covariance of the distribution will correspond to the derived expressions. This does not imply that the resulting distribution will be close enough to a Gaussian one. It can be a widely different distribution, which still has the same mean and covariance.\n\n- Better generalization, but worse in the best-case scenario? In Figure 3, InPose is worse than existing methods when the scale is one. The paper says that this is \"expected,\" but why is this?
