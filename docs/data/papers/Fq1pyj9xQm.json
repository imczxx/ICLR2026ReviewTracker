This paper neglects important related work (e.g. delta nets https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06484 , PSMs: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10918 and especially log-linear attention: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04761). These papers present very similar methods with more general and scalable experimental results, although less of a focus on length generalization. The authors would need to carefully read and discuss this work and how it relates to this paper. Especially log-linear attention and PSMs present the idea of generic parallel scans for doing log-depth recurrence. \n2. The paper is missing comparisons of parameters + FLOPs across architectures. Adding the MLP layers will add parameters and make the networks larger than the baselines. This seems like it potentially makes the comparisons unfair as a result. Moreover in terms of actually understanding the cost of the new architecture, we need a more detailed analysis of the FLOPs required both for training and for inference. \n3. It seems that the architecture likely does not allow easy parallel training. We have seen in recent years that this is important for scalability (e.g. transformers + SSMs). It is not even obvious to me from the paper whether computation is being re-used during training, or if for each token during training the entire LRU over the sequence is being recomputed. Full description of the training complexity for next token prediction would be useful. \n4. The transformer baseline seems somewhat weak by only using NoPE positional embeddings. It is now fairly standard to compose sliding window RoPE layers with global NoPE layers for length generalization. The local layers are needed to create better representations of local tokens that is difficult with NoPE. Here is one example paper with dramatically better length generalization with better positional encodings: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01032. \n5. There is no strong state space model baseline. In particular, the gated delta net is the SoTA architecture and is substantially more expressive than Mamba and similar architectures. This baseline is needed. \n6. The results of LDRU without the non-linearity seem fairly similar to with the non-linearity. When it is linear, it seems that the LDRU may also become equivalent to some form of state-space/linear attention."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

RegularGPT seems to be essentially the same idea (a balanced binary tree recursion - except uses Transformer as the recursive cell) - and also performs near perfectly (better in the original paper). The improvement in this paper seems like due to minor implementational difference rather than exposing any theoretical leap. \n* Limited evaluation on anything else besides algorithmic regular language tasks. Does not show if it can be anything more than something that works well in \"toy\" tasks. While I do appreciate evaluation on algorithmic/synthetic tasks - particularly because they can be harder to \"hack\" by finding spurious shortcuts and easier to analyze - however, restricting the whole study to them when introducing a supposedly general purpose model restricts the scope severely. \n* Seems to miss a lot of critical related paper:\n   - First of all, LDRU seems like a neologism for Balanced Tree Recursive Neural Networks - which have been explored in multiple prior works [1,2,3].\n   - Moreover it misses any comparison with more recent proposals like Recursion-in-Recursion (RIR) which also proposes logarithmic-depth recurrence/recursion and shows effectiveness in algorithmic tasks - like propositional logical inference, listops (in multiple OOD settings) - alongside benchmarks in LRA and other [4] and utilizes a modern gated recurrent cell inspired from Ordered Memory.
