In EDM, natural-language inputs are first translated into structured semantic and risk representations that expose affective intensity, therapeutic needs, and graded hazard estimates. These representations then condition a protocol-aware generation stage that enforces domain-specific safeguards and ethical constraints so that responses remain therapeutically appropriate while avoiding potentially harmful content. We constructed a diagnostically calibrated dialogue repository and validated it through clinician-mediated verification to ensure clinical fidelity.\nHuman involvement in EDM is limited to data annotation and post-hoc validation, without direct participation in inference or decision-making. Our evaluation adopts a hybrid methodology that combines computational-linguistic measures, bias screening, and a five-dimensional clinical assessment spanning therapeutic alignment, empathetic congruence, contextual consistency, task utility, and safety adherence. Comparative experiments demonstrate marked gains over baseline systems in contextual adaptation, reduction of hazardous outputs, and alignment with clinician judgments.\nThe main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we propose a stratified processing paradigm that separates risk assessment from therapeutic response synthesis and embeds layered safety protocols. Second, we present a unified evaluation framework that blends automated metrics with clinical oversight. Third, we establish practical design principles for ethically governed mental-health language systems and indicate future directions in cross-cultural adaptation and multimodal clinical decision support.", "tldr": "We propose a dual-phase prompt framework that enhances safety and therapeutic relevance in mental health language models.", "keywords": ["Therapeutic Dialogue Systems", "Large Language Models", "Safety-Constrained Prompt Design", "Contextual Risk Stratification", "Therapeutic Alliance Modeling", "Affective State Inference", "Clinical AI Safeguards"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/66be09803fa720c6dab67bacddcd58c2e6c237ff.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/55f3f0db50b926fec48988ced1cb1effebc89371.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Ethical Dialogue Modeling (EDM), a two-phase framework designed to make large language models safer and more clinically reliable for mental health dialogue.

They make the paper look more technical but do not represent genuinely new algorithms or theoretical advances. Much of what is written in mathematical form could be described in plain language without loss of substance.\n\n3- Hazard class is chosen by calibrated cutoffs on a softmax risk vector; small calibration drift can flip LOW↔MEDIUM↔HIGH and change the route (self-serve vs clinician).

Specify splits, counts per category, selection criteria, inclusion/exclusion rules, and how each phase (simulation, role-play, evaluation) maps to the research questions.\n\n3- The methodology section has no citations. It’s unclear whether the results build on established metrics, evaluation criteria, or psychological foundations. This is concerning since the methodology should be built on a clear foundation.\n\n4- The framework and dataset are not released.

The authors also conduct a qualitative analysis of failure modes (metaphor misinterpretation, cultural bias, over-referral)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "## Weakness 1 \n\nThe authors claim to address limitations in therapeutic LLMs but don't adequately discuss known failure modes like bias and symptom exaggeration documented in prior work (e.g., https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3715275.3732039 and https://openreview.net/forum?id=1pgfvZj0Rx#discussion). How does EDM specifically mitigate these established problems?\n\nAlso, the paper emphasizes localization and cross-cultural adaptation as future work, yet doesn't clarify how the current system performs across different cultural contexts or healthcare systems. What evidence supports clinical applicability beyond English-speaking settings?\n\n## Weakness 2\n\nThe dual-phase architecture combines standard components (affect detection, risk classification, constrained decoding) without clear novelty over existing therapeutic LLM work. What is the specific algorithmic advance beyond combining existing techniques?\n\nThe mathematical formulation (Eqs. 10–18) appears to add complexity without justified benefit (memory mechanisms and orthogonality penalties are borrowed from standard literature without ablation studies demonstrating their necessity). Adding much needed details to the conducted experiments would make the paper stronger. \n\n## Weakness 3\n\nThe discrete hazard class (Eq. 6) is defined algorithmically but lacks a clinically grounded rubric with verifiable criteria that could be explained to domain experts. What explicit criteria distinguish \"HIGH\" from \"MEDIUM\" risk, and who determined these? The paper states thresholds are \"calibrated\" but provides no actual threshold values, the process for setting them, or sensitivity analysis showing how different thresholds affect false negatives (critical for safety). How were τ_high and τ_med determined and validated? Why are high-risk and medium-risk categories measured separately rather than using a continuous risk score? What justifies this discretization?\n\n## Weaknes 4\n\nThe authors claim to solve cognitive bias (line 109) through \"clinician-supervised validation,\" but this looks like circular reasoning, as human clinicians have documented biases. What specific mechanisms prevent clinician bias from being amplified in your system? Also, the paper mentions \"bias screening\" in Section 3.2 with zero implementation details, methodology, or bias metrics reported. What bias assessment was actually conducted, and where are the results?\n\n## Weakness 5\n\nThe seemingly used dialogue corpus (n=1000: 600 simulated, 400 role-play) lacks any transparency: Where did the role-play sessions originate, who conducted and verified them, and what do \"constrained prompts\" mean? This is essential for assessing representativeness and quality. The 18.2% content exclusion rate in the safety filtering pipeline is mentioned without explanation of what was excluded or why. What types of content were filtered out, and could this bias the training data?\n\n## Weakness 6\n\nThe \"high-stakes scenarios\" (n=25) lack documentation of their source, who created them, what content they contain, and how quality was verified. Are these scenarios published or available for independent evaluation?\n\n## Weakness 7 \n\nThe three prompting baselines (P_COT, P_RLHF+, P_CLIN) are described in generic terms (\"standard chain-of-thought,\" \"clinical scaffolding\") but no actual prompts or implementation details are provided. How can anyone reproduce or critique your experimental setup? What exactly is the \"clinical scaffolding\" in P_CLIN, and which specific therapeutic protocols or evidence-based interventions does it incorporate? This is too vague to evaluate or replicate. What RLHF training procedure was used for P_RLHF+, what was the reward model, and how many human annotations were required? The description is insufficient.\n\n## Weakness 8 \n\nThe clinician panel is described only as having \"mean experience µ_exp = 14.3 years\" with no information on panel size, geographic location, clinical specialization, or which countries' regulatory bodies licensed them. How representative is this sample?\n\n## Weakness 9 \n\nThe paper claims IRB approval for an 8-week RCT (N=120) but provides no IRB number, approval date, protocol registration link, or study location. Without these identifiers, the claimed human subjects research cannot be independently verified. Section G.9 vaguely mentions \"clinical partnerships and community outreach\" for recruitment but provides no specifics on study sites, inclusion criteria, or participant demographics. Where and how was this trial conducted?\n\nThe trial results (Table 6) show large effect sizes (d=1.24 for BDI, d=1.37 for GAD-7) compared to controls. What was the control condition exactly, and were there any baseline differences between groups?\n\n## Weakness 10 \n\nTable 2 reports multimodal efficacy but provides no error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests. Were differences between conditions statistically significant? Table 5 (n=50 extreme scenarios) reports percentages without uncertainty quantification or statistical tests. With such a small sample, how confident can we be in these results? Table 4 reports Cohen's κ but without confidence intervals or formal inter-rater agreement tests beyond point estimates. What are the 95% CIs?\n\n## Weakness 11\n\nNo actual prompts, threshold values, hazard classification rubric, or code are provided anywhere in the paper. This work is effectively non-reproducible as written (what materials will be made available and under what license)? The metaphor detector achieves 96.8% accuracy (line 363) but there's no description of the training dataset, test set, or validation procedure. Where was this component trained and evaluated? The paper claims to have constructed \"a diagnostically calibrated dialogue repository\" but provides no repository link, data release plan, or access information. Will this dataset be made public?\n\n## Weakenss 12\n\nThe paper compares EDM to automated baselines but not to human therapist performance in terms of accuracy, therapeutic alliance, or adverse outcomes. How does EDM compare to actual human clinicians on the same cases?\n\n## Weakness 13\n\nWho is \"the user\" in the deployed pipeline (the patient, a clinician, or both)? The application scenario remains unclear throughout the paper. What is the actual clinical workflow you envision? Was the system tested for sensitivity to patient demographic information (race, gender, socioeconomic status, etc.)? Such biases are well-documented in healthcare AI but no analysis is presented.\n\n## Weakness 14\n\nThe safety analysis is based on only n=25 high-stakes scenarios and n=50 extreme scenarios (both insufficient sample sizes for drawing robust conclusions about real-world safety). How was the representativeness of these edge cases validated? The paper claims \"emergency protocols activated for all critical-risk inputs (100%)\" but doesn't define what triggers an emergency or discuss false-positive rates for unnecessary escalation. Over-referral can desensitize users to legitimate warnings.\n\n## Weakness 15 \n\nImproving general clarity: The related work section is embedded in the introduction rather than presented as its own section, making it difficult to assess how this work positions relative to existing literature. Consider restructuring for clarity. This paper conflates novelty with complexity (many mathematical formulations add notation without proportional insight, see https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03341 on mathy-ness).
