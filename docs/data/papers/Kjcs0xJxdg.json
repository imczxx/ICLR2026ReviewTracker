We propose Projection Convex Hull (PCH), a scalable framework for learning polyhedral trust regions in high-dimensional spaces. Starting from an exact MINLP formulation, we derive an unconstrained surrogate objective and show that, under suitable weight assignments, the optimal hyperplanes of the MINLP are recovered as stationary points of the surrogate. Building on this theoretical foundation, PCH adaptively constructs and refines hyperplanes by subregion partition, strategic weight assignment, and gradient-based updates, yielding convex hulls that tightly enclose the positive class while excluding negatives. The learned polyhedra can serve as geometric trust regions to enhance selective classification and constraint learning. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that PCH achieves strong performance in accuracy, scalability, and model compactness, outperforming classical geometric algorithms and recent optimization-based approaches, especially in high-dimensional and large-scale settings. These results confirm the value of PCH as a theoretically grounded and practically effective framework for trust-region learning.", "tldr": "We introduce Projection Convex Hull (PCH), a scalable framework that constructs boundary-tight convex hulls, enhancing downstream tasks such as selective classification and constraint learning.", "keywords": ["Convex hull learning", "boundary-tight separation", "scalable polyhedral separation", "constraint learning"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/427698196d932414bc748fe3e5aea01ceea91dfa.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the Projection Convex Hull (PCH) method, a scalable framework for learning polyhedral trust regions in high-dimensional spaces.

The fundamental problem of computing the tight convex hull is actually a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP). Classical geometric methods suffer from complexity that grows exponentially with dimension, and existing optimization-based approaches lack practical scalability.\n\nThe authors overcome this challenge through a rigorous theoretical decomposition. They first formally express the convex hull problem as a MINLP that explicitly accounts for model compactness. Then, they reduce the problem into multiple subproblems that handle one hyperplane at once. The authors prove that the solution for finding the optimal hyperplanes can be recovered as a stationary point of an unconstrained surrogate objective function under suitable weights. This surrogate loss function is minimized using gradient steps. The weight for each negative point is carefully designed and updated during this process to ensure that minimizing the weighted surrogate function is equivalent to maximizing the intended separation margin of the original MINLP.\n\nIn practice, the PCH framework achieves structural adaptivity: it dynamically manages the model complexity by pruning redundant hyperplanes and adding new ones if the current hull still incorrectly encloses negative samples.
