Existing graph generators either model topology changes (i.e., edge additions/deletions) or focus only on static graph properties (such as degree distributions or motifs), without considering how temporal signals shape the generated structure. By approaching the problem from an unconventional perspective, we introduce temporally attributed graphs, named TANGEM, that integrate a temporal similarity matrix into biased random walks, thereby coupling signals with structure to generate graphs that highlight patterns reflecting how nodes co-activate over time. We evaluate TANGEM using an approach that separates structural fidelity (clustering, spectral metrics) from downstream temporal consistency, allowing us to clearly isolate the impact of the topology generator itself. In time series benchmarks, TANGEM consistently outperforms strong baselines in structural metrics while remaining lightweight, learning from a single graph.

It is interesting that the paper proposes to use the information contained in temporal node features to guide the generation of the graph topology."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Ambiguity of the task and unclear motivation**\nThe main concern lies in the aim of the paper. The task is defined as generating graphs from a graph with a fixed topology and temporally varying node features (the authors call such graphs “temporally attributed graphs,” but this concept already exists in the literature and is commonly referred to as spatiotemporal graphs [1]). However, the proposed model ultimately generates only a static graph structure—temporal features are not generated or represented in the output. As a result, the problem reduces to generating a static graph from a spatiotemporal one.\n\nIn general, generating synthetic graphs similar to observed ones can be meaningful for data augmentation, privacy preservation, or simulation purposes, when the goal is to sample from the same underlying distribution of graphs. But in this case, what is the motivation for generating a single static synthetic graph from one spatiotemporal graph? What is the expected use case of such a generated graph? Since temporal features are discarded in the output, it is unclear what practical or scientific insight is gained. The authors should provide a clear rationale or concrete examples of scenarios where this task is useful.\n\n**Confusing exposition**\n The methodological explanation is confusing and makes it difficult to follow an otherwise conceptually simple idea. In particular, a) the formal mathematical definition of the task to be solved is missing; b) random walks and the temporal bias used are introduced before explaining their role in the pipeline, leaving the reader disoriented; 3c the transformer component is described without clearly specifying what it takes as input and how its outputs are transformed into a new graph. Overall, the idea itself is not complex, but the writing makes it hard to understand.\n\n**Similarity function**\nEquation (1) defines the temporal similarity as $S_{ij} = f(x_i, x_j)$, but in the main text it is never stated what this function $f$ actually is. In the appendix, you mention that it could be a cosine similarity or a correlation function, but this is not clearly justified or discussed. It is important to remember that $x_i$ and $x_j$ are not simple vectors --- they are time series, carrying temporal structure and dependencies. Measuring similarity between two time series is a non-trivial task, and reducing it to a simple vector similarity (like cosine) is quite limiting. What function $f$ did you actually use in your experiments? Did you consider more appropriate similarity measures that account for the temporal nature of these features (e.g., DTW, temporal kernels, or cross-correlation over time)?  The same applies to the parameter $q$ in the random walk: its value is never specified, nor is there any sensitivity analysis. How was $q$ chosen, and have you tested how sensitive the model is to its variation?\n\n**Choice of datasets**\nAlthough several standard spatiotemporal graph datasets exist (e.g., METR-LA [2], CER-E [3], AQI [4], ENG-RAD [5]), the paper instead uses a static benchmarks such as CiteSeer, where synthetic temporal features are artificially generated via a heat diffusion process. This weakens the empirical validation, since it does not demonstrate the method’s utility in realistic spatiotemporal scenarios. The authors should justify this choice.\n\n**Minor issues**\nIn the abstract, the phrase “we introduce temporally attributed graphs, namely TANGEM” is inaccurate as the paper introduces a method, not a new type of graph. Figure 1 is never explicitly referenced in the text and still contains LaTeX artifacts. Appendix A.4 is empty (it seems it should contain the table on the following page, but without text referring to it, it appears blank).\n\n\n[1] Cini, Andrea, et al. \"Graph deep learning for time series forecasting.\" ACM Computing Surveys 57.12 (2025): 1-34.\n[2] Zeng Li, Clifford Lam, Jianfeng Yao, and Qiwei Yao. 2019.

For this, they propose a biased second-order random walk on the static graph topology, which integrates two mechanisms to bias transition probabilities. The first strategy uses topological features inspired by node2vec, where a bias parameter of second-order transition probabilities influences the exploration/exploitation behavior of the walk based on the static topology of the graph. The second mechanism is based on a temporal similarity matrix that captures the pairwise alignment of node attributes in time serie data capturing evolving node attributes in a static graph. The entries of this temporal correlation matrix are used as a \"temporal bias\" p(u,v) that influences the probability of a random walker currently residing in node u to move to a neighbor node v.\n\nThe actual graph generation is then considered as a autoregressive generation of a node sequence, where a transformer model is trained on node sequences sampled from the biased random walk model. As far as I understood this part of the work (see my question on ths below) the generated sequences are then aggregated into a static graph, thus discarding any sequential patterns in the biased random walk sequences that may have been captured by the second-order random walk model or the transformer model. \n\nThe authors evaluate their approach in four rather small data sets, three empirical graphs on traffic time series in road networks (256, 294 and 237 nodes) and a third one using a simple diffusion model to generate temporal signals in a static citation network (2120 nodes). The results of the graph generation are compared to simple random graph models and deep graph generation models, comparing degree distributions, clustering coefficient, spectral properties and motifs.

It is unclear what the key component - the temporal bias in the second-order random walk - contributes to the results, see my question Q6 - Q8 below."}, "questions": {"value": "[Q1] Referring to W1 above, please clarify early on in the paper what is expected input and output of your generative model. I understood that the input is a time-attributed graph, while the output is a simple static, unweighted and directed graph (it is not even made clear whether this is weighted, unweighted, directed or undirected). Is this assumption correct? If my assumption is correct, then the statement in the conclusion that TANGEM is \"a generator for temporally attributed graphs with fixed topology\" is misleading, since it does not actually generate temporally attributed graphs (it rather uses such graphs to generate static graphs). Please clarify. \n\n[Q2] I did not grasp the intuition behind Eq.7, which extends the temporal bias to the second-order neighborhood of nodes. I would argue that the influence of second-order influence between nodes should already be subsumed in the temporal similarity matrix, which is based on the temporal alignment of node attributes in the underlying graph - assuming that the influence between nodes transitively expands beyond the immediate neighbors. Could you explain why second-order influence is explicitly modeled and why we do not need to extend this to, e.g., third-order neighbors? \n\n[Q3] Related to W2 above, I think the assumptions about the process underlying the node attribute dynamics captured in the temporal similarity matrix should be laid out more clearly. As an example, for the traffic data used in the experimental evaluation, there is an underlying process that moves a conserved quantity (vehicles) through a static graph and those vehicles are likely to move on trajectories that cannot be modelled by a first-order Markov model. For the CiteSeer data set, the authors used a particularly simple heat-diffusion process, which has the Markov property and follows a linear dynamics. The assumptions baked into those processes are never made clear, and clarifying for what processes the authors deem their model suitable would greatly help the reader to appreciate the contributions of this work. Could you clarify what you assume about the underlying process?\n\n[Q4] Related to W3, while I liked the idea of the temporally biased random walk model, the authors lost me when they describe the transformer-based graph generation process. First of all, it is a major omission that the authors never clearly state what exact output their model generates. My assumption is that it is a simple, unweighted possibly directed static graph but this should be made clear. Second, if I my assumption is correct, I do not understand what the transformer model (and the biased second-order random walk) which are both modelling sequential patterns contribute, since the generated sequences are anyway simply aggregated into a graph, which discards any sequential patterns that involve more than two consecutive nodes. Could the authors explain this important aspect of their approach?\n\n[Q5] The use of the transformer model is motivated from a computational efficiency point of view, however there is no evaluation of this. Especially for the small examples used in the evaluation, there will definitely not be any issues of sampling graphs from a biased second-order random walk (which can be done using the node2vec implementation for graph that are larger by many orders of magnitude). Could the authors clarify this?\n\n[Q6] The evaluation metrics are unclear and make it virtually impossible to interpret the results. In section 4.3 the authors state that they calculate the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for several \"structural properties\". First, I would have preferred a clear motivation for the choice of MMD as a measure. Second, some of those properties are distributions (e.g. degree distribution) where a MMD makes sense, but other properties are single values (e.g. the clustering coefficient) where it is unclear what the value means. Moreover, even the stated intepretation of the metrics is wrong, sincde the authors state that the clustering coefficient captures \"community structure\", which is clearly not the case. Could it be that the authors have confused \"cluster patterns\" in the sense of community structure with \"clustering\" in the sense of closed triangles or transitivity in graphs? On another note, the authors should clearly define their metrics (or at least cite the respective works). \n\n[Q7] I was very confused by Figure 3, where the textual description and figure caption seem to suggest that the figure contains graphs generated by the proposed TANGEM model, but where I cannot find this in the figure. Also, what does DyGG refer to? Is this a leftover from a previous version of the manuscript and it should read TANGEM?\n\n[Q8] A key question that I had while reading the experimental evaluation is what the actual contribution of this work, the temporally biased second-order random walk, contributes to the model. This could be seen as an ablation study and as far as I understood the authors, this is somehow addressed in Figure 4, where different random walk strategies are compared. In particular, a comparison between the BRW and BRW+ seems interesting, as I understood that BRW+ essentially corresponds to the proposed model (this should be clearly stated) while BRW corresponds to the second-order random walk in node2vec with fixed parameter q and no temporal bias. First of all, it is not clear how this parameter q has been chosen for the experimental results. Second, the results seem to suggest that the differences between the biased random walk with and without temporal bias are rather small (it is also unclear whether they are even significant since the measures have been normalized, no variance is given and there is no statement on how many instances were compared). This potentially diminishes the key contribution of the work, and should thus be made clear."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "RMFEVTCrdA", "forum": "9JCknIXbDo", "replyto": "9JCknIXbDo", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24753/Reviewer_ExbD"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24753/Reviewer_ExbD"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24753/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762005481778, "cdate": 1762005481778, "tmdate": 1762943185333, "mdate": 1762943185333, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
