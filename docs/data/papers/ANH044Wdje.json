Most LAE models, including the Emphasized Denoising Linear Autoencoder (EDLAE) introduced by (Steck, 2020), use quadratic loss during training. However, the original EDLAE only provides closed-form solutions for the hyperparameter choice $b = 0$, which limits its capacity. In this work, we generalize EDLAE objective function into a Decoupled Expected Quadratic Loss (DEQL). We show that DEQL simplifies the process of deriving EDLAE solutions and reveals solutions in a broader hyperparameter range $b > 0$, which were not derived in Steck’s original paper. Additionally, we propose an efficient algorithm based on Miller’s matrix inverse theorem to ensure the computational tractability for the $b > 0$ case.

The main contributions of this work are:\n\n1. **Theoretical Generalization:** Using the DEQL framework, the authors derive a general closed-form solution (minimizer) for the expected quadratic loss.\n2. **Expanded Solution Space:** They apply this general solution back to the EDLAE objective, successfully deriving closed-form solutions for the previously unexplored hyperparameter regime of b>0.\n3. **Efficient Algorithm:** Recognizing that a naive computation of these new b>0 solutions is computationally prohibitive ($O(n^4)$), the authors propose a novel and efficient algorithm based on the Miller matrix inversion theorem.\n4. **Complexity Reduction:** This algorithm reduces the complexity to $O(n^3)$, making it practical and comparable to existing methods like EASE and the b=0 EDLAE baseline.\n5. **Empirical Validation:** Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show that the newly derived solutions for b>0 (especially when combined with $L_2$ regularization, termed DEQL(L2)) consistently and significantly outperform the original b=0 EDLAE baseline.\n6.

It provides a clearer and more principled statistical framework for understanding this class of models. Deriving the closed-form solution for the b>0 case is a non-trivial and significant extension of prior work.\n- **Practical Algorithmic Contribution:** A major strength is that the authors did not stop at the computationally intractable $O(n^4)$ solution. The development of the $O(n^3)$ algorithm using the Miller matrix inversion theorem is a crucial contribution that makes the entire theoretical framework practical and usable. This new algorithm maintains the same complexity as the original EASE and EDLAE (b=0) models.\n- **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is extremely well-written and easy to follow. The motivation is clear, and the logical flow—from the limitation of EDLAE, to the general DEQL framework, to the specific b>0 solution, and finally to the efficient algorithm—is impeccable. The mathematical derivations are clean and well-explained.\n- **Significance and Empirical Results:** The empirical validation is thorough and convincing. The proposed b>0 solution (specifically DEQL(L2)) demonstrates consistent and sometimes substantial performance gains over the strong EDLAE baseline across all six datasets. The paper also reinforces the value of simple linear models, showing they remain competitive and, in some cases, superior to complex deep learning-based models while offering significantly faster (CPU-based) training.\n- Novel Insight: The finding (RQ2) that the zero-diagonal constraint—essential in models like EASE and EDLAE—is not strictly necessary when b>0 and $L_2$ regularization is applied is an important insight for future model development in this area."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Lack of Theoretical Guidance on Hyperparameters:** The DEQL framework successfully expands the solution space to b>0, but it does not provide theoretical guidance on *how* to select the optimal hyperparameters (e.g., the ratio b/a, p, or the $L_2$ coefficient $\\lambda$). Navigation of this newly expanded solution space still relies on empirical grid search, which can be costly. The paper proves *that* b>0 solutions are better, but not *which* b>0 solution is optimal a priori.\n2. **Computational Bottleneck:** While the $O(n^3)$ algorithm is a significant achievement, it still relies on the inversion of an $n \\times n$ matrix ($H_0$ or $H_0 + \\lambda I$). For datasets with a very large number of items (n), this $O(n^3)$ step remains a significant bottleneck, limiting its scalability into the high tens of thousands. This is an inherent limitation of this class of closed-form LAE models, but it remains a practical weakness.\n3. **'Pure' DEQL Performance:** The core theoretical contribution is the 'pure' DEQL solution (Eq. 9). However, the experimental results in Table 1 clearly show that this pure DEQL model performs poorly and is often worse than the EASE/EDLAE baselines. The strong performance gains are only realized *after* adding $L_2$ regularization (DEQL(L2)) or both $L_2$ and the zero-diag constraint. This suggests the primary practical contribution is not DEQL *per se*, but *regularized* DEQL. This is not a major flaw, but the paper's framing could be slightly more precise to reflect that the b>0 solution *requires* regularization (like $L_2$) to be effective, though this is standard practice anyway.\n4. The work's key contribution is performance uplift. However, the experimental gains shown in Table 1 are not statistically significant. For example, on ML-20M, Recall@20 improves from 0.3925 to 0.3934, and NDCG@20 from 0.3421 to 0.3426. On Netflix, the performance is identical. On MSD, the b=0 EDLAE baseline actually outperforms the proposed DEQL(L2+zero-diag). These minor and inconsistent gains hardly justify adopting a new solution, let alone the extra hyperparameter tuning for b.\n5. Concurrent research is working to break this cubic complexity bottleneck, e.g., via scalable iterative methods, graph-based approximations, or randomized linear algebra. The paper's contribution lacks some theoretical or experimental comparisons in terms of effectiveness and complexity with these works.\n6. The paper adds a new hyperparameter (b) to an already complex tuning space (dropout p, $L_2$ $\\lambda$). This runs counter to the broader research trend of seeking simplification for robust performance. Other recent work suggests that the dropout and $L_2$ terms already provide sufficient regularization, making an explicit b parameter slightly redundant."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **Sensitivity to b:** Related to Weakness 1, how sensitive is the model's performance to the choice of b (or the b/a ratio)? The grid search ranged from [0.1, 2.0]. Could you provide a brief analysis (perhaps with a plot) on the validation set showing how Recall@20 varies as b changes? Is there a clear 'sweet spot,' or is performance relatively flat across a wide range of b>0?\n2. **Statistical Significance:** The experimental gains in Table 1 (ML-20M, Netflix) appear to be well within the margin of error. Can the authors please provide statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) across multiple runs to demonstrate that the b>0 solutions are *truly* superior to the b=0 baseline? As it stands, the evidence suggests the gains are just noise from tuning an extra parameter.\n3. **Learned Diagonal Values:** You argue convincingly in RQ2 that the zero-diagonal constraint is not strictly necessary when b>0 and $L_2$ regularization is used (DEQL(L2)). This is a very interesting finding. In the DEQL(L2) model, what do the diagonal entries of the learned $W^*$ matrix look like? Are they small values close to zero (suggesting the $L_2$ norm effectively pushes them down), or do they take on meaningful non-zero values? This could offer insight into *why* the hard constraint is no longer needed.\n4. **Ablation of b vs. $\\lambda$:** The 'naive' DEQL (Eq. 9) performs poorly, and strong results are only obtained with DEQL(L2). This suggests the $L_2$ regularization is doing the heavy lifting, not the b>0 formulation. Could the b=0 EDLAE baseline achieve the same performance as DEQL(L2) if its $L_2$ hyperparameter ($\\lambda$) was simply tuned more aggressively over a wider range?\n5. **Scalability and Approximation:** The $O(n^3)$ inversion of $H_0$ is the main bottleneck. Have the authors considered or can they comment on using approximation techniques for $(H_0 + \\lambda I)^{-1}$? For example, would an iterative solver (e.g., Conjugate Gradient) or a low-rank approximation of $H_0$ be a viable path for scaling this method to n >> 50,000 items? This would break the pure 'closed-form' nature but might offer a practical path to larger datasets.\n6. Generality of the Algorithm: The efficient $O(n^3)$ algorithm relies on $H^{(i)}$ being a low-rank (specifically, rank-2) update to a common matrix $H_0$. This structure arises from the specific dropout/emphasis scheme of EDLAE. Is this low-rank structure a fundamental property of DEQL, or just a property of this specific instantiation? In other words, could other formulations of DEQL (i.e., different choices for $\\mathcal{D}^{(i)}$ in Def 3.1) lead to $H^{(i)}$ matrices that do not have this structure, making the Miller theorem speedup inapplicable?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "pp4SS4zIRa", "forum": "ANH044Wdje", "replyto": "ANH044Wdje", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14126/Reviewer_9r8b"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14126/Reviewer_9r8b"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14126/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761307741740, "cdate": 1761307741740, "tmdate": 1762924593228, "mdate": 1762924593228, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This manuscript proposes a generalization of EDLAE named Decoupled Expected Quadratic Loss (DEQL), which extends the theoretical formulation and provides closed-form solutions for a wider range of hyperparameters range b>0.
