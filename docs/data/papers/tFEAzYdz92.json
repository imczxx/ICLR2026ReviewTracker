The paper should deeply contrast with OmegaPRM (automated process supervision via MCTS) which established scalable step-labeling at large scale in math reasoning (1.5M annotations) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06592), and with recent generative/critic-style PRMs designed to explain and correct steps such as GM-PRM and VisualPRM/Athena-PRM (multimodal, but methodologically very close in “PRM generates critiques + refines BoN”) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04088). The proposed “generative PRM” feels incremental w.r.t. these trends.\n\n2. The paper claims >30% severe flaws in mainstream OR data and a rigorous three-stage filter, but I don’t see inter-rater reliability, error taxonomy distributions, or random spot-check protocols beyond illustrative examples. Given PRM sensitivity to label noise (documented in PRM surveys/lessons) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07301) , stronger auditing is necessary.\n\n3. Step labeling and final verification heavily rely on strong LLMs (GPT-4o/Qwen verifiers) inside the pipeline that also guide critique at inference. Without cross-model, cross-vendor checks and held-out validators, there is potential circularity (the critic agrees with the validator it was trained/selected with).\n\n4. Since BoN/selection tends to give large lifts, the paper should compare against strong non-PRM baselines (self-consistency; majority vote with route-length filters; retrieval-augmented PRM or OOD-robust PRMs) that recent works show to be competitive, e.g., Retrieval-Augmented PRM (R-PRM / RAPRM) and R-PRM variants focusing on OOD and data bootstrapping. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14361) Current ablations (e.g., “Major Voting”) look weak and not representative of the SOTA toolkit.\n\n5. OR is a heterogeneous space (LP/MILP/NLP/CP-SAT with industry quirks). I don’t see OOD splits (new templates, new constraint families, solver switches) or robustness to noisy/problematic instances (e.g., infeasible but realistic specs). OOD weaknesses are a known pain point for PRMs. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14361) \n\n6. The Modeling→Critique→Code pipeline may conflate several effects: (i) data curation, (ii) structured prompts, (iii) critic guidance. A factorized ablation (swap in a scalar PRM; blind the critic to code; remove “Corrected Step”) would clarify whether “generative PRM” itself is the key.\n\n7.Important but under-specified: exact prompts, MCTS hyper-parameters per task, GPT-4o temperature and refusal handling, and the policy/critic decoupling at test time (who conditions on whom)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. How often does GPT-4o disagree with the MCTS label? Show confusion matrices and human audits on a random 500-step sample. How many “corrections” by GPT-4o were later proven wrong?\n\n2. If you allow the critic to emit corrections (you already do), can you implement Refined-BoN like GM-PRM and report deltas? (https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04088)\n\n3. Evaluate with new solver backends (e.g., Pyomo→PuLP / OR-Tools), new template families, and noisy text to test OOD per RAPRM concerns. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14361)\n\n4. Ablate the “generative” aspect: Replace the critic with (i) scalar PRM, (ii) critique-only (no correction), (iii) correction-only (no explanation). Which component drives Complex-LP gains?\n\n5. Add self-consistency, vote-with-length-normalization, and retrieval-augmented PRM. Current “Major Voting” is too weak to claim SOTA.(https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14361)\n\n6. End-to-end token/cost for data curation + training + inference (critic calls per step)? Compare with OmegaPRM’s cost per step label. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06592)\n\n7. Failure modes: Provide qualitative cases where OR-PRM gives confident but wrong constraints/objectives (classic OR pitfall), and whether the system catches feasible but semantically wrong models.\n\n8. For 100 randomly sampled instances, have expert OR graders rate the usefulness and correctness of critiques (Likert & error-type taxonomy). Your current evidence relies mostly on automatic verifiers.\n\n9.  As far as I know, the algorithm complexity of MCTS is relatively high, and I am interested in the impact of introducing MCTS on computational efficiency.\n\n10.
