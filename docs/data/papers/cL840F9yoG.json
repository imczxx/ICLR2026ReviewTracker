Yet, they struggle in logical reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models, but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al. 2025), which introduces a novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers, achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls for in-depth investigation.  In this work, we perform a critical review on this class of models, examine key design choices and demonstrate interesting variants that significantly outperform what is reported on the Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard tasks. Our results also raise surprising observations and intriguing directions for further research.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["2D reasoning", "recurrence", "transformers"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
