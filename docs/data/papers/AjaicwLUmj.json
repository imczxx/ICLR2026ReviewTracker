Enablement of prompt-specific instructions as inputs creates new horizons in implementation of interactive charts controlled by AIP Agents. In this paper we outline new approach to visualize the multi-variate timeseries with explanatory features at point in time. Palantir Foundry is perfect platform for this task and fully equipped with AIP-powered capabilities. Combination of the AIP Agents and customizable vega-chart Wirbelsäule-Plot becomes valuable resource for conducting comprehensive analysis.
