Traditional safety alignment techniques often result in overly cautious models that excessively refuse user queries, degrading the user experience. In this paper, we introduce **ReAlign**, a novel framework for re-aligning LRMs for safety through Reinforcement Learning (RL). ReAlign leverages a sophisticated reward system that integrates feedback from a safety verifier (a guard model), a general reward model for response quality, and a novel response refusal penalty. We apply ReAlign to the Qwen3-4B model and conduct extensive evaluations. Our results demonstrate that the re-aligned model achieves significant safety improvements in both thinking and non-thinking reasoning modes while maintaining high response quality and preserving its capabilities on diverse benchmarks, including Arena-Hard-V2, AIME-25, LiveCodeBench-V6, and GPQA. Critically, unlike previous methods, **ReAlign** does not increase the model's refusal rate. We also provide a systematic analysis of the relationship between the safety of a model's internal *CoT* and its *final answer*, establishing that a safe trace contributes to a safe output, but the two are partially decoupled. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed comparative study with a rejection-sampling-based Supervised-Finetuning (SFT) approach designed on the same principles as our RL method. This analysis reveals key failures in SFT, explaining why it is less suitable for LRMs safety alignment. We also discuss the robustness of the aligned model across different reasoning modes and against adaptive jailbreak attacks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "RLVR", "LLM Safety"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8272189b5dcb398fcde771032f56fa2dca1443c4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "ReAlign tackles a core problem that arises in safety training for LRMs: over-refusal.

While it has been known that reasoning helps with safety, it is unclear how or why it helps. For example, does reasoning help because it explores by pondering on harmful thoughts or because longer safe context drives the model to be more safe? How does reasoning compare to non-reasoning? This paper conducts the following analysis that helps understand these questions. \n>- Analysis on reasoning safety vs. answer safety: This work tries to understand how reasoning safety impacts answer safety by directly imposing a reward on the reasoning, which previous work has not done. The results hint that safer reasoning is not necessary for answer safety when training on outcome based rewards and that such RL training approaches might not make the model learn a strong correlation between reasoning and final answer. This suggests that reasoning in the safety domain may be different from reasoning in the math domain.\n>- Thinking vs. non-thinking training: As hybrid models with both thinking and non-thinking mode are becoming popular, the results on transferability give insight into how we should compose training data. \n2. This paper utilizes online RL for safety. Most work that leverages reasoning for safety adapt SFT/DPO approaches with only a few utilizing RL. More exploration of RL-based approaches are timely."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. There is no baseline comparison to prior work. Prior work also tackles the same problem by training LRMs both through SFT [1-3] and RL [4, 5]. Since this work proposes a new methodology, sufficient comparison to baselines is required to see how it fits into previous literature, especially against methods that use RL. \n2. Some contributions of this work are a hybrid reward model as a methodology and a comparison to SFT under controlled settings as an analysis. However, a similar idea has been proposed by TARS [5] where they use a dual reward system to solve the problem of safety-only (guard-only) rewards, also conducting controlled experiments comparing to SFT in the same setting as their RL setting. How does ReAlign compare with TARS?\n3. [6, 7] also have analysis on reasoning safety vs. answer safety. How the findings of ReAlign are different from [6, 7] should be discussed.\n4. Some related work is missing for SFT [1, 3] and RL [5] based approaches. Also, Deliberative Alignment [4] is mentioned as an SFT approach in line 680 but it is an RL approach. \n5. I think the claim in lines 439-449 is an overstatement. The reasoning degradation from distilled data (off-distribution) could depend on the teacher model and rejection sampling methodology. Furthermore, SFT data from the target model (on-distribution) not improving safety and maintaining reasoning seems intuitive, even when rejection sampled, because the model does not have much to learn from its own generations.\n6. In lines 446-447, it states that reasoning performance was degraded because “ArenaHard-v2 score from 9.5 to 8.4”. However, in lines 310-311, it refers to a similar score difference on the utility benchmarks as “a negligible delta of one another”. The rubric for “negligible” seems arbitrary.\n\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Wang, Zijun, et al. \"Star-1: Safer alignment of reasoning llms with 1k data.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.01903 (2025).\n\n[2] Jiang, Fengqing, et al. \"Safechain: Safety of language models with long chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2502.12025 (2025).\n\n[3] Zhang, Yichi, et al. \"Realsafe-r1: Safety-aligned deepseek-r1 without compromising reasoning capability.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.10081 (2025).\n\n[4] Guan, Melody Y., et al. \"Deliberative alignment: Reasoning enables safer language models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2412.16339 (2024).\n\n[5] Kim, Taeyoun, et al. \"Reasoning as an Adaptive Defense for Safety.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.00971 (2025).\n\n[6] Zhou, Kaiwen, et al. \"The hidden risks of large reasoning models: A safety assessment of r1.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2502.12659 (2025).\n\n[7] Zhang, Yichi, et al. \"Towards Safe Reasoning in Large Reasoning Models via Corrective Intervention.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2509.24393 (2025)."}, "questions": {"value": "Additional comments and questions:\n\n1.

They introduce a method called ReAlign, where they train a reasoning model with a hybrid reward system, penalizing both unsafe behaviors and refusals, and rewarding safer and high quality responses.

I would list them in the order of descending severity, i.e., the first one being most severe and so on.\n\n# Potential Flaw in the Problem Setting (Conflicts with COT monitorability)\n\nThe biggest weakness of this paper is actually in the problem setting of attempting to make the chain-of-thoughts themselves safe, instead of just keeping the final response safe. **While the paper studies reward mechanisms not involving safety of the COT itself**, the main method, described in Section 3.1, has a penalty for unsafe COTs. I think this makes the whole method questionable from the COT monitorability perspective.\n\nBelow is line 352-353 copied from the paper:\n\n> it is beneficial to include CoT data and to supervise the safety of the CoT.\n\nThis conclusion is made based on the single observation that supervising safety of the COT increases safety of the COT. The final answer safety seems unaffected by this. This is a pretty strong statement given prior works that disagree with supervising COT safety directly. Prior works [1, 2] have described how making chain-of-thoughts safer can harm monitorability of modern reasoning LLMs. [1] shows that for a strong reasoning model like o3-mini, prolonged training to apply optimization pressure on the COT directly can lead to obfuscation, where the model can take harmful/unsafe actions while obfuscating their thoughts in the COT, which may make it **much harder** to actually prevent unsafe behaviors. In other words, making COTs safe does not mean that very strong reasoning models like o3-mini will become safe — these models might just learn to obfuscate their chain-of-thoughts. **A very strong counter-argument will be needed supporting why we need to make COTs safe instead of just the final answers, given the results from frontier reasoning models like o3-mini presented in [1], to justify why COTs should be safe as well, given the risk to monitorability that this process may produce.**\n\n\n# Lack of novelty and contextualization\n\nSeveral aspects of the paper lack novelty, and do not cite/contextualize the method with prior work. For example, the hybrid reward system is similar to the one in TARS [4], and the data filtering system described below (copied from line 206-208)\n\n> Next, we (2) Filter this data to focus on challenging instances, discarding any prompt where all eight responses were either uniformly safe or uniformly unsafe\n\nis very similar to the filtering mechanism adapted by DAPO [5]. These works are not cited.\n\n# Lack of coverage for experimental results\n\nThis is probably the least important weakness, but the experiments in the paper are conducted using a single base model (Qwen3-4B). Running experiments with more base models and RL algorithms, datasets etc. will make the results presented in the paper more robust."}, "questions": {"value": "1. (**Comparison with TARS**) How is the reward system in this paper, combining a safety evaluation reward with general utility/quality reward, fundamentally different from the one proposed in TARS [4]? Both a qualitative comparison describing why this paper’s proposed method would be different/better compared to TARS, and a quantitative comparison showing the benefits of ReAlign over TARS, would significantly improve this paper’s quality.\n\n2. (**Experiment setup for Figure 2**) While Appendix D records the experiment setup for Figure 2 — I am not sure which subsets of the WildJailBreak dataset are used to measure the safety and refusal rates. I.e., is the entire evaluation dataset used to measure both the safety and refusal rates? This will be questionable, since the only way the model can often be safe on a harmful prompt is by refusing to answer it, and so safety and refusal rate has to have a positive correlation. On the other hand, if the authors used the benign prompts to calculate refusal rate and harmful prompts to calculate the safety rate, that would be the correct approach — but this should be properly clarified in the main text of the paper in section 2.1.\n\n3. (**Choice of RL algorithm**) While interesting, why did the authors choose GSPO instead of its more commonly used counterparts like GRPO/RLOO?\n\n4. (**Ablation over reward design**) If one chooses different penalty values for safety vs refusal in equation (1), how does the safety-refusal tradeoff of the resulting model vary?\n\n5. (**Training data construction**) Why are the authors generating 8 rollouts from the base model on a certain subset (it would be great if the authors can clarify how this subset is chosen) using the base model to create the training set of 13.7K COT and 6.7K without COT samples? For online RL, shouldn’t these responses be generated on-policy, using the current model, instead of the base model?\n\n\n# References\n\n[1] Monitoring Reasoning Models for Misbehavior and the Risks of Promoting Obfuscation, https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/34f2ada6-870f-4c26-9790-fd8def56387f/CoT_Monitoring.pdf\n\n[2] Chain of Thought Monitorability: A New and Fragile Opportunity for AI Safety, https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11473\n\n[3] Backtracking Improves Generation Safety, https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14586\n\n[4] Reasoning as an Adaptive Defense for Safety, https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00971\n\n[5] DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale, https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "o1Mb3My6eo", "forum": "XxYNlbTFYS", "replyto": "XxYNlbTFYS", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13046/Reviewer_SBnR"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13046/Reviewer_SBnR"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13046/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760938865935, "cdate": 1760938865935, "tmdate": 1762923780791, "mdate": 1762923780791, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ReAlign, an RL-based framework for safety alignment of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) using a Hybrid Reward System that balances safety, helpfulness, and refusal rate.

Authors spend one full section (Sec 2) belaboring an obvious point that there exists a trade-off between safety and refusal rates, or between safety and capability. This is neither surprising nor novel. Everyone working in alignment knows this. The \"evidence\" it presents (Figure 2, Table 1) merely confirms what is already widely understood in the community. More critically, its actual method occupies less than one page (Sec 3). The so-called \"hybrid reward system\" in Eq (1) is nothing more than a trivial piecewise function: assign -10 if unsafe, -5 if refusal, otherwise use a standard reward model. This is not a sophisticated design; it is a straightforward heuristic that any practitioner could devise in minutes. There is no principled derivation, no theoretical justification, and no insight into why these specific penalties should work.  \n\n- Second, this paper's claim about SFT's poor generalization (Sec 4.5) is not a novel finding. Prior work has already demonstrated that SFT fails to generalize for safety alignment tasks. This has been thoroughly documented in existing literature [1], making its extensive analysis of SFT failures redundant rather than insightful. Authors are actually rediscovering known limitations and presenting them as contributions, which I cannot recognize.\n\n- This paper's evaluation may also be insufficient. First, it only tests on Qwen3-4B. How do we know this approach works on other model families or scales? The generalization claim is entirely unsupported. Second, its safety evaluation relies heavily on Qwen3Guard and WildGuard, both of which are themselves imperfect classifiers. It provides no analysis of inter-annotator agreement, false positive rates, or robustness of its safety metrics. Third, where are comparisons against published safety alignment methods like Constitutional AI, Safe-RLHF, or  STAIR? \n\n- Moreover, this paper does not ablate the specific penalty values (-10 for unsafe, -5 for refusal). Why these numbers? How sensitive are the results to these choices? It does not compare its hybrid reward against simpler alternatives (e.g., binary safe/unsafe rewards with different magnitudes). Table 3 provides some ablation on CoT constraints, but it does not systematically ablate other design choices like the data filtering strategy, group size for advantage computation, or the relative weighting between safety and helpfulness.\n\n- Last but not least, the manuscript exhibits formatting issues that suggest insufficient attention to presentation standards like Table 1 exceeding the page margins.\n\n[1] SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training"}, "questions": {"value": "The questions are listed in the weakness and this paper may need massive revision."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "zoXQCI1d3O", "forum": "XxYNlbTFYS", "replyto": "XxYNlbTFYS", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13046/Reviewer_oD9g"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13046/Reviewer_oD9g"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13046/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761992126304, "cdate": 1761992126304, "tmdate": 1762923779315, "mdate": 1762923779315, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
