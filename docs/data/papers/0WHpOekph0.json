However, existing super-resolution approaches struggle to generate the high-frequency spatial information present in climate data, especially over regions showing complex terrain variability. A key obstacle lies in a frequency bias existing in both deep neural networks (DNNs) and climate data: DNNs exhibit such bias by overfitting to low-frequency information, which is further exacerbated by the prevalence of low-frequency components in climate data (e.g., plains, oceans). As a consequence, geography-dependent high-frequency details are hard to reconstruct from coarse climate inputs with DNNs. To improve the fidelity of climate super-resolution (SR), we introduce GeoFAR: by explicitly encoding climatic patterns at different frequencies, while learning implicit geographical neural representations (i.e., related to location and elevation), our approach provides frequency-aware and geography-informed representations for climate SR, thereby reconstructing fine-grained climate information at high resolution. Experiments show that GeoFAR is a model-agnostic approach that can mitigate high-frequency prediction errors in both deterministic and generative SR models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various spatial resolutions, atmospheric variables, and downscaling ratios.

This leads to performance degradation when applying DNNs to meteorological data super-resolution tasks, which are predominantly low-frequency. To address this issue, the authors propose GeoFAR, a plug-and-play module. GeoFAR encodes input data into frequency-domain representations and additionally introduces implicitly encoded spatial information as input to the DNN, thereby improving performance on climate data super-resolution tasks dominated by low-frequency content.

Implicitly encoding spatial information into features usable by neural networks is an important research direction in recent years, and the authors present a compelling practical application in the context of super-resolution."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Overall, I find this an interesting paper, but the experimental validation raises concerns:\n\n1. Directly downsampling high-resolution data to low resolution to form LR-HR pairs is an unreasonable practice. Such interpolation retains excessive high-frequency information. Given that the authors do not provide a detailed description of dataset construction, I question the validity of their datasets. Retaining excessive high-frequency details in the LR data constitutes information leakage—could this be the actual reason why GeoFAR, which optimizes in the frequency domain, appears effective? As shown in Table 1, comparing Global-to-Local Downscaling and Local Downscaling, the UNet results indicate that when the task involves real low-resolution to high-resolution data (e.g., ERA5-PRISM), the improvement from GeoFAR is significantly smaller than in simulated LR-HR scenarios.\n\n2. The current experimental results lack comprehensive validation. In quantitative remote sensing, it is common practice to use multiple independent data sources for cross-validation—for example, jointly using reanalysis data and actual remote sensing observations—rather than relying solely on reanalysis data.\n\n3. The paper suffers from significant writing issues, including imbalanced content depth, insufficient discussion of key issues, and poor organization. For instance, the related work section merely lists numerous existing methods without establishing a clear causal chain between “existing approaches” and the “problems summarized at the end of the section,” nor does it validate certain claims. Specifically, in Section 2.2, the authors hastily assert that “current methods remain based on natural images while poorly mimicking the biased frequency distribution of climate data,” yet they fail to provide a mathematical explanation for why existing methods underperform on meteorological data, nor do they compare against recent frequency-domain-based super-resolution methods presented at major conferences (e.g., BF-STVSR, DiffFNO)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can the authors validate the accuracy of their downscaling model using observational data—for example, by comparing against ground meteorological station measurements (evaluating accuracy at station-corresponding grid locations), MODIS LST (compared with ERA5 SKT), and GPM IMERG precipitation data (compared with ERA5 precipitation)?\n\n2. Can the authors provide additional details regarding dataset construction and validate the reasonableness of their approach? For instance, do the downsampled data exhibit similar high-frequency content and entropy to real-world low-resolution observations? To my knowledge, directly interpolating HR remote sensing data to LR resolution often retains excessive high-frequency details—a phenomenon easily verifiable by downsampling Sentinel-2 data to 500m and comparing it with MODIS data. The remote sensing community typically simulates LR data using multi-stage downsampling combined with smoothing. Could different dataset construction strategies lead to different conclusions?\n\n3. The authors repeatedly emphasize in the related work that existing DNNs fail to preserve high-frequency information and produce overly smooth outputs. However, as shown in Table 1, most tested DNNs already yield reasonably good results, and GeoFAR does not demonstrate a fundamental improvement. Does this suggest the authors overstate the limitations of current methods?\n\n4. GeoFAR essentially performs input-level data augmentation without modifying the internal architecture of the DNN. Will the injected high-frequency information still be forgotten by the network? Does GeoFAR truly address the core issue, or does it merely provide a superficial fix?\n\n5. How does GeoFAR compare against methods that explicitly incorporate frequency-domain considerations at the operator level? What about the latest methods from CVPR or ICCV 2025? Could GeoFAR be combined with them for even greater gains? (This would help substantiate the claim that GeoFAR is truly plug-and-play.)\n\n6. As an open-ended question: how well does GeoFAR perform on super-resolution of various remote sensing indices—for example, NDVI (from MODIS 500m to Landsat 30m)? Super-resolution of remote sensing indices is more amenable to cross-validation using independent high-resolution observational data.\n\n7. Can the authors add a clear statement of contributions?
