However, the inherent domain shift and rapid local adaptation in CD-FFT substantially amplify its susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing studies have just revealed the vulnerability of CD-FFT to backdoor threats, but fall short of exploring robust defense solutions. To bridge this gap, we first systematically evaluate the transferability of existing FL backdoor defenses to the CD-FFT setting, revealing their limited effectiveness under this more challenging scenario. Motivated by this, we propose Beacon, an innovative backdoor defense framework that decouples gradient behaviors at a fine granularity to uncovers malicious signals. Specifically, we creates a novel Task-Deviation Orthogonal Disentanglement (TDOD) module, which orthogonally decomposes client updates into consensus and deviation components, enabling joint reasoning over benign contribution and suspicious divergence. Furthermore, a Classification Head Inconsistency Forensics module is designed to capture boundary-shifting artifacts by traversing per-class gradients, thus identifying label-wise anomalies indicative of targeted tampering. Consequently, Beacon enables effective, robust, and domain-adaptive backdoor defense in CD-FFT. Extensive experiments across four cross-domain benchmarks and three backdoor variants demonstrate that Beacon consistently suppresses attack success rates to below 2\\%, while preserving main task accuracy, significantly  outperforming seven state-of-the-art defenses in this challenging setting.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Federated fine-tuning", "cross-domain", "backdoor defense", "gradient decoupling"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d9744f023bbae5a8cb8d26fde4a52981708b78dc.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/cd9360e93d8388ecf3d1ac3e67c3d865c429637b.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents Beacon, a new framework for defending against backdoors in cross-domain federated fine-tuning.

This paper provides limited background information on cross-domain federated fine-tuning (CD-FFT), making it difficult for readers to understand the contribution, particularly in Section 4.2.\n\nThe paper claims that CD-FFTs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, but it does not discuss related work on existing backdoor attacks and defenses in the context of CD-FFT.\n\nCompared with traditional federated learning (FL), the specific challenges of defending against backdoor attacks in cross-domain settings are not clearly explained.\n\nAlthough the experiments show that most existing backdoor defenses perform poorly in CD-FFT, the underlying causes are not analyzed.\n\nSeveral key parameters in TDOD and CHIF lack sensitivity analysis. The need to fine-tune all these parameters limits the practical applicability of this approach in real-world scenarios.\n\nThe proposed BEACON framework, particularly the CHIF module, may be vulnerable to specially designed attacks such as non-targeted or multi-target attacks.\n\nWhile the paper reports the time cost of the proposed method under moderate conditions (few clients, medium-sized dataset), its scalability to large-scale FL settings remains unverified. Certain steps, such as the orthogonal decomposition in TDOD, may become computationally expensive as the model, dataset, or number of clients increases.\n\nThe leave-one-out strategy could be bypassed by coordinated, colluding adversaries.\n\nMost comparative evaluations are based on defenses proposed before 2022, with only two recent backdoor detection methods included as baselines. This may weaken the comprehensiveness of the performance evaluation of BEACON."}, "questions": {"value": "Current backdoor defenses often fail to effectively mitigate backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) because most are designed for standard FL settings and do not generalize well to cross-domain or heterogeneous data distributions. The causes of poor performance vary, but common factors include reliance on global data similarity assumptions, sensitivity to non-iid data, and limited adaptability to diverse client behaviors.\n\nThe threshold \\epsilon in TDOD is critical for filtering noisy gradient updates. Similarly, parameters \\tau_m, \\tau_s, \\lambda_1, and \\lambda_2 significantly influence the balance between detection sensitivity and stability. However, their sensitivity across different model architectures and datasets is not analyzed, and the paper lacks an ablation study to justify these parameter settings.\n\nSince CHIF identifies label-specific anomalies in classifier head gradients, BEACON may be less effective against non-targeted or generalized backdoor attacks, which do not produce distinct gradient signatures. It is unclear how BEACON maintains robustness under such conditions, as its detection mechanism may not capture dispersed or non-class-specific deviations.\n\nBEACON could also be vulnerable to colluding adversaries. If malicious clients coordinate their updates to imitate domain-specific variations, the leave-one-out consensus in TDOD could be deceived, causing the malicious updates to appear as benign and evade detection.\n\nThe computational efficiency and scalability of orthogonal component decomposition are not discussed. It remains uncertain whether BEACON can scale to large FL systems with more clients, larger datasets, or larger models.\n\nMany state-of-the-art FL backdoor attacks and defenses proposed in recent years are not considered in this paper. It is unclear whether BEACON can still effectively mitigate these newer attacks and outperform contemporary defenses.\n\nThe paper also does not examine the impact of data distribution on BEACON’s performance.
