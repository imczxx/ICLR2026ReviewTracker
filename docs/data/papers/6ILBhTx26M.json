However, the following challenges still exist in prior methods: (1) They predict coordinates as discrete tokens in an autoregressive text generation paradigm, which constrains grounding accuracy and leads to sub-optimal inference efficiency; (2) Their predictions are restricted to predefined element sets, and lack the ability to comprehensively parse the entire interface, thereby impeding the versatility and generalizability required for downstream applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Grounding GUI Anything (GGA), an efficient end-to-end framework that enables semantically-aware and fine-grained interface parsing with continuous coordinate decoding. By bridging the MLLM with a dedicated regression-based decoder, the enhanced visual and textual representations are jointly leveraged to regress target coordinates within a continuous spatial domain. This design overcomes the quantization and sequential limitations of traditional discrete token modeling, thus enhancing both localization accuracy and inference speed. Furthermore, to improve robustness and mitigate hallucination, we incorporate a rejection mechanism that enables the model to identify non-existent elements. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce ScreenParse, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the structural perception capabilities of GUI grounding models across diverse real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks demonstrate that GGA consistently achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

The literature review regarding GUI grounding tasks is incomplete, as it omits several key studies that employ non-next-token prediction paradigms. Specifically, the paper should cite and discuss:\n  - Bbox regression-based GUI grounding: \n    - GROUNDING MULTIMODAL LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL IN GUI WORLD (ICLR 2025).\n  - Coordinate-free GUI grounding methods: \n    - Attention-driven GUI Grounding: Leveraging Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models without Fine-Tuning (AAAI 2025)\n    - GUI-Actor: Coordinate-Free Visual Grounding for GUI Agents (NeurIPS 2025).\n2. While GUI Grounding is a key step, the paper only provides performance metrics for this isolated component. The work currently lacks exploration into the system-level integration required to build a functional GUI Agent System. A demonstration of how this method seamlessly contributes to a unified and efficient full agent is necessary.\n3. Figure 3 appears to show the output of the Vision Encoder being fed directly into the LLM, which contradicts the established architecture of InternVL 2.5, which typically includes a Pixel-shuffle layer and an MLP projector between the Vision Encoder and the LLM. The omission of this crucial intermediate module is confusing and raises several questions: \n  - Was the MLP projector tuned in the proposed method? \n  - Does the proposed coordinate generation module take the raw Vision Encoder output or the output after the MLP projector as its input?\n4. What is the definition of $L_{sem}$ in Equation (4)?\n5. Figure 5 utilizes Grounding DINO to detect icons within the GUI screenshots. It is suggested to include a quantitative analysis of the recall and precision of Grounding DINO specifically for this icon detection task on the proposed dataset. Furthermore, clarification is needed regarding the MLLM Semantics Module:\n  - Is this module primarily dedicated to extracting icon semantics?\n  - Which specific MLLM (model size and version) was utilized for this purpose?\n  - What is the reported accuracy or quality assessment of the generated semantic response?\n6. Could the authors clarify how the \"Time\" metric in Table 1 was calculated? Given that the model sizes being compared are comparable, the significant time difference seems disproportionate to the mere compression of a few bounding box output tokens. Is this time difference primarily due to a substantial variation in the overall output sequence length among the compared methods?\n7. What is the exact formula used to compute the SemSim metric in Table 3? According to the table, the proposed GGA-8B model's performance on SemSim significantly surpasses that of Qwen 2.5-VL-72B. Is it because the GGA-8B model was exposed to related icons or semantic information from the proposed ScreenParse benchmark during its training phase, which might explain this large discrepancy?"}, "questions": {"value": "Please find the questions in the Weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "dx6mfs4YmE", "forum": "6ILBhTx26M", "replyto": "6ILBhTx26M", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8589/Reviewer_Yrw3"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8589/Reviewer_Yrw3"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8589/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761429340663, "cdate": 1761429340663, "tmdate": 1762920436103, "mdate": 1762920436103, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "GwhnzkSVzO", "forum": "6ILBhTx26M", "replyto": "6ILBhTx26M", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8589/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8589/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763098604055, "cdate": 1763098604055, "tmdate": 1763098604055, "mdate": 1763098604055, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an end-to-end GUI grounding and parsing system named Grounding GUI Anything (GGA) that replaces traditional autoregressive coordinate token generation with a continuous regression-based decoder.

Hard to see what to focus on and style is too different from the rest of the paper.\n2. Token router seems to be explained as something complicated, but if I understand correctly it just extracts all tokens that are predicted and splits them into two groups: [VG] + [REJ] in group 1 (going to Coordinate Decoder) and all other tokens in group 2 (Going to Element Matcher + decode). From the text, it originally seemed like it was trained, or it did anything more. I would argue that in figure 3 you don't even need the extra \"Token Router\" block, since it's just a split (it's not similar to a token router in MoE).\n3.

How much does the performance drop in non-GUI tasks? Ideally we could use this setup even in cases where we care about all original InternVL2.5-8B domains, but it's hard to predict how much the performance drops in the other cases (especially with the vision encoder finetuning only on GUI tasks)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "jV0KkOE8G4", "forum": "6ILBhTx26M", "replyto": "6ILBhTx26M", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8589/Reviewer_Bqer"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8589/Reviewer_Bqer"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8589/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761819451992, "cdate": 1761819451992, "tmdate": 1762920434774, "mdate": 1762920434774, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Grounding GUI Anything (GGA), a unified framework for grounding and understanding graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

The technical novelty of the proposed seems incremental. The core idea is delegating coordinate prediction from next-token prediction to a decoder similar to those in object detection tasks. It is conceptually straightforward and not particularly insightful. The resulting performance improvement in grounding accuracy is therefore unsurprising. In fact, the more interesting and potentially novel contribution lies in the design of the [REJ] token, which helps suppress hallucinations, yet this part receives relatively little emphasis compared with the coordinate decoder itself.\n2. Some concerns about efficiency gains. The paper repeatedly highlights efficiency as a major advantage, but the experimental results raise questions. In Tables 2 and 3, the proposed method is reported to be up to 5 times faster than the base model (InternVL2.5-8B), e.g., from 2.684 s to 0.632 s in Table 2, and from 0.558 s to 0.154 s in Table 3. This is counterintuitive, as an additional N-layer Transformer decoder (the coordinate decoder) is introduced. The paper does not clarify whether both methods are benchmarked on the same GPU setup or whether the reported time only measures the coordinate-output stage.
