Many existing works utilize proxies of the latent confounder to adjust for it indirectly, typically requiring multiple proxies. Within the framework of latent variable linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (lvLiNGAM), we propose a causal effect identification method requiring only a single proxy. Moreover, this proxy can be agnostic, which means that: first, it can have an arbitrary causal relationship with the treatment/outcome; second, this causal relationship is not required to be known a priori. The complexity of the agnostic proxy precludes a straightforward identification of the causal effect of interest. Consequently, our method is designed to first derive several candidate solutions from cross-cumulants and then identify the valid solution via independence tests. With a sufficient sample size, if the causal effect is identifiable, our method returns its true value; if it is unidentifiable, our method explicitly reports unidentifiability.
