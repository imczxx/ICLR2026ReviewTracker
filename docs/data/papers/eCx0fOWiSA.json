Current evaluation practices involve curating increasingly large datasets to assess the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, there is a lack of systematic analysis and guidance on determining the sufficiency of test data or selecting informative samples for evaluation. This paper introduces a certifiable and cost-efficient evaluation framework for LLMs. Our framework adapts to different evaluation objectives and outputs confidence intervals that contain true values with high probability. We use ``test sample complexity'' to quantify the number of test points needed for a certifiable evaluation and derive tight bounds on test sample complexity. Based on the developed theory, we develop a partition-based algorithm, named Cer-Eval, that adaptively selects test points to minimize the cost of LLM evaluation. Real-world experiments demonstrate that Cer-Eval can save 20% to 40% of test points across various benchmarks, while maintaining an estimation error level comparable to the current evaluation process and providing a 95\\% confidence guarantee.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Sequential test", "LLM evalution", "adaptive sampling"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/18d79fa233ca3952a9cbd8092ce7bcf9462b86d4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors argue that existing evaluations in LLMs do not (i) adapt to specific user goals, and (ii) do not consider trade-offs between evaluation cost and validity making it difficult to choose the correct amount of evaluation data.

The paper would require a thorough discussion on the breakeven point, i.e. the point at which using this evaluation is better than evaluating on the entire dataset. I am not sufficiently convinced that the proposed approach is always preferable - as the user has to tolerate a moderate to larger estimation error and/or the test dataset needs to be sufficiently large. I think the point where your approach becomes beneficial should be identified with more certainty, and would be required for practitioners to decide when implementing your approach provides a benefit. A more careful analysis and discussion would be critical for this paper and this should be, in particular, discussed in the main text.\n\n*Limited discussion of real-world experiments.* The discussion on the evaluation on \"real-world\" datasets is quite limited. While sufficiently many models are tested, the paper would benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of the results, and in particular of the limitations of this approach. The current discussion of the empirical results in real-world settings fails to offer clear takeaways.\n\n*Overly complicated formalization.* The formalization could be improved to make the paper more readable. For example, at first $n$ is introduced as the dataset size, but in Def. 3.6 $n$ represents a function depending on several parameters and this dependency remains unclear. The current formalization is not clear enough, especially not helpful for practitioners who just need to implement your approach. It becomes especially confusing in Theorem 4.2 where the function is denoted as $n'$. Generally all the variables $n, n', n^*$ and $N$ require disambiguation.\n\nOverall, I think the paper has potential toward improved LLM evaluations but the mentioned weaknesses should be addressed to improve clarity and to provide more clear takeaways in particular for practitioners."}, "questions": {"value": "Why do you focus on MMLU, AlpacaEval and MATH in particular?

My biggest concern for the paper is the critical gap in baseline comparisons. The paper only effectively compare the method with two baselines, i.e., the static evaluation and vanilla online evaluation process. There are quite a few obvious papers that address the same problem are not included. For example, TinyBenchmarks (Polo et all., 2024) leverages Item Responses Theory (IRT) and is able to achieve <2% estimation error based on 1% of the full MMLU dataset. Similarly, StratPPI (Fisch et al., 2024) and AutoEval (Boyeau et al., 2024) is cited in the related works but are not compared as baseline. Although some of the work requires the partition to be known in advance, however, I don't think that itself can justify the absence of these baselines. I would very strongly suggest the authors to including more baselines for comparison. \n\n2. My another concern is the experimental setup. The main focus of the paper focuses on the efficiency and reliability of the evaluations, and the experiments solely base on the saving ratio vs. estimation error level. However, in practice, the most important goal for evaluation is for model comparisons (i.e., model A vs. model B). Why we don't carry on experiments to show the effectiveness of the method on ranking models? For example, are we able to rank models consistently with the 40% saving on the computation cost? I really think these experiments are critical to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and push the adoption."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Why we are not comparing our method with other baselines? Any specific reason we only pick these two baselines in the paper?\n2.
