The proposed framework learns the score function on the quotient space with respect to the group, avoiding the need to model components corresponding to group actions. They start by projecting the standard forward SDE onto the quotient space using a Riemannian Ito's lemma. They then observe that the vector field on the quotient space admits an orthonormal decomposition into horizontal and vertical components, where only the horizontal component is relevant as the vertical component corresponds to infinitesimal group actions. Given the non-trivial geometry of the quotient space, they re-define a process in the original space that retains only the horizontal movement, called horizontal lift.

Therefore, it would have been interesting to see whether the improvements observed for the selected model also hold across different architectures. In relation to this, the results table could have been more informative if, for each baseline, the specific heuristics used to handle symmetries were explicitly stated. \n\nAdditionally, while the theoretical advantages of the proposed model are clearly illustrated in Table 1, I would have expected these advantages to be examined empirically as well, rather than being evaluated only based on final performance metrics. For example, I would expect a similar convergence behaviour between the proposed approach and the AF3 heuristic, since they are both removing the unnecessary DOFs and also lowering the variance. With respect to GeoDiff,I would expect the proposed method to achieve faster convergence during training, as it removes the equivalent DOFs. \n\nFinally, the proposed framework rely on a horizontal projection operator that involves an inverse of a matrix that depends on the input dimensions, i.e. number of points in the cloud, or atom in the molecule.

The work is exceptionally timely, as similar issues are being reported in various domains, such as periodic crystal generation [1, 2]. The authors are encouraged to cite similar works to further strengthen significance. The paper provides a powerful and unifying theoretical lens to explain and, more importantly, solve these inconsistencies.\n\n2. **Elegant and Sound Framework**: The proposed framework is mathematically elegant and theoretically sound. The derivation—projecting the standard diffusion SDE onto the quotient space $\\mathcal{M}/\\mathcal{G}$ and then deriving its corresponding \"horizontal lift\" SDE back in the original space—is a principled and clean solution.\n\n3. **Excellent Analysis of Prior and Heuristic Methods**: A major strength is the paper's insightful analysis of prior work within its new framework. The discussion (and Table 1) that masterfully categorizes and explains the shortcomings of previous methods (like data augmentation or inference-only alignment) is excellent. The critique of heuristic alignment strategies (GeoDiff, AF3) is particularly brilliant, clearly articulating how they introduce high variance or suffer from sampling incompatibility.\n\n4. **Clarity and Intuition**: The paper is well-written. Figures 1 and 2, in particular, are exceptionally clear and provide excellent intuition for the complex mathematical concepts involved, making the core idea highly accessible.\n\n5. **Strong Empirical Validation**: The authors provide thorough ablation studies and experiments on challenging, standard benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, GEOM-DRUGS, and protein design). The empirical results largely demonstrate the superiority of this principled approach over existing methods.\n\n[1]\"Equivariant diffusion for crystal structure prediction.\" ICML,2024\n\n[2]\"Kinetic Langevin Diffusion for Crystalline Materials Generation.\"ICML,2025"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Missing Discussion on GEOM-DRUGS Results**: In Table 3, the performance on the GEOM-DRUGS dataset, while strong, appears to be below that of the MCF baseline. This is a noteworthy result, but the paper does not provide any discussion or analysis for this specific comparison. A brief discussion of this would strengthen the experimental section.\n\n2. **Missed Visualization Opportunity**: While Figures 1 and 2 are excellent for conceptual understanding, the paper would be significantly improved by a new figure that visualizes the dynamics of the proposed horizontal diffusion process itself. For example, a qualitative visualization of the distribution's evolution on a simple manifold (e.g., $\\mathcal{M}/SO(2)$) would be highly illustrative and provide a powerful complement to the static diagrams.\n\n3. **Minor Formatting Suggestion**: In Table 3, the results for \"GEOM-DRUGS\" are a key contribution.

This is a clear success. However, a question remains about learning the full G-invariant target distribution $p(x)$. For a finite dataset (which is not perfectly G-invariant), does the horizontal lift SDE guarantee that it learns the correct probabilities for all equivalent points $g \\cdot x$? For example, if the dataset contains only two samples $x_1, x_2$, the true target distribution should be non-zero and have the same probability on the entire orbit $ \\\\{g \\cdot x_1, g \\cdot x_2 | g \\in \\mathcal{G} \\\\} $. Does the proposed method recover this full manifold, or does it primarily learn the quotient-space projection well? A deeper discussion on this geometric probability coverage would be valuable.\n\n2. **Comparison to Other Lie Group Diffusion Methods**: Could the authors comment on how this quotient-space framework compares, in terms of theoretical advantages or disadvantages, to other recent work on diffusion for symmetric data?
