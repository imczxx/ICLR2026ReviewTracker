The 5k SFT trajectories represent a relatively small subset of potential teacher data. Given that Claude 3.7 Sonnet is a substantially stronger model, there may be a scenario where scaling the number of trajectories could narrow the gap between the Base and Kimi-Dev priors. If this is the case, the proposed approach would offer a more efficient rather than more powerful method for training multi-turn SWE agents, which represents a weaker claim that it could be otherwise.\n3. While the Agentless checkpoint demonstrates strong performance as a prior for multi-turn adaptation, it remains unclear whether directly applying large-scale RL to the SWE-Agent framework would yield comparably strong or weaker results. The literature includes examples of applying GRPO (DAPO) to sparse reward settings for LLMs in SWE tasks, such as DeepSWE [1]. A direct comparison or discussion of this alternative training paradigm would strengthen the paper's claims about the necessity and superiority of the two-stage approach.\n\n[1] Michael Luo et al.

The so-called Agentless training approach provides more stability and the opportunity to introduce intermediate skills, such as locating files, writing tests and fixing bugs, which may subsequently be used and composed together when training a SWE-agent model. Concretely, the authors describe: a mid-training procedure where data from GitHub issues and PR commits form examples of how developers reason about issues and fix bugs; a cold-start procedure where SWE-related reasoning traces from R1 are used to induce long CoT abilities; an RL stage where a policy gradient objective is used to train code editing capabilities with outcome-based rewards; and finally a test-time self-play stage where the model learns to play the roles of a BugFixer and TestWriter. Following this training procedure, the authors evaluate the resulting Kimi-Dev model on SWE-Bench Verified, achieving a strong performance of 60.4% for an open-weights 72B model derived from Qwen 2.5 (Base). The authors then investigate whether the structured Agentless training procedure leads to model checkpoints which offer useful \"priors\" for more open-ended SWE-agent fine-tuning. Indeed, various stages of the Agentless training procedure, in particular the mid-training, lead to a big uplift in SWE-Bench Verified performance after various amounts of SFT on SWE-Agent traces collected from Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The authors also demonstrate some evidence towards the RL prior (after the full Agentless training procedure) supporting a greater number of turns for SWE-Agent style rollouts after SFT."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "While advanced coding agent model training has been underway in model labs for certain years, there are relatively few detailed accounts of how to take a pre-trained model and effectively imbue it with the skills needed to solve software engineering problems. From this perspective, the work offers a valuable contribution, in particular the details of the mid-training procedure which appears to be the stage of Agentless training that yields the largest SWE-Bench Verified performance improvement after SFT on SWE-Agent traces; perhaps due to training the model to reproduce the motifs, reasoning patterns and skills required to conduct software engineering work. The work is of a reasonably large scale, and achieves compelling results on SWE-Bench Verified for a model of its size, with 60.4% resolution rate on SWE-Bench Verified with the Agentless-like framework."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "While the Agentless performance for SWE-Bench Verified is reasonably strong at 60%, the pass@1 rate on the SWE-Agent results are somewhat low at 48.6%, particularly given the model is roughly double the size of other models obtaining comparable scores. It would be good to investigate why this is, and crucially whether this is as a result of the Agentless training procedure that preceded SFT for SWE-Agent.\n\nMoreover, the authors train on the outputs of other models at two key points in the paper. This is disappointing since it effectively hides how the corresponding skills can be trained from scratch in an open-source model, instead deferring this to the black box of a preexisting model trained by some other lab. The first instance of this is during mid-training - which appears to be one of the steps in the training procedure which yields the greatest performance improvements - where traces from the DeepSeek's R1 model are used to introduce skills such as reasoning, problem analysis, method sketching, self-refinement and exploration of alternative solutions. This is an important procedure, and it would have been good to see discussion of how these skills could be bootstrapped without training on the outputs of a model which has already undergone this training. The second instance are the SWE-Agent traces used for SFT from Claude 3.5 Sonnet. While I understand that the primary focus of this paper is the Agentless training procedure itself, I do believe that any conclusions pertaining to the usefulness of this intermediate training procedure as a \"prior\" for training SWE-Agents must be made with a more legible training procedure for the SWE-Agent stage. In other words, had the jump from Agentless to SWE-Agent been achieved by a transparent RL procedure, then conclusions about the usefulness of the Agentless skill prior may be more impactful. Instead, we appear to have learned that these \"priors\" are useful when doing imitation learning from black-box model traces.\n\nFinally, on the point about generalization, the studies all revolve around SWE-Bench style tasks (including the live and multilingual variants in Appendix E). These represent only a small subset of software engineering work, and do not address related tasks such as novel algorithm design, performance optimization, task management and so forth, which I believe would be a better quantifier of generalization than merely more up-to-date or polyglot variants of SWE-Bench's issue resolution task. Indeed, this is an area where the paper's Agentless training thesis may hold promise; where systematically created workflow-based mid-training procedures can imbue a model with a diverse range of useful skills which can be learned to be composed together in the RL stage.\n\nNits:\n- L427: do you mean to say \"The RL prior outperforms all the other models...\"?"}, "questions": {"value": "- what is behind the roughly linear increase in token length in Figure 3 as RL training proceeds?
