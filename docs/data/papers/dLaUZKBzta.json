The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM is to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically interpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained interest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in self-contained pipelines. In parallel, differentiable rendering techniques such as Gaussian splatting have demonstrated remarkable scalability and efficiency for volumetric representations, suggesting a natural fit for GMM-based cryo-EM reconstruction. However, off-the-shelf Gaussian splatting methods are designed for photorealistic view synthesis and remain incompatible with cryo-EM due to mismatches in the image formation physics, reconstruction objectives, and coordinate systems. Addressing these issues, we propose cryoSplat, a GMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM image formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware Gaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a view-dependent normalization term and FFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging. These innovations enable stable and efficient homogeneous reconstruction directly from raw cryo-EM particle images using random initialization. Experimental results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of cryoSplat over representative baselines.

This field has experienced tremendous progress over the last decade, including several mature software packages for 3D reconstruction such as RELION [1], cryoSPARC [2] and CryoDRGN [3]. The reconstruction pipeline for cryo-EM is comprised of several different steps: particle picking (identifying the location of the molecules in the noisy images), estimation of the point-spread function and ab-initio reconstruction (obtaining an initial low-res reconstruction). This is typically followed by the estimation of viewing angles combined with high-resolution 3D refinement. This paper is focused on the last step: the high-resolution 3D reconstruction of a single (fixed) molecule with known viewing angles. It proposes a simple approach inspired by 3D Gaussian splatting [4] that the authors name CryoSplat. It is a more-or-less direct adaptation of 3D splatting from computer graphics to the cryo-EM domain, making the following changes to match the TEM imaging modality:\n1. The projection is orthogonal, in contrast to the perspective projection (pinhole camera) model typically used in computer graphics.\n2. There are no occlusions. The Gaussians are simply added together. So there's no need for a z-buffer and alpha-blending.\n3. The algorithm does not need to figure out which Gaussians are outside the camera's view since the entire molecule is always in view. The authors still divide the image into tiles, but this is merely an implementation detail for better GPU performance.\n4. The projection image is convolved with a point-spread function.\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is a demonstration that, given input images with matching projection orientations, a high-resolution 3D GMM model can be used to reconstruct the 3D volume using gradient-based optimization.\n\n[1] Scheres, Sjors HW. \"RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination.\" Journal of structural biology 180, no. 3 (2012): 519-530.\n\n[2] Punjani, Ali, John L.

The authors have demonstrated that one can obtain high-resolution reconstructions simply by running backprop. I am not aware of previous literature that demonstrated this.\n\n* The paper is very clearly written."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* The benchmarks do not compare the method to leading packages for homogeneous reconstruction but only to CryoDRGN (and a backprojection baseline). While CryoDRGN is a leading package for heterogeneous reconstruction, it is not the best at homogeneous reconstruction. At a minimum, I do not think the paper can be accepted without a comparison to a leading homogeneous reconstruction method such as RELION or cryoSPARC.\n\n* The novelty of this work is not very high in my opinion. Gaussian mixture models have been used by several authors in cryo-EM reconstruction (e.g. [5],[6]) but mostly to attack the much more difficult problem of heterogeneous reconstruction, where molecules have continuous degrees of freedom. This is probably due to the fact that in cryo-EM the homogeneous reconstruction problem is considered to be \"solved\". The authors acknowledge the works of Chen et al. and others, but claim that they are different from these works because they do not rely on an approximate 3D model of the molecule (\"consensus model\") for initialization. Indeed, CryoSplat does not require such an initial model, but it takes the orientations of the images as input.  The issue is that on experimental data the orientations are typically obtained by rotating a consensus model and comparing the resulting projections to the input images... So a consensus model is still used in the pipeline. As far as I can tell, the optimization is a straightforward application of backpropagation with no \"secret sauce\". Hence, the main contribution of the paper is a demonstration that backprop on a GMM with known orientations can result in high resolution models. The contribution would be much more significant if the method was able to also estimate the viewing angles from scratch.\n\n* This submission seems to have significant overlap to GEM (ICLR submission 6298) even with regards to the choice of datasets.

In particular, the efficient CUDA implementation would seem to be largely based on that of 3DGS, with fairly minor modifications. This is still a contribution to be sure, but the contribution description should acknowledge if this code is largely based on 3DGS code.\n- Some of the descriptions of voxel-based methods strike me as a bit unfair/unsupported. For example, line 109 describes these methods as “inherently discrete”--this is not the case when voxels use interpolation beyond nearest neighbor. It is ironic that this is described as a limitation of voxels, when (although Gaussians are technically infinitely-supported) 3DGS crops the spatial extent of each Gaussian and is thus more discrete of a representation than a grid with interpolation, since there is no interpolation between distinct Gaussians. Line 124 describes Gaussian mixture models as supporting differentiable optimization; this is only the case when the Gaussians are modeled with their full support, and even so the Gaussian and its gradient are negligible over much of its support, making the gradients of limited value beyond the main ellipsoid of support. Additionally, section 4.3 describes neural representations and Gaussians as more flexible for heterogeneous reconstruction compared to voxel grids. This claim is unsupported (e.g. it is straightforward to imagine combining a canonical 3D model in the form of a voxel grid with a neural or explicit deformation/conformation model, just as one could for a neural or Gaussian representation).\n- The last paragraph on page 3 describes three aspects of the original 3DGS that must be adapted for application to cryo-EM. The first is the switch from perspective to orthographic, which is clearly described. However, the second and third aspects are not clearly described. Aspect (ii) is described as prioritizing photorealism over physical accuracy, and aspect (iii) is described as misaligned coordinates with respect to the Fourier slice theorem. Aspect (ii) is too vague; aspect (iii) makes it sound like the Fourier slice theorem is used in the forward model, but this is not the case since the forward model here is applied in real-space, so it’s not clear why misaligned coordinates would be an issue. Is this because the contrast transfer function is applied in Fourier domain?\n- In Figure 2, the resolution is described as being calculated based on the point where the FSC curve crosses 0.143. However, the graphs of FSC on the right of the figure seem to have arbitrary x axis scales, that do not always show where FSC for CryoSplat crosses 0.143. Moreover, the resolutions reported for CryoSplat do not seem to match these crossing points.\n- In Figure 2, I acknowledge that CryoSplat achieves higher FSC. However, I am confused by this because visually in the ChimeraX figures the reconstructions from CryoSplat appear smoother than those from both backprojection and CryoDRGN, and in some cases (e.g. the second row) there are fine details in which backprojection and CryoDRGN are in agreement with each other, but the same features are not present in CryoSplat. I am not sure how to square this observation with the quantitatively higher FSC for CryoSplat, but I am concerned of a potential bug in computing FSC.\n- Figure 3 caption claims that 10,000 Gaussians are usually sufficient, yet in all four subfigures there is meaningful improvement moving from 10,000 Gaussians to 30,000. Moreover, in Figure 2 CryoSplat uses 30,000 Gaussians. The goal should not be just to outperform baselines, but to maximize resolution and stability of reconstruction.\n- The initialization strategy for the Gaussians is described on line 396, but the rationale behind it is not explained until the appendix. The rationale is more important than the numbers themselves.\n- Section 4.2 describes some reconstructions as producing artifacts, and points out the location of artifacts in Figure 2.
