This is crucial to ensure safety of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics compared to commonly used loss functions.  \nIn extensive experiments, JensUn achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than previously thought.", "tldr": "We improve evaluation and the process of unlearning in LLMs.", "keywords": ["LLM unlearning", "relearning", "unlearning evaluation"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/27d860fad31d1761b5cfeae9df779b580502c876.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9b4167706e9c80a77c40e0e4b014f7190656fa83.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces JensUn, a new LLM unlearning method that uses Jensen–Shannon Divergence to achieve a better balance between forgetting targeted knowledge and preserving overall model utility. The authors show that JensUn is more stable and resistant to benign relearning, meaning the forgotten information is less likely to re-emerge after additional fine-tuning. To address weaknesses in current evaluation practices, they propose a stronger assessment pipeline that uses LLM-based semantic judging instead of ROUGE, tests multiple paraphrased query versions, and reports worst-case performance. They also introduce a new dataset, LKF (Lesser Known Facts), for more realistic unlearning scenarios.
