It also is not so clear to me that the tweaks are significantly more \"simple\" than the original architecture as is claimed in the paper.  An aggregation function is changed, and certain vectors are multiplied rather than concatenated.  The latter should make the model's footprint a bit smaller, but I am not sure it is substantially smaller or conceptually simpler.\n- The proposed method is comparable to baselines but is by no means a clear winner.  In fact, it appears that overall the baselines perform better: In Table 1, the open book baseline wins in a majority (9 out of 15) algorithms.\n- The paper is entirely empirical, without any theoretical arguments or insights into why the changes should perform comparably.  In particular, there is no solid, evidence-based explanation for why a min aggregation function should perform comparably to, or better than, more conventional choices.\n- The experiments do not include any error bars, standard deviations, or statistical tests to quantify reproducibility.  It would be better to do multiple independent runs of each experiment and then average the results across the random noise in each run (model initialization, dropout, etc.).  This is particularly important since the modified model and baselines performed very similarly.\n- There were a number of issues with the paper's presentation.  I understand the authors are not native English speakers, but some of these issues are independent of language:\n    - section 3 refers to RL as a \"differentiable architecture\" but RL is an architecture-agnostic training paradigm, not an architecture.\n    - There is a repeated reference line 113\n    - missing period line 142\n    - Lines 178-180 contain a redundant mention of concatenation\n    - The same symbol \"g\" is used to denote multiple independent things.  In 4.2 this symbol is used to represent the graph embedding, the output of the gating function, and the decoder.  Different symbols should be used for each.\n    - An architectural diagram would have been more helpful than purely textual descriptions, especially for new contributions in 4.3, and there is enough space in the 9-page limit to include one.\n    - line 230: \"MPL\" for multi-layer perceptron is backwards, \"ELU\" is duplicated twice\n    - Section 5 mentions learning rate but not which optimization method was used (SGD? Adam? something else?)\n    - Tables 1,2 would be easier to parse with bold-face indications of the best results\n    - Some textual descriptions would benefit from more precise formulas.  For example, line 240-242 just writes the gating function as $f(x,h,m)$ without any formula clearly defining $f$ (it is only described verbally).\n    - The method is called F6 in the title, but this name is never explained in the main text."}, "questions": {"value": "- Can the authors provide any intuition why min aggregation should work comparably to, or better than, mean/max aggregation?\n- In 4.3.1: The \"duplication\" description was not clear to me.  What is the difference between the two duplicates that increases variability?  Do they have different trainable parameters? Is there any message passing between them or they each independently compute separate predictions?  If it is the latter, how do you combine the predictions from each duplicate at the end?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "FB33AdAzTk", "forum": "dtl4IcoQpp", "replyto": "dtl4IcoQpp", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21689/Reviewer_b2JD"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21689/Reviewer_b2JD"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21689/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761929386201, "cdate": 1761929386201, "tmdate": 1762941891637, "mdate": 1762941891637, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper builds on the Triplet-GMPNN model, proposing various modification of the core architecture.

For some reason, the authors avoid to provide mathematical formulation of what they do, describing the modifications to the backbone mostly in plain english. I think this actually leads to lack of clarity. I would have liked to see the formula of the proposed gating. Or some pseudo-code. I think the way it is expressed in english, is not actually clear to me what the new proposed gating is. The text also does not make any attempts of clearly singling out what is part of the original backbone architecture, versus what is novel. The Triplet-GMPNN architecture is described in section 4.2 (which I think it should since we will be mostly working on it) again in plain text, in a very confusing way. And the \"triplet\" part of the architecture, one of the main innovation from general message passing networks is not really described in this section, even though the section is almost an entire page. I think is more likely to expect readers of the paper to be knowledgeable about message passing networks but less knowledgeable about the specific architecture you are building on, then to assume they know the architecture but somehow a generic description of how message passing architectures work is needed. \n\nI believe that either a diagram, or some math or some pseudocode would help immensely the paper, making it clear what is the novel alteration of the paper, what is the architecture being run etc, \n\nMy second issue is with the scale of results and ablations. From reading the text, I'm not sure there is any deep motivation of the proposed modifications (in a mathematical sense or otherwise), which is fine. ML is to a large degree an empirical field, and if a different formulation of the architecture works better, that should be enough. But when the paper does not have any of these deeper reasoning for changing the gating function or the aggregator to min, I feel more extensive results are needed. And more extensive ablation (and not on the hidden size h -- but rather on the architectural changes being proposed). I think the scale of the experiments, the lack of deeper motivation and the scale of ablation are not sufficient for a venue like ICLR."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

It's also not fully clear where numbers come from author-run experiments and where they're reproduced from previous research, e.g. are all initializations, hyperparameters and other factors controlled for? There are also several cases where the proposed architecture does not outperform the baseline (which I'd consider to be Triplet-GMPNN), e.g. Bellman-Ford, DAGSP. \n\nThe omission of BFS from the main results seems dishonest, it's an important and easy algorithm within NAR that most capable methods can achieve 100% accuracy on.
