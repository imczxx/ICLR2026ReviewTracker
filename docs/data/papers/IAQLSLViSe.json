All results assume best-case conditions under noiseless simulation, applied equally to all methods. This isolates algorithmic behavior from hardware-specific noise and focuses on the theoretical scaling properties of output encodings.\nWe explicitly assume a future outlook where quantum computers continue to grow in qubit count—similar to historical trends—and where noise either remains constant or decreases through error correction or hardware improvements. These assumptions are standard in theoretical QML research and are clearly stated in the paper. We have discovered and corrected several statements in the manuscript that may have given the wrong impression in this regard. We offer to provide our notes about these changes upon request to keep this response concise, noting that OpenReview provides an even more thorough pdf-diff. \n\n**Noise and Hardware Robustness**\nWe distinguish between two notions of noise in quantum computing: (i) intrinsic quantum randomness, which arises from the probabilistic nature of measurement and motivates our focus on single-shot inference and resolvability, and (ii) hardware-level noise, such as decoherence, thermal fluctuations, and cross-talk, which stem from the physical limitations of current devices. Our contributions address (i) under idealized conditions while (ii) remains an open challenge and is outside the scope of this work. We clarify this as best as possible in the revised manuscript.\n\nWe acknowledge that robustness to hardware noise is an open challenge. While Appendix A.1.2 includes inference under IBM Qiskit noise models, a full systematic study of noise resilience is beyond the scope of this work. Importantly, our claims about tournament encoding hold under worst-case tournament conditions and do not rely on noise assumptions.\nRegarding Condorcet cycles: theory guarantees that the probability of a unique winner converges to unity as $K \\to \\infty$ (Malinovsky \\& Moon, 2024). We view deeper exploration of tournament theory—such as tie-breaking strategies and cycle analysis—as an exciting extension for future work. Given the breadth of this field, a comprehensive treatment is beyond the scope of a single paper, but we will highlight these directions explicitly in the revision.\n\n**Quadratic vs Exponential Scaling**\nWe freely acknowledge that tournament encoding requires $O(K^2)$ qubits, which is a limitation for large $K$. However, this polynomial growth is fundamentally different from the exponential shot requirements inherent to one-hot encoding and the irreducible sampling overhead of expectation-based methods.\nOur contribution introduces a complexity trade-off: quadratic resource scaling (potentially reducible via sparse tournaments or hierarchical schemes, etc.) for tournament inference versus exponential sampling cost growth for the alternatives (irreducible). No one in the field can make definitive claims about whether qubit count or shot requirements will dominate in the future, but we argue that reducible > irreducible and quadratic < exponential, making this a worthwhile research direction.\nWe will add a resource scaling analysis and explicitly frame this trade-off in the revision.\n\n**Hardware Experiments**\nWe respect the request for real-device experiments but note that training thousands of PQCs on NISQ hardware is computationally expensive and ethically questionable given the resource cost (e.g., helium lossage) for toy datasets. Our primary contribution—the theoretical link between tournament winners and shot resolvability—would be obscured by hardware noise, which affects all methods equally.\nWe will clarify this rationale and emphasize that hardware validation is future work.\n\n**Realism, Imbalance, and Overlap**\n\n_Class Imbalance \\& Semantic Overlap:_ We agree that imbalance and overlapping class boundaries can influence tournament aggregation. These effects are not unique to quantum classifiers—they also affect classical one-vs-one frameworks. Our current study assumes balanced datasets to evaluate encoding strategies under controlled conditions. We will explicitly state this assumption and note that extending the framework to handle imbalance (e.g., weighted voting, tie-breaking rules) and ambiguous boundaries is an important direction for future work.\n\n_Real-World Scaling:_ We do not claim applicability to large-scale real-world datasets or NISQ hardware at this stage. All experiments use standard benchmark subsets (MNIST Digits and FashionMNIST) to isolate algorithmic behavior without conflating results with hardware limitations or dataset-specific complexities. Applying this method to high-dimensional, large-class datasets or real hardware requires addressing quadratic resource scaling and noise resilience—both acknowledged limitations in Section 5. We will highlight these constraints more prominently and frame them as future research directions."}}, "id": "62RzfDmcBJ", "forum": "IAQLSLViSe", "replyto": "IAQLSLViSe", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17915/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17915/Authors"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17915/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763730663045, "cdate": 1763730663045, "tmdate": 1763730663045, "mdate": 1763730663045, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The papr introduces \"Quan-dorcet\" a round-robin tournament aggregation technique for multiclass quantum classification.

Limited demonstration of practical quantum advantage\n\nThe experiments, while promising, appear to be simulation-based (no demonstrated real quantum hardware results).

Scalability issues not thoroughly addressed\n\nFor  𝐾 classes, one-vs-one induces  K*(K-1)/2 binary comparisons/qubits (or circuits). The paper should more clearly analyse the resource scaling (qubits, gates, measurement overhead) for large 𝐾, and whether the tournament cost outweighs encoding benefits.\n\nThe assumption that a unique Condorcet winner will emerge reliably may break down in practice under noisy or ambiguous class boundaries; the authors should discuss scenarios where majority voting may fail or require tie-break strategies.\n\n3. Baseline comparisons and alternative encodings\n\nAlthough one-hot and binary encodings are compared, more recent and sophisticated quantum multiclass classifier encoding schemes (e.g., amplitude encoding, mixed‐state discriminators) are not deeply benchmarked. Without comparison to strong state-of-the-art quantum multiclass methods, the improvement claim is less convincing.\n\nMoreover, many classical multiclass frameworks (ensemble binary classifiers, one-vs-one classical SVMs) employ similar architectural breakdowns; a comparison of quantum vs classical one-vs-one paradigms would strengthen significance.\n\n4. Theoretical justification of single-shot improvements\n\nThe notion of “shot resolvability” is interesting but currently heuristic. A deeper theoretical analysis of how measuring fewer shots yields reliable class output (given quantum measurement statistics, error rates) would improve confidence.\n\nAlso, the impact of entanglement and shared statewide encoding on error propagation among the binary comparators is not fully addressed.\n\n5. Application and realism of datasets/inputs\n\nThe datasets used, while unspecified here in detail, likely involve small-scale toy problems under simulation. It remains unclear how the method performs on large-input real-world classification tasks (e.g., image datasets with many classes and high dimensionality).\n\nThe authors should discuss how measurement budget, class imbalance, noise, and decoherence would influence performance in near-term quantum devices.\n\n**Relevant References for Inclusion**\n\nTo strengthen the literature context and demonstrate awareness of related work, the authors should consider citing the following:\n\nDu, Y., Yang, Y., Hsieh, M.-H., & Tao, D.
