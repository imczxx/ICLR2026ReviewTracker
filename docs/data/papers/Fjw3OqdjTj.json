We introduce Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9 on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100 documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Vector Similarity Search", "Information Retrieval", "LLM reranker"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/236c1472ab212f42233d61d4b07512ce1c71e035.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel method Reranker-Guided Search (RGS) to address two key limitations of the traditional “retrieval-reranking” pipeline: 1) Its performance is constrained by the quality of the Top-K documents returned by the initial retrieval stage; 2) The computational cost of large language model (LLM)-based rerankers is prohibitively high, limiting the number of documents that can be processed.

For large-scale document repositories, building and storing such a graph structure incurs additional preprocessing costs and memory overhead.\n2. For an initial retrieval result that is completely irrelevant and isolated in the embedding space, RGS struggles to correct it through re-ranking into a completely different, highly relevant region.

The experiments are broad and focused on modern, hard benchmarks that stress reasoning and multi-modality rather than only classical TREC-style tasks; showing gains across BRIGHT, FollowIR, and M-BEIR strengthens the claim of generality.

I include some questions about new analysis, and questions about baselines, but the work is already very informative without these.\n\nS3. The results with perturbation are particularly fascinating.

It is a major weakness that ReasonIR is not included as a baseline, nor other reranker alternatives like JudgeRank or Rank-R1. Basically, the results in Table 1-3 are very limited in their baselines, only using BGE embedding and not looking at many rerank alternatives.\n\nW2. Listwise rerankers are know to be very sensitive to order, for example see https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17563 which shows that listwise rerankers in reverse or when re-run multiple times can have very different results. For this reason, it would be very helpful to show Recall@R in Tables 1-3. We can not tell otherwise if it is recall that is helping or a different ordering of results fed to the reranker. The text has \"the number [recall] is only 31% on BRIGHT [at top-100]\", which does suggest RGS is helping with recall, but it's not clear which datasets this holds for. Using Recall@R can even be used to compare all the methods without applying any reranking.\n\nW3. Intuitively, it's not clear why RGS should help with instruction following.\n\nW4. The benefits of RGS decline rapidly after budget hits 500. I actually wonder if it will start to get worse as the budget increases further. More importantly, it's not clear so clear whether 100 budget is needed, or much of the benefit can be achieved with only 50 or even 20.\n\nW5.
