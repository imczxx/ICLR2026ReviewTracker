In essence, the authors use the Poincare ball to represent tonal distance and harmonic tension in a way that feels musically intuitive: the deeper or more nested a tonal relationship, the farther it sits from the origin, much like how modulation in tonal space creates perceptual “depth.” Technically, the model extends the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) into this non-Euclidean space, defining the exponential and logarithmic maps correctly and applying the hyperbolic reparameterization trick to learn latent structures that curve outward."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "a) A key methodological ambiguity arises from the decoding step described in Section 4.2.  After sampling a manifold point z using the Wrapped Normal distribution (Eq. 7), the paper states that “the result of \\log_{0}(z) is then decoded in standard fashion to produce \\hat{x}”. This means the decoder operates on \\log_{0}(z), a vector in the tangent space at the origin T_{0}\\mathcal{M}, rather than on the manifold point z itself. Because T_{0}\\mathcal{M} is Euclidean, this choice effectively flattens the curvature for the likelihood p_{\\theta}(x\\mid z), making the decoder independent of the negative curvature that motivates the model.  But, the paper provides no justification for why this operation preserves the claimed benefits of hyperbolic geometry.  The authors should clarify whether decoding from \\log_{0}(z) is theoretically equivalent to decoding from z or \\log_{\\mu}(z), and, if so, under what invariances or assumptions this equivalence holds.  If not, empirical evidence comparing these alternatives is needed to confirm that curvature has a meaningful influence on the generation process, rather than being restricted to the prior–posterior space.  In its current form, the use of \\log_{0}(z) risks neutralising the negative-curvature effects in the decoder, undermining the central claim that the proposed Poincare-VAE benefits from a non-Euclidean latent geometry.\n\n---\n\nb) In Section 4.3, the paper introduces R-SLERP as an interpolation method that it claims is “guaranteed to stay within the hierarchy levels of its start and end point,” and that the distance to the origin “changes linearly with t, given that such behaviour holds for v_{\\text{int}}(t)”. However, what this  section actually provides is a constructive recipe, that is, it maps the two endpoints z_1, z_2 to the origin’s tangent space with \\log_0, performing SLERP on the unit directions, scaling the radius linearly \\alpha(t)=(1-t)\\|v_1\\|+t\\|v_2\\|, and mapping back using \\exp_0, but without a formal derivation or set of sufficient conditions to justify the “guarantee.”\n\nTechnically, this construction ensures only that the radius from the origin changes linearly if the tangent-space behaviour meets certain assumptions, because Eq. 4 earlier shows d(0,\\exp_0(v))=\\|v\\|. However, the paper never proves that the resulting path always remains between the two endpoint radii or that it preserves the intended “hierarchy level” for all admissible points in the Poincare ball. In simple terms, the authors are asserting that the curve connecting two musical representations never overshoots or collapses outside their hierarchy range, but they do not actually prove it. They only describe the recipe that should, in theory, make it happen.\n\nThis is critical for me because the paper’s entire argument that hyperbolic interpolation captures smooth hierarchical transitions in music depends on this behaviour being guaranteed by geometry, not just observed empirically. To be convincing, the authors need to (a) provide a short lemma showing that d(0,z_{\\text{int}}(t))=\\alpha(t)\\in[d(0,z_1),d(0,z_2)] for all t\\in[0,1], or (b) explicitly state that the claim is heuristic. An empirical observation rather than a mathematical fact. Without that, the so-called “hierarchy-preserving” property remains an intuitive but unverified idea, leaving the interpolation step, and thus one of the paper’s main technical contributions, on uncertain theoretical ground. \n\n---\nc) In Section 5, it compares only two models: the proposed P-VAE with a Poincare ball latent space and an E-VAE with Euclidean latent space. In the same subsection (“Models”), the authors explicitly state that prior music-VAE work on architectural optimisation and disentanglement (Roberts et al., 2018; Brunner et al., 2018; Li & Mandt, 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020b) is “orthogonal” to their goal of comparing hyperbolic vs Euclidean geometry and “may further improve results,” and is therefore not evaluated. They also implement a “standard Euclidean VAE” and note that it does not differ significantly from their E-VAE because the two are mathematically equivalent. As a result, all reported gains are of the form “P-VAE > this one Euclidean baseline,” and the experiments do not isolate curvature as the unique cause of improvement. To make the curvature claim testable, additional Euclidean and non-Euclidean baselines would be required. \n\nThat is, all reported improvements hinge on outperforming one basic flat-space model. The omission of stronger Euclidean or alternative-geometry baselines makes it impossible to determine whether the observed gains genuinely arise from negative curvature or merely from unrelated architectural or training differences. For me, this restricted setup cannot substantiate the paper’s central claim that hyperbolic geometry itself improves musical representations. To isolate curvature as the causal factor, the study should expand its baselines to include at least some of below:\n(i) advanced Euclidean controls such as β-VAEs, disentangled or hierarchical VAEs, or Euclidean VAEs with regularized Riemannian metrics (e.g., Chen et al., 2022);\n(ii) alternative non-Euclidean geometries like spherical or mixed-curvature manifolds (Skopek et al., 2020); and\n(iii) explicit ablations varying the curvature constant c while keeping all other parameters fixed."}, "questions": {"value": "- Section 4.3 Header reads “Riemannnian SLERP” (extra ‘n’)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "nWEhBWO1pK", "forum": "rIyS3dYAiH", "replyto": "rIyS3dYAiH", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18547/Reviewer_Jhze"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18547/Reviewer_Jhze"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18547/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761970556596, "cdate": 1761970556596, "tmdate": 1762928249511, "mdate": 1762928249511, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes learning hyperbolic representation spaces for music using variational autoencoders with a Poincaré ball latent space.

The Poincaré VAE and wrapped-normal sampling closely follow prior work (Nagano et al., 2019). R-SLERP is essentially a composition of log/exp maps and SLERP, with linear radial scaling. While it helps to avoid interpolation paths curving toward the origin, it does not constitute a clear theoretical advance or provide formal guarantees.\n\n- Speculative motivation. The claim that music is hierarchical rests on the combinatorial growth of note sequences, which applies to any sequential data. The dependency that “each note constrains the next” is not unique to music. The connection between musical structure and tree-like geometry, or negative curvature, is not formally or empirically substantiated.\n\n- Marginal empirical gains. The claim that hyperbolic representations are superior is not convincingly supported. Reconstruction improvements (Table 1) are small, yet the authors describe them as “impressively” demonstrating the superiority of hyperbolic latent spaces. Furthermore, the hyperbolic VAE increases runtime by 7–40%, and the latent dimensionality is identical to Euclidean baselines (128d for POP909, MAESTRO and 512d for MIDICAPS), undermining the expected efficiency benefits of hyperbolic representations.\n\n- Conceptual tension around interpolation. The authors argue that hyperbolic geometry is a natural fit for musical hierarchy, yet their principal interpolation justification is that hyperbolic geodesics are a poor choice (they curve inward, producing sparse midpoints). The authors must explain why choose hyperbolic geometry in the first place. \n\n- Insufficient experimental validation. R-SLERP is the main technical novelty, yet there is only 1 qualitative experiment presented. In this experiment, the results seem to agree with the hypothesis that hyperbolic geodesic interpolation lead to sparse midpoints. However, no comparison was made to Euclidean interpolation (Euclidean VAE) and there's no quantitative results to conclude that R-SLERP produces better or more meaningful interpolations.\n\n- Interpretability claims: The UMAP plot in Fig. 4 is interesting but there's no comparison against a Euclidean baseline to assess whether the angular separation and arrangement of keys is due to hyperbolic geometry. The same follows for the claim that radius encodes richness. There is a single example of this in Fig. 5c. Consequently, it's unclear whether the proposed approach is also better in terms of  interpretability.
