To address this, we introduce VISTA (Voting-based Integration of Subgraph Topologies for Acyclicity), a modular framework that decomposes the global causal structure learning problem into local subgraphs based on Markov Blankets. The global integration is achieved through a weighted voting mechanism that penalizes low-support edges via exponential decay, filters unreliable ones with an adaptive threshold, and ensures acyclicity using a Feedback Arc Set (FAS) algorithm. The framework is model-agnostic, imposing no assumptions on the inductive biases of base learners, is compatible with arbitrary data settings without requiring specific structural forms, and fully supports parallelization. We also theoretically establish finite-sample error bounds for VISTA, and prove its asymptotic consistency under mild conditions.

The goal of many causal discovery tasks is to learn the Markov blanket, yet this approach requires first learning the Markov blanket for each node — a process seems to be somewhat putting the cart before the horse. In general, the divide-and-conquer causal discovery techniques should try to avoid overly strong `divide ` tasks, for example, doing divide based on a learned rough skeleton or structure. For instance, we can first run the PC algorithm to construct a causal graph, then partition this graph and apply NOTEARS or DAG-GNN separately to each subgraph, and can yield better performance compared to directly applying the N./D. to the entire node set. But does this even make much sense?\n\n2.

The details of learning each subgraph are insufficient. Did the authors use the raw data, or the data consisting of the target variable and its Markov blanket?\n\n2. In part 3 of Section 2, the authors state that “they either assume correct inputs at merging time, …, or perform essentially uncalibrated frequency-based stitching”. Could the authors provide specific examples of existing methods that fall into each of these two categories? In addition, how does the proposed method differ from the latter type, given that it also learns local subgraphs from data and integrates them via weighted voting? Fundamentally, isn’t the proposed approach also frequency-based in nature?\n\n3. For Theorem 3.1, isn’t 𝐸 supposed to be the complete set of edges? Why is it stated that 𝐸 ⊆ 𝐸(𝐺’)? Moreover, it is unclear how 𝐺’ is derived. In other words, the construction of 𝐺[𝑋 \\cup 𝑀𝐵(𝑋)] (for X \\in V) is not properly defined in the proof. Consider the causal structure 𝐴→𝐵←𝐶 & 𝐴→D & D←𝐶. If we learn G[B \\cup MB(B)] (i.e. G(B \\cup {A,C})), is it learned solely from the data containing variables A, B and C? if so, it seems 𝐺’ cannot be correctly reconstructed. Could the authors clarify this? \n\n4. Figure 1 is useful as it illustrates the advantages of the proposed idea. However, there is one concern: the Markov blanket represents a subset of features, whereas other causal discovery methods output causal structure. Why, then, is it appropriate to compare them directly?\n\n5. Regarding Section 3.1, which constitutes the core of the paper, the authors introduce NV as the native idea (or baseline) motivating their approach. However, this baseline appears to be a misleading aggregation strategy. In causal discovery, researchers would not typically take the NV idea as the natural voting point. Instead, a more common and intuitive approach is to perform edge-level frequency voting first, followed by direction-level voting. Therefore, from my perspective, I consider that it is not appropriate to present the proposed method as a remedy to the limitations of NV, as this comparison lacks persuasiveness."}, "questions": {"value": "As noted in the Weaknesses, especially points 3 and 5."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "VAGibbpFy8", "forum": "DZUehXNiBn", "replyto": "DZUehXNiBn", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12436/Reviewer_JAtG"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12436/Reviewer_JAtG"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12436/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761814751465, "cdate": 1761814751465, "tmdate": 1762923322490, "mdate": 1762923322490, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies causal structure learning from observational data, with an emphasis on scalability to high-dimensional settings. In particular, the authors decompose the overall structure learning problem into local subproblems, and develop an integration strategy based on a weighted voting mechanism with acyclicity enforcement. For the weighted voting mechanism, they give each edge $X -> Y$ a score $s(X \\to Y)$, based both on the number of times that $X - Y$ occurs (with either orientation), and out of those times, what fraction of times it occurs in the orientation $X -> Y$. These weights are fed into a Greedy Feedback Arc Set (FAS) algorithm to (heuristically) maximize the total weight of included edges, while maintaining acyclicity, and the final graph is given by thresholding the GreedyFAS output.\n\nExperimentally, the authors test on synthetic data and on the Sachs protein signaling dataset, with various recent causal discovery algorithms as base learners. In the synthetic experiments, they study both Erdos-Renyi and scale-free graphs, with both a naive parameter generation strategy as well as a normalized strategy. Using their method (with especially with weighted voting) tends to improve the performance of base learners across various metrics, such as false discovery rate (FDR), true positive rate (TPR), structural Hamming distance (SHD), and F1 score, and decreases computation time.

The modularity of the proposed framework is nice, and the stitching algorithm is lightweight (though, by necessity, heuristic). Overall, the direction is a promising one for more scalable causal discovery.\n\n**Quality and clarity:** The motivation and methodology is well-described, as well as the reason for particular methodological choices.

In particular, I noted two main issues:\n1. **Introduction of unobserved confounding:** Taking a subset of nodes from a causal graph introduces unobserved confounding, even for Markov blankets. For example, take the graph with edge $X_1 \\to X_2$, $X_1 \\to X_3$, and for $k \\in \\\\{1,2,\\ldots,K \\\\}$, the edges $X_2 \\to Y_k$ and $X_3 \\to Y_k$. Then, for each $k$, the Markov blanket is $(X_2, X_3, Y_k)$, and the local graph will have an edge between $X_2$ and $X_3$. If $K$ is large, then there would be some edge between $X_2$ and $X_3$ in the final graph, even though that edge is not in the true graph. In particular, each base learner will *not* return the subgraph induced by ${V} \\cup \\text{MB}(V)$, but a supergraph of the induced graph. \n2. **Identifiability of orientations:** In the introduction, the authors state that \"the true DAG can be recovered given sufficient data\", but for only observational data, this is simply untrue without further assumptions (e.g. linearity + non-Gaussianity). It seems that their framework assumes every base learner returns a DAG, rather than a Markov equivalence class / essential graph. This should be discussed and emphasized, and is a limitation of their approach in settings where those further assumptions are unwarranted.\n\n**Minor weaknesses**\n3. I don't think Theorem 3.1 is worth stating as a theorem, it's immediately implied by the definition of the Markov blanket.\n4.
