A core challenge is encoding the relational features in asymmetric distance matrices of VRPs. Early attempts directly encoded these matrices but often failed to produce compact embeddings and generalized poorly at scale. In this paper, we propose RADAR, a scalable neural framework that augments existing neural VRP solvers with the ability to handle asymmetric inputs. RADAR addresses asymmetry from both static and dynamic perspectives. It leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the asymmetric distance matrix to initialize compact and generalizable embeddings that inherently encode the *static asymmetry* in the inbound and outbound costs of each node. To further model *dynamic asymmetry* in embedding interactions during encoding, it replaces the standard softmax with Sinkhorn normalization that imposes joint row and column distance awareness in attention weights. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks across various VRPs show that RADAR outperforms strong baselines on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution instances, demonstrating robust generalization and superior performance in solving asymmetric VRPs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Neural Combinatorial Optimization", "Vehicle Routing Problem"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/95691c2b974f62f5b57e2fa674485b879e3211f7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces RADAR, a scalable neural framework designed to address the limitation of existing neural solvers for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) that primarily rely on symmetric Euclidean distances, which restricts their applicability to real-world scenarios with asymmetric distances (e.g., one-way streets, traffic congestion).  \nRADAR tackles asymmetry from both static and dynamic perspectives: for static asymmetry, it uses Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) on the asymmetric distance matrix to initialize compact, generalizable node embeddings that capture each node’s role as a source (outbound costs) and destination (inbound costs); for dynamic asymmetry, it replaces standard row-wise softmax normalization with Sinkhorn normalization, which jointly normalizes rows and columns of the attention matrix to enforce balanced bidirectional flow and capture global distance information from both interacting nodes.  \nExtensive experiments on 17 synthetic VRP variants (e.g., ATSP, ACVRP) and 3 real-world datasets show that RADAR outperforms SOTA traditional and neural baselines.  \nI regard the asymmetric vehicle routing problem as highly significant yet relatively underexplored in current research.
