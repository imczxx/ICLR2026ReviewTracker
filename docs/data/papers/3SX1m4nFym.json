Recent studies have shown that incorporating thermodynamic knowledge into 3D representations can achieve superior novel view synthesis performance. However, in the absence of temporal evolution and temperature calibration data, the representation learning becomes ill-posed. To address this problem, our key insight is to leverage the low-pass characteristic of heat conduction to model scene representations in the frequency domain. To this end, we first represent the 3D thermal field using a continuous vector-matrix (VM) decomposition, and parameterize the resulting factors with a learnable wavelet basis. This allows us to explicitly disentangle the scene representation into low-frequency components that capture smooth thermal variations and high-frequency subbands that encode structural details. Next, we devise a high-frequency masking strategy to suppress infrared noise while preserving salient details. Concurrently, this mask guides a learnable geometric deformation field to optimize geometric details by directly adjusting the anchor positions, thereby eliminating the need for explicit material parameters. Finally, the modulated wavelet coefficients are dynamically reconstructed into a spatial-domain feature field via a differentiable inverse wavelet transform. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that WaveGS consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3DGS", "Thermal Novel View Synthesis"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b7c6583c59a2d5192bc54b5306c9a5c35982856d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes WaveGS, a physics-inspired neural 3D scene representation for thermal infrared novel view synthesis. The key motivation is that thermal radiation obeys heat diffusion, which behaves like a low-pass filter in the frequency domain: most energy concentrates in low-frequency components while high-frequency details are sparse and often noisy. WaveGS models a 3D thermal scene by (1) representing the scene as a continuous Vector-Matrix (VM) decomposition anchored on a sparse set of Scaffold-GS-like anchor points instead of dense voxel grids, enabling efficient querying and real-time Gaussian splatting. (2) Parameterizing both 1D vector factors and 2D matrix factors directly in the wavelet domain, explicitly separating low-frequency “smooth thermal field” components from multi-scale high-frequency subbands. (3) Learning a sparsity-inducing high-frequency mask that (i) suppresses noisy or spurious high-frequency coefficients via L1-style regularization, and (ii) guides a localized anchor deformation field which refines geometry only where structurally meaningful high-frequency responses exist, while enforcing smooth and spatially local corrections. The masked and modulated wavelet coefficients are then reconstructed back into the spatial domain via a differentiable inverse wavelet transform, yielding per-anchor features that drive Gaussian rendering. Experiments across four thermal datasets (RGBT-Scenes, ThermoScenes, TI-NSD, and NTR) show that WaveGS outperforms baselines including generic 3D Gaussian Splatting variants, frequency-aware methods such as FDS-GS, and physics-motivated thermal renderers such as Thermal3D-GS, ThermalGaussian, and NTR-Gaussian, often achieving the best PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS while maintaining real-time rendering (>200 FPS)."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- Strong physical motivation. The paper grounds its design in the physics of heat conduction (the heat equation), which implies exponential attenuation of high spatial frequencies in the Fourier domain. This provides a principled reason to bias the model toward low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency activations, rather than just adding ad-hoc frequency penalties.\n- Wavelet-domain parameterization of a 3D thermal field. Instead of learning everything in the spatial domain, WaveGS learns multi-scale wavelet coefficients (LL / LH / HL / HH) for both 1D vector and 2D matrix VM factors, then reconstructs them via differentiable inverse wavelet transform. This is claimed to be the first such parameterization specifically tailored to thermal novel view synthesis."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Novelty vs. system integration.\nWhile the physics motivation and the high-frequency-driven deformation are compelling, a large portion of the pipeline is a careful fusion of existing components: Scaffold-GS-style anchors and Gaussian rendering, VM/TensoRF-like low-rank factorization for continuous fields, multi-scale wavelets for frequency localization, sparsity regularization, etc. The paper could do more to clearly separate what is genuinely new from what is reused. Right now, I feel the method is a sophisticated “all-star mashup,” and it is not yet quite clear which pieces are indispensable.\n- Ablation scope.\nThe ablations are informative but mostly internal. We do not see an external control such as:\n(i) Scaffold-GS + learned local deformation but without wavelet-domain modeling (i.e., everything in spatial domain).\n(ii) FDS-GS + the proposed high-frequency sparsity mask and deformation field.\nSuch comparisons would better validate the claim that representing the scene in the wavelet domain is the main driver of improvement (and not simply the presence of a localized deformation MLP on top of an already strong Gaussian baseline).\n- No video / multiview flythrough evidence.\nThe paper mainly shows per-view still images and quantitative metrics (PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS), but does not convincingly present continuous camera flythroughs or multi-view trajectories (e.g., a smooth orbit around the scene, or UAV-style forward motion) demonstrating temporal / geometric consistency across frames."}, "questions": {"value": "These are questions where the author's rebuttal could meaningfully change my rating.\n- Modularity of contributions.\nCan you provide an ablation where you only add the wavelet-domain parameterization (multi-scale low/high-frequency coefficients) on top of a standard Gaussian Splatting baseline without the deformation field and sparsity mask? Conversely, can you show Scaffold-GS + localized deformation (guided by image-space edges or some heuristic) but still trained purely in the spatial domain, no wavelet? This would help isolate whether the true gain comes from the physics-inspired frequency modeling vs. the geometric refinement machinery.\n- Deformation stability.\nThe deformation field is regularized both for locality (penalizing displacement where the high-frequency mask is low) and for smoothness across neighboring anchors. Could you report whether this deformation ever “runs away,” e.g., causing anchors to drift and distort global geometry? Are there practical bounds or clamping heuristics you apply during training?\n- Video evidence of 3D consistency.\nCan you share multi-frame novel-view renderings (e.g., a smooth camera sweep, orbit, or UAV-style forward motion) for at least one of the thermal sequences if it is possible? This would directly address the concern that your method might be fitting each training view independently, rather than learning a stable, viewpoint-invariant 3D thermal field. A short flythrough video is often the most convincing qualitative proof of geometric consistency in Gaussian splatting / NeRF-style work.
