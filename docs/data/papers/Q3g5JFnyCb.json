These scores are central to evaluation protocols such as mean Average Precision (mAP) and to applications like pose selection, where predictions are ordered or filtered based on their scores. Yet, the quality of these rankings is often suboptimal, limiting overall performance. In this paper, we ask whether explicitly optimizing the ranking of confidence scores, without altering keypoint coordinates, can improve HPE. To this end, we formulate confidence ranking as a pairwise ordering problem, which, to our knowledge, has not been directly explored in HPE. We further propose a rank loss that upper bounds the negative expected likelihood of correct orderings and guarantees that reducing the loss leads to higher-quality rankings. To validate this formulation, we present Ranked Confidence Net (RCNet), a lightweight module with only 0.07M parameters that refines confidence rankings post hoc while leaving keypoints unchanged. RCNet serves as both a conceptual demonstration of the value of ranking and a practical tool with negligible computational cost. Experiments on COCO show consistent improvements across strong HPE baselines, with an average gain of 0.7 mAP (ranging from 0.3 to 1.8), and consistent gains on CrowdPose. These results establish confidence ranking, independent of coordinate refinement, as an effective and previously overlooked direction for advancing human pose estimation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Human Pose Estimation; Confidence; Learning to Rank"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b0107ae1cb4a366ee7d8b76f8e68cf8e88d17bc4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/fe7be5b7605c414bd5a6a12e3f32d94f6766ee57.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the neglected problem of ranking confidence scores in 2D human pose estimation (HPE).

Please consider reporting improvements on the larger variants of ViTPose at 384 resolution.\n\n- Ranking gains don’t change recall: By design, RCNet reorders scores and leaves detections/coords unchanged; mAR is unaffected, limiting impact when localization is already the bottleneck (in crowding, occlusions or truncations).\n\n- “Near-random” baseline ranking claim: Sec. 4 explains the near-random baseline claim for ranking. The paper shows ~58–63% pairwise accuracy for several methods, but this hinges on pair sampling and the matching protocol. Please correct me if I am wrong under the top-down COCO greedy-matching protocol, ranking should not be near-random (due to predicted confidence based sorting) and should not materially affect mAP. Please clarify the setup.\n\n- Limited qualitative results: Fig. 4 in the main paper is the only qualitative example and does not show how precision improves over the baseline. Please revise to clearly visualize the benefit from correct re-ranking (e.g., highlight corrected orderings and the resulting AP change for the shown image).
