First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, the iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about the graph communities at different levels of refinement, concatenating the community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) on this new feature vector. By doing so, we inherently obtain the topological data about the nodes and their neighbors without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs—without the need for sampling. Our results, on a wide set of graphs, show that ATLAS has comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with accuracy being as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and\n11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.", "tldr": "We present a topology aware MLP-based graph learning algorithm as a high-fidelity and scalable alternative to GNNs", "keywords": ["Topology aware embedding", "Scalability", "Heterophilic graphs", "MLP", "GNN"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2e08e0f608ff65a46b657e4b862e7bdba4fec0d2.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c3891507d8cfabf4da0a090fca7cba81f339ea0c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes ATLAS, a topology-based learning method aiming to handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs by incorporating community detection information into MLP features.

This design eliminates costly message passing while preserving structural information, enabling efficient learning on large graphs. The authors also introduce a theoretical framework using normalized mutual information (NMI) to adaptively refine communities based on the degree of homophily, achieving strong interpretability and adaptability.\n\nHowever, the experimental evaluation has notable weaknesses. On the OGBN-Products dataset, the set of comparison baselines is too limited and includes mostly outdated methods, making it difficult to assess ATLAS’s true competitiveness against modern scalable and heterophily-aware GNNs.
