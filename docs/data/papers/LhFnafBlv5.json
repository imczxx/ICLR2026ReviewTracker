Current approaches predominantly repurpose backbones from Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Computer Vision (CV) (e.g., Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time series (e.g., periodicity and fluctuation). The research community lacks dedicated backbones incorporating temporal-specific inductive biases, depending on domain-agnostic backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition). We introduce Fourier Neural Filter (FNF) as the backbone and Dual Branch Decoupler (DBD) as the architecture to provide exceptional learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for spatiotemporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that FNF integrates time-domain and frequency-domain analysis while enabling adaptive truncation of noise components within a unified backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling. Through the lens of information bottleneck theory, we reveal that DBD delivers superior gradient flow and representation capacity, enabling it to effectively capture local and global, temporal and spatial information comprehensively. Our empirical evaluation on 12 public benchmark datasets, encompassing both multivariate long-term and short-term forecasting tasks, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to existing advanced baseline models. Notably, our approach achieves these results without any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["time series forecasting"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/92a1c6f3d97f0a96813a9301610928f024b214ee.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b48a29d6aeeb7c8745bb870c88c9570b750e56e9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Time Filter (TiF), combining a new Fourier Neural Filter (FNF) backbone with a Dual Branch Decoupler (DBD) architecture.

FNF’s contributions (input-dependent kernel, selective activation, adaptive truncation) are close in spirit to prior spectral/fractional operators (e.g., FNO/AFNO/FITS/FreMLP). The paper does not clearly establish what capability FNF enables that prior spectral blocks cannot, beyond architectural composition; DBD overlaps with known parallel/dual-path decouplers (e.g., Leddam [1], xPatch [2], MTGNN [3], TimeMixer++ [4], just to name a few). A sharper comparison or operator-replacement study is needed.\n\n2. There is no working anonymous repo or pseudo code for review, which limits the reproducibility of the proposed method.\n\n3. For PeMS, the lookback is fixed to 96 for all baselines, which can bias results; fair practice tunes input length per method (as you already did for Table 2). Please align protocols across tasks.\n\n4. Table 2 lacks more recent strong baselines (e.g., TimeMixer++ [4] (ICLR25), PatchMLP [5] (AAAI25), TQNet [6], and TimeBridge [7] (ICML25)), which undermines the SOTA claim; please add with identical splits/tuning.\n\n5. The proposed FNF looks conceptually overlapped with selective state-space models such as Mamba: both realize an input-conditioned long filter with a gated residual/skip path. In FNF, the frequency-domain parameterization (F → complex transform → adaptive truncation → F⁻¹) effectively implements a learnable long convolution; Mamba parameterizes a similar operation via SSM kernels and a selective gate. The manuscript should explicitly position FNF against Mamba/S4-family—clarifying what FNF does that a selective SSM cannot—and include quantitative comparisons.\n\n*[1] Revitalizing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Learnable Decomposition with Inter-Series Dependencies and Intra-Series Variations Modeling.*\n\n*[2] xPatch: Dual-Stream Time Series Forecasting with Exponential Seasonal-Trend Decomposition.*\n\n*[3] Connecting the Dots: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Graph Neural Networks.*\n\n*[4] TimeMixer++: A General Time Series Pattern Machine for Universal Predictive Analysis.*\n\n*[5] Unlocking the Power of Patch: Patch-Based MLP for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting.*\n\n*[6] Temporal Query Network for Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting.*\n\n*[7] TimeBridge: Non-Stationarity Matters for Long-term Time Series Forecasting.*"}, "questions": {"value": "See in weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "XVP3u1iOZ2", "forum": "LhFnafBlv5", "replyto": "LhFnafBlv5", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6038/Reviewer_oAZB"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6038/Reviewer_oAZB"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6038/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760600456471, "cdate": 1760600456471, "tmdate": 1762918424655, "mdate": 1762918424655, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new architecture for multivariate time series forecasting, including two key components:\n(1) Fourier Neural Filter (FNF), an input-dependent integral kernel operator that unifies time-domain and frequency-domain modeling, extending the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) by introducing adaptive gating, selective activation, and learnable truncation for denoising.\n(2) Dual Branch Decoupler (DBD), a dual-path structure inspired by information-bottleneck theory that decouples temporal and spatial processing for improved gradient flow and representation capacity."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The organization needs improvement to make it easier to follow. In the Related Work, it is unclear why distribution shift and non-autoregressive decoding are reviewed, as these topics do not appear to be central to the paper’s main contributions.

The theoretical claims in this paper are mostly definitions or intuition.

Additional experiments using a fixed window size and including statistical significance tests would help address these concerns.\n\n3.
