For an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference \\& Messaging for Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.", "tldr": "ECHO-MIMIC uses LLM-guided evolutionary search to evolve interpretable heuristics and personalized nudges that align many local agents to a global objective, turning ill-structured collective-action problems into tractable ones.", "keywords": ["Large Language Models (LLMs)", "Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)", "Program Synthesis", "Code Heuristics", "Hyper-heuristics", "LLM-guided Search", "Collective Action", "Commons Governance", "Mechanism Design & Nudging", "Personalized Persuasion", "Behavioral Messaging", "Multi-agent Coordination", "Ecological Connectivity"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fd9c9faf8be53732052191d9a45fc8b11381b6ad.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a6eae43457c1eed50d1abd68857b7510d04b8ccc.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper applies the idea of Evolutionary Search with LLMs to the problems of (1) navigating an ill-structured collective action dilemma (agricultural landscape management) and (2) finding appropriate heuristics to resolve the dilemma.

I am interested to hear from the AC and other reviewers how they feel about it. I will elaborate on two complementary fronts on which I feel like the paper has not demonstrated yet that their main contribution, the method ECHO-MIMIC, is effective.\n- What evidence do we have that a capable LLM agent, say in two years time, is not able to surpass the performance of ECHO-MIMIC with the newest LLM at that time? ECHO-MIMIC is introducing a lot of constraining structure onto the problem of solving the agricultural landscape management issue. They present DSPy MiPROv2 as \"a strong LLM-native baseline\", and show that ECHO-MIMIC performs much better. But I yet have to feel convinced that a framework like ECHO-MIMIC can hold its ground against increasingly capable general LLM agent scaffolds that can be prompted to resolve the collective action problem. I suggest adding a side by side comparisons of how ECHO-MIMIC scales with stronger base LLMs vs how a general LLM agent framework scales with stronger base LLMs. \n- While the agricultural landscape management is interesting to our society in its own right, I do not think that it is sufficiently interesting to the ICLR community to serve as the only test bed for your method. It is hard to gauge how generalizable your insights about ECHO-MIMIC are *beyond* your particular problem of interest (say, other collective action problems or social dilemmas). To me, the current narrative and focus of the paper seems to fit much better into non-ML venues with a stronger emphasis on solving individual collective action problems. (This is despite acknowledging that your method ECHO-MIMIC is fully ML-based.) \n- Less important, but maybe also illustrating the point above: The paper did not put much effort into putting their work in the context of related ML/AI work that is addressing (ecological) collective action problems / social dilemmas."}, "questions": {"value": "When you decided to tackle the ill structured problem through a dual approach on the agent level as well as on the global policy maker level, what factors drove your decision to introduce a policy level agent specifically with regards to how much power you give it for influencing the individual agents?

MIMIC then evolves natural‑language nudges tailored to agent personas (Resistant, Economic, Social) that are evaluated by having a \"Farm LLM\" edit its baseline code in response to the message (Stage 4).

The framing of ill-structured problems into a series of well-structured subproblems is both conceptually strong and well justified. The implementation of ECHO-MIMIC is technically sound: the evolutionary loop is clear, the operator analysis is detailed, and the authors provide transparent code-fitness tracking. The connection between code complexity and heuristic performance (Fig. 3, p. 7) adds credibility that the model is actually learning something non-trivial rather than just overfitting toy patterns. The integration of behavioral messaging through MIMIC is also compelling, the idea of evolving not just the policy but the persuasive mechanism for its adoption is fresh and well-motivated. Empirically, the method convincingly outperforms a strong baseline (DSPy MiPROv2) on both the imitation and the collective-goal tasks (Table 1, p. 9). Overall, the paper sits at an interesting intersection of AI for social systems, mechanism design, and interpretability research."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The biggest concern is the narrowness of the experimental setup. All results come from a stylized five-farm synthetic landscape with simplified geometry and an overly discrete target metric (IIC), which makes it hard to judge real-world robustness. Even though ECHO beats the baseline, the absolute accuracies on global-target learning are low (0.13–0.31 across farms, Table 1, p. 9). It’s unclear if the learned heuristics are practically usable or just internally consistent. The use of LLM-simulated “Farm” agents to evaluate nudges is clever but questionable as a proxy for real human behavior, especially since the authors note that outcomes degrade substantially when swapping model families (Gemini 2.0 vs 1.5). Reproducibility across providers and prompts seems fragile. The complexity-performance trade-off (Fig. 3d, p. 7) also undercuts the claim that the method produces “simple, executable heuristics”; the best programs appear relatively opaque and brittle. Finally, some design choices, like mapping directional sets to fractional intervention values or relying on neighbor in-context examples, feel ad-hoc and would likely break under different spatial or economic assumptions."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
