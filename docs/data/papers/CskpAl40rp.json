This paper proposes a matched-pair experimental design that sequentially and actively enrolls patients in high treatment-effect regions. Importantly, we frame the identification of the target region as a classification problem and propose an active learning framework tailored to matched-pair designs. Our design not only reduces the experimental cost of detecting treatment efficacy, but also ensures that the identified regions enclose the entire high-treatment-effect regions.

The motivation arises from the challenge that when the overall treatment effect in a population is small, conventional matched-pair designs may lack sufficient statistical power due to inefficient random sampling. The proposed approach reformulates the identification of high treatment-effect regions as a classification problem and employs an active learning strategy adapted from the RobustCAL algorithm to sequentially select participant pairs for experimentation. The authors provide theoretical guarantees showing that the enrollment region generated by MPED-RobustCAL encloses and converges to the true high-effect region, with improved label efficiency compared to passive learning, while maintaining statistical validity through Type I error control. Experiments conducted on synthetic data and two real-world datasets demonstrate that MPED-RobustCAL achieves higher testing power and true positive rates than conventional matched-pair designs and existing active designs such as regression-based active design and Bayesian active learning methods.

Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets such as ALS and IHDP, the authors show that MPED-RobustCAL achieves higher testing power, improved precision, and faster convergence in identifying regions with high treatment effects. The method is robust across different classifiers and label budgets, and the theoretical analysis is thorough, with proofs supporting the main claims. The inclusion of sensitivity analyses and comparisons with other active learning baselines further strengthens the empirical evaluation.\n\nHowever, the paper also has some limitations. The performance of MPED-RobustCAL, while generally superior, can be affected by label noise and imperfect ground-truth identification in real-world datasets, which may prevent the true positive rate from reaching its theoretical maximum. Additionally, the learning efficiency of MPED-RobustCAL is sometimes lower than that of the original RobustCAL due to extra label queries required for two-sample testing. The method’s reliance on certain hyperparameters and the need for careful tuning may also limit its practical applicability in some settings. Overall, while the approach is promising and well-supported, further work on reducing sensitivity to noise and hyperparameters would enhance its impact."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "na"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "na"}, "questions": {"value": "na"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "na"}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "PbfD55Lria", "forum": "CskpAl40rp", "replyto": "CskpAl40rp", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14523/Reviewer_iumY"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14523/Reviewer_iumY"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14523/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761906187767, "cdate": 1761906187767, "tmdate": 1762924918174, "mdate": 1762924918174, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The work proposes a new experimental setting to consider within the context of detecting the existence of a treatment effect.

The motivational issues translate to a seeming lack of novelty. This may partly be because of the introduction and related work being squeezed into < 1.5 pages.\n\n**Novelty:** \n\nI believe that the authors do not do a good job of distinguishing their contribution from prior work. For example, the authors mention the existence of a separate field known as the estimation of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). The authors explicitly define CATE as quantifying the treatment effect size with a limited sample. The authors instead claim their work is more about detecting the existence of a treatment effect. Semantically, both lines of work can be considered as the same concept as the end result is understanding how a treatment impacts different subgroups of populations. I understand that CATE may be more of a post hoc analysis rather than the sequential online setting of this paper. However, if that is the case, then it should be possible to analyze how these CATE methods perform if molded into the framework of a sequential design which is not seen in the experimental setting.\n\nThe authors also base their method as an alteration on top of the Robust CAL active learning approach. Specifically, they identify that their method does an additional sampling step into the positive agreement region of a set of classifiers. This can be a significant contribution, but there is no explicit analysis that distinguishes their method from that of Robust CAL. Specifically, there is no intuition about the benefit of sampling from the positive agreement region and in fact they show that it results in lower label efficiency compared to the Robust CAL algorithm by itself. Their theoretical analysis compares against passive learning, but an in depth comparison against Robust CAL would do more to highlight their own novelty. This problem is further exacerbated by the lack of a comparison against Robust CAL in their empirical results section. \n\n**Motivation:**\n\nIn general, I think the novelty issue is partially due to a lack of motivation regarding the significance of their method itself. For example, their opening figure shows that their method is enrolling targets from a superset of targets, but their isn’t an analysis or any intuition that makes it clear why sampling over this larger region is better. In fact, I wonder if this sampling strategy has potential downfalls for sampling outside the region where the treatment effect takes place.\n\nThere also isn’t specific intuition regarding the choice of adding onto the Robust CAL algorithm. There are many active learning frameworks such as BALD, CoreSet, entropy, etc. What is it about Robust CAL specifically that motivated its choice for this very specific medical context problem? The entire label complexity analysis is based on this paper, but I am still unsure why it was chosen.\n\n**Experimental:**\n\nThe problems of Novelty and Motivation are also highlighted by the choice of experiments with respect to their method. The authors claim their method is an improvement on Robust CAL, but it doesn’t compare against it in any of the experiments. Instead it compares against regular MPED, a regression based active design strategy, and tau-BALD. This limits how much we can assess the novelty of the method in this paper, because it isn’t clear how the base strategy would have done. It would have also been natural to compare against standard active learning strategies such as Coreset, entropy, margin sampling, and other strategies that commonly appear in the literature. It isn’t clear to me why these methods could not have been adapted to this setting and given a fair basis of comparison. \n\nI would have also been curious to establish differences amongst the selected targets that led to the improvement we observe empirically. For example, how did the samples with MPED-RobustCAL differ from those selected by MPED and can we visually or analytically show what covariates were sampled compared to those from the base algorithm.\n\nI also think certain natural ablation studies are missing from this paper. For example, I understand that it is difficult to acquire data suitable for the MPED task, however, it would be good to perform a more comprehensive assessment with the synthetically generated data. For example, in the synthetic data, we could vary the treatment effect threshold and establish some intuition about how the method performs under different gamma values. Furthermore, it would have been good to establish how certain choices like s=0.5 corresponds to different real world clinical experimental conditions."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Why wasn’t their a comparison with several active learning strategies? Is there something specific about BALD that admits its usage here, but not others?\n\n2. Why wasn’t Robust CAL a comparison in the plots? I felt that would be a natural comparison.\n\n3. Is there a way to intuitively demonstrate the advantages of sampling from both DIS and POS. I don’t fully understand why this implies enclosing the target region. I also want to see how this idea of DIS and POS evolves over training and potentially how this relates to certain distributions of covariates. Potentially, this would be a learning dynamics study of the 10 classifiers in the ensemble."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "DYcfDOJaut", "forum": "CskpAl40rp", "replyto": "CskpAl40rp", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14523/Reviewer_PCUW"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14523/Reviewer_PCUW"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14523/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761927055831, "cdate": 1761927055831, "tmdate": 1762924917547, "mdate": 1762924917547, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes MPED-RobustCAL, an active-learning framework for matched-pair experimental designs (MPEDs) aimed at detecting (rather than estimating) treatment effects when the overall ATE is small but there exists a responsive subregion Ω_γ.
