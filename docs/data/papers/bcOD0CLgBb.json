Existing differential privacy defenses assume uniform sensitivity across embedding dimensions, leading to excessive noise and degraded utility. We propose SPARSE, a user-centric framework for concept-specific privacy protection in text embeddings. SPARSE combines (1) differentiable mask learning to identify privacy-sensitive dimensions for user-defined concepts, and (2) the Mahalanobis mechanism that applies elliptical noise calibrated by dimension sensitivity. Unlike traditional spherical noise injection, SPARSE selectively perturbs privacy-sensitive dimensions while preserving non-sensitive semantics. Evaluated across six datasets with three embedding models and attack scenarios, SPARSE consistently reduces privacy leakage while achieving superior downstream performance compared to state-of-the-art DP methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Text Embedding", "Privacy", "Defense", "Inversion Attack"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2e7a012cf4a81ad401b5d261dc5840018facc772.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents SPARSE, a user-centric framework for concept-specific privacy protection in text embeddings.

For instance, an epsilon of 5 provides strong privacy but reduces utility by half. This trade-off improves for higher epsilon values, but one may still have to accept a leakage of 35%–50% to preserve utility, requiring an epsilon of 20.\n- There is no analysis of how the method affects the representation of related concepts. For example, if SPARSE protects a concept like gender, how does this influence related concepts such as appearance descriptions or commonly gender-biased attributes?\n\nMinor remarks:\n- There is a missing space in L39: \"T5-based embeddings.Such\"\n- L207: \"We\" should probably be capitalized."}, "questions": {"value": "- Could the method, in principle, also be applied to LLM prompt extraction attacks, such as in “Extracting Prompts by Inverting LLM Outputs” (Zhang et al.)?\n- How long does fitting the binary masks approximately take?\n- How many attributes can the method defend against simultaneously before utility is completely compromised? For example, if we aim to prevent leakage not only of age but also of gender, ethnicity, illness, political opinion, etc., at the same time.\n- L210: Is removing the private words in the negative sample set the best strategy?
