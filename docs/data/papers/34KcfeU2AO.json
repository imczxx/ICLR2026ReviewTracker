First, we introduce CrackInst1K, to our knowledge the first publicly available instance-level crack segmentation dataset, comprising 1025 high-resolution tunnel images with pixel-accurate instance masks. Second, we propose CrackInstSynth, a generative data-augmentation framework that substantially enlarges instance-level crack corpora while preserving geometric and topological realism. CrackInstSynth integrates three coordinated modules: (i) Region-level Instance Placement (RIP), which partitions the canvas into quadrants to strategically position crack instances for diverse layouts; (ii) a Physics-driven Skeleton Generator (PSG) that enriches morphological variability by growing crack skeletons via physical simulation; and (iii) a Topology-Preserving Generation Module (TPGM) that employs a two-stage conditional diffusion pipeline (skeleton→mask, mask→image) to produce paired, width-aware instance masks and corresponding images while enforcing intra-instance topology and inter-instance separation. Extensive experiments show that augmenting real data with CrackInstSynth consistently improves the performance of multiple instance segmentation models on CrackInst1K and other benchmarks, validating both visual fidelity and downstream effectiveness.

Its core contributions lie in two aspects: Firstly, it constructs and releases the CrackInst1K dataset, a specialized benchmark containing 1025 high-resolution tunnel lining images with pixel-level instance annotations, directly addressing the severe challenge of data scarcity in this field, especially the lack of instance-level annotations. Secondly, it develops the CrackInstSynth data augmentation framework, which can synthesize a large number of image-mask pairs that are precisely aligned with annotations and maintain the topological structure of cracks through region-level instance placement, physics-driven skeleton generation, and topology-preserving diffusion models. The main strength of this paper lies in the completeness and systematicness of its work. From the collection, annotation and release of the dataset, to the design and implementation of the enhancement methods, and then to the comprehensive experimental verification, a complete closed loop has been formed. The experimental design is particularly commendable. It not only evaluated the visual quality of the generated images but also introduced topological consistency metrics and deeply examined the improvement effect of synthetic data on the performance of downstream instance segmentation models, with convincing conclusions. The released resources have clear practical value in promoting the research on automation in the field of structural health monitoring."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper presents a comprehensive and well-structured contribution, combining dataset creation (CrackInst1K) and a generative augmentation framework (CrackInstSynth) into a cohesive pipeline that forms a complete research cycle from data collection and annotation to synthesis and validation.

CrackInst1K dataset scale and diversity are limited: The paper claims CrackInst1K is the \"first publicly available instance-level crack segmentation dataset,\" but it only contains 1025 images far smaller than large-scale crack datasets like OmniCrack30k (2024, 30k images) and lacks diversity across infrastructure types (e.g., only tunnel linings, no bridge decks or pavements). This narrow focus restricts its applicability to multi-scenario structural health monitoring.\nb. Literature citation lags and incomplete comparison: The related work section focuses on pre-2024 datasets (e.g., CFD 2016, DeepCrack 2018) but fails to compare with the latest 2024 crack datasets like OmniCrack30k (which has large-scale data but no instance labels). It also ignores recent generative augmentation methods for thin structures (e.g., 2024 works on topology-aware diffusion for linear defects), leading to an incomplete positioning of the work’s innovation.\nc. Instance-level annotation advantage is weak: The paper emphasizes that CrackInst1K provides instance IDs, but it does not quantify the value of instance labels e.g., no comparison between models trained on instance labels vs. binary masks. Without demonstrating that instance labels significantly improve downstream tasks (e.g., crack length/width measurement accuracy), the uniqueness of the dataset is not fully justified.\n\nRegarding the technical part, I have several doubts:\na. CrackInst1K dataset construction details are missing: The raw image acquisition uses a \"vehicle-mounted line-scan system,\" but the paper does not specify key parameters (e.g., camera resolution, scanning speed) or how stitching errors during raw stripe assembly are corrected—stitching artifacts could affect crack continuity and annotation accuracy. Data anonymization relies on \"stitching patches from different timestamps and camera poses\" but does not provide rules for mosaic stitching (e.g., overlap rate, alignment criteria). It is currently unclear whether the mosaic processing disrupts crack continuity or introduces false edges.\nb. CrackInstSynth module parameter settings lack validation: RIP fixes the number of instances to 1–3 based on the \"1m² usually has no more than 3 cracks\" prior, but this prior is not verified with real tunnel inspection data (e.g., no statistical analysis of crack density in actual tunnels). Using a fixed range may limit the diversity of synthetic layouts. PSG’s random walk parameters (step length 2px, turning angle ±30°, maximum length 0.8× window diagonal) are set empirically. No parameter sensitivity analysis is conducted e.g., how changes in step length affect skeleton realism or model performance.\nc. Instance truncation in RIP is unaddressed: RIP allows instances to overflow quadrants and clips them to the canvas, which may truncate crack ends. The paper does not evaluate how truncation affects model training (e.g., whether truncated cracks lead to under-segmentation) or provide a solution to avoid truncation.\n\nRegarding the experimental part, I have several doubts:\na. Model generalization verification is insufficient: The main text only focuses on Mask R-CNN results, and while Appendix A.5.2 mentions other models (e.g., Mask2Former, SOLOv2), it does not analyze why performance gains vary across models (e.g., why one-stage models benefit less from synthetic data). No validation on non-tunnel crack datasets (e.g., bridge crack data) is conducted, making it impossible to confirm the framework’s cross-scenario applicability.\nb. Ablation experiments are incomplete: Table 3 evaluates the impact of removing RIP/PSG/TC-ControlNet but does not isolate the contributions of TopoDownsample and SPADE Norm in TC-ControlNet (e.g., testing \"only TopoDownsample,\" \"only SPADE Norm,\" \"both\"). It also does not test how synthetic data quality (e.g., realistic vs. low-quality synthetic masks) affects model performance, failing to validate the core value of topology preservation.\nc. Cross-dataset evaluation is biased: When testing on DeepCrack and CRACK500 (semantic segmentation datasets), the paper treats them as \"single-instance datasets.\" However, semantic segmentation masks do not distinguish individual cracks, so converting them to instance labels may introduce artificial annotations, leading to overestimated performance of the proposed method.\n\nRegarding the structural and presentation issues, I have several doubts:\na. Key results lack visual support: Figure 1 (workflow) shows crack measurement but does not compare measured values (e.g., width 2.9px) with actual physical sizes, making it impossible to verify the accuracy of geometric attribute extraction. Figure 4 (qualitative results) only shows tunnel and pavement styles but no side-by-side comparison with real images of the same style, failing to intuitively demonstrate synthetic data realism.\nb. Dataset and code availability are unclear: The paper states that CrackInst1K and CrackInstSynth will be released \"upon acceptance\" but provides no preview (e.g., sample images, annotation format documentation) or release platform (e.g., GitHub). Without this information, reproducibility and practical value are difficult to assess.\nc. Limitations are not discussed: The conclusion only summarizes contributions but does not mention limitations (e.g., CrackInst1K’s narrow tunnel focus, CrackInstSynth’s poor performance on highly branched cracks, MIP’s inefficiency).
