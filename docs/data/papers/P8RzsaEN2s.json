Existing methods place all entities on one homogeneous manifold—Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic, or their product/multi‑curvature variants, to model linear, symmetric, or hierarchical patterns. Yet a predefined, homogeneous manifold cannot accommodate the sharply varying curvature that real‑world graphs exhibit across local regions. Since this geometry is imposed a priori, any mismatch with the knowledge graph’s local curvatures will distort distances between entities and hurt the expressiveness of the resulting KGE. To rectify this, we propose RicciKGE to have the KGE loss gradient coupled with local curvatures in an extended Ricci flow such that entity embeddings co-evolve dynamically with the underlying manifold geometry towards mutual adaptation. Theoretically, when the coupling coefficient is bounded and properly selected, we rigorously prove that i) all the edge-wise curvatures decay exponentially, meaning that the manifold is driven toward the Euclidean flatness; and ii) the KGE distances strictly converge to a global optimum, which indicates that geometric flattening and embedding optimization are promoting each other. Experimental improvements on link prediction and node classification benchmarks demonstrate RicciKGE's effectiveness in adapting to heterogeneous knowledge graph structures.", "tldr": "We establish RicciKGE, a framework coupling embeddings with extended Ricci flow, proving curvature decay and convergence under heterogeneous knowledge graph geometries.", "keywords": ["Knowledge graph embedding; Ricci flow; Geometric learning"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2d03cc21025507d7d43fcab084122364c8d28b9c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/00a1fe99bda4b5af1dd2244915c1596aecd6269c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper targets the geometric mismatch that arises when knowledge graph embeddings are forced into a predefined, homogeneous manifold, which distorts distances under locally heterogeneous curvature.

The motivation is precise and grounded in limitations of homogeneous manifolds for KGE: the paper clearly articulates how a static geometric prior misaligns with locally varying curvature in real KGs. This framing connects well to manifold-based KGE literature and sets a concrete failure mode that the method aims to fix. \n\n2. Theoretical analysis is not superficial: Theorem 1 proves exponential decay of edge-wise Ricci curvature under bounded coupling, and the corollary establishes linear convergence of distances under strong convexity. The interplay between curvature decay and optimization is discussed rather than just stated, which raises confidence in the mechanism’s stability.\n\n3. The algorithmic presentation is serviceable: Algorithm 1 aligns the distance-flow step with embedding updates, and the complexity section isolates the main overhead (curvature estimation via Sinkhorn) with a parallelization argument. While brief, this helps practitioners estimate costs of adoption."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The contribution over prior curvature-flow work feels incremental and needs sharper differentiation. The paper extends discrete Ricci flow with a gradient coupling term, but related graph Ricci-flow models and geometric regularizers already exist; the delta versus prior discrete/extended flows (e.g., geometry-only flows or Ricci-guided graph methods) remain under-quantified. A stronger ablation isolating “pure Ricci flow”, “pure gradient”, and “coupled” variants across datasets is necessary to establish novelty in effect, not just form. \n2. The theoretical guarantees rely on strong and somewhat idealized assumptions that may not reflect KGE training practice. The curvature result assumes volume/diameter bounds, Sobolev inequalities, and a spectral gap on a closed manifold; the distance convergence assumes µ-strong convexity in distance, while typical KGE losses combine non-convex components, negative sampling, and relation-specific transforms. The paper does not empirically validate robustness when these assumptions fail, leaving a theory–practice gap. \n3. There is a conceptual tension between the motivation (preserving heterogeneous local curvature) and the main theorem (all edge-wise curvature decays to zero). The text argues that curvature “imprints” are absorbed into embeddings during transients, but the paper provides limited qualitative or quantitative evidence of what structural signals survive once the manifold is flat. Visualization or probing tasks before/after flattening would help reconcile this tension. \n4. The empirical gains, while consistent, are often small and sometimes not state-of-the-art, and the statistical significance is not established. Table 1 shows multiple deltas around +0.1 to +0.4 MRR on FB15K-237 and cases that do not surpass the strongest baseline; no confidence intervals or paired tests are reported. Given the added O(|E|(k^2+kd)) overhead per epoch from curvature estimation, time–accuracy tradeoffs (including wall-clock, GPU memory, and scaling on larger KGs) should be reported to justify practicality. \n5. Reproducibility and implementation specifics are thin at submission time. Code is promised only upon acceptance, and several details are under-specified: the exact Sinkhorn parameters for W1, normalization schemes for edge weights, β search ranges and schedules, negative sampling strategies, and seed/variance reporting across runs. The β sensitivity plot is helpful, but does not replace a thorough hyperparameter protocol and release of full configs for each backbone"}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ZQUZayGNo0", "forum": "P8RzsaEN2s", "replyto": "P8RzsaEN2s", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3076/Reviewer_jDYF"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3076/Reviewer_jDYF"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3076/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761836589048, "cdate": 1761836589048, "tmdate": 1762916541020, "mdate": 1762916541020, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes RicciKGE, a curvature-adaptive knowledge graph embedding method that couples the KGE loss gradient with local edge-wise curvatures via an extended Ricci flow, allowing embeddings and manifold geometry to co-evolve.

Can you define \"neighbourhood measures\" in the main paper before or around line 143? Since $\\kappa(i, j)$ is so central to the Ricci curvature used to define the method, I believe it is important that most concepts it depends on are contained in the main paper.\n2. Can you define $\\beta$ and $\\text{Ric}_{ij}$ in Eq. (2)? For the latter, it was also no longer used in the remainder of the paper, and its definition is left vague. Is it supposed to be some form of $\\kappa(i, j)$? Is that important? Nevertheless, you could also consider rewriting Eq. (2) in a way that reflects that.\n3. Algorithm 1 suggests that embeddings are updated in sequence. Is that the case? If yes, since certain entities can appear in multiple triplets, this might lead to multiple updates happening, which seems problematic. If not, can you please make this clearer in the algorithm?\n4. Previous empirical evidence, such as AttH (Chami et al., 2020), suggests that a good match between the geometry of embeddings and the graph structure would enable lower-dimensional embeddings to outperform methods that ignore that (e.g., TransE, DistMult, etc.). In this context, looking at Table 1 (emb. dim. 32) would suggest that the performance gap should be larger for those methods versus AttH/GoldE, while that gap is indeed small in higher embedding dimensions. Why is that not consistently the case for lower dimenions in your results? Is there a more elaborate phenomenom going on?\n\n**Other comments:**\n\n- l. 483: Our theoretically => theory?\n\n**References**\n\nChami, I., Wolf, A., Juan, D. C., Sala, F., Ravi, S., & Ré, C.
