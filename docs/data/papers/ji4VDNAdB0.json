In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, full utilization of qubits is impractical due to resource limitations. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes Quantum-Critic Proximal Policy Optimization (QC-PPO), where the critic is designed using Quantum Neural Networks, whereas an actor is implemented using conventional networks. We further argue that allocating quantum capacity to the critic serves as a more natural lever for performance gains in actor-critic RL. This is because bootstrapped value estimates shape advantage computation, which consequently shapes the direction of every policy update. Evaluations on multiple MuJoCo environments show consistent improvements; on Humanoid-v4, QC-PPO improves the median return by 52.3\\% over PPO with equal environment steps, demonstrating its potential for on-board applications.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "quantum machine learning", "robotics"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8ff3f32808029b6db6e8d0b87d99f7bb234268a2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors present a hybrid quantum-classical actor-critic reinforcement learning model called Quantum-Critic Proximal Policy Optimization (QC-PPO), where the classical neural network in the critic is replaced by a quantum neural network.

Did the authors employ a different set of hyperparameters, or is there another explanation for the observed performance gap? Further clarification on this issue is required.\n\nMinor Issues:\nPage 1: The statement, “Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) replaces the deep neural network (DNN) with a quantum neural network (QNN; parameterized quantum circuit, PQC),” is not entirely accurate, as this describes only one type of QRL. Other approaches to QRL exist and should be acknowledged.\nPage 1: The phrase “limited qubit budgets” is awkward. The authors could revise it to “limited number of qubits” for better readability and clarity.\nPage 1: The citation, “As shown by Kölle et al. (2024); Jin et al. (2025),” should be revised to “As shown by Kölle et al. (2024) and Jin et al. (2025)” for consistency and correctness.\nPage 2: Similarly, “Chen et al. (2020); Jerbi et al. (2021); Cho et al.
