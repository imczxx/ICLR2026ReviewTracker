Recent approaches commonly employ parallel fusion strategies; however, these methods often risk losing crucial shared information across modalities, which can degrade segmentation performance. In this paper, we advocate leveraging sequential information bottleneck fusion to effectively preserve shared information across modalities. From an information-theoretic perspective, sequential fusion not only produces more robust fused representations in missing-data scenarios but also achieves a tighter generalization upper bound compared to parallel fusion approaches. Building on this principle, we propose the Sequential Multi-modal Segmentation Network (SMSN), which integrates an Information-Bottleneck Fusion Module (IBFM). The IBFM sequentially extracts modality-common features while reconstructing modality-specific features through a dedicated feature extraction module. Extensive experiments on the BRATS18 and BRATS20 glioma datasets demonstrate that SMSN consistently outperforms traditional parallel fusion-based baselines, achieving exceptional robustness in diverse missing-modality settings. Furthermore, SMSN exhibits superior cross-domain generalization, as evidenced by its ability to transfer a trained model from BRATS20 to a brain metastasis dataset without fine-tuning. To ensure reproducibility, the code of the SMSN is provided in the supplementary file.", "tldr": "Using information bottleneck fusion to improve the generalization and robustness in brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities.", "keywords": ["Brain Tumor Segmentation", "Missing Modality", "Generalization", "Robustness"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/88dbffc13fee798833beffeaa6da0a9c6a629d8d.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/eb71cded1c3e16b36ae7f4ab20f1bad01b4da924.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "To address the problem of missing modality segmentation in multimodal brain tumor MRI, this paper proposes the Sequential Multi-modal Segmentation Network (SMSN).

In Proposition 2, the authors prove that the sequential information bottleneck model can ensure a tighter upper bound on generalization errors under the condition that the encoder, fusion module, and decoder are all 1-Lipschitz continuous. However, this condition faces challenges in the actual implementation of deep networks. Specifically, when using Transformers, self-attention with softmax often results in a Lipschitz constant greater than 1 during gradient propagation, and other modules also tend to amplify gradients. As a result, the network does not naturally satisfy Lipschitz continuity. How should this issue be addressed?\n2. The derivation of sequential information bottleneck relies on the assumption of conditional independence between modalities.
