However, most existing EEG tokenization methods are already frequency or time-frequency-oriented: e.g., LaBraM reconstructs the frequency domain (with a TimeConv module on raw signals), and NeuroLM includes both time and frequency domain reconstruction. The proposed change mainly shifts from FFT to STFT, which feels incremental and weakens the claim of being “the first to encode diverse time-frequency motifs” in L142-143.\n\n2/ The single-channel design fully discarding inter-channel topology, which seems questionable. Many EEG tasks, especially localization or differential montages in epilepsy or sleep staging, depend critically on spatial relationships and cross-channel synchrony. The relatively lower performance on CHB-MIT, compared to BIOT, may partly reflect this limitation. Moreover, such a setup implicitly assumes that the downstream backbone needs reintroduce spatial structure (as EEGPT or LaBraM do with hard-coded topographic embeddings), so the claim of being model-agnostic is also overstated.\n\n3/ The baselines are outdated and inconsistent. Recent models such as CBraMod (ICLR’25)[1], EEG2Rep(KDD’24)[2] are not compared, and NeuroLM is included for only two of four datasets. This selective evaluation raises fairness concerns and weakens empirical credibility.\n\n4/ This paper shows partial data leakage in its experimental setup, which weakens the claim of dataset generalization. Both the single- and multi-dataset experiments pretrain and evaluate on the same set of datasets. This design still leads to partial data leakage, as the tokenizer indirectly sees the target data distribution.\n\n5/The writing could be more structured. The term motifs, central to the paper and appearing in the title, is not defined until the Related Work section.

The \"time-frequency motif learning\" is essentially a combination of spectral patching, transformers, and VQ quantization, but it doesn't introduce fundamentally new mechanisms—e.g., the localized spectral window encoder is similar to patch-based processing in vision transformers, and the masking strategy mirrors BERT-like objectives without EEG-specific innovations. Claims of up to 17% improvement in Cohen’s Kappa are overstated, as they are relative to baselines on specific datasets (e.g., TUEV), but absolute gains are modest (e.g., 0.5273 to 0.6189), and statistical significance is only reported sporadically (e.g., p=1.5e-4 on IIIC-Seizure). Experiments are limited: no comparisons to more recent EEG models (e.g., BRANT or MMM beyond superficial mentions), insufficient ablation on key hyperparameters (e.g., codebook size K, masking ratios), and the multi-dataset setting uses only four datasets, which may not capture broader diversity in EEG corpora. Scalability to ear-EEG is promising but under-evaluated—only a 14% gain is claimed without details on transfer learning adaptations or failure cases. Interpretability analysis (e.g., token consistency) is superficial and lacks quantitative metrics like mutual information or visualization of failure modes."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
