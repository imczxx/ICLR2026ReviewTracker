Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models. Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["model similarity", "model fingerprint"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/471d8593e25b00e90a3dc4d2df6f6b49e0facbea.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Random Selection Probing, a procedure to detect whether two models are related (e.g. fine-tuned from each other). The setup is as follows: They have two models: a reference model and a target model. They define a trivial \"random selection task\" (pick a ranadom letter a-z) that should not depend on the training data. Then they perform \"prefix optimization\". This is where they optimize short input prefixes on the reference model to bias its outputs towards specific target tokens on that task. This optimization finds prefixes that exploit some patterns in this task. They apply the optimized prefixes to a target model and measure how well the same biases transfer.

Misunderstandings from my side can arise from this; this is reflected in my low confidence rating -> I'm not sure I fully understood the paper.\n- I don't understand something about the concept of this. You search for a prefix that biases the model to favor one designated letter by maxinimizing the normalized probability. I understand why you substract the unrelated control model. But why should successful transfer of these prefixes uniquely indicate fine-tuning lineage, rather than other shared factors (e.g. architecture or pre-training data or anything else)? \n- There's no sensitivity analysis showing how the method is sensitive to prompt variability\n\nMore confusion than weaknesses from my side - I added some key questions in the next section."}, "questions": {"value": "- Why are you calling p-values \"rigorous\" everywhere? What's so rigorous about them? I'm genuinely confused. Can they be non-rigorous? \n- P-values also depend on the size of the dataset and you can get arbitrarily small p-values that would capture a small effect size under frequentist inference. That's why people typically report effect sizes. How does this work under your framework?\n- Why report only p-values and not effect sizes? Given that the p-values are so small, what's the benefit of reporting that vs the effect sizes to begin with?\n- Are you detecting \"model correlation\" or whether the model has the same lineage? You can have models that are correlated that do not directly descend from each other or have any specific fine-tuning related to each other. The framing of the paper seems you are working on the former, but the explanation seems you're working on the latter. \n- Is the assumption of the paper that a model always either has some lineage (H1) or it does not (H0)? So, it does not matter the extent of this lineage? \n- I'm not sure about the p-values. The p-values you report are super tiny (1.00e-300). As far as I understand, you are assuming that X follows a binomial distribution (page 5) which then means you are assuming independent outputs. Questions: (a) Are the outputs not very correlated because of the joint optimization of prefixes? What does it mean to treat them as independent here? (b) Don't you need to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing here?\n- Can you comment generally on the internal validity of this approach: are you measuring what you think you're measuring? I'm quite confused here.\n- Also, is the prinary innovation here the procedure with the tokens or the application of a hypothesis testing procedure? If it's the former, why did you choose this procedure and what makes it unique/good to begin with? It seems one could design many procedures.\n- Why are all the numbers in Table 4 on Grad exactly the same, or Table 6?\n- Does it really make sense to use a 0.05 threshold (e.g. page 8) when your p-values are so ridiculously small in so many cases?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "jVgazT3oaZ", "forum": "x2ovxUlsVd", "replyto": "x2ovxUlsVd", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20733/Reviewer_zkVT"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20733/Reviewer_zkVT"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20733/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760864147225, "cdate": 1760864147225, "tmdate": 1762934149709, "mdate": 1762934149709, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work aims to devise methods to determine if two large models are actually the same one.\n\nTo do this, the authors frame it as a statistical hypothesis test framework and compare the potentially 'matching' model against a reference, non matching one.

The ordering of experiments is a bit weird -- why not show that you can both find related / unrelated ones in section 4 and then the variants of that setup. Otherwise, you read all of 4 and you're left with the question of -- well do does the test think that everything is related -- and you need to get to Table 7/8 to see that this was tested, though it's given in the context of an ablation.\n\n3. Why are there no comparisons to other methods? While other methods may not have the significance test -- surely you can devise a simple way to use them in such a way. This would be interesting to understand if your significance test is the real value add or if both the prompt optimization + significance test is the value add. For example, ModelDiff suggests using a set of held out models for the threshold (that are known not to be related) -- you could use that, as you have your 'unrelated' model anyway. You could then compare in terms of 'accuracy' using all the model pairs that you have.\n\n4.

This is likely factually incorrect for many base models, which often exhibit inherent biases toward specific common letters (like 'A' or 'E') even without prefixes. If the underlying distribution is not uniform, the binomial test in Eq. 5 is fundamentally flawed and may produce false positives on uncorrelated but similarly biased base models.\n\n- The practical utility of this method for VLMs is questionable due to extreme computational overhead. Table 19 reveals that preparing a single visual prefix in the logits setting takes ~1 hour on an H1005.
