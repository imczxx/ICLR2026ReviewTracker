Existing transformer-based methods suffer from long-sequence bottlenecks and limited quantization resolution, primarily due to the large number of tokens required and constrained quantization granularity. These issues prevent faithful reproduction of fine geometric details and structured density patterns.\nWe introduce MeshMosaic, a novel local-to-global framework for artist mesh generation that scales to over 100K triangles—substantially surpassing prior methods, which typically handle only around 8K faces. MeshMosaic first segments shapes into patches, generating each patch autoregressively and leveraging shared boundary conditions to promote coherence, symmetry, and seamless connectivity between neighboring regions.\nThis strategy enhances scalability to high-resolution meshes by quantizing patches individually, resulting in more symmetrical and organized mesh density and structure.\nExtensive experiments across multiple public datasets demonstrate that MeshMosaic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometric fidelity and user preference, supporting superior detail representation and practical mesh generation for real-world applications.", "tldr": "We propose MeshMosaic, a novel local-to-global framework for artist mesh generation that scales to over 100K triangles.", "keywords": ["Artist Mesh Generation", "Autoregressive"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0d23b6022b14e1b556c68ead5dfa64c819230c49.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c9931e43634eb6f95d509b27972e4d0df2537293.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MeshMosaic, a framework to generate high-resolution triangle meshes by overcoming the sequence length limitations of prior autoregressive models.

This patch-wise approach, combined with local high-resolution quantization, enables the generation of meshes with over 100,000 triangles.

The method successfully scales autoregressive generation to much higher face counts (>100k) than previous approaches. The local quantization strategy is effective at preserving fine-grained geometric details, which is a significant practical advance.\n2. The local-to-global assembly strategy, particularly the boundary conditioning mechanism (GRU-encoded boundary tokens), is a novel and well-engineered method for enforcing local continuity during patch generation.\n3.

MeshMosaic is built upon fine-tuning the DeepMesh model, which has known limitations in generating structurally coherent meshes for complex topologies. The proposed patch-based framework feels like an overly complicated solution designed to compensate for the weaknesses of a poor base model. The impressive polygon count masks the fact that the method's quality does not truly scale. Its performance degrades significantly on dense, complex inputs, which are the true test of scalability in today's generative landscape.\n2. The paper's evaluation is misaligned with the current, most critical challenges in 3D generation. The primary industrial need is not generating meshes from clean data, but rather the high-quality re-topology of **dense, often noisy meshes produced by state-of-the-art text/image-to-3D models**. The paper completely ignores the actual SOTA in this domain (e.g., Tripo, Hunyuan3D), making its contribution appear isolated and its performance claims less impactful.\n3. The local-to-global approach, even with a global frozen point cloud feature, inherently struggles with non-local properties. The authors' own example (Fig. 11) shows it fails to enforce symmetry across distant parts, a critical flaw for \"artist-quality\" assets where high-level structural consistency is paramount.\n4. Despite efficient per-token time, the absolute wall-clock time for generating a high-resolution mesh is impractical. The reported time of \"several hours to complete\" for a >100K face mesh is a fatal flaw for any real-world interactive or iterative design workflow."}, "questions": {"value": "1. A critical test for any modern mesh generation method is its ability to handle dense, AI-generated geometry. Could the authors provide a direct comparison of MeshMosaic against recent, highly relevant methods like **Tripo and Hunyuan3D's PolyGen**? The comparison should be on the task of re-topologizing dense meshes (e.g., 20K+ faces) produced by these systems, evaluating both geometric fidelity and topological quality.\n2. Given the model is fine-tuned on DeepMesh, a model with known limitations, how do the authors ensure the new framework has truly fixed these weaknesses? Please provide a dedicated ablation demonstrating MeshMosaic's performance on the challenging, dense outputs mentioned in the previous question, where the original DeepMesh would likely fail completely.\n3.  The global context comes from a frozen Michelangelo encoder. Why was this encoder not fine-tuned, and what evidence supports that this weak conditioning is sufficient for global coherence, especially when ablations (Fig. 13) show catastrophic failure without it?\n4. The final \"gluing\" step suggests boundary conditioning alone is insufficient for perfect alignment. Could you quantify the magnitude of these post-hoc patch translations and discuss if they can lead to error accumulation across a mesh with dozens of patches?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Th7ohLbvxM", "forum": "fg75K9ZK8k", "replyto": "fg75K9ZK8k", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1551/Reviewer_7GEc"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1551/Reviewer_7GEc"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1551/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760761260108, "cdate": 1760761260108, "tmdate": 1762915808215, "mdate": 1762915808215, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}, "comment": {"value": "We thank all the reviewers for their helpful suggestions and questions.
