The prevalence of Artificial intelligence content (AIGC) has the potential to widen its impact and create more challenges for the people on the continent. AIGC poses a dual challenge. First, creatives who have worked so hard to create a masterpiece see their work being illegally duplicated or used without their consent. The other unsuspecting individuals have fallen prey to misinformation caused by AIGC. The reason, amongst many, could be the regulatory gaps in the law governing data protection, copyright and even artificial intelligence. This paper argues that curating technical watermarking methodologies/techniques is insufficient, considering the uniqueness of the African continent. It further addresses the regulatory gaps by examining the existing laws and proposing an Afrocentric perspective on AIGC using Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa as case studies.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Algorithm watermark", "AI fairness", "Afroncentric"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dd80b3dfa23d8181ee51703bcad7fc6c84da331b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper explores an important and timely topic: examining AIGC algorithm watermarks from an Afrocentric perspective. The core argument of the paper is that purely technical watermarking solutions are insufficient in the unique context of the African continent, and regulatory loopholes and legal frameworks must be taken into account. The paper supports this argument through case studies of Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa, and offers policy recommendations.\n\nThe main strength of the paper lies in its novel perspective and the significance of the issue. Shifting the focus of the watermark discussion from a purely technical level to geopolitical, legal, and ethical dimensions, particularly focusing on the specific challenges of the Global South and Africa, is a very valuable contribution. The paper is well-structured, and both the introduction and conclusion sections effectively explain the research motivation and contributions.\n\nHowever, the paper has some fundamental flaws that make it currently not meet the acceptance standards of ICLR. The most significant drawback is the lack of close connection with the machine learning community and substantial technical contributions. The paper reads more like a legal policy analysis article than a machine learning research conference paper. Additionally, the paper is lacking in rigor, including a weak literature review, insufficient depth in case studies, and a disorganized reference list."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. Novelty & Significance: \nThe paper's topic is novel. It is the first (to the author's knowledge) systematic study from an African perspective on AIGC watermarks. It successfully elevates the discussion beyond technology to touch upon key issues such as data ownership, intellectual property, and regulation, which are crucial for establishing a truly global and ethical AI ecosystem.\n2. Clarity & Readability\nThe paper is generally well-written and the language is smooth."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Deviates from the conference's mainstream interests\nDespite its novel perspective, the paper's direct contribution to the field of machine learning is limited. ICLR readers expect to see algorithms, theoretical analysis, experimental validation, or in-depth technical discussions. This paper mainly conducts legal text analysis and policy recommendations, which deviates from the conference's mainstream interests.\n2. Technical Quality & Correctness\nThe paper is not a technical one, so it is difficult to evaluate it from the perspectives of algorithm correctness or experimental design.\nHowever, the rigor of its argumentation process is questionable. The four evaluation metrics proposed in Part 4 are reasonable, but the subsequent country-by-country analysis appears superficial, merely reiterating existing legal provisions without in-depth critical analysis or novel insights that directly link these laws to the challenges of watermarking technology. For instance, the paper points out the conflict between the \"natural person\" requirement in the law and AIGC, but this is a general issue and does not delve into its specific manifestations or solutions in the African context.\n3. Clarity & Readability\nThe paper is generally well-written and the language is smooth.\nHowever, there are serious problems with the reference format. The in-text citations (e.g., acc(2023), Sco(2024)) do not correspond to the reference list at the end of the paper, and the list format is extremely inconsistent (containing a large number of garbled characters and broken URLs), which seriously affects the academic rigor and readability of the paper.\n4. Related Work\nThe literature review in the paper is very weak. It cites a few non-academic sources (such as blog posts, museum websites) on the history and technical overview of watermarks, but there is a severe lack of citations to important academic literature in the ICLR-related field (e.g., adversarial attacks, robustness studies, verifiable claims on AIGC watermarks, etc.). This makes the paper disconnected from the existing discourse in the machine learning community."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Clarify the paper's positioning and target readers: The paper should clearly state that it is a legal policy paper. During the revision, the depth of policy analysis should be significantly enhanced instead of attempting to cater to technical conferences.\n2. Deepen the analysis rather than merely describe: The case studies of the four countries need to go beyond the description of legal provisions. It is necessary to delve into:\n- How are these legal loopholes exploited by specific AIGC application cases?\n- How do the legal differences among different countries affect the deployment of cross-border AIGC services?\n- How does the specific implementation of watermarking technology (such as the \"double-sided watermark\" mentioned in the text) interact with local laws? What specific obstacles will be encountered?\n3. Standardize the reference format: References must be organized strictly in accordance with academic norms, ensuring that the citations in the text correspond one-to-one with the list at the end of the paper, and that the format is uniform and the information complete.\n4. Strengthen the feasibility of arguments and suggestions: The policy recommendations (Part 7) are a good starting point, but they can be more specific."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "CfBCofCnBH", "forum": "GzvdIo1QiP", "replyto": "GzvdIo1QiP", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24593/Reviewer_UsNU"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24593/Reviewer_UsNU"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24593/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761053101226, "cdate": 1761053101226, "tmdate": 1762943131460, "mdate": 1762943131460, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper provides the first Afrocentric-focused work on algorithm watermarking of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) , examining the regulatory gaps in data protection, intellectual property, and human rights in African countries like Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa.
