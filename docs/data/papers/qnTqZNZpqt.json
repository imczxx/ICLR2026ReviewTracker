Our approach is completely model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe deployment in high-stakes applications.

The authors analyze attention patterns to categorize heads as perception-oriented or reasoning-oriented, based on their focus on visual or textual modalities. Building on the observation that early heads tend to focus on images while later ones attend more to text, they propose a steering strategy that rebalances head attention through a plug-and-play rescaling method, without retraining the model."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- **Comprehensive empirical study**: The paper conducts an extensive evaluation covering over 150 boundary configurations and 24 scaling strategies, across 6 benchmarks, 4 model baselines, and multiple multimodal reasoning tasks, offering a robust and reproducible analysis.\n\n- **Practical and efficient method**: The proposed rescaling mechanism is lightweight, easily applicable, and does not require retraining, making it a low-cost yet effective plug-and-play improvement.\n\n- **Grounded in prior findings**: The analysis builds upon established observations that visual heads are typically concentrated in earlier layers, while reasoning heads emerge in later ones, and explores how this structure can be exploited for targeted steering."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **Questionable modality-based interpretation in deeper layers**: While early layers remain largely modality-specific, intermediate and late layers increasingly encode multimodal, contextually grounded representations. Therefore, the paper’s use of a modality attention ratio as a proxy for quantifying visual versus textual information becomes problematic beyond early layers.\n\n- **Oversimplified perception–reasoning dichotomy**: Following the previous point, the assumption of a strict split between perception (visual) and reasoning (textual) is conceptually fragile. Reasoning processes in later layers are often driven by early visual activations, making it inaccurate to directly associate perception with image tokens and reasoning with text tokens. The proposed binary segmentation of layers overlooks these interdependencies. Observations 5 and 6 in the paper also seem inconsistent with a universal two-block division, suggesting that the initial assumption may need refinement. A more rigorous investigation, such as testing perception boundaries within reasoning layers and vice versa, could reveal whether this dichotomy truly holds.\n\n- **Imbalanced token contributions**: Since image tokens typically outnumber text tokens, summing attention values across modalities without re-weighting introduces a bias. The decision to use raw sums rather than normalized values by token count should be better justified.\n\n- **Choice of scaling layers insufficiently analyzed**: The authors mention that re-scaling at one layer propagates through subsequent layers (lines 282–283). If so, the choice of which layer(s) to scale becomes crucial, yet this factor is not systematically explored.\n\n- **Neglect of dataset-related confounds (e.g., data leakage)**: A major limitation of MLRMs is data leakage, which can bias models toward reasoning shortcuts rather than perception. Investigating how reasoning heads behave under such conditions could strengthen the perception–reasoning framework and validate whether their steering approach mitigates these known failure modes."}, "questions": {"value": "1. How are unlabeled or ambiguous heads interpreted in your framework? Beyond perception and reasoning, could there be other functional categories?\n\n2.

While the framing and theoretical perspective are valuable, the core idea—adjusting attention gating based on functional signals—is conceptually close to emerging inference-time hallucination mitigation and attention routing techniques.

The method’s performance under long-context CoT, dense visual reasoning, and highly noisy images is not thoroughly evaluated. Real-world complexity may affect stability of head-based selection.\n\n3.    It is unclear whether identified “good heads” generalize across architectures and tasks or require task-specific calibration.
