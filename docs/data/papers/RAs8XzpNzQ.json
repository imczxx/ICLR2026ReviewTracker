However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward.\n When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error, consistent with recent empirical observations. Furthermore, for fixed $k$ there exists an optimal sampling temperature. In the “best-of-$k$” limit with the teacher as reward, we prove that the generalization error decays as $\\Theta(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.", "tldr": "We propose a solvable model of inference-time scaling.", "keywords": ["test time compute", "inference time compute", "scaling law", "higher dimensional statistics"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2b6b68eb59886cd7ada0cfd0861b9dda0f8821c6.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ebb61f9d95ceae2f231ad0d6015d874d11381ee8.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a Bayesian linear regression model to study the performance of best-of-k sampling in inference-time scaling.
