However, the increasing prevalence of backdoor attacks presents significant challenges to federated systems. These attacks rely on the injection of carefully crafted triggers that lead to erroneous predictions. Recent research has shown that the diversity of trigger structures and injection locations in FGL diminishes the effectiveness of traditional federated defense methods. Notably, existing defense strategies for FGL have yet to fully exploit the unique topological structures of graphs, highlighting opportunities for improvement in countering these attacks.\n\nTo this end, we propose a tailored topology- and distribution-aware backdoor defense against federated graph learning method (FedTD). At the client level, we introduce an energy function to integrate the underlying data distribution into the local model, assigning low energy to benign clients and high energy to malicious clients. By combining topological features with the energy function, we establish a more comprehensive energy estimation. At the server level, we construct a virtual graph based on estimation of each client to evaluate the maliciousness score of each client. The homophily level of each local graph is considered to ensure the reliability of the virtual graph. During aggregation, we assign lower weights to clients with high malicious scores and higher weights to clients with low malicious scores, thus achieving a more robust FGL. FedTD remains robust under both small and large malicious client ratios. Extensive results across various federated graph scenarios under backdoor attacks validate the effectiveness of FedTD.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph Learning", "Federated Learning"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ae3eddab99ca0d9f1b500cd44acab8d92acd1662.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents FedTD , a new robust defense mechanism to counter backdoor attacks in Federated Graph Learning (FGL). Unlike other defenses which the authors describe as 'topology blind’, and as ignoring under and over graph homophily levels across clients, FedTD manages this at the client (TDCE) level by having each client create a fully summarized estimation vector that makes a weighted combination of its data distribution (modeled with an energy-based GCN) and topological features (node degree and centrality). Server side (TDGC) also provides a ‘virtual client graph’ by clustering estimation vectors based on cosine similarity. \nThe authors’ main contribution on this is the adjustment of similarity score with client homophily levels, which gives a reliable anomalous behavior score. In the virtual graph, malicious clients are identified as low degree outliers, and are given lower weights during model aggregation, nullifying the attack. FedTD under these conditions on five datasets, with small stealthy triggers and varying malicious clients ratios has shown to significantly outperform 14 baselines.

The generality of FedTD to other FGL tasks (e.g., link prediction, graph classification) remains untested. The attack baselines also primarily rely on traditional trigger designs, without evaluating against adaptive or dynamic backdoor strategies, which could better test the method’s robustness.\n\nThe paper’s related work discussion, though broad, lacks deeper contrast with recent graph-specific robust learning frameworks (e.g., defense via certified aggregation or representation smoothing).
