Existing methods for inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs assume a fixed relational vocabulary and, as a result, cannot generalize to knowledge hypergraphs with *novel relation types* (i.e., relations unseen during training). Inspired by knowledge graph foundation models, we propose HYPER as a foundation model for link prediction, which can generalize to *any knowledge hypergraph*, including novel entities and novel relations. Importantly, HYPER can learn and transfer across different relation types of *varying arities*, by encoding the entities of each hyperedge along with their respective positions in the hyperedge. To evaluate HYPER, we construct 16 new inductive datasets from existing knowledge hypergraphs, covering a diverse range of relation types of varying arities. Empirically, HYPER consistently outperforms all existing methods in both node-only and node-and-relation inductive settings, showing strong generalization to unseen, higher-arity relational structures.", "tldr": "We develop the first foundation model over inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs.", "keywords": ["Knowledge Hypergraph", "Link Prediction", "Graph Neural Networks", "Foundation Models"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f2a4b7feb506eebb271f469696ebbefdd93d00ae.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Proposes a method for inductive link prediction on knowledge hypergraphs (HKG).

The proposed method is ultimately a rather straightforward modification of ULTRA. I do not count this against the paper too much though, because it is the natural approach and exploring and evaluating this approach provides value.\n\nW2. Comparison to ULTRA not convincing. After reading the abstract of this paper, I immediately thought why not use ULTRA + reification. The authors then actually did this but in a way that is not convincing. To me, a key contribution of this paper is a fair and solid evaluation of the proposed method and alternatives, but I am not convinced that this has been done. This is for the following reasons:\n\n1. The reification approach appears problematic. All relations become nodes, and only max-arity relations of form hasEntity-k(hyperedge, entity) + one hasRelationType relation are used. This severely limits the relation modelling capabilities of ULTRA. Instead, the natural reification is to relation-k(hyperedge, entity) and drop the hasRelationType relation. I feel that this approach needs to be explored, as it is what first comes to mind and as it appears much more promising.\n\n2. ULTRA has not been retrained on the reified data (whereas the proposed method is). Since ULTRA has never seen reified relations, I'd not expect it to work well. A fair comparison would do the reification above and then train ULTRA on the same graphs (both KGs and HGs) as the proposed method. Only then I'd consider the study insightful and convincing.\n\nW3. Comparison to HCNet not convincing. The authors seem to use random relation embeddings, as HCNet does not support new relations. I fail to see the value of this experiment; it clearly cannot lead to useful results. The experiment should either be dropped (ok with me) or perhaps (i) transductive results added and (ii) for the inductive setting, fold-in the new relations into HCNet."}, "questions": {"value": "See W2."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ZAlFEw4xaP", "forum": "YLTQbMoAaX", "replyto": "YLTQbMoAaX", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13425/Reviewer_JyfY"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13425/Reviewer_JyfY"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13425/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761840106637, "cdate": 1761840106637, "tmdate": 1762924049239, "mdate": 1762924049239, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a foundation model named HYPER for inductive link prediction.
