The prevailing works attempt to construct efficient motion representations, but lack a unified spatiotemporal decomposition framework, suffering from either holistic temporal optimization or coupled hierarchical spatial composition. To this end, we propose WorldTree, a unified framework comprising Temporal Partition Tree (TPT) that enables coarse-to-fine optimization based on the inheritance-based partition tree structure for hierarchical temporal decomposition, and Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC) that recursively query ancestral hierarchical structure to provide complementary spatial dynamics while specializing motion representations across ancestral nodes. Experimental results on different datasets indicate that our proposed method achieves $8.26\\\\%$ improvement of LPIPS on NVIDIA-LS and $9.09\\\\%$ improvement of mLPIPS on DyCheck compared to the second-best method.

It consists of two key components. First, a Temporal Partition Tree (TPT), which recursively splits the video’s timeline into a tree of sub-intervals (coarse-to-fine) for sequential optimization at multiple time scales, and second, a Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC), which links each node of the time-tree with a chain of inherited scene representations from its ancestors. In essence, each time segment (node) has its own local dynamic model, while also leveraging ancestral information (broader motion context and coarse geometry from higher levels) as a complementary spatial dynamic prior. This inheritance-based design allows model specialization at different temporal scales without losing global context. The overall optimization iteratively refines the scene: starting from a root (entire video) model, then subdividing in time and re-optimizing each segment with inherited parameters in a tree structure. Notably, the tree nodes are optimized in parallel at each level, leveraging the fact that disjoint time segments can be processed independently. The SAC mechanism ensures that finer segments still incorporate multi-level spatial information by querying the chain of ancestor nodes for each segment. Qualitative results show improved and temporally coherent reconstructions of moving subjects than baselines."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper presents a hierarchical decomposition of a dynamic reconstruction problem in both time and space. Prior monocular methods generally either optimized a single global motion field over the entire video or imposed a fixed spatial hierarchy. In contrast, the paper proposes an inheritance-based time segmentation that recognizes that different temporal intervals can exhibit distinct motion patterns. Next, Spatial Ancestral Chains ensure that each temporal segment's model includes multi-scale spatial context rather than starting from scratch. This hierarchical motion specialization may help decouple global and local motions.\n\n2.Using BFS expansion, all segments at a given depth can be optimized in parallel. Next, the use of 3D Gaussian splatting as the underlying scene representation looks like a wise choice, i.e., it provides explicit control over primitives and fast rendering.\n\n3. The use of the SAC mechanism, i.e., aggregating the Gaussians of ancestor nodes when rendering a child's frame, effectively layers coarse and fine geometry, preventing the child from needing to re-learn large static structures or global motion from scratch."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.A notable limitation is the dependence on external 2D vision models for initialization. Specifically, monocular depth estimation, optical flow, and feature tracking are used to lift 2D priors into 3D scene representations.\nThe paper does not show how errors in these inputs can affect the final result. Presumably, inaccuracies in initial depth or camera pose estimation could propagate through the hierarchical optimization.\nSuggestion to improve: It would strengthen the work to either (a) demonstrate some robustness analysis (e.g., running the method with intentionally perturbed or lower-quality priors to see if it can recover) or (b) discuss approaches to reduce reliance on these models.\n\n2. The TPT currently uses a very simple scheme for splitting the video (fixed). Each interval is bisected at the midpoint in time (a binary partition), and this continues to a fixed tree depth. This coarse-grained, uniform partition may not be optimal for every video. Real dynamic scenes can have uneven motion. E.g., a subject may remain still for a while then move rapidly, or different time segments have different complexity. \n\nThe paper could be improved by addressing this design choice. Perhaps providing reasoning for why uniform binary splits were chosen may be simplicity? easier parallelism?, etc.\n\n3. WorldTree's pipeline seems to implicitly assume that the input video has a mixture of static and dynamic content, and that at least a portion of the scene can be treated as static for initialization. The authors perform a \"Static Warm-Up\" and Bundle Adjustment (BA) at the root stage, probably to establish camera poses and a base model of the scene before modeling non-rigid motion. This likely works well if, for example, the background is static and only an object or person is moving. The authors should clarify this assumption. Are there failure cases when the scene violates these assumptions?"}, "questions": {"value": "Q1. In Sec. 3.3, the paper states that the common ancestors of different nodes are independent of each other but have the same optimized initialization. Kindly clarify what this means in practice? For example, when a parent node (covering a certain interval) is split into two children, do you duplicate the parent's Gaussian primitives and motion parameters into each child's ancestral chain as an initialization, and then allow each branch to optimize those copies independently?\n\nQ2. The current implementation always splits intervals evenly at the midpoint in time. Did the author(s) experiment with other criteria for the partition point? For instance, could one split an interval at a frame where the motion or reconstruction error is highest (indicating a change in dynamics)? If not, how sensitive is the method to the exact placement of the split?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ylsaHXkgV4", "forum": "mVo6cyFR6C", "replyto": "mVo6cyFR6C", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5961/Reviewer_2Tyt"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5961/Reviewer_2Tyt"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5961/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761682579924, "cdate": 1761682579924, "tmdate": 1762918376861, "mdate": 1762918376861, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors present WorldTree, a framework for 4D dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular video.

Dependency on External Segmentation (SAM): The reliance on external segmentation tools like SAM (mentioned in the Appendix and implied by comparisons to HiMoR/SplineGS) is a significant point of concern.

A clearer analysis is needed to quantify the degradation when using noisy or no segmentation masks.\n\n2. Scalability and VRAM Limits: The paper notes a constraint on the maximum number of motion nodes (32) due to VRAM capacity on the NVIDIA-LS dataset. While this is a practical limitation of the current implementation (building on MoSca), it raises critical questions about the theoretical scalability of the Tree-Chains spatial representation itself.
