Unlike prior graph-based MOT methods that redesign tracking architectures, UniTrack provides a universal training objective that integrates detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling seamless integration with existing MOT systems without architectural modifications. Through differentiable graph representation learning, UniTrack enables networks to learn holistic representations of motion continuity and identity relationships across frames. We validate UniTrack across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements across all tested architectures and datasets including Trackformer, MOTR, FairMOT, ByteTrack, GTR,  and MOTE.

The details of the differentiability of the flow term are not clearly conveyed. The loss scales by factors that depend on false positives/false negatives, but the paper does not define a differentiable surrogate for those counts. As far as i understand that derivation treats the FP/FN counts inside the loss as if they were constants and never explains how those counts are made differentiable with respect to the model outputs. In practice, FP/FN are discrete functions of predictions (they jump when a score crosses a threshold.\n\n2. Inconsistent definitions: the paper has defined λs and λt ((Eq. 8), as they are deterministic functions of graph connectivity (via Laplacian eigenvalues). Then, in eq.10, the λs and λt are treated as learnable parameters that can be updated by backprop. \n\n3. The paper includes frame-rate analysis and normalizes by the frame interval, which is good.
