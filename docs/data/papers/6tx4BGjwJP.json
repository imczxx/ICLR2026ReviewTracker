Although CLIP excels at understanding, it lacks reconstruction abilities required to be a unified visual encoder. However, previous CLIP-based unified methods fail to balance understanding and reconstruction, leading to semantic degradation or inconsistent reconstructions. In contrast, we introduce a novel two-stage training scheme with a self-distillation strategy that progressively endows CLIP with high-fidelity reconstruction abilities while preserving its original comprehension performance. For enhanced reasoning and consistency in generation and editing, we further develop a dual-condition architecture built upon the MetaQuery framework. Our architecture jointly utilizes multimodal hidden states for rich contextual details and learnable query embeddings to harness the powerful reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging advanced image representation and architectural design, UniLIP demonstrates superior instruction following and edit fidelity. With only 1B and 3B parameters, UniLIP can outperform larger unified models such as BAGEL (7B) and Uniworld-V1 (12B), achieving state-of-the-art performance of **0.90** on GenEval, **0.63** on WISE, and **3.94** on ImgEdit. These results demonstrate that UniLIP successfully expands the application of CLIP, establishing its continuous features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Rigorous Ablation of the Two-Stage Training Strategy: The authors provide extensive ablation studies on the two-stage training approach and the self-distillation strategy. These experiments are crucial, demonstrating that directly fine-tuning CLIP for reconstruction causes catastrophic forgetting of comprehension capabilities. The ablation results (Table 6) confirm that the self-distillation loss is essential, preventing the understanding score (MMBench) from plummeting by 54.2 points. This work rigorously solves the key challenge of adapting CLIP for reconstruction without compromising its original semantic power.\n2.

However, the earliest proposal was made by DreamLLM (Dong et al., ICLR 2024 Spotlight).\n2. Lack of Explicit Architectural Comparison to Dual-Encoder Baselines: UniLIP successfully combines high-level semantics and low-level pixel details by adapting CLIP for reconstruction. This approach yields competitive results, surpassing Janus-Pro (7B) in certain understanding benchmarks (MMBench 80.7 vs 79.2). However, the manuscript does not explicitly compare the necessity of the unified CLIP adaptation (UniLIP) versus a conceptually simpler dual-encoder system (one encoder optimized for high-level tasks like LLaVA setting/understanding, and another specialized encoder for low-level detail/reconstruction).
