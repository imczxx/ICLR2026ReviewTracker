I would greatly appreciate an argument as to why empowerment in particular disempowers other agents. Are these effects caused by something about the empowerment objective or something about assistance in general? I may have missed it, but I didn't see an argument as to why we should expect empowerment to be more disempowering than other types of assistance that assist a single person. \n- Limited evaluation. The gridworld benchmark consists of 110 environments, but they don't vary by the walls, blocks, or initial agent positions, only by the key and goal locations. Empowerment type objectives can greatly depend on the shape of the environment. It would be helpful to see more environments that vary in shape (different walls, blocks, and agent positions), as well as more discussion on how these factors impact whether an agent disempowers another. I think these types of variations might be more important than varying key/goal positions.\n- It's cliche, but going beyond the gridworld would be very helpful. I think gridworld is sufficient to see that empowerment type assistance can disempower a bystander, but the more interesting question is whether this is a product of empowerment or assistance in general. I think a larger environment may go a long way towards seeing those differences between empowerment and other types of assistance.\n- No evaluation with other types of assistance. The paper's main claims are supported by the current evaluation, mostly because the paper doesn't claim that empowerment is particularly disempowering, but if the paper were to add that claim it would be very helpful to see other types of assistance compared.\n- In Figure 5, I'm not convinced that disempowerment is actually occuring in a significant fashion. It looks like the Bystander's reward is nearly unaffected, and their empowerment is also fairly flat. \n- Some minor notes:\n    - Lines 46-47, \"empower one person's empowerment\", should be \"empower one person\"\n    - Lines 106-107, I think the agent with the key would only have a higher effective empowerment if they actually used the key to expand the number of states they visit. For example, the agent could have a key but still just no-op and therefore have 0 effective empowerment.\n    - Lines 235-237, I don't think equation 4 is a lower bound on the true effective empowerment.

For example, in Figure 5 the bystander's empowerment does go down, but barely, and in fact appears to be pretty close to the user's final empowerment. The same is true for Figure 3, the user's final empowerment is pretty close to the bystander's. In Figure 7 you count the number of times the bystander is disempowered---what is your threshold?\n- I'm a little confused by how you are actually measuring the empowerment with rollouts. Are you independently estimating the entropies H[S_T | s]  and H[S_T | s, A_T]? How many rollouts do you do?\n- How are the feature vectors of the states constructed? \n- I probably missed this, but I'm a little confused as to how the reward is summed up in each trajectory. From my understanding the goal state gives a reward of 1. Do the user and bystander stand over the goal state to continue to collect that reward, which is how the Bystander starts off with a reward of ~30 for the no-op assistant in Figure 3?\n- The empowerment values seem pretty high to me. For example, in Figure 6 with No-Op the bystander has an empowerment of 40, which if we assume that H[S+ | s, a] = 0 (therefore maximizing I(S^+; a | s) to just be equal to H[S^+ | s]), in order for the entropy over the future states to be that large there would have to be at least 2^40 possible future states if we assumed that the distribution is uniform. Maybe I'm missing something here?\n- How are you estimating the empowerment for the joint-empowerment case? Is this with the same rollout-estimator described in Eq 4? Are S_T^U and S_T^B different here, shouldn't they be the same?\n- How often is the user disempowered in the joint-empowerment case? I see the results for the bystander disempowerment, but in this case they are symmetric, so user disempowerment may be worthwhile looking at (unless it is similar)\n- What types of environments does the joint empowerment fail in vs succeed in? Is there a pattern here?\n- Do you train the empowering assistant with the human with the same goal that they will be evaluated against? \n- In line 413-414, can't the assistant cut off the hallway?

The authors identify what they term a critical gap in prior work: empowerment-based and choice-based assistance have been studied almost exclusively in single-human contexts, leaving multi-human effects unexplored. To investigate this, they introduce a set of gridworld environments (“Disempower-Grid”) with two PPO-trained human agents—a user and a bystander—and one assistant. The assistant is trained under several goal-agnostic objectives, including empowerment I(A;S’), an assistance-via-empowerment (AvE) proxy, and two choice-based variants.  Across multiple experimental conditions and environment configurations, the authors compare these objectives and find consistent patterns where optimizing empowerment or related goals for one human alters the other’s control and reward dynamics. To test robustness across goal variations, the authors also procedurally generate 110 versions of a single environment by permuting goal and key positions, finding consistent disempowerment patterns.

Specifically, the authors are hypothesizing and making predictions about the emergence of disempowerment as a consequence of single agent empowerment ensued by an AI assistant. However, I feel that the setup considered in this paper falls much short of providing a convincing test for the hypothesis due to following reasons:\n    * I am not convinced by the user and bystander setup in how it is instantiated.  The simulated “humans” are implemented as frozen PPO-trained agents rather than any form of human-proxy or adaptive behavioral model. This makes the setup unrealistic for studying assistance, since humans would not act as stationary, fully rational policies. Without adaptation or preference uncertainty, the results say more about interactions between fixed RL policies than about multi-human assistance.\n    * The training pipeline is internally inconsistent. During empowerment estimation, the assistant assumes that humans act according to a uniform random policy, even though the humans in evaluation follow PPO-learned strategies. Because empowerment I(A;S’|s) depends on the distribution p(a|s), this mismatch violates the underlying definition and breaks the link between the optimization target and the true interaction dynamics.\n    * One of my major concerns also stems from the presentation of setup as general sum. While the over setup does seem to be non-competitive from user’s perspective, the situations are effectively competitive from assistant’s perspective. In many tasks, it is very difficult for the assistant to  help the user without  blocking or restricting the bystander’s motion (for example, in the Push/Pull and Freeze conditions). The observed “disempowerment” therefore arises trivially from the environment’s geometry rather than from a deeper property of empowerment objectives.\n\n- I am also concerned with the empowerment formulation which appears coarse in this context.\n    - Empowerment is computed with rollout sampling under a uniform policy, making it a measure of reachability entropy. This seems to weaken the theoretical grounding of the objective and undermines claims about empowerment itself.\n    * Local empowerment tends to reward occupying bottlenecks or high-control regions. In shared environments, this naturally suppresses others’ reachable states. The paper interprets this as an emergent safety failure, but it is a direct and predictable consequence of the local control bias in empowerment maximization.\n    * I may be misunderstanding this part but the paper seems to claim that empowerment-based objectives are “goal-agnostic” and therefore safer which would be misleading. Empowerment intrinsically encodes a value preference for influence and optionality. The assistant’s tendency to dominate shared control spaces is an expected outcome of optimizing for control and  not an unforeseen failure mode.\n    * As per my understanding, the comparison across empowerment, AvE, and choice-based objectives lacks normalization or calibration. Each is estimated using different scaling or entropy measures, so their quantitative differences are not directly comparable. As a result, the figures illustrate relative trends rather than meaningful metric comparisons.\n\n* The paper misses a very important discussion and comparison with multi-principal assistance games [1] and related multi-human alignment frameworks. These models explicitly address how an assistant should balance incentives among multiple principals and analyze trade-offs between efficiency and fairness. Situating the disempowerment findings relative to MPAG theory would clarify whether the observed behaviors violate established normative assumptions or merely reflect missing social-welfare constraints. \n* The paper also does not include  comparison with strong baseline explicitly designed to prevent harmful side effects, such as Stepwise Relative Reachability [2]. Including this would test whether the observed disempowerment persists under known mitigation frameworks and would contextualize the result within existing alignment research.\n\nFinally, I find some critical issues with the the empirical analysis presented in the paper\n* The empirical analysis lacks depth in both ablation and evaluation. There are no statistical tests, only qualitative mentions of significant effects, which makes the magnitude and consistency of the disempowerment effect uncertain. It might also be helpful to examine the robustness across horizons or rollout samples.\n* The joint-empowerment formulation  is overly simplistic. Summing empowerment across agents introduces a crude trade-off that predictably reduces assistance effectiveness without addressing the core issue of conflicting control incentives. More principled multi-agent formulations, such as relational or max-min empowerment, are not explored.\n* The motivating examples, such as the hospital assistant scenario, overextend the implications of the toy gridworld findings. Real assistive systems are trained under explicit multi-principal or social-welfare objectives; hence, the leap from small-scale spatial disempowerment to real-world alignment concerns is highly speculative.\n\n[1] Multi-Principal Assistance Games, Arnaud Fickinger, Simon Zhuang, Dylan Hadfield-Menell, Stuart Russell, 2020\n\n[2] Penalizing side effects using stepwise relative reachability, Victoria Krakovna, Laurent Orseau, Ramana Kumar, Miljan Martic, Shane Legg, 2019."}, "questions": {"value": "- What empirical evidence shows that disempowerment stems from the empowerment objective rather than from environment geometry or bottlenecks?\n- The training setup of both the user and assistant is highly artificial.

Or use their policies( assuming that’s part of the environment in the point of view of the user)\n\n- Regarding alternative orientations of the Assistant and Bystander with respect to the user? For example, what if the bystander is at (3,2) instead of (0,1) [ zero - based indexing] for the Push-Pull/ Push Only and the procedurally generated experiments? Would it still exhibit similar levels of zero-sum dynamics, if at all any zero sum dynamics? I think the current orientation is such that assistant’s actions, driven by the goal-agnostic objectives, would result in zero-sum dynamics mostly. So it is harder to understand how much of that is just from the goal-agnostic objective/ and not just how the environment is set up. \n\n- Further, all the objectives are doing something similar, in terms of increasing the information/reachability/variance/entropy of the future states available to the user for the user’s actions in the rollouts, and with discount factor added in, intuitively I think, assistant’s actions would have higher probability of freeing up the states, around the user ? Is this behavior fundamentally what’s causing the disempowerment for the bystander? If the bystander happens to be on the wrong side of the environment, we see zero-sum dynamics, and if it is around the user, it might be empowered too ? \n\n- For the spatial bottlenecks, what are the probabilities for other actions, i.e, for the assistant to move out of the path of the user? Also, can you provide more clarity on how the agent state is treated when computing the empowerment objectives? For the push/pull settings - since the agent is embodied, does the user consider it as a blocked state? \n\n- For Figures 3 and 4, the Push/Pull and the Push only, why is the No-op reward different in the plots for bystander? If there is no-op by the assistant, I think the reward should be the same in these two settings ? \n\n- Could you help me understand how the results/behavior would look like for a Move Only environment, if that has been considered  ? An environment where the agent cannot push or pull any of the boxes, so no reversible changes to the environment, but just navigate. In this case, would disempowerment look like the assistant blocking the spatial bottleneck for the bystander to empower the user ? \n\n- For the Move Any Environment, to understand the objectives and assistant;s intentions better - it helps to know the probability of the different blocks that the assistant picks up for moving the blocks to disempower the bystander? Does the assistant prefer to unblock the user by moving blocks closer to the user first ? Even this environment is setup such that, perturbing 3 out of 5 blocks would disempower the bystander, i.e, there is a higher chance for the bystander getting disempowered, so hard to justify that disempowerment is from the objectives alone.\n\n- For Move Any and Freeze, if we can discretize, what is the action space of the assistant per step? I think it is [Freeze Bystander, Move Block, Do Nothing] What is the horizon T for the rollouts when computing the objectives? What is the cause for the user reward increasing in the figures, if the assistant has learnt to freeze the bystander? (Since the block still wouldn’t allow the user to reach its goal)? \n\n-  The procedurally generated environments only modify the key and goal positions, while the majority of the disempowerment could be coming from how the blocks are positioned between the user and the bystander ? It would be worthwhile to see the results for other orientations for blocks or fully randomizing them."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "7SMW1wj00x", "forum": "w0F6196dTt", "replyto": "w0F6196dTt", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23747/Reviewer_mEzA"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23747/Reviewer_mEzA"], "number": 6, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23747/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762561370145, "cdate": 1762561370145, "tmdate": 1762942788851, "mdate": 1762942788851, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
