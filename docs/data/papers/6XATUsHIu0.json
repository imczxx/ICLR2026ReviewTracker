A key step in supporting this research was the development of game description languages: frameworks that compile domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research: a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines. We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible representation scheme. We present technical notes on the description language and compilation process, along with speed benchmarking.", "tldr": "We introduce Ludax, a domain-specific language for board games that compiles directly into hardware-accelerated JAX code", "keywords": ["hardware acceleration", "games", "description languages"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d90d797ae545a9c5fa07c11d94294140b2a9fc75.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ae82d7e80701801c6529f81824b600721950df62.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose Ludax, a framework that automatically generates vectorizable JAX environments for board games.\nIt introduces a dedicated game description language (DSL) and a pipeline that converts this DSL into executable JAX code.\nThe authors also highlight several design techniques for maintaining JAX jittability—ensuring static shapes and pure functional style.\nIn experiments with selected board games, Ludax-generated environments achieved comparable speed to hand-crafted JAX baselines and significantly outperformed the non-vectorized Java-based framework Ludii, from which Ludax draws inspiration."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "While neither DSL-based game generation nor vectorized environments are entirely new concepts, their combination is valuable and timely.\nConceptually, it matters because recent advances in reinforcement learning algorithmsrely heavily on vectorizable simulators such as PQN, and technically, because implementing diverse games in JAX is non-trivial due to strict requirements for jittability (static array shapes, pure functional programming).\n\nLudax effectively addresses these challenges by offering a DSL and a code generation pipeline tailored for JAX.\nThe paper clearly explains how to define atomic functions, map them to DSL primitives, and generate executable JAX code.\nThe experiments convincingly show that the generated code is both fast and compatible with RL training pipelines, as evidenced by the consistent learning performance compared to manually written environments."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "As the authors themselves note, limited generalizability is the main bottleneck.\nTo define a new game, one must manually implement new atomic functions that are both compositional and general enough to be reused for other games.\nHowever, many game rules are highly domain-specific and cannot be easily decomposed into such atomic components.\n\nThus, Ludax excels at interpolating within the family of games expressible by existing atomic functions (e.g., two-player, rectangular board, placing or sliding pieces, line-based victory conditions such as Hex, Gomoku, Connect Four, or Yavalath).\nBut it struggles to extrapolate to more complex games requiring novel logic.\nAlthough the authors mention that adding new atomic functions can extend Ludax, designing such composable primitives remains a core research challenge rather than an engineering task.\nHence, this limitation should not be overlooked as a minor or easily solvable issue."}, "questions": {"value": "- Do the authors have any insight into how to incorporate complex, non-compositional game logic into Ludax’s atomic framework?

Ludax game descriptions are compiled using the Lark Python library, and operators are processed from the bottom up into atomic JAX functions. Some of these JAX functions are converted into maps from the current game state into a Boolean truth value and passed up the parse tree. A major improvement of Ludax is the transformation of iterative procedures related to game states into matrix-value functions amenable to fast precomputation using GPUs, similar to PGX.
