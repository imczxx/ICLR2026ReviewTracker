Existing approaches, such as flow matching and Schrödinger Bridge Matching, effectively learn mappings between two distributions by modeling a single stochastic path. However, these methods are inherently limited to unimodal transitions and cannot capture *branched* or *divergent* evolution from a common origin to multiple distinct outcomes. To address this, we introduce **Branched Schrödinger Bridge Matching (BranchSBM)**, a novel framework that learns branched Schrödinger bridges. BranchSBM parameterizes multiple time-dependent velocity fields and growth processes, enabling the representation of population-level divergence into multiple terminal distributions. We show that BranchSBM is not only more expressive but also essential for tasks involving multi-path surface navigation, modeling cell fate bifurcations from homogeneous progenitor states, and simulating diverging cellular responses to perturbations.", "tldr": "BranchSBM extends Schrödinger Bridge Matching to branched and unbalanced trajectories, enabling neural modeling of multimodal dynamical systems such as cell fate bifurcations and perturbation responses.", "keywords": ["Schrödinger bridges", "branched generative modeling", "stochastic optimal control", "unbalanced optimal transport", "flow matching", "trajectory inference", "stochastic processes", "probabilistic transport", "multimodal distributions", "dynamical systems"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c680deef07ea4c38f9fed7097f599ab055e9ea37.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces Branched Schrödinger Bridge Matching (BranchSBM), which solves a branched generalized SB by decomposing it into a sum of unbalanced conditional SOC objectives.

Training assumes access to clustered terminal distributions $\\pi_{1,k}$ (and uses them directly in losses), rather than discovering branches from snapshots.\n2. The work decomposes branchGSB into a sum of unbalanced CondSOC subproblems with branch-specific drifts/growth and a task-specific state cost guiding intermediate trajectories. I think several components are not entirely new. In per branch, the formulation considered here is close to unbalanced SB/RUOT except for the task-specific state cost. The neural interpolant function considered here and used for flow matching is also presented in (Neklyudov et al.,  ICML 2024). And I believe the paper misses some references. The paper discusses the connections with other methods mainly in the appendix, but it would benefit from a more explicit discussion of some key references in the main text.\n3. Not totally simulation-free in training. Although drift learning avoids state-SDE simulation (Stages 1–2), growth learning still requires time integration of $g_{t,k}$ to obtain the weight.\n4. Training complexity and the contribution of each stage remain unclear. The paper reports Stage-3 vs. Stage-4 loss trends (Table 6) but does not present ablation on metrics (e.g., W/MMD) to quantify each stage’s effect on final performance, stability, or sample quality. More granular ablations could clarify the necessity/sufficiency of each stage.\n5. Baselines are limited. Comparisons are primarily to a single-branch SBM baseline; no comparisons to other unbalanced SB/RUOT (e.g., DeepRUOT), or flow-matching methods (e.g., OT-CFM, SF2M, MetricFM) are provided, which weakens the case that BranchSBM is uniquely required.\n6. Pipeline choices may inject bias. Sensitivity to the number of branches K, and to endpoint clustering protocols, is not analyzed. \n7. Dependence on a task-specific state costs $V_t$. The approach follows intermediate trajectories “governed by a state cost”; results highlight energy/mass evolution but do not systematically study how $V_t$ choices affect accuracy, stability, or branching time.  \n8. Perturbation experiments are conducted on top-50 PCs but metrics on top-2 PCs for W distances; it is unclear why the authors choose to do so.\n9. Scalability with many branches/memory. The authors note higher space complexity (multiple branch networks), though time is said to be comparable, and inference is cheaper. Empirical scaling with large K or long horizons is not demonstrated. Also lacks analysis of training time or memory scaling with dimensionality or number of branches."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could the method be extended to infer branching structure automatically from snapshot data? If not, please discuss how sensitive training is to incorrect or coarse endpoint clustering.\n2. The four-stage pipeline (interpolant → flow matching → growth → joint) is complex, and the contribution of each stage to the final outcome remains unclear. Could the authors report ablations on key metrics (e.g., W₁/W₂/MMD) to quantify how each stage affects trajectory fidelity and stability?\n3. The evaluation mainly contrasts with a single-branch SBM. Including other competitive baselines (e.g., DeepRUOT, SF2M, OT-CFM, MetricFM) would better contextualize where BranchSBM provides concrete advantages.\n4. Since $V_t$ guides intermediate trajectories, could the authors explore how varying its definition affects results? Currently, its influence on branching time or trajectory stability is not quantified.\n5. The perturbation experiments rely on PCA (50, 100, 150 PCs) and evaluate W distances only on the top-2 PCs. Could the authors test whether performance holds in the full PCA space to validate?\n6. The paper notes increased space complexity due to per-branch networks, but no measurements of training time or memory usage with respect to dimensionality or number of branches are reported. Including empirical scaling results (e.g., runtime vs. K or dimension) would clarify practical feasibility.\n7. Since BranchSBM explicitly learns branch-specific growth rates $g_{t,k}$, it would be informative to visualize these trajectories on biological datasets—e.g., the mouse hematopoiesis dataset. Showing how growth evolves along different branches could clarify the biological interpretability and verify whether the model captures expected proliferation or decay patterns.\n\nReferences\n1.

Current models, like standard Schrödinger Bridge Matching (SBM) and flow matching, are limited to modeling single, continuous paths between a source and target. The goal of BranchSBM is to learn branched trajectories to guide from a single source to multiple target by parameterizing separate dynamics for each path. The method also extends the Generalized SBM (GSB) framework by including a non-linear state cost, $V_t(X_t)$, which acts as a potential term to ensure that the learned trajectories remain on the data manifold.\n\nThe proposed BranchSBM algorithm solves the \"Branched GSB problem\" by parameterizing separate velocity fields (drifts) $u_{t,k}$ and growth rate fields $g_{t,k}$ for each of the $K$ branches with neural networks. This formulation allows the model to handle \"unbalanced\" transport, where the mass of each branch can grow or shrink. The model is trained using a four-stage algorithm. Stage I, trains a neural interpolant to find the optimal, energy-minimizing paths between the source and each target endpoint. Stage II then uses conditional flow matching to train the branch-specific drift networks $u_{t,k}$ to replicate the velocities from Stage 1. Stage III freezes the drift networks and trains the growth networks $g_{t,k}$ to match the known target mass of each branch. Stage IV unfreezes all parameters and jointly fine-tunes all networks to minimize a combined objective that includes energy, mass matching, and distribution reconstruction losses."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper tackles an interesting and well-motivated problem in machine learning of how can we model population-level dynamics that diverge from a single source to multiple distinct outcomes. This is common scenario in fields like single-cell genomics, where we are interested in how a single, source population of pluripotent cells evolved into several distinct cell types, and standard generative models that assume a single, unimodal transition are insufficient. The authors' core idea of extending Schrödinger bridges to explicitly handle branched paths is a relevant contribution.\n\nThe theoretical framework for decomposing this complex problem also appears sound. The authors provide proofs for their core propositions, notably Proposition 1, which tractably reframes the \"Unbalanced GSB\" problem into a solvable \"Unbalanced CondSOC\" objective, and Proposition 2, which then justifies modeling the full \"Branched GSB\" problem as a sum of these individual objectives . This provides a formal grounding for the method's architecture, which separates the dynamics for each branch."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The proposed method's significant complexity raises concerns about its practical adoption, scalability, and generalizability. The algorithm is a four-stage sequential training pipeline (Algorithm 1) that involves training at least $2(K+1) + 1$ separate neural networks (an interpolant, $K+1$ drift fields, and $K+1$ growth fields). Furthermore, the overall objective is a carefully weighted sum of at least 6 different loss terms (trajectory, flow, energy, match, mass and reconstruction), which are balanced by many hyperparameters. This multi-stage, multi-loss design suggests a high sensitivity to tuning and raises questions about its robustness. Given this intricacy, the paper would be substantially strengthened by meticulous ablation studies to justify each component. For instance, a thorough analysis of the model's performance when stages (such as 1 or 4) are simplified or loss terms are removed would help distinguish critical components from those offering marginal gains and would better motivate the final design.\n\nThis substantial methodological complexity is not yet fully justified by the provided experimental validation. The cost of the method would be more compelling if benchmarked against a wider array of competitive alternatives and shown to have outstanding results. Currently, most of the results are compared almost exclusively against a single baseline (single-branch SBM). While this demonstrates that a branched model is better at modeling branches than a non-branched one, it doesn't contextualize the method within the broader field. Furthermore, Despite being motivated by cell differentiation, the paper notably omits a comparison against any of the many existing, often simpler, single-cell trajectory inference algorithms, some of which also explicitly designed to deal with branching.
