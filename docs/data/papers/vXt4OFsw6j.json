We introduce three datasets of ancient Greek handwriting for diachronic representation learning: Hell-Char, a curated training set spanning the 3rd–1st centuries BCE, and two evaluation sets, PaLit-Char (1st–5th c. CE) and Med-Char (9th–14th c. CE). To address challenges of symbolic variation, scarce data, and systematic degradation, we propose two methodological innovations: a similarity-weighted supervised contrastive loss that biases embeddings by human-perceived confusability, and a lacuna-driven augmentation scheme that simulates realistic manuscript corruptions. Trained with these strategies, both a lightweight CNN and a pretrained ResNet achieve strong recognition performance and produce embeddings that more coherently separate character classes than PCA or generic pretrained models. These embeddings enable clustering, identification of stylistic subgroups, and construction of prototype images that visualize diachronic evolution and transitional letterforms. Our results demonstrate that incorporating expert priors and domain-specific corruptions yields robust, interpretable representations, offering a transferable paradigm for representation learning under scarce, temporally evolving, and noisy conditions.", "tldr": "Domain-aware contrastive learning yields robust embeddings for evolving, low-resource handwriting data.", "keywords": ["representation learning", "clustering", "supervised classification", "diachronic analysis", "handwritten character recognition", "paleography", "cultural heritage data"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ea2c5c67c09ad720500ff84ac51cd31befb0ed65.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the challenge of diachronic representation learning for ancient Greek handwriting by introducing three datasets.

However, neither of these are fully explained, and both have conceptual issues which are not addressed: \n\n* (A) Similarity-weighted supervised contrastive loss: The term S_{y_i, y_a} is given as “dynamically computed from embeddings”. It is not clear how it is computed, whether these embeddings are the representations actively being learned, or if these refer to fixed, pre-computed embeddings. Conceptually, the contrastive learning objective is already expected to model visual similarity between samples, so it is unclear what motivates adding an additional similarity term. In addition, L155 mentions an addition “standard cross-entropy” loss, but it is not clear if this refers to training the backbone on letter classification, and if so, whether the contrastive loss is applied to the output of the classification head or to intermediate activations.\n\n* (B) Lacuna augmentation: While this is presented as one of the main contributions of the paper, it is never clearly defined. L150 mentions that this augments images by masking; if so, this is similar to standard image augmentation strategies for training vision models.\n\nThere also lacks a comparison to stronger representation learning baselines such as zero-shot or fine-tuned CLIP, DINO, or DIFT features, while comparing only to baselines like pretrained ResNet features which are expected to be weak on challenging images.\n\nWhile the curation and aggregation of data is a valuable contribution, much of the data is sourced from existing datasets (Hell-Date, PaLit), and it is unclear how much new data is contributed. The abstract and intro do not mention this, suggesting that this is a new data contribution. It should be clarified whether new data is being contributed, or whether the main contribution is the curation or filtering of existing data.\n\nOverall, the bulk of the paper is devoted to exploratory data analysis and paleographic insights from methods such as clustering. While these are valuable insights in general, it is not clear whether they are in the scope of this conference."}, "questions": {"value": "Is the proposed method specific to ancient Greek?
