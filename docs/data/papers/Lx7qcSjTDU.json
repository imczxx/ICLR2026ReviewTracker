Simulations are widely available on regular grids but are generally biased and too coarse to inform wind-farm siting or to assess extreme-weather-related risks (e.g., gusts) at infrastructure scales. To fully utilize both data types for generating high-quality, high-resolution hub-height wind speeds (tens to ~100m above ground), this study introduces WindSR, a diffusion model with data assimilation for super-resolution downscaling of hub-height winds. WindSR integrates sparse observational data with simulation fields during downscaling using state-of-the-art diffusion models. A dynamic-radius blending method is introduced to merge observations with simulations, providing conditioning for the diffusion process. Terrain information is incorporated during both training and inference to account for its role as a key driver of winds. Evaluated against convolutional-neural-network and generative-adversarial-network baselines, WindSR outperforms them in both downscaling efficiency and accuracy. Our data assimilation reduces WindSR's model bias by approximately 20% relative to independent observations.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["super resolution", "diffusion models", "climate", "data assimilation"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ef2cd96580e0a0ba2589d7dec00b9ff2abbebeab.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes WindSR, a diffusion-based super-resolution downscaler that conditions on a blended field (observations + simulation via a Gaussian soft-bleed mask with a dynamic impact radius) plus terrain.

Evaluation feels thin for both SR and DA:\n  - Super-resolution baselines are limited to older CNN/GAN models (SRCNN, ESRGAN). Missing stronger, more recent downscalers, especially diffusion/transformer ones (e.g., CorrDiff [1]). Also missing a traditional dynamical downscaling baseline. At least one modern AI method **or** one traditional method would make the comparison more solid. \n  - Data assimilation baselines are also SRCNN/ESRGAN, which are SR models by design. It’s unclear how they’re adapted for assimilation. Classical DA (e.g., 3DVar, 4DVar) isn’t included, and newer AI DA methods (e.g., score-based DA [2], latent DA [3], VAE-Var[4], etc.) aren’t compared. Again, the authors are recommended to include at least one modern AI **or** one traditional DA baseline.\n  - It’s not clear whether baselines like SRCNN/ESRGAN also use terrain as input. Without that, the comparison may be skewed. \n  - Although the abstract and introduction highlight WindSR’s efficiency, the paper provides neither theoretical analysis nor empirical evidence to substantiate this claim. Additional clarification and/or experiments are needed.\n- The idea of using terrain deviation and speed deviation to determine the dynamic impact radius is interesting, but the thresholds based on terrain and speed deviation aren’t justified, and there’s no ablation/sensitivity to show how these choices affect assimilation quality.\n\n[1] Mardani, Morteza, et al. \"Residual corrective diffusion modeling for km-scale atmospheric downscaling.\" Communications Earth & Environment 6.1 (2025): 124.\n\n[2] Rozet, François, and Gilles Louppe. \"Score-based data assimilation.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2023): 40521-40541.\n\n[3] Melinc, Boštjan, and Žiga Zaplotnik. \"3D‐Var data assimilation using a variational autoencoder.\" Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society 150.761 (2024): 2273-2295.\n\n[4] Xiao, Yi, et al. \"VAE-Var: Variational autoencoder-enhanced variational methods for data assimilation in meteorology.\" The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations. 2025."}, "questions": {"value": "- On what basis does WindSR claim an efficiency edge?
