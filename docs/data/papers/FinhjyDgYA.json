To this end, we conceptualize a principled, top-down approach grounded in energy-based interpretation. Specifically, we formalize token dynamics as a joint maximum likelihood estimation on the hypersphere, featuring two properties: semantic alignment in the high-dimensional space and distributional uniformity in the low-dimensional space. By quantifying them with extended Hopfield energy functions, we instantiate this idea as a constrained energy minimization problem, which enables designs of symmetric attention and feedforward modules with RMS normalization. We further present *Hyper-Spherical Energy Transformer* (Hyper-SET), a recurrent-depth alternative to vanilla Transformers naturally emerging from iterative energy optimization on the hypersphere. With shared parameters across layers, Hyper-SET can scale to arbitrary depth with fewer parameters. Theoretically grounded and compact, it achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse tasks, including Sudoku solving, image classification, and masked image modeling. We also design novel variations under the proposed general principle, such as linear attention and gated feedforward layer, and showcase its scalability with depth-wise LoRA.

With this in mind, maybe comparisons to some simpler RNNs/convnets may be meaningful?\n- Comparisons against other single-layer recurrent-depth baselines require some more explanation and elaboration (beyond Appendix D). See \"Questions\" Q1 below.\n- The single-layer recurrent-depth setting is interesting but impractical. A well-trained ViT with 12 (non-tied) layers can easily get > 90 on CIFAR 10 for instance (cf Table 1 where the high score is 90, whereas even the original ViT paper [1] boasts 99% in Table 6). Almost all practical use cases do not use this weight sharing. With this in mind, the empirical results currently do not demonstrate the practical efficiency of such networks. See \"Questions\" Q2 below.\n- Relatedly, the baseline deep networks in Figure 4 seem under-tuned, e.g., the baseline 12-layer ViT is said to get 66% on CIFAR100 in Table 4 but [1] Table 6 shows that a 12 layer ViT can get > 90% on CIFAR100. See \"Questions\" Q2 below.\n\nSome nits:\n- It does not really make sense to write two separate ODEs to show that you optimize each part of the features (e.g. (7) and (10)), which would suggest a parallel-structure network. Instead it is more mathematically sound to have a combined ODE with both RHS terms summed together, and obtain the network architecture via operator splitting (or some similar technique).\n- Table 2 empirical performances in the first two columns are close and seem within-noise, requiring 5 significant figures on the benchmark to distinguish the models; within this context, bolding is done slightly incorrectly, e.g., only bolding Hyper-SET numbers in the case of a tie (0.417 in the second column). On the other hand, the text referencing Table 2 is slightly unfair to Hyper-SET since it can emphasize parity in the first two columns instead of saying it lags in all metrics.\n\n[1]: Dosovitskiy, Alexey. \"An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.11929 (2020)."}, "questions": {"value": "Q1: Can you elaborate a little on the surprising performance of the baselines in the experiments?

The conceptualization of token dynamics as a balance between \"semantic alignment\" and \"distributional uniformity\" is intuitive and provides a compelling theoretical foundation for the architecture.\nThe mathematical derivations that connect these two principles to the standard Transformer components are elegant. Showing how attention, FFNs, and RMSNorm emerge as natural solutions to a single constrained energy minimization problem is the central theoretical strength of this work.\nThe empirical evaluation is extensive and respectable.

While the authors are not expected to conduct a full-scale SOTA-level experiment, and their attempt to scale by stacking two distinct layers is a valuable inclusion, the paper would be significantly strengthened by a more in-depth discussion on how this scaling limitation could be overcome. The paper falls short in hypothesizing why this limitation exists. Is the hard parameter-sharing of the recurrent model creating an optimization bottleneck that a deep stack of independent layers avoids? The work would be more complete if it drew parallels to existing literature on deep vs. recurrent models or the challenges of weight-sharing in large-scale settings. A discussion on potential paths forward would provide a more comprehensive outlook.
