Effect of negative transfer: what if some source tasks are unrelated to the target?\n\n**In Appendix D. 3 of the revised paper**, we study how unrelated source tasks affect the performance of using four heterogeneous HPO-B problems with varying input dimensions. Each surrogate model (as in Section 5.1, Figure 4) is “attacked” by tuning it with meta-train data from an unrelated task. For example, using data from task 5889 to tune the surrogate for 5859, or using data from 4796 to tune the surrogate for 5860. We then evaluate each surrogate on its original task after one to five negative-tuning epochs, where additional epochs represent stronger negative transfer.\nOn average, ProfBO remains mostly unaffected under mild negative transfer (a single tuning epoch), but its performance degrades when the negative influence is stronger. The severity of negative transfer increases as the discrepancy between tasks grows, and it is particularly pronounced when input dimensions differ, as demonstrated by the interaction between tasks 5860 (6D) and 4796 (3D).\n\n> 2. Effect of number (diversity) of source task on the performance of ProfBO.\n\n**In Appendix D.4 of the revised paper**, we study how the number of source tasks used to train the MDP prior and fine-tune the PFN affects the final performance of PROFBO. Using problems 4796 (rpart.preproc, (d=3)), 5859 (rpart, (d=6)), and 5906 (xgboost, (d=16)) from HPO-B, we re-evaluate performance when only 10%, 50%, or 100% of the available source-task data is used. The corresponding results are presented in Figure 11.\nOverall, the average trend in Figure 11a shows that increasing the number and diversity of source tasks leads to improved performance. Figure 11b further indicates that higher-dimensional tasks, such as problem 5906, are more sensitive to reductions in the amount of source-task data.\n\n> 3. The performance of ProfBO on Covid-B extended to 40 iterations.\n\nAs shown in **Figure 13a of Appendix D.6 of the revised paper**, our claim in Section 5.2 about ProfBO’s few-shot (≤ 20 iterations) performance on Covid-B is still valid on the aggregated result over all problems, and ProfBO still demonstrates great performance within 40 iterations, although there is a certain case (problem NSP15) when TNP slightly outperforms ProfBO after 20 iterations (Figure 13b)."}}, "id": "yhUHaUEItP", "forum": "Lox09R86xM", "replyto": "Lox09R86xM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9116/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9116/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9116/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763685590146, "cdate": 1763685590146, "tmdate": 1763685590146, "mdate": 1763685590146, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper targets the important problem of black box optimization where only few evaluations are possible, but optimization trajectories of related tasks are available to speedup the optimization.

As I understand it, this requires being able to make new evaluations of the source tasks, and in particular, not just using whatever optimization trajectory you happen to have from some earlier optimization on this task. Is that correct? The typical assumption in metalearning for BO is that the data you have from each source task come from some previous run of BO or the like on that source task, so the number of points per source task would be in the neighborhood of 20-40. How many datapoints per source task were used here? Appendix C.2 says \"In Cancer-B, we utilize three meta-training datasets (6T2W, NSUN2, RTCB), comprising 437,634 evaluations in total, and two meta-test datasets (WHSC, WRN), totaling 291,756 evaluations.\" Does that mean that all O(10^5) points were used as the dataset for learning the DQN on the source tasks? If so, it would present a serious problem for the motivation of the paper. I cannot think of many realistic scenarios where one would be able to run orders of magnitude more evaluations on the source tasks as on the target task. In particular it does not seem to be the case in the scenarios used to motivate the paper: \"In practice, these related source tasks can be the docking scores of a set of molecules evaluated on different receptors.\" If for one receptor (target task) it takes hours/days to do an evaluation, it is implausible that it would take only seconds/minutes to do the evaluation for some different receptor.\n\n* The paper is broadly framed as being for few-shot learning, but it is really about transfer learning. These are not the same thing, generally in few-shot learning one may not have access to the similar source tasks required by the method. Even the title of the paper may be confusing, \"None to optima\": Except is it really \"None\" when source tasks are required?\n\n* The potential for negative transfer is an important issue in any transfer learning / metalearning method, and is not investigated in the paper at all. I'd like to see what happens to performance as unrelated tasks are added as source tasks.\n\n* Understanding when trajectory information is helpful: The MDP prior and model for optimization trajectories is the core contribution of the paper. Internally to the paper, the claim that this is important/valuable seems well-supported by the ablation studies, which shows that eliminating either positional encoding or the MAML training algorithm significantly deteriorates performance. But, prior work has come to a different conclusion. The paper for the NAP method (Maravel et al. 2023) has a whole section (Property 3.2) claiming that history-order invariance is important for Meta-RL generally, and that positional encoding should not be used. NAP performs nearly as well ProfBO. So while removing positional encoding degrades ProfBO, other methods (NAP) intentionally exclude positional encoding and yet perform nearly as well as ProfBO with positional encoding. What is the source of this seeming discrepancy?\n\n* The language around optimization trajectories and sampling strategies seems confused. Section 4 states \"Under the GP assumption in standard BO, at iteration t, all queries in Dt−1 are treated as i.i.d. uniformly distributed, ignoring the fact that Dt−1 is actually a BO trajectory.\" This makes it sound like the GP is making distributional assumptions on the X input locations, which is not the case. I think the text is trying to get at the notion of exchangeability, which is a related albeit different concept.\n\n* Number of samples: The paper is framed very strongly around 20 iterations being the upper bound for number of samples. E.g. page 1 \"fewer than 20 evaluations\"; page 3 \"within a few shots, e.g. T<=20\"; page 4 \"T can be fewer than 20\", etc. Then suddenly in Section 5.2 this is changed to \"within 20 or 40 iterations.\" This is of course because the method did not perform particularly well at 20 iterations on the Cancer problem and required 40 iterations to beat TNP. This raises the obvious question of what happens on the covid problem if the number of iterations is taken out to 40, and furthermore seems like there should be some acknowledgement that in some settings more iterations are required.\n\n* It would be helpful to understand when/why more iterations are required. The HPO-B problems were run out to 90 iterations because that's what was done in the work this builds most directly on. We see that there are are significant improvements from iteration 20 to iteration 90. So while it may be correct to say that ProfBO is the best of the methods at iteration 20, it is not correct to say that ProfBO has solved the problem well in fewer than 20 evaluations; the regret is still very high if one were using ProfBO and had to stop after 20 iterations. Is well-performing few-shot learning just not possible here? When is it possible?"}, "questions": {"value": "* Please clarify how many points are being used as the dataset for each source task.
