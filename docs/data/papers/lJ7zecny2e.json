My main concerns are twofold:\n\n1. The authors emphasize that there is a huge gap between MM-CoT and geoscience (lines 89–90), and they propose a concept called an “intention-driven active perception process,” claiming that this represents a “critical gap” in Earth observation. They also highlight *Perceptually-Grounded Geo-CoT* as a new paradigm in their contributions. However, I believe this emphasis is overstated. The so-called new paradigm essentially “mandates a verifiable link between each analytical step and its corresponding visual evidence,” which has already been extensively explored in follow-up works after MM-CoT (2023). I can list several such studies [1–3], and the authors should conduct a more thorough review of these. Over the nearly two years since MM-CoT was proposed, numerous works have investigated the correspondence between reasoning steps and their associated visual evidence. The authors do not clarify how their approach differs from these, but instead focus only on MM-CoT (2023) and emphasize thinking with corresponding visual evidence is the “critical gap” in remote sensing field which  is already widely recognized in common field. The Geo-CoT paradigm does not clearly demonstrate any distinction between the remote sensing observation domain and the general domain. The authors even state in the related work section (lines 143–147) that existing studies focus on reasoning over whole objects, while remote sensing involves “a verifiable log of fine-grained perceptual operations.” However, if the authors examined recent works on visual reasoning from the past one to two years, they would see that this kind of “fine-grained perceptual operation” has already been addressed in many general-domain studies. The fact that the authors list this as the first of their three main contributions suggests they may have deliberately overlooked related works in order to overstate the novelty of their approach.\n\n2. There are serious issues with the evaluation metrics used in the downstream tasks, which I hope the authors will clarify. Specifically, the authors use mAP and mIoU as evaluation metrics for the Visual Grounding (VG) task. I will detail these concerns in my comments, but this choice raises significant doubts about the reliability of their downstream task evaluations.\n\n[1]Visual CoT: Advancing Multi-Modal Language Models with a Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\n\n[2]V*: Guided Visual Search as a Core Mechanism in Multimodal LLMs\n\n[3]CMMCoT: Enhancing Complex Multi-Image Comprehension via Multi-Modal Chain-of-Thought and Memory Augmentation"}, "questions": {"value": "1.Visual Grounding is essentially a single-instance localization problem conditioned on language, not an object detection task requiring multiple candidate boxes with confidence scores. The paper reports both mAP and mIoU as evaluation metrics for the Visual Grounding (VG) task. While mIoU is understandable as it directly measures localization accuracy, the use of mAP is conceptually unclear. \n\n2.The Geo-CoT380k dataset is a key contribution, consisting of 380k reasoning traces generated by GPT-4V. However, the paper lacks any quantitative or qualitative validation of these traces. Prior CoT work often applies explicit quality control—e.g., multi-sample consistency (self-consistency), deductive stepwise verification, or human expert spot-checking—when using LLM-generated chains (e.g., [1], [2], [3]). But the paper does not mention such validation, making it unclear whether the reported improvements stem from the quality of reasoning chains or simply from the large data volume. This casts doubt on the true impact of Geo-CoT on reasoning faithfulness.\n\n[1]Wang X, Wei J, Schuurmans D, et al. Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought \tReasoning in Language Models.

Under this setting, how are confidence scores for mAP computation obtained? If the model outputs only one bounding box per query, the definition of precision–recall and mAP becomes ambiguous. Could the authors clarify this evaluation setup?\n\n(3)Could the authors clarify whether any quality control was performed on the GPT-4V-generated reasoning traces? If not, how can we be confident that the improvements are due to reasoning supervision and not just data scale effects?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ub3uaNWPJr", "forum": "lJ7zecny2e", "replyto": "lJ7zecny2e", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10900/Reviewer_bTxE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10900/Reviewer_bTxE"], "number": 6, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10900/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761985888567, "cdate": 1761985888567, "tmdate": 1762922104487, "mdate": 1762922104487, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
