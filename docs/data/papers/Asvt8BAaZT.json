While various low-memory optimizers have been proposed that sometimes match the performance of Adam, their lack of reliability has left Adam as the default choice. In this work, we apply a simple layer-wise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis to quantify when second-moment tensors can be effectively replaced by their means across different dimensions. Our SNR analysis reveals how architecture, training hyperparameters, and dataset properties impact compressibility along Adam's trajectory, naturally leading to \\emph{SlimAdam}, a memory-efficient Adam variant. \\emph{SlimAdam} compresses the second moments along dimensions with high SNR when feasible, and leaves when compression would be detrimental. Through experiments across a diverse set of architectures and training scenarios, we show that \\emph{SlimAdam} matches Adam's performance and stability while saving up to 98% of total second moments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Optimization dynamics"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2948352b1396c7ba2c1c08e874fa987eb57297e4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a layer-wise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis to determine when the second-moment tensors in optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam) can be compressed by replacing them with their dimensional means.

The main motivation of this work is to establish a metric for guiding dimension-wise mean compression of second-moment tensors and provide SlimAdam. However, this goal appears to overlap with Adam-mini [1], which not only implemenst a compression method based on block-wise mean values but also provides insights based on Hessian structure to explain why the full second-moment may be unnecessary and to guide how to compress. The authors should more clearly delineate their contributions and explicitly contrast their approach with the insights and methods provided by Adam-mini.\n\n2. SNR is a natural choice for quantifying the viability of mean compression, given its formula of $\\text{mean} / \\text{variance}$. The paper does not sufficiently justify why it is superior to other plausible metrics. For instance, measures based on the L2-norm or KL-divergence of the error introduced by compression, or just variance, could be more direct and computationally efficient. The author should demonstrate the unique advantages of SNR over other alternatives through theoretical analysis or empirical comparision. \n\n3. For mean compression, it is clear that higher SNR correlates with better compressibility. However, the method remains dependent on an empirically set threshold (e.g., $\\alpha=1$) to make compression decisions. This dependency not only limits the generality of the method by introducing a potentially sensitive hyperparameter across different scenarios but also raises the question of whether other metrics (e.g., L2-norm, KL-divergence, or variance) could perform just as effectively with a similarly tuned threshold.\n\n4. The utility of SNR seems limited to mean compression and may not extend to or guide other compression paradigms (e.g., low-rank factorization, quantization).\n\n[1] Zhang, Yushun, et al. \"Adam-mini: Use fewer learning rates to gain more.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.16793 (2024)."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

I’ll split my review into two parts — one on the empirical analysis and one on the proposed optimizer.\n\n### Empirical analysis and design rationale\n\nThe paper’s primary findings are almost entirely empirical, and this lack of theory leaves several key decisions unclear—especially because the empirical signals themselves are not particularly strong. Axis sharing is constrained to whole fan-in or fan-out dimensions purely for implementation convenience, with no exploration of alternative groupings or proof that these axes are optimal (e.g., would results change if one considers randomly partitioning a layer’s parameters into two equal-size groups?). Similarly, the paper adopts (the interesting metric) SNR with a heuristic threshold as the only compression criterion, although simple variance (which answers “How much l2 loss do we pay if we collapse this vector to a scalar?”) would align more directly with the intuition the authors cite (“If entries along a dimension exhibit low variance relative to their mean, they can be effectively represented by a single value”).\n\nLearning rate is the only hyperparameter the paper systematically analyzes. It is presented as the dominant knob that shifts SNR and thus determines which layers can be compressed, yet the text provides no a-priori reason why learning rate—rather than, say, Adam’s momentum coefficients or the batch size—should hold that position.\n\n\n### Optimizer details\nThe optimizer requires selecting a compression axis for each layer or layer type. Choosing a compression axis means either relying on proxies or heuristics, or collecting fresh SNR statistics. My concern is that the latter defeats the purpose in some cases, and the former is not reliable.\n\nAlternatively, we can train a small proxy model or reuse generic rules. Yet the authors themselves show that preferred compression axes shift with dataset, width, and vocabulary size. Even within the same dataset and width, layers of the same type show different preferences. Depth-averaging does not fully solve the problem for users operating at the tightest memory margins or in domains whose depth-specific SNR patterns have not been studied yet. Even the stronger patterns they find—for example, compressing along the embedding dimension versus the token dimension—may not yield an SNR above the cutoff needed to justify compression.\n\nFull-size SNR collection defeats the purpose. To decide the sharing axis, you must first run the uncompressed model under standard Adam long enough to gather per-layer SNR statistics. During this warm-up, you still store the full second-moment tensors, so the memory spike SlimAdam tries to avoid is paid up front. For practitioners who want to fit a slightly larger model into fixed hardware, this spike means the maximum model size is still bounded by Adam’s footprint during the warm-up, undermining the value of a lighter optimizer."}, "questions": {"value": "Please address my concerns above, especially around the empirical nature of the evidence, axis selection, and practicality at tight memory budgets. In addition, a high-level clarification would help: how should we interpret “compressibility” in this work beyond plots of SNR?

Higher SNR indicates tighter clustering, which justifies compression. And the compression is applied only in the layers where SNR is high, and state granularity is retained where SNR is low.
