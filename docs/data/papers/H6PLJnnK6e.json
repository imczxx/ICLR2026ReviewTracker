While considerable effort has been devoted to enhancing heatmap sophistication through advanced learning models, this paper rigorously examines whether this emphasis is justified, critically assessing the relative impact of heatmap complexity versus MCTS configuration. Our extensive empirical analysis across diverse TSP scales, distributions, and benchmarks reveals two pivotal insights: \\textbf{1}) The configuration of MCTS strategies significantly influences solution quality, underscoring the importance of meticulous tuning to achieve optimal results and enabling valid comparisons among different heatmap methodologies. \\textbf{2}) A rudimentary, parameter-free heatmap based on the intrinsic $k$-nearest neighbor structure of TSP instances, when coupled with an optimally tuned MCTS, can match or surpass the performance of more sophisticated, learned heatmaps, demonstrating robust generalizability on problem scale and distribution shift. To facilitate rigorous and fair evaluations in future research, we introduce a streamlined pipeline for standardized MCTS hyperparameter tuning. Collectively, these findings challenge the prevalent assumption that heatmap complexity is the primary determinant of performance, advocating instead for a balanced integration and comprehensive evaluation of both learning and search components within this paradigm.", "tldr": "This study shows simple heatmaps and well-tuned MCTS can outperform complex heatmap-based approaches for the Travelling Salesman Problem, advocating for a balanced focus on both learning and search components.", "keywords": ["Travelling Salesman Problem", "Heatmap", "Monte Carlo Tree Search", "Combinatorial optimization"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/186692237bda7f64cdf763c05859eb08f4512462.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c71f8d778663816e44f83cd2c54fc125a7ad6c78.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper critically evaluates the \"Heatmap + Monte Carlo Tree Search\" paradigm for solving TSP, challenging the prevailing focus on increasingly complex learned heatmaps.

Foremost, there might be a fundamental misposition that the authors put forward in this work regarding the research line of developing more complex heatmap models: heatmaps do not merely serve for the specific MCTS serching, instead, most recent heatmap-related methods inherently embody advancements in backbone design, training schemes, or data representation, etc., aligning major focuses in the broader ML community. So the criteria for assessing a heatmap should probably not be whether it helps MCTS perform better. Rather, increasing consensus has been inclined to testing neural TSP solvers in a \"heatmap + greedy\" paradigm to evaluate the raw efficacy of neural parts without the results being disguised by post-inference tricks like MCTS, which I personally also deem more reasonable. \n2. The contribution is a bit limited. Though I appreciate the systematic \"tuning\" of MCTS settings, the grid-search-based evaluations seem more of an engineering practice than some technical innovation. Second, the proposed GT-Prior, though interesting and computationally efficient, is also learning-free and straightforward. So, from a holistic view, the performance reported basically stems from the established MCTS algorithm, leaving the incremental efforts by the authors (conducting parameter search) somewhat simple and limited under the threshold of a top-tier conference.\n3. The performance is not sufficiently impressive. The proposed method fails to outperform DIFUSCO on 2 out of 3 benchmarks, while recent literature has proposed much stronger heatmap models than DIFUSCO.\n4. Minor issues.

Is it defined by the parameter quantity of neural models that produce the heatmap, or by any mathematical or statistical metrics computed upon individual heatmaps?

E.g., in Sec 5 the authors say \"the prevailing view that increasingly sophisticated heatmap models are the primary drivers of performance in the \"Heatmap + MCTS\" TSP paradigm.\" Similar statements do not seem grounded enough.\n2.

The authors state that ``The underlying assumption is often that heatmap sophistication directly translates to superior solution quality``, yet they provide no experiments to substantiate this claim. They lack analytical experiments to compare the heatmaps produced by different methods, such using greedy strategy.\n\n2. It can be inferred from ``Table 1`` and the sentence ``The Time_Limit for MCTS was set to 0.1 for TSP-500 and TSP-1000, and 0.01 for TSP-10000`` that the authors run MCTS in parallel. However, they never state this explicitly in the table (64 threads for TSP-500/1000 and 2(maybe?) threads for TSP-10000). Moreover, the baseline solvers ``LKH`` and ``Concorde`` are executed in single-thread mode, so the comparison is unfair and likely to mislead readers about the actual efficiency of MCTS. Additionally, previous study [1] suggests that the ``LKH`` and ``Concorde`` figures reported in the table may be outdated or stem from sub-optimal configurations; it is therefore advisable to adopt the updated baseline results.\n\n3. This paper concentrates **solely on the TSP** with ``heatmap+MCTS`` pipeline tailored to it. This approach is hard to extend to richer problems such as the CVRP.\n\n4. In general, as problem size increases, the quality of heatmaps learned by ML methods deteriorates. Previous studiy [2] has shown that heatmaps achieve strong performance on small-scale TSP instances, while this paper does not include experiments on TSP50 or TSP100. \n\n5. Both ``MCTS`` and ``LKH`` are K-opt algorithms; the former adds a heatmap guidance. In my view, once the instance size exceeds 500, LKH dominates MCTS in both speed and solution quality by a large margin. Hence the authors’ hope that ``heatmap + MCTS`` will ``develop TSP solvers that are not only high-performing but also more robust, efficient, and genuinely impactful`` is questionable.\n\n\n[1] *COExpander: Adaptive Solution Expansion for Combinatorial Optimization, ICML 2025*\n\n[2] *Unify ML4TSP: Drawing Methodological Principles for TSP and Beyond from Streamlined Design Space of Learning and Search, ICLR 2025*"}, "questions": {"value": "1.
