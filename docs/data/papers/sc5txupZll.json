However, traditional RAG methods, which rely on chunk-based retrieval, overlook the complex interrelationships between entities, limiting their ability to effectively model multi-entity facts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PaX-RAG, a novel framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation with multi-path summaries for a more structured and coherent representation of multi-entity relationships. Unlike existing methods like GraphRAG and HyperGraphRAG, which model binary and n-ary relations, respectively, PaX-RAG aggregates multiple paths into a single summary, offering a more holistic and ordered knowledge representation without the complexity of hypergraphs. Additionally, PaX-RAG employs an optimal transport-based retrieval strategy, which enhances retrieval accuracy by preserving the structural integrity of path sets and allowing for better semantic similarity matching between multi-entity queries. We show through theoretical analysis that PaX-RAG generalizes and extends existing graph-based methods, making them special cases of our framework. Extensive experiments across diverse knowledge-intensive domains, including healthcare, law, and computer science, demonstrate that PaX-RAG outperforms traditional RAG methods as well as other graph-based methods in terms of retrieval accuracy, generation quality, and computational efficiency.

Efficiency analysis of graph-based RAG is very important, but the cost for the OT-based retrieval approach and maintaining such a complex “path context graph” remains unknown. Comparisons with other baselines are needed.\n\n4. Only GPT-4o-mini was used to perform the main experiments; this limits the demonstration of the generalization capability of the method.

The formulation in Optimal Transport defines transport cost as purely cosine similarity between either entity or relation embeddings. Include a theoretical or empirical analysis of alternative definitions of the cost in OT beyond cosine similarity. Test Euclidean, Mahalanobis, or learned metric variants for sensitivity and retrieval robustness. \n\n6. Unclear advantage of ordered path construction over hypergraph representation. Despite this paper's claim that ordered path graphs capture multi-entity relations better than hypergraphs, it does not provide direct experimental evidence that isolates this effect.

The paper uses the Optimal Transport theory to support the proposed framework. However, the connection between OT theory and the core challenges of RAG is unclear. Why is converting to different distributions related to LLMs' needs? Why can the OT theory help us find multi-hop reasoning contexts? Proving existing models are \"special-case\" does not mean PaX-RAG would be effective. \n\n2. The proof of Proposition 4 is more like an argument and explanation. There are no rigorous mathematical steps. Thus, the paper gives readers the impression that it just wants to have some theory, though the theory is not that related to context retrieval and LLM reasoning.\n\n3. Instead of discussing OT theory, the authors should discuss the advantages of using paths. I feel like the key idea of PaX-RAG can be summarized as extracting entities, building a bipartite graph G_p = (V, P), and then walking on the graph. By using this expression, what is the actual novelty of PaX-RAG (not the OT theory)? Thus, the paper should find a focus. The current paper title is long, which gives readers the impression that the focus is unclear.\n\n4. The results in Table 2 show that other baselines are much worse than HyperGraphRAG and PaX-RAG. Can we have stronger baselines, given that so many graph RAG papers have been published? E.g., RAPTOR and GFM-RAG? Or does it mean the dataset is not that suitable? It may be because the questions for UltraDomain are generated by LLMs. Using LLM-generated questions to evaluate LLMs is problematic. Then, the authors can include at least one or two traditional datasets (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue), or try some new dataset, e.g., GraphRAG-Bench.\n\n5.
