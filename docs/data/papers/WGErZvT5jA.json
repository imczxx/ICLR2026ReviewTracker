At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states—such as 3D keypoints or joint angles—from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diffusion", "robot pose estimation", "video to action", "inverse dynamics", "world model"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4b0a46e83a0c272a6206143b1ab360a98a1e525b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/07f363af2e91b47e9bab53042fa2e6c5a17f483c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "iUO8suO0lk", "forum": "WGErZvT5jA", "replyto": "WGErZvT5jA", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14809/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14809/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761594640759, "cdate": 1761594640759, "tmdate": 1761594640759, "mdate": 1761594640759, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
