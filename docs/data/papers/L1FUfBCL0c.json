However, existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability, manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher–student framework to provide more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Chain-of-Thought (CoT); Task Vectors; Model Steering; Large Language Models (LLMs)"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/17fe7ecb0cf3b879e0ecf1cdd024e0f79bf401af.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3a5e1d5cbd20c3cc5915d908b3246a4bb2c519bb.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents CoT Vectors, a novel extension of task vectors for modeling multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The approach is well-motivated and provides meaningful insights into reasoning dynamics, with Learnable CoT Vectors showing stronger and more stable gains than extraction-based methods.

Specifically, it lacks a measurable way to categorize different types of CoTs and demonstrate when the proposed method works well and when it doesn’t.\n\nThe authors claim that the method saves compute cost because fine-tuning is not required. However, the inference process involves invoking both the frozen LLM and the student model. Given that models are typically used for inference far more often than training, the overall efficiency of the proposed method in real-world scenarios remains uncertain.\n\nIf I understand the authors correctly, there may be a hidden issue in Eq. 4. In Eq. 4, the extracted CoT vector takes the average. This means that if the answer is long and there are only a few mismatched tokens, the model may accept the result. However, if the problem is similar to the one depicted in Figure 1, a few mismatched tokens can invalidate the entire answer.\n\nThe experimental study lacks evaluation of the end-to-end efficiency of the proposed method.

We are pleased to see that the reviewers recognize our motivation: to introduce CoT Vectors, task-general reasoning representations that adapt the task vector framework to CoT reasoning. We are encouraged to see that the reviewers find our approach and analysis to be novel and insightful (Reviewer YJ7G, wcrC, and QPGb), the clarity of motivation and presentation (Reviewer YJ7G and wcrC), the comprehensive experimental evaluation spanning multiple models and datasets (Reviewer YJ7G and QPGb), and the practical efficiency of our method, which achieves parameter-efficiency and negligible inference overhead without prompt lengthening and full-finetuning (Reviewer YJ7G).\n\nBased on these comments, we have summarized the common questions and our responses as follows:\n\n**Q1: Comparison with more PEFT baselines**\n\nIn addition to LoRA, we newly evaluate Prefix-Tuning[1] and IA³[2], two representative PEFT methods belonging to distinct families. Results are shown in the table below:\n\n| Method | #Params | Performance (%) |\n|--------|---------|-----------------|\n| LoRA | 10.0M | 79.0 |\n| Prefix-Tuning | 573K | 75.0 |\n| IA³ | 645K | 76.2 |\n| Extracted (Ours) | 0 | 78.2 |\n| Learnable (Ours) | 3.6K | 83.5 |\n\nAcross all evaluated reasoning benchmarks, our CoT Vector approach achieves superior or at least comparable performance relative to both Prefix-Tuning and IA³. Morever, Prefix-Tuning and IA³ introduce substantially larger tunable modules, whereas our method injects only a single compact vector, requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters. This confirms that CoT Vectors provide competitive improvements in reasoning ability while maintaining much stronger parameter efficiency. \n\n**Q2: Misunderstanding about requiring two models for CoT Vector**\n\nWe would like to clarify a potential misunderstanding: our framework does not use two separate models—such as a frozen teacher LLM and a student model—during either training or inference.\nInstead, the terms teacher and student simply denote **two forward passes of the same frozen pre-trained LLM**, each receiving a different input sequence (with and without the CoT prompt).\nTo obtain the Extracted CoT Vector, we perform two passes of the frozen LLM using inputs with and without CoT, and compute the difference between the corresponding hidden states.\nTo obtain the Learnable CoT Vector, we insert a small trainable vector into a particular hidden layer and optimize it, such that the resulting student hidden state aligns with the teacher hidden state—again relying solely on a single frozen LLM.\nDuring inference, the only required operation is to add the obtained CoT vector into the forward pass via simple vector addition.\nTherefore, our method does not introduce any additional model beyond the original frozen LLM.\n\nWe also address other specific concerns in separate responses. We have uploaded the revised paper and highlighted the modified parts in blue.\n\n\n[1] Li, Xiang Lisa, and Percy Liang. \"Prefix-tuning: Optimizing continuous prompts for generation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00190 (2021).\n\n[2] Liu, Haokun, et al. \"Few-shot parameter-efficient fine-tuning is better and cheaper than in-context learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 1950-1965."}}, "id": "4pid3angA5", "forum": "L1FUfBCL0c", "replyto": "L1FUfBCL0c", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9113/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9113/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9113/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763611941199, "cdate": 1763611941199, "tmdate": 1763611941199, "mdate": 1763611941199, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces CoT Vectors, a compact representation that encodes multi-step reasoning knowledge, enabling LLMs to enhance reasoning without modifying model weights.\nTwo approaches are proposed to obtain these vectors: extracted CoT vectors and learnable CoT vectors optimized via a teacher-student distillation framework, with analysis of their layer-wise effects.\nExperiments show that the proposed methods can improve performance on the studied tasks."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The main experiments in the paper focus on mathematical reasoning and some domain-specific tasks, and the performance of the proposed method on more natural language logical reasoning tasks remains to be further validated.\n\n2. The training of task vectors may depend on factors such as the number and quality of sampled support instances, as well as the balancing factor $\\lambda$ between the two losses. Providing additional experimental results on these aspects could better demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.\n\n3. Although the authors provide some formula-based intuitive insights in Section 3.1, there remains a certain gap between the theoretical explanation and practical implementation. For example, the $\\mu$ and shift vector in Equation 1 should ideally be functions that vary with the input, whereas the task-general CoT vectors seem to assume a single shared reasoning chain prompt (i.e., the same $K_C$ and $V_C$) for all instances of the same task. Even under this assumption, $\\mu$ would still be expected to vary with the input.\n\n4. While the proposed method introduces relatively few trainable parameters, in practice an additional teacher model is required to perform CoT reasoning and align the output distributions with the student model. Reporting only the number of trainable parameters may therefore provide an incomplete picture of the overall overhead.\n\n5.
