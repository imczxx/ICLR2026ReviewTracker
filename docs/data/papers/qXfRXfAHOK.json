A key to generalization lies in understanding functional parts (e.g., door handles and knobs), which indicate where and how to manipulate across diverse object categories and shapes. Previous works attempted to achieve generalization by introducing foundation features, while these features are mostly 2D-based and do not specifically consider functional parts. When lifting these 2D features to geometry-profound 3D space, challenges arise, such as long runtimes, multi-view inconsistencies, and low spatial resolution with insufficient geometric information. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{Part-Aware 3D Feature Field (PA3FF)}, a novel dense 3D feature with part awareness for generalizable articulated object manipulation. PA3FF is trained by 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled datasets, via a contrastive learning formulation. Given point clouds as input, PA3FF predicts a continuous 3D feature field in a feedforward manner, where the distance between point feature reflects the proximity of functional parts: points with similar features are more likely to belong to the same part. Building on this feature, we introduce the \\textbf{Part-Aware Diffusion Policy (PADP)}, an imitation learning framework aimed at enhancing sample efficiency and generalization for robotic manipulation. We evaluate PADP on several simulated and real-world tasks, demonstrating that PA3FF consistently outperforms a range of 2D and 3D representations in manipulation scenarios, including CLIP, DINOv2, and Grounded-SAM, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Beyond imitation learning, PA3FF enables diverse downstream methods, including correspondence learning and segmentation task, making it a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Robotic Manipulation", "Imitation Learning", "3D Representation", "Generalizable Policy"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/eeddf0b3ac2624563158b307892bead2c2ca06bc.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/cd019feb9fa7d90c73a622f9b1c98ca8d297a60e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper argues that robots handle new objects better when they reason about the parts that matter for action—like handles, buttons, and lids—rather than whole objects.

They then use this representation in a diffusion policy that conditions control on the named part, letting the robot plan motions directly from the 3D scene. Because the features are native to 3D, they’re more consistent across viewpoints and make part boundaries clearer. In experiments spanning simulation and eight real-world tasks, the method outperforms strong 2D-feature and 3D-policy baselines, particularly when generalizing to unseen objects and states.

The architectural modification of the PTv3 backbone (removing down sampling layers and stacking additional Transformer blocks) is a core engineering contribution. However, the paper lacks sufficient quantitative details (e.g., parameter count, FLOPs, precise layer configuration) and a dedicated gain analysis for these changes. This absence of detailed exposition and architectural diagrams prevents readers from adequately assessing its contribution to the final performance and hinders the reproducibility of the research.\n2. The real-world experiments are evaluated with only 10 trials per task. This low number of evaluations in robotics may not provide sufficiently high statistical reliability to convincingly support the \"state-of-the-art\" claims. Furthermore, restricting the ablation study to a single task (\"Put in Drawer\")  severely weakens the proof of generality for component contributions across a broad range of tasks and different generalization types (e.g., OI, OC).\n3. PADP exhibits a significant drawback in inference speed compared to baselines like DP3 (4.23 FPS vs. 12.7 FPS).  Although PADP achieves higher success rates, this over 60% reduction in inference speed has not been adequately justified as a necessary trade-off (i.e., whether a  10~20% success rate gain, which does not guarantee deterministic success, is worth the real-time cost). In real-time robotic control requiring high-frequency feedback or integration into large policy frameworks, this performance-efficiency trade-off may reduce its practical applicability."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Generalization Source and Action Semantics Decoupling: The PartInstruct benchmark tests generalization across various factors, including Object State (OS), Object Instance (OI), Part Combination (TP), Task Category (TC), and Object Category (OC). Please confirm if the model is trained only on the Training Set data. If so, how does PADP or its language encoding module achieve generalization over action direction semantics (e.g., generalizing from *forward* to *backward* action prediction as seen in Figure 12)? This requires explaining the policy's mechanism for understanding and decoupling non-object-related semantics in the language instruction.\n2. Precise Role of Language Embedding in Feature Aggregation: The paper states that the \"semantic embedding of the task-critical part name\" is used as the CLS token in the Transformer encoder to guide aggregation. Concurrently, Language Instruction is shown as an input in Figure 2, Stage III. Please clarify which specific text input (task-critical part name vs. full language instruction) is input to the PERCEPTION part for embedding, and how it relates to the language information input to SigLip during PA3FF training.\n3. Definition of Real-World Evaluation Metrics: Table 2 reports Train/Test success rates for real-world tasks. Given the experiment statement \"Each task is evaluated with 10 trials under randomized initial conditions\", please explicitly define: Does the Train success rate represent testing under randomized initial conditions using the exact objects and scenes used for training? And does the Test success rate represent testing under randomized initial conditions using unseen object instances or environmental changes? Clarifying these definitions is crucial for interpreting the real-world generalization performance.\n4. Feature Robustness and Cross-Topology Consistency: For the same object category with significantly different spatial morphologies, can PA3FF effectively cluster and align features? For example, regarding the faucets with topologically distinct structures shown in Figure 6, please provide a quantitative assessment of PA3FF features' cross-topology consistency/transferability between them. This is needed to more fully demonstrate the robustness limits of the part-aware features.\n5.
