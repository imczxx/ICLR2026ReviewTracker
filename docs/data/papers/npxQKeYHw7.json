An effective \"tokenization\" of behavior requires tokens to be transferable, learnable in an unsupervised manner, and short-lived to facilitate composability, akin to tokens in large-language models. Previous work has studied this problem using action quantization, sub-policies, options and skills, but no solution provides an unsupervised, task-agnostic method to discover short-lived, action-spanning behavioral tokens. We introduce an online unsupervised framework that autonomously discovers behavioral tokens via a joint entropy objective—maximizing the cumulative entropy of an overall mixture policy to ensure rich, exploratory behavior under the maximum occupancy principle, while minimizing the entropy of each component policy to enforce diversity and high specialization. We prove convergence in the tabular setting of our policy iteration algorithm, then extend to continuous control by fixing the discovered components and deploying them deterministically as quantized actions within an online optimizer to maximize reward. Experiments demonstrate that our {\\em maxi-mix-mini-com} entropy-based tokenization and action quantization provide interpretable and reusable behavioral tokens that can be sequenced to achieve competitive performance against continuous-action controllers and that largely outperform random action quantization and skill discovery methods.", "tldr": "Learn a concise, unsupervised, task-agnostic discrete vocabulary of short-lived, state-dependent behavioral tokens for continuous control so they can be composed to solve downstream tasks.", "keywords": ["Online unsupervised reinforcement learning", "Maximum‐Occupancy Principle", "Behavioral Tokenization", "Action Quantization"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fdc6e31157872f3c30cee0a983d47aae9c9b7113.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/63a64231da32304929a0a7b0bec5c6778d57e972.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors present an unsupervised method based on online RL to learn efficient tokenisation of actions in a continuous control problem, by learning a mixture policy that maximises the entropy of the actions while the sub-policies in the mixture minimise the entropy.

What does long-lived or short-lived mean, intuitively and formally? \n2. Would the objective in (2) be maximised by a uniform mixture of deterministic policies?\n3. If this is the case (and please correct me if i'm wrong), I’m not sure why this requires learning. Couldn't you construct these policies online with zero learning cost? At each step, you construct the sub-policies by as deterministic (or very low variance) actions, sequentially such that each new policy is sufficiently different from the already generated ones, and then you randomise with equal probability for the mixture.\n4. Continuing on this line, what is preventing from converging to trivial (useless) policies? How can you assure that the sub-policies learned are of any interest? A trivial solution to the objective (if I understand correctly), with e.g. 2 policies, would be each policy picks one action deterministically, and both policies are mixed with equal weights, but this is not necessarily interesting in many cases. \n5. Shouldn't the unsupervised ‘tokenisation’ be somehow linked to other policy metrics like obtained rewards? In line 193 you mention that the method leads to a compression of the actions, but can this lead to an ‘arbitrary’ compression that does not take into account rewards (and in fact it will not take them into account). So is it possible that the quantisation learned completely stops the agent from being able to get high rewards? I can think of toy examples where this would happen and i’m not convinced this does not happen in general. If this is correct, then the fact that the quantised policies work in the examples you tested is because the reward function is expressive enough, perhaps. Please correct me if I misunderstood some part.\n6. What is the intuition for the method doing much better than PPO? I would expect an unconstrained algorithm (in terms of the sub-policies) to still do better, but at a higher complexity cost."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "nEHifdFT45", "forum": "npxQKeYHw7", "replyto": "npxQKeYHw7", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14016/Reviewer_JUW5"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14016/Reviewer_JUW5"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14016/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761933114169, "cdate": 1761933114169, "tmdate": 1762924510810, "mdate": 1762924510810, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes an unsupervised method to quantize the action space to learn ‘tokens’, specialized one-step policies, which are used by downstream policies to tackle a wide range of tasks.

The proofs of Theorems 3 and 4 are comparatively straightforward, as they build directly upon the results established in [1] and [2]."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "However, the paper has three issues:\n\nAn important advantage of unsupervised behavioral tokenization is its potential to improve sample efficiency in downstream tasks. As stated in Lines 42–43, “By focusing on core representative tokens, behavioral tokenization can improve sample efficiency, accelerate convergence, and avoid wasteful exploration of irrelevant continuous actions”. However, the paper reports only the final downstream performance after 3 million training steps, without intermediate evaluations. Presenting learning curves or periodic evaluations for the proposed method and the baselines would provide clearer empirical support for this claim.\n\nThe paper does not specify how the hyperparameters were chosen for both the proposed method and the baselines. Were defaults used? If any hyperparameters were tuned, did each method get a fair opportunity to tune the same number of hyperparameters? Were hyperparameters tuned across environments?\n\nThe reported results are based on only five random seeds. Strong claims cannot be made based on such a small number. You could either increase the number of seeds, and then justify why it is sufficient, or you could aggregate across environments and only make claims at the aggregate level. You could then just show individual runs per environment, to qualitatively show behavior. \n\nFinally, though not strictly a weakness, it was unclear why the modes of the component Gaussian policies were used as discrete actions. To quote: \n“Action space is quantized using the modes of the learned component Gaussians, a method that provides the first unsupervised online AQ algorithm. Next, state-dependent quantized actions are used as discrete actions in a DQN (Mnih et al., 2013) or discrete PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). The learned components and quantization are not allowed to change during the optimization of cumulative reward using the discrete controller” \nCouldn’t the component policies themselves be considered the tokens, and DQN learn to take the action of sampling from one of the component policies? This is not obviously better, but it would be useful to discuss this choice more. \n\n(Putting Minor Points here, as there is no separate box. These are not major issues) \n1. It was not immediately clear what the state- or action-centric perspective referred to. The concept only became clear after reading Section A.1 (Lines 799–809), which appears too late in the paper. I would suggest moving parts of this explanation to the introduction for better clarity and accessibility.\n\n2.

It’d be beneficial to increase the coverage of the tested tasks. For example, more MuJoCo locomotion and navigation environments. 2) The lack of comparison to the natural, trivial uniform quantization.\n3.
