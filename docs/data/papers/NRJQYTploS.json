Existing works mostly assume clean and regular historical sequences for predicting future ones. However, real-world time series data often contain anomalous subsequences that deviate from the normal patterns of the entire series, posing challenges to accurate forecasting. In this paper, we propose RockTS, a novel end-to-end framework for robust time series forecasting based on Information Bottleneck and Optimal Transport, which integrates the detection and imputation of anomalous subsequences into the forecasting task through a unified optimization objective. RockTS first introduces a detection process for anomalous patterns based on Information Bottleneck, which compresses representations of time series while retaining the information more relevant for effective forecasting. It then imputes the detected anomalous regions with normal patterns through a novel reconstruction strategy based on Optimal Transport for forecasting. Experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that RockTS achieves superior robustness and forecasting performance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Time series forecasting"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d26deadfb20c497d19d515e81bd8ab743d18c5c9.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents RockTS, a novel, end-to-end framework designed to tackle the critical real-world problem of robust time series forecasting by jointly addressing data anomalies.

For example, the paper mentions using MSE loss, but it appears that MAE loss is used in the code.\n\n(2) There are concerns about unfair comparisons. (i) It seems that some methods' results are referenced from published papers, but most of them use MSE loss, while the authors' method uses MAE loss. (ii) Some results differ significantly from the published methods at length 512. For example, the average of 512-PatchTST-ETTh1 over four prediction lengths is 0.331 form its paper, while the authors report 0.351. \n\n(3) The baselines used are relatively old, and there is a lack of more recent baselines, such as CATS and DeformableTST. \n\n(4) The advantages on large-scale datasets such as Electricity, traffic, and weather are not obvious. For example, on traffic, it is even worse than PatchTST. Since the authors' code is mainly modified from PatchTST, this suggests that the newly added modules may be harmful for some datasets. After artificially injecting noise into the dataset, the accuracy of ROCKTS deteriorates severely compared to the original ROCKTS. If the ROCKTS modules were truly effective, such a significant deterioration should not occur. Based on the above analysis, considering that the Gumbel softmax is unstable and difficult to optimize, and there are no explicit supervision information for anomaly detection in the paper, this raises concerns about the effectiveness and generalizability of the IB-based Detector.\n\n(5) Anomaly detection is entirely unsupervised. We do not know whether the current sample contains anomalies. It is highly likely that normal patterns are mistakenly corrected. This may also be why it performs worse than the baseline model on large-scale datasets. Moreover, the current method forces the model to identify anomalies, which may not be reasonable and could lead to the risk of performance degradation.\n\n(6) In terms of efficiency, compared with patchTST, the inference overhead nearly doubled on the weather, electricity, and traffic datasets, while the accuracy remained the same or even poorer than PatchTST.
