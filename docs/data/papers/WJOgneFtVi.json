However, these tasks are often complex, involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR, a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Data Science Agent", "Large Language Models", "AI Agents"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f07f5dc7a48e9b4cb36ac99d8e41923534f9c917.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper aims to develop data science agents with LLMs. This paper proposes DS-STAR, consisting of (1) data analysis agent to provide description of the given data; (2) a planning-verification-refinement-execution pipeline to solve the problem; (3) debugging agent to debug code; (4) retriever to retrieve relevant data files.

Errors in the Judge's assessment could lead the agent down flawed iterative paths or cause it to prematurely accept sub-optimal solutions.\n\n2. Efficiency and Cost Concerns: The iterative planning and multi-step verification process (Planner $\\rightarrow$ Coder $\\rightarrow$ Judge $\\rightarrow$ Refinement) is inherently a multi-turn loop. Compared to single-shot planning or baselines that rely only on code execution success, solving a single task likely requires multiple LLM API calls. The paper must quantify the average inference time and API call count for DS-STAR and discuss the trade-offs in latency and computational cost.\n\n3. Boundary Limitations of Data Summarization: While the analysis module is designed to handle heterogeneous data, the ability of a Python script and LLM to generate an accurate and complete text summary for highly complex, large-scale, or deeply nested unstructured data remains questionable.
