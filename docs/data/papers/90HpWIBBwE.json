Ignoring such exogenous covariates can seriously degrade forecasting accuracy, especially when they signal phase changes or spikes in the target series. Most current time-series foundation models (e.g., \\texttt{Chronos}, \\texttt{Sundial}, \\texttt{TimesFM}, \\texttt{TimeMoE}, \\texttt{TimeLLM}, and \\texttt{LagLlama}) ignore exogenous covariates and make forecasts solely from the time-series history, limiting their performance. In this paper we focus on bridging this gap by developing \\texttt{ApolloPFN}, a prior-data fitted network (PFN) that is time-aware (unlike prior PFNs) and that natively incorporates exogenous covariates (unlike prior univariate forecasters). Our design introduces two major advances: (i) a synthetic data generation procedure tailored to resolve the failure modes that arise when tabular (non-temporal) PFNs are applied to time-series, and (ii) time-aware architectural modifications that embed the inductive biases needed to fully exploit the time-series context. We demonstrate that \\texttt{ApolloPFN} achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks containing \\emph{exogenous} information such as M5 and electric price forecasting.", "tldr": "Through our synthetic data generation procedure and architectural modifications we incorporate time series inductive biases to our PFN model for accurate forecasting", "keywords": ["Neural Forecasting", "Time Series", "PFN", "Zero-shot", "Foundational Model"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b1768098b95d2a5db583db8e903fcde431b98d76.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ApolloPFN, a Prior-Fitted Network (PFN) designed for zero-shot time series forecasting that incorporates exogenous covariates."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Many of the “failure mode” demonstrations (e.g., Fig. 2) rely on single illustrative examples rather than aggregated or statistically supported analyses.

Most datasets containing exogenous covariates (such as M5 and electricity price forecasting) are relatively small in scale and limited in diversity. It remains unclear how ApolloPFN would generalize to larger, more complex multivariate datasets.\n\n3. The experimental comparison includes a limited set of baselines and datasets, which makes the empirical results less solid and comprehensive.\n\n4. The proposed architectural modifications—such as the incorporation of positional embeddings and expanded attention—are relatively standard and have been widely adopted in time-series Transformer variants. As a result, the architectural novelty of ApolloPFN is somewhat limited, with the main contribution lying more in the adaptation of PFNs to temporal contexts rather than in introducing fundamentally new modeling mechanisms.\n\n5.
