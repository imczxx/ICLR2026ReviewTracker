PARR consists of three components, a rewriter LLM, a fixed sparse or dense retriever, and a reasoner LLM. The rewriter augments the query into several triplets so that the retriever can better recall necessary paths for proving the target answer. The reasoner then performs reasoning on the set of retrieved triplets and decide the final top-k answers. To finetune the rewriter, the authors dump path proofs from existing link predictors, namely NBFNet and A\\*Net, and use them to compute several minimal sets of rewritten queries as the training signal for rewriter. The reasoner is then finetuned on the output of the rewriter and the retriever to predict the final answer. For top-k supervision, the authors distill the output from NBFNet or A\\*Net to the reasoner LLM.

Instead of using LLMs to encode text features or triplets in a KG, this paper proposes a novel way to use LLMs as a reasoner over a retrieved subgraph. This potentially leverages the rule knowledge in LLMs and their ability to perform logical deduction.\n2. The framework aligns well with classical logical reasoning algorithms, where the rewriter, retriever and the reasoner correspond to backward chaining, unification and forward chaining respectively. The rewriter is responsible for recall while the reasoner is responsible for precision.\n3. PARR achieves state-of-the-art performance on all popular KGC benchmarks. The prediction steps of PARR are interpretable to human."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. PARR heavily relies on paths and predictions generated by NBFNet or its derivatives. To train PARR, it needs to first train an NBFNet and dump its path proofs for every triplet in the training set, which is very time consuming. If proofs are used in retrieval, one also needs to conduct NBFNet inference on the inductive test sets before applying PARR. As shown in Table 9, it takes 835 GPU hours (4 days on 8 H100) to finetune the reasoner LLM on YAGO3-10. This is way more costly than NBFNet or A*Net. For example, A*Net reports 20.8 min / epoch for YAGO3-10, which translates to 14 GPU hours. It’s not practical to spend 60x training time just for 3% gain in HITS@1.\n2. Since PARR requires finetuning two LLMs, it’s not clear to me whether PARR benefits from generative LLMs or just the curated training signals. For example, we may train a small Transformer model from scratch for query rewriting (similar to the LSTM used in [1]) using the same training signal. We may train a subgraph reasoner from scratch like NBFNet. Both models only require relation embeddings and don’t need language prior.\n\n[1] Yang et al.

The KGC task itself is actually a special case of KGQA where the question is explicitly given as a triple with a missing entity.\nThe idea of retrieving relevant information (e.g., path-like proofs) and using LLMs to reason over them has been explored in prior works such as RoG [1]. A similar approach, utilizing GNNs to retrieve paths and then employing LLMs to generate answers, has also been explored in the KGQA literature [2].\nTherefore, the novelty of the proposed framework in the context of KGC is somewhat limited.\nThe authors should better clarify the differences and connections between their work and prior works in KGQA, and highlight the unique contributions of PARR specifically for KGC.\n2.\tUnsatisfied Claims on Hallucination Reduction: The authors claim that PARR advances previous LLM-based methods by reducing hallucination in prediction through the use of retrieved proofs. However, the proposed rewriter is still purely based on LLMs' internal knowledge learned from training. Therefore, it still has the potential to generate hallucinated facts that do not exist in the knowledge graph. The authors should provide more empirical evidence to evaluate the rewrite results and support their claim on hallucination reduction.\n3.\tTraining Complexity: The training cost of PARR is relatively high, as it involves training LLMs on a large amount of generated data. The method needs to retrieve proofs for all triples in KGs and generate corresponding reasoning data for LLM training, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, making it less practical for large-scale KGs.\n4.\tLimited Performance and Generalizability: While the proposed framework involves heavy LLMs and training, its performance and generalizability are still limited compared to traditional KGC methods like NBFNet. For example, on FB15k-237 Hits@10, NBFNet achieves 0.599 while PARR only achieves 0.593. Moreover, the experiments in inductive settings show that PARR's performance drops significantly, indicating limited generalizability to unseen KGs.\nConsidering the proposed method is built upon the traditional KGC methods like NBFNet, it is not convincing to me that the introduction of LLMs and the complex training process is well justified, given the limited performance gains and generalizability.\n5.\tMinor Issues: The multi-answer generation setting is not reasonable. Considering the original KG contains 1-to-many relations, it is not necessary to sample top-k predictions from link predictors as ground truth answers.\n6.\tTypos and Notations: The writing and structure of the paper can be improved. There are many short sections that can be merged for better readability and flow. There are also many notation inconsistencies, e.g., using both R to denote relations and retrieved triples.\n\n[1] LUO, LINHAO, et al. \"Reasoning on Graphs: Faithful and Interpretable Large Language Model Reasoning.\" The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations.\n\n[2] Mavromatis, Costas, and George Karypis. \"Gnn-rag: Graph neural retrieval for efficient large language model reasoning on knowledge graphs.\" Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2025. 2025."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
