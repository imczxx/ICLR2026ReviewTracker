Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. \nWhile recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings.\nIn this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Spatiotemporal Forecasting", "Extreme Heavy Rain", "Video Transformer"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4a0e72d336eda2f54c8b5cfaac9894c1a9dde705.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a4e9b6278124e408036ba915284744416cac8b91.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes exPreCast, an efficient deterministic deep learning framework for short-term precipitation (nowcasting), focusing on extreme rainfall events. exPreCast is built upon the Video Swin Transformer and introduces a Cubic Dual Upsample (CDU) decoder to preserve fine radar texture and a Temporal Extractor (TE) for flexible forecasting horizons and dynamic adjustment.

Saying that, however, while the Cubic Dual Upsample Block is justified empirically in the ablation studies, it does not justify why it happens. Perhaps, one could create a link in the appendix, offering the analysis why this might lead to the improvements (if it follows from the existing literature such as Fan et al that would be also totally fine, however the justification needs to be there). This could be a theoretical justification or some additional empirical analysis which would help answer not only whether it helps but also what makes it work better. On point (2), the dataset, I would expect the authors to say whether it would be released (after careful reading I couldn't see it clearly), and put some descriptions about how this dataset is created. Now, I can only see in Appendix A that 'we first converted the radar reflectivity from dBZ to mm/h using the Marshall-Palmer Z-R relationship, Z = 200R1.6. We then report the CSI-p for thresholds p= [1,4,8,10,20,40,80]. Additionally, we applied a mask to exclude pixels outside the radar range' Maybe, comparing these statistics with the statistics of the existing datasets would be useful and would better justify this part of the contribution. \n\nI would expect the authors also to put a list of contributions in the end of the intro, that would help navigate through the methodology.\n\n\nChi-Mao Fan, Tsung-Jung Liu, and Kuan-Hsien Liu (2022).

FACL contributes significantly to texture generation and substantial forecast improvements[1]. For fairness, the authors should present a comparison between other models (e.g., SIMVP) with FACL and the proposed exPreCast, or alternatively, compare the performance of exPreCast trained with MSE loss against other models.\n\nUnfair Comparison Due to FACL in Different Forecast Durations:\nAlthough the authors claim that the CDU decoder can adapt to various forecast lengths, the use of FACL still makes comparisons across different forecast durations unfair. It becomes difficult to distinguish whether the performance gain for long-term forecasting comes from FACL or from the CDU decoder itself.\n\nLack of Discussion on the Distribution of Precipitation Events Across Datasets:\nLines 18–21 state that previous datasets are limited to a single type of precipitation event, whereas KMA balances different precipitation types. However, this claim lacks statistical support. The authors should analyze and compare the distribution of precipitation events at different thresholds across datasets.\n\nIncomplete Ablation Study on Upsampling:\nThe ablation on upsampling is only conducted on exPreCast, which is insufficient to demonstrate that upsampling is a general issue across all deterministic models. Moreover, the range of interpolation methods compared is limited—commonly used methods such as bicubic and area interpolation are missing. Exploring multiple interpolation approaches across different models would yield more valuable insights.\n\nIncomplete Visualization in Figure 6:\nFigure 6 should include all forecast frames from one hour to six hours after the first frame. Providing the complete sequence would allow reviewers to better evaluate the visual quality and temporal consistency of the generated forecasts.\n\nReference:\n[1] Fourier Amplitude and Correlation Loss: Beyond Using L2 Loss for Skillful Precipitation Nowcasting [NIPS2024]"}, "questions": {"value": "How were the samples in the KMA dataset selected and quality-controlled?\nWhat are the differences in MAE and MSE among the different models?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "qc8OsbM5df", "forum": "fDknsQhSgm", "replyto": "fDknsQhSgm", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23561/Reviewer_kH8J"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23561/Reviewer_kH8J"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23561/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762697672117, "cdate": 1762697672117, "tmdate": 1762942712363, "mdate": 1762942712363, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
