Yet prevailing practices conflate interpretability with subjective human/LLM rationales, with post-hoc visuals loosely aligned to answers, or with answer rationale consistency. These proxies are annotation-hungry, bias-prone, and crucially do not certify process verifiability: where the model looked and why it looked there. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from feedback excels at answer verifiability but offers little support for constraining the provenance of attention or penalizing visually ungrounded reasoning. We introduce REFLEX-Med, a reinforcement framework that instantiates label-free explainability through two verifiable prerequisites: (i) faithful visual grounding that is text-conditioned localization in the image, and (ii) bi-directional cross-modal provenance, that is a cycle of mutual traceability across image-text and text-text semantics. REFLEX-Med couples curriculum GRPO with two frozen rewards computed by a medical vision-language encoder: a visual fidelity reward aligning text-conditioned saliency between the model's own answer and an anchor text, and a bi-modal provenance reward enforcing image-text and text-text consistency in embedding space. Together with standard format and semantic-matching rewards, REFLEX-Med resists large VLM hallucination and attention-think drift, improving both answer quality and auditable faithfulness on unified medical reasoning (open and close-ended VQA) all without human or LLM rationale annotations.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["medical reasoning", "large vision-language models", "explainability"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4db6d8a35377ce585644a83cf546575374cb0667.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9585ed40cb1e00b6195f00fba43f819116bde7e0.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces REFLEX-Med, a RL framework designed to improve the explainability of medical VLM without relying on costly human-annotated rationales. The core idea is to instantiate \"label-free explainability\" through two verifiable prerequisites: faithful visual grounding (where the model looks) and bi-directional cross-modal provenance (why it looks there).\n\nTo achieve this, the authors propose two novel reward signals computed by a frozen, pre-trained medical VLM acting as a \"judge\":\n1.  A **Visual Fidelity Reward ($R_{VFR}$)**, which encourages the policy's attention (saliency map) to align with the attention of an \"anchor\" (ground-truth) statement.\n2.  A **Bi-modal Provenance Reward ($R_{BPR}$)**, which enforces semantic consistency in the embedding space between the model's generated answer, the anchor text, and the input image."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.  **Originality & Significance:** The paper proposes a novel and important shift in medical VLM explainability, moving from subjective (and annotation-hungry) rationales to objective, \"label-free\" verifiable criteria. The core concept of using a frozen judge to reward faithful grounding ($R_{VFR}$) and semantic provenance ($R_{BPR}$) is a creative and promising approach.\n2.  **Problem Formulation:** The work correctly identifies a critical failure mode of current VLMs (\"attention-think drift\") and proposes a concrete mechanism to penalize it. The goal of instantiating \"process verifiability\" (where and why the model looked) is highly relevant for high-stakes domains like medicine.\n3.  **Methodology:** The design of the two reward functions is intuitive and directly maps to the stated goals. Using a frozen judge to provide a stationary reward signal and prevent reward hacking is a sound design choice within an RL framework."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  **Unexplained Catastrophic Performance on PathVQA:** The most glaring weakness is the model's performance on the PathVQA dataset, as shown in Table 1. The Qwen2.5-VL (SFT) baseline achieves 87.8% (c) and 79.3% (o). In contrast, REFLEX-Med-7B scores 80.9% (closed) and a shockingly low 30.3% (o). This is a massive performance degradation on an in-domain dataset. The paper fails to acknowledge, analyze, or explain this result. This strongly suggests that the proposed reward framework may be fundamentally flawed or, at best, highly detrimental to specific modalities like pathology. This single result undermines the paper's primary claims of improving answer quality.\n2.  **Unvalidated Reward Signal Quality:** The methodology critically depends on the frozen BioMedCLIP judge providing accurate saliency maps and meaningful embeddings. The paper provides zero evidence that BioMedCLIP is a reliable judge, especially for saliency. Medical grounding models are notoriously unreliable outside of the domain they were trained on (e.g., CXR). If the judge produces low-quality masks for CT or pathology images, the $R_{VFR}$ signal is optimizing the policy for noise, which would explain the poor performance on PathVQA. The authors must validate the judge's performance before using it as a source of truth.\n3.  **Outdated and Limited Experimental Setup:**\n    * **Baselines:** The baselines are missing more recent, state-of-the-art VLM, such as those from the InternVL series or the newer Qwen-VL models and InternVL.\n    * **Judge Model:** BioMedCLIP is an outdated choice. Newer, more powerful medical foundation models (e.g., BIOMEDICA) trained on far larger and more diverse datasets exist and would almost certainly provide a more reliable reward signal.\n    * **Scale:** The experiments are limited to 3B and 7B models.\n4.  **Marginal Improvements in Ablations:** As seen in Figure 4, the improvements from adding the $R_{VFR}$ and $R_{BPR}$ rewards are often minimal. For example, in the rightmost panel (Train on X-Ray), the test accuracy on MRI for the full model is 93.0%, while the ablation (w/o R-VFR + R-BPR) is 92.7%. A 0.3% gain is not a compelling argument for the added complexity of the method, especially given the catastrophic failure on PathVQA. The low gains on MRI data also raise questions about the judge's effectiveness on this modality."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  Can you please provide a detailed explanation for the massive performance drop on the PathVQA dataset (Table 1) when applying REFLEX-Med, compared to the simple SFT baseline? Why does your method perform so much worse (87.8% -> 80.9% c, 79.3% -> 30.3% o)?\n2.  How did you validate the quality of the saliency maps generated by the frozen BioMedCLIP judge? Can you provide quantitative or qualitative evidence that these masks are accurate, especially for the non-CXR modalities (PathVQA, CT, MRI)? Is it possible that your model is simply learning to match a *bad* set of saliency maps?\n3.  The improvements in the cross-modal ablation (Figure 4) are very marginal, especially for the MRI modality (e.g., 0.3% gain in the right panel). Why do you think the gains are so small? Does this suggest the judge model is ineffective on MRI, or that the rewards themselves have limited impact?\n4.  Could you clarify if the RL implementation is online or offline?

Given that, I think I have no choice but to reject this paper. Yet, I do have some more comments about the paper's weakness, listed below.\n\n1. While the experimental results are impressive, the paper seems to overstate its contribution, from the reviewer's point of view. The paper claims the proposed method can help avoid hallucination and attention-think drift, and further improve the faithfulness of the reasoning and explainability. \n\n    However, the proposed rewards only rely on the text output (modal statement $t_1$), and it is computed via a stand-alone CLIP model. This leads to two problems: **(1)** Is the CLIP model as a judge reliable? All the proposed rewards are computed as semantic similarity in the CLIP model's embedding space, which could be error-prone from the first hand. The chosen BioMedCLIP is clearly not pre-trained for fine-grained text-image alignment, making the saliency map unreliable as well. There is also no fact-check or direct chain-of-thought quality assessment, which means the claim of avoiding hallucination is questionable. **(2)** The rewards are indirect quantities in the GRPO optimization, which means optimized rewards don't guarantee a better reasoning or explainability, but just higher semantic similarity between model output and input text-image pair. *Eventually, GRPO is optimizing the model in a direction that generates output more similar to the anchor text, rather than improving the reasoning.* This could be fine in terms of improving performance, but no proof or evaluation shows that this is helpful for explainability.\n\n2. The paper claims the proposed method is a **label-free** solution, but it is not that solid a point. Compared with all the baselines mentioned in the paper, the proposed method uses the same VQA data, where the ground-truth answer text is necessary. Of course, the proposed method does not need a fine-grained local corresponding map or heatmap, but none of the baselines or commonly used methods need these additional annotations. To better validate this point, one may want to compare with a baseline that requires such annotation.\n\n3. The proposed method also claims it can improve the visual grounding capability. However, from the limited visual example in Figure 6, it is not obvious that the model is really capable of visual grounding. Figure 3 looks nice, but it is the saliency map for the CLIP model, rather than the actual attention of the VLM. Moreover, optimizing the VFR reward only improves the quality of the saliency map, but not the internal attention of the VLM. Providing more visual examples and reasoning results could help answer this question.\n\n4. It might just be the problem of the reviewer, but it would be great if some of the points could be better clarified. For example, how is the saliency map computed? Also, it will be much easier to follow the paper if the frozen CLIP reward model could be clarified earlier in the paper, rather than just using a vague description."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can you provide some more visualization, like Figure 3 and Figure 6? The reviewer is very interested in the quality of the visual grounding for both the CLIP model and the final VLM.\n\n2. When computing the text embedding for the model output, does it include the thinking part of the output? Or is it just about the answer part? \n\n3. Also, the reviewer wonders what will happen when the question asks about questions related to global information, e.g., imaging modality, and how the grounding reward will be helpful in this case. Also, for a yes/no question, if the question itself is wrong, what will happen?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "6Fb69CzXhL", "forum": "32QQlzm9ft", "replyto": "32QQlzm9ft", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4734/Reviewer_C48v"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4734/Reviewer_C48v"], "number": 7, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4734/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762575979500, "cdate": 1762575979500, "tmdate": 1762917540837, "mdate": 1762917540837, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents an RL fine-tuning framework for medical VLMs that aims to make explanations auditable without rationale labels.

This technique has been widely used in computer vision and multi-modal learning, for instance, in Grad-CAM [1] and its variants, as well as in conditional image-text embedding networks [2]. Furthermore, the idea of \"text-visual consistency\" as a regularization or reward mechanism has been explored in prior work [3-4]. Consequently, the contribution of this component feels more like an application of existing techniques rather than a fundamental innovation.\n2. **Lack of Comparative Experiments**: The authors mention that the GRPO algorithm has already been applied to medical VQA tasks. However, the experimental comparison section lacks a direct comparison with existing GRPO-based medical VQA methods [5-7]. This makes it difficult for readers to accurately assess the true performance gain of the proposed method over the most relevant state-of-the-art work. \n3. **Clarity Issues and Lack of Symbol Definitions**: The paper's clarity suffers in several key areas. Symbols such as $y_i$, $\\pi_\\theta$, $c_i$  on page 5, lines 231-232, and $r_i$ in Equation (10) appear to be used without clear prior definition, which hinders comprehension. And Equation (8) introduces a LoopTight term, but the paper fails to explain its specific function, design rationale, or how it is utilized within the algorithm.\n4. **Insufficient Justification and Support for Reward Design**: The designed rewards, VFR and BPR, all use indicator functions. The paper claims this \"stabilizes group-standardized advantages,\" but provides no theoretical derivation or experimental evidence to support this crucial assertion. Using continuous values like IoU or cosine similarity directly as rewards is a more natural choice. And the reward design introduces several key hyperparameters ($τ_{IoU}=0.5, τ_{tt}=0.8, τ_{it}=0.5$). The paper provides no basis for selecting these specific thresholds.\n5. **Incompleteness of Ablation Studies**: The current ablation study only tests the scenario where VFR and BPR are removed simultaneously. This is insufficient for understanding the individual contribution of each reward component. A more comprehensive ablation study should include: 1) Experiments where only VFR is removed, and only BPR is removed. 2) An ablation on the choice of the \"medical judge\" model. 3) An ablation on the curriculum learning strategy.\n\n**References**:\n\n[1] Grad-cam: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization, In ICCV 2017.\n\n[2] Conditional Image-text Embedding Networks, In CVPR 2018.\n\n[3] Learning from Observer Gaze: Zero-shot Attention Prediction Oriented by Human-object Interaction Recognition, In CVPR 2024.\n\n[4] Human Attention in Visual Question Answering: Do Humans and Deep Networks Look at the Same Regions?
