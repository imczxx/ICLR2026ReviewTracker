Furthermore, the control-related cost term is a simple quadratic function. These are two significant simplifications of the cost function that are not satisfied by general MFGs.\n\nSecond, a very special dynamics model, an Euclidean spatial state space with deterministic velocity control, is considered. This imposes strong assumptions, including continuity and determinism in the state evolution and that agents have full knowledge of the dynamics. General games do not satisfy these assumptions.\n\nThird, because of the simple dynamics model considered, agents' transitions are independent of the population distribution. This significantly reduces agents' coupling and thus weakens the model's connection to the general dynamic MFG framework, where both agents' rewards and transitions depend on the population distribution.\n\nThese model considerations and simplifications make sense from the perspective of optimal transport, but they substantially limit the applicability of the proposed method to general MFGs.\n\n### The Claim of \"Simulation-Free\" and Its Benefits\n\nIt is mentioned multiple times that the proposed method is \"simulation-free\", meaning that it does not simulate a PDE/ODE system. However, the trajectories of the particles still need to be simulated according to ODE (6). I do not see the fundamental difference between these two types of \"simulation\".\n\nFurthermore, it is claimed that other deep flow methods that simulate the population struggle in high-dimensional settings. However, it is not clear to me what the benefits of a particle-based flow matching method are in this regard. Specifically, the high-dimensional nature also requires an (exponentially) large number of particle trajectories $\\{ X_{i,t_{j}}^{(k)} \\}_{i,j}^{n,m}$ to approximate the true trajectory field $X^{(k)}$.\n\n### Related Work\n\nRecognizing the challenges faced by fixed-point iteration methods, several recent works \\[1,2,3\\] also propose simple methods that eliminate the forward-backward (best-response and population simulation) structure and demonstrate better convergence properties. These works are closely related to the discussions in the paper:\n\n- They are generalized Frank–Wolfe algorithms that update parameters using first-order gradient information. Thus, these methods do not need to calculate the exact best response or the induced population at each iteration. They share the same motivation that \"when the objective changes at each step, moving toward the best response of the current step eventually leads to an MFNE\" (Lines 78–79) and that \"convergence to a fixed point can still be achieved as long as each update yields improvement with respect to the current objective\" (Lines 293–294).\n- They are truly simulation-free methods, as the population distribution is learned in a model-free manner and can be estimated from a single trajectory of a single representative agent.\n- \\[3\\] addresses continuous state–action spaces by incorporating function approximation.\n\n\\[1\\]: Angiuli, A., Fouque, J.-P., Laurière, M., 2022.

Isn’t it a soft regularization method? Do you mean that you want to constrain the next iteration to be near the current iteration?\n- It is stated that the proposed method circumvents the \"main challenge in solving MFGs … enforcing the continuity equation constraint.\" Is it because it learns a velocity field that matches the trajectories, so it automatically satisfies the continuity equation?
