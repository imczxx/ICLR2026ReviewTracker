However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.", "tldr": "We define a Riemannian metric on the noise space of diffusion models using the Jacobian of score function.

The paper should clarify why the Jacobian provides a superior geometric characterization.\n- The justification for introducing the Jacobian of the score function in defining the Riemannian metric relies heavily on the Jacobian’s spectral property observed in Ventura et al.

Since this is the main justification of the proposed metric design, the supporting experiment visualizing or quantifying the singular value distribution should be included in the main text rather than included in Appendix Fig. 8.\n- In Lines 256-258, it is commented that Stanczuk et al. (2024) demonstrated that the score function itself exhibits similar tangent/normal decomposition behavior: the inner product between the score function $s_{\\theta}(x_{t}, t)$ and a vector $v$ at $x_{t}$ is small if $v$ lies in the tangent space to the data manifold, while it is large if $v$ points in the normal direction. In that case, the benefit of using the Jacobian-based metric over its score-based variant remains unclear. The manuscript should provide either a theoretical explanation or an empirical comparison with this baseline [1].\n- Figure 8 shows that the Jacobian’s singular-value distribution depends on the noise level $t$. Quantitative analyses of how these spectral characteristics vary with $t$ and how they relate to the interpolation performance in Tables 2 and 3 would strengthen the argument.\n- The geodesic optimization in Eq.

Well-designed evaluation protocol\nThe paper addresses a long-standing challenge in diffusion-based interpolation: evaluating whether the interpolated trajectory remains semantically meaningful. I appreciate that the authors go beyond commonly reported metrics such as FID and RE, and additionally incorporate PPL and PDV to assess the smoothness and consistency of the interpolation trajectory. Furthermore, the inclusion of video frame interpolation (evaluated using MSE and LPIPS) provides a grounded and objective benchmark with clear reference frames.

Concerns regarding the use of the VAE latent space\nAll main experiments are conducted using Stable Diffusion v2.1, where diffusion operates in the compressed latent space of a VAE. This means the data manifold here is already partially shaped by the VAE encoder prior to diffusion. As a result, it is unclear whether the proposed manifold-based interpolation method fundamentally applies to diffusion models in a general sense, especially those that operate directly in pixel space or other VAEs (VA-VAE,...) or in other modalities (e.g., audio, 3D, text embeddings). The fact that interpolation at \\tau = 0.0T still works to some extent (Appendix Fig. 7) may stem from the geometric structure induced by the VAE, rather than purely from the diffusion process itself. Additional experiments on pixel-space diffusion models or non-image domains would strengthen the generality claim.\n\n2. Placement and depth of Section D.3 (Interpolations and Spectral Gaps with varying \\tau)\nThe core narrative of the paper suggests that geodesic interpolation is meaningful across timesteps. However, the empirical discussion of how the spectral structure of the Jacobian changes with \\tau appears only briefly in Appendix D.3, despite being central to the theoretical motivation. For example, the statement “As \\tau increases, more singular values approach 1.0 because injected noise thickens the manifold and makes it isotropic.” raises a substantial question: if the manifold becomes isotropic at larger noise levels, do geodesic paths cease to carry meaningful geometric information at those stages? This deserves more careful treatment, ideally with quantitative curves across varying \\tau, possibly supported by toy experiments that illustrate when and why the proposed metric is effective.\n\n3. Limited diversity in data domains and styles\nThe experiments primarily focus on natural images of faces and animals. It remains unclear how the method behaves under more complex compositions (e.g., multi-object scenes), stylized domains (e.g., cartoons, anime, drawings), or domains with high structural variation. Even brief qualitative or failure-case discussions could help clarify whether the proposed metric generalizes or whether failure modes arise from, for instance, overlapping local tangent spaces or insufficient Jacobian conditioning. Understanding such limitations would help clarify the scope of applicability.\n\n4.

If possible, please provide clarification or additional quantitative trends across different \\tau values.\n\n3.
