While these protocols promise interoperability, they also introduce new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security evaluation of A2A-MAS. We develop a taxonomy and threat model that categorize risks into supply-chain manipulations and protocol-logic weaknesses, and we detail six concrete attacks spanning all A2A stages and components with impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Building on this taxonomy, we introduce A2ASecBench, the first A2A-specific security benchmark framework capable of probing diverse and previously unexplored attack vectors. Our framework incorporates a dynamic adapter layer for deployment across heterogeneous agent stacks and downstream workloads, alongside a joint safety–utility evaluation methodology that explicitly measures the trade-off between harmlessness and helpfulness by pairing adversarial trials with benign tasks. We empirically validate our framework using official A2A Project demos across three representative high-stakes domains (travel, healthcare, and finance), demonstrating that the identified attacks are both pervasive and highly effective, consistently bypassing default safeguards. These findings highlight the urgent need for protocol-level defenses and standardized benchmarking to secure the next generation of agentic ecosystems.", "tldr": "We present the first security benchmark for agent-to-agent multi-agent systems, revealing protocol-level vulnerabilities and demonstrating effective attacks across high-stakes domains.", "keywords": ["Agent-to-agent protocol", "multi-agent systems", "security benchmark"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/44826e42b36f18fbaeb9de73cf5dc4bfbbc1709b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/855a343b5acbf76545e229a186c21ff52167d7c7.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents A2ASECBENCH, the first protocol-aware security benchmark framework for agent-to-agent multi-agent systems (A2A-MAS), which is built on a taxonomy categorizing A2A risks into supply-chain manipulations and protocol-logic weaknesses (covering six concrete attacks) and a joint safety–utility evaluation methodology; empirical validation across travel, healthcare, and finance domains shows the identified attacks are highly effective in bypassing default safeguards, highlighting the urgent need for protocol-level defenses and standardized benchmarking."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The paper pioneers a comprehensive threat taxonomy and model for A2A-MAS, categorizing risks into supply-chain manipulations and protocol-logic weaknesses while detailing six concrete attacks, which fills the gap of low-level, protocol-specific vulnerability exploration in existing LLM-MAS security research.\n- A2ASECBENCH, the first A2A-specific security benchmark framework proposed, incorporates a dynamic adapter layer for heterogeneous deployments and a joint safety–utility evaluation methodology, enabling probing of diverse unexplored attack vectors and explicit measurement of the harmlessness-helpfulness trade-off.\n- The empirical evaluation is rigorous and impactful: it tests the framework on official A2A demos across three high-stakes domains (travel, healthcare, finance), with most attacks achieving 100% success rates, clearly revealing systemic protocol-level vulnerabilities in current A2A deployments.\n- The paper provides practical and actionable insights for multiple stakeholders (agent developers, system designers, protocol researchers), such as progress-aware orchestration and verifiable capability claims, and advocates layered defenses to guide the secure design and adoption of A2A ecosystems.\n- Artifact is provided at the submission stage."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "To be honest, I am not very familiar with the A2A protocol and the formal security research of multi-agent systems. I have tried my best to understand the attack design part and believe that the theoretical design of the benchmark (A2ASECBENCH) is largely sound. However, my main considerations lie in the experimental aspect, particularly regarding the generalizability of this A2A-focused benchmark:\nAs the authors acknowledged, the evaluation of A2ASECBENCH is limited to the official implementation of the A2A protocol. This makes me question whether the benchmark’s design is sufficiently general to bring substantial contributions to the broader multi-agent security community—for example, whether its core design ideas (such as the threat taxonomy, dynamic adapter layer, or joint safety-utility evaluation) can be extended to other multi-agent collaboration frameworks beyond A2A.\nMoreover, the benchmark’s design appears to be highly coupled with the A2A protocol itself. Given that the A2A community does not seem particularly widespread yet, this coupling may restrict its application scope in practice. That said, it is worth noting that the benchmark’s design depth is relatively solid, its structured threat categorization does provide valuable insights for multi-agent security research, even if its direct applicability is currently bounded by the A2A ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, a limitation section should be presented."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the Weaknesses section, as I am not sure about the potential impact and contribution of this work to MAS Security Community.

All results are on “official A2A samples” in three domains; there’s no evidence the attacks transfer to independently built, messier A2A stacks or to agent platforms that already add extra validation. This weakens the “protocol-wide” claim. Adding at least one non-official, differently engineered MAS baseline (e.g., with custom task gating or artifact sanitization) would make the evaluation harder to dismiss.\n2. Assumptions about rendering/consumption in ATSI. The Artifact-Triggered Script Injection attack inherits XSS-like power only if the host or a downstream agent renders artifacts in a permissive way; the paper does not enumerate which of the standard A2A sample apps actually do that. A tighter analysis of artifact types vs. vulnerable renderers would help readers know when ATSI is real and when it’s theoretical. \n3. Significance tied to A2A’s adoption curve. The paper’s impact claim leans on A2A being the interoperability layer for agents, but the experiments don’t show applicability to adjacent ecosystems (OpenAI’s agent runtime, LangGraph-style planners, or in-house orchestrators).
