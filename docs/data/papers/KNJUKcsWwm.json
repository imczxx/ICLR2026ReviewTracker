Conjoint analyses typically report AMCEs by averaging over opponent attributes and thus ignore strategic interdependence. We instead learn stochastic interventions—product-of-Categorical policies over factor levels—that (i) optimize expected outcomes in an average-case setting and (ii) extend to a two-player minimax (adversarial) setting that realistically captures simultaneous strategic candidate selection. Methodologically, we derive a closed-form solution for the average-case optimizer under two-way interactions with L2 variance regularization, and provide a general gradient-based procedure for richer model classes. Uncertainty from the outcome model propagates exactly to both the optimal policy and its value via the Delta method. We further model institutional details (e.g., primaries) inside the minimax objective and introduce a data-driven measure of strategic divergence between parties. On synthetic data, we characterize sample complexity and coverage as dimensionality and n vary. On a U.S. presidential conjoint, adversarially learned policies produce equilibrium vote shares that align with historical election ranges, in stark contrast to non-adversarial (averaging) optimizers. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we release an open-source dataset of mapped historical U.S. presidential candidate features on Hugging Face (anonymous URL). Our framework connects causal policy learning with multi-agent RL in high-dimensional discrete action spaces while preserving interpretability and statistical guarantees.", "tldr": "We derive optimal stochastic interventions for conjoint experiments—incorporating adversarial, game-theoretic candidate selection—and show adversarial strategies better match historical stratgic outcomes than nonstrategic methods.", "keywords": ["Causal inference; High-dimensional treatments; Randomized experiments; Policy learning"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7729e408ffce71545bdad9c8521ef82952a8d099.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a75a7ccc68827d64922fbcfb0d8d8109e7099031.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors address the problem of identifying optimal interventions when determining the importance of different features in the selection of political candidates.

It was a fairly hard read.\nI encourage the authors to consider anchoring the paper to a topic that will be familiar to a wider part of the ICLR community, such as treatment effect estimation (which seems related, is more on the statistical inference side than the pure machine learning side and is widely known. Though other statistical topics might work too).

Should other reviewers have a more favorable impression of the paper, I would not mind its publication (assuming that more blatant things such as the formatting are resolved).\n\nRemaining minor comments (+ some typography issues):\n- Line 097: missing space after period\n- Many paragraphs somehow start with a space.
