Prior approaches to address this often rely on uniform frame sampling, query-agnostic pruning, or require costly training of dedicated compression modules. In this work, we introduce CoSeLECT, a training-free, plug-and-play, query-guided frame selection method that intelligently subsamples video frames for efficient use in MLLMs. CoSeLECT leverages two key signals: temporal redundancy, which identifies similar frame clusters, and query relevance, which selects frames based on their semantic alignment with the input query. By combining these signals through an adaptive frame selection strategy, CoSeLECT selects frames that are both diverse and highly relevant to the query, without requiring any model-specific tuning. Our results on various base MLLMs show that CoSeLECT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including trained methods like LongVU by +3.8\\% on MVBench and +0.8\\% on VideoMME.", "tldr": "Training-Free Adaptive Frame Selection to improve efficiency and accuracy of Video Large Language Models", "keywords": ["Video Language Understanding", "Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/89119ea8b50f68aa9f780d49ded8107dc2dc7780.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes CoSeLECT, a training-free adaptive frame selection method that efficiently selects the most informative frames from a large pool by combining query relevance and temporal continuity.
