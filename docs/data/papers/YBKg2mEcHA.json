With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model outputs.

The analysis in Section 5 is descriptive, identifying features of different datasets. However, the optimization method in Section 6 is built on the assumption that a \"centroid\" of syntactic patterns is “associated with higher-performing prompts”. The paper provides no experimental evidence to validate this core hypothesis—it is not demonstrated that this syntactic centroid actually correlates with better model responses.\n\n2.Lack of \"Prompt Effect\" Evaluation: As a paper analyzing datasets, its key missing piece is an evaluation of prompt effectiveness. The study remains purely descriptive, analyzing the form of prompts and presenting some statistical results, without connecting it to the quality of the output. A stronger paper would have (at minimum) sampled prompts based on the identified linguistic features (e.g., high amod frequency in medical-01 or high dobj in 1.1k-business) and measured their impact on task performance. This omission reduces the practical utility of the linguistic findings.\n\n3.Vague and Irreproducible Optimization Method: The prompt optimization method described in Section 6 is too vague to be reproducible. The paper states it takes an \"average of the high-dimensional embeddings of POS tags and dependency relations\" to define a centroid, but does not specify the embedding model, dimensionality, or averaging technique. Furthermore, it claims an LLM is \"guided to rewrite the prompt\", but the (meta) prompt or guidance mechanism used for this rewriting is not provided, making the case study in Figure 5 anecdotal rather than scientific.\n\n4.Misalignment with Main Conference Scope: The paper's core strength lies in its comprehensive data collection and detailed descriptive taxonomy (Figure 1), which are hallmarks of a strong \"Datasets and Benchmarks\" contribution. However, it struggles to present a compelling, hypothesis-driven research contribution suitable for a main conference track. The linguistic analysis (Section 5) is purely observational , and the novel \"application\" (Section 6) is presented as an underdeveloped sketch without rigorous empirical validation. As such, the work reads more like an excellent analytical report on what exists rather than a research paper proposing and validating a new method or finding that advances the state-of-the-art.

Prompting is a very important field in todays' LLM application. In Prompt Engineering of real application, the core object of interest and optimization are often in complex, thousand-token system prompt/meta-prompt or long prompts for complex task.

In fact, most of this analysis is shallow, can be quickly completed by calling existing tools (e.g., spaCy), and is largely only applicable to the short queries analyzed in the paper.\n\n2. In Section 6, the author proposes an application. However, the section is very unrigorous. \n    - The claimed effectiveness of application lack systematic experiments (only two case studies are given). There is a complete absence of systematic, quantitative experiments on any standard benchmark. No pre- and post-optimization accuracy comparisons on a validation set are reported. \n    - The section omit the details necessary for reproduce or validate the method. For instance: (a) How are the \"high-dimensional embeddings of POS tags and dependency relations\" computed? (b) What LLM was used to perform the task? \n    - Also, the syntactic-based method is only sound for the short queries discussed in the paper, while is hard to scale to real complex prompts. For example, what is the \"average syntax\" of a system prompt that defines complex logic, tools, and constraints? How can the similarity to the centroid be calculated? \n    - The method, as described by the author, use the collected datasets for defining the centroid, even without any selecting or filtering.

First, while the taxonomy is detailed, it is largely descriptive; there is no quantitative validation or inter-annotator reliability to demonstrate its robustness. Second, the “prompt optimization” approach is insufficiently evaluated—it is shown on a single illustrative case rather than through systematic benchmarking or quantitative improvements across tasks. The notion of aligning to a syntactic “centroid” is intriguing but lacks theoretical grounding or clear metrics of success (e.g., human evaluation, BLEU-based improvements, or task accuracy). Third, the linguistic analyses, though thorough, often remain surface-level: the paper shows frequency and ratio tables but stops short of statistical tests or model-based interpretations that would solidify claims about dataset similarity or diversity. In Section 5, for instance, the cosine similarity heatmap is interpreted qualitatively without quantifying variance or conducting clustering significance tests. Additionally, the 1.22 TB corpus is not clearly documented—only 129 datasets are listed, but the main text does not provide URLs, schema details, or licensing summaries beyond Appendix E.
