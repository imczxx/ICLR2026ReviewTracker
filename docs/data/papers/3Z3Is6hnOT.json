However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce Fast-dLLM, a method that incorporates a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, Fast-dLLM also proposes a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to 27.6× throughput improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.", "tldr": "Fast-dLLM boosts diffusion-based LLM inference speed by introducing block-wise KV caching and confidence-aware parallel decoding, achieving up to 27.6× throughput gains with minimal quality loss.", "keywords": ["Diffusion LLM", "efficiency"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/485ac304770cd0fd6133512f910a40ee4ecda6bb.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6afcc17e77ee247c40e21bd9d45c45ec372c4df2.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the slow inference speed of diffusion-based large language models, stemming from the lack of Key-Value (KV) cache support and quality degradation in parallel decoding.

The mechanism of 'DualCache' is not clearly explained; it is unclear how caching suffix tokens saves computation and accelerates inference. Additionally, more details on the extra memory overhead introduced by the KV cache need to be disclosed.  In addition, the paper claims that the cache update introduces “negligible overhead” in Figure 2, but it provides no concrete explanation or timing comparison. \n\n2. The novelty of the block-wise KV cache contribution is unclear. The manuscript fails to sufficiently differentiate its caching method from existing work like Block-diffusion, and the experimental section lacks relevant diffusion model baselines. \n\n3. The reported speedup ratios raise concerns about potential metric inflation. Furthermore, the datasets used are primarily focused on math and code problems, lacking experimental data on benchmarks specifically designed for evaluating inference acceleration.\n\n4. The conceptual relationship and practical distinction between threshold- and factor-based strategies are insufficiently clarified. It is unclear whether the factor-based rule is a relaxed, adaptive, or independent variant, or under which conditions one should be preferred. A clearer rationale linking these strategies would improve comprehension and applicability.\n\n5. While the paper qualitatively illustrates KV similarity, it does not provide quantitative measures showing how approximation errors change with block size, decoding length, or modality, making it difficult to assess cache mismatch risks. It would be helpful to report KV similarity decay curves across decoding steps for different block sizes and tasks, correlate these similarities with downstream task metrics (e.g., accuracy, EM, BLEU) to establish a “similarity threshold → refresh” rule.\n\n6. The assumption of a “well-defined joint PMF with self-consistent marginals” may not hold for real diffusion LLMs trained approximately. The implications of this idealization are not discussed in detail, limiting interpretability of theoretical guarantees.\n\n7. The paper does not include a comparison with autoregressive (AR) models.
