We introduce \\textbf{Meta Policy Optimization (MPO)}, a framework that addresses these challenges by integrating a meta-reward model that dynamically refines the reward model's prompt throughout training. In MPO, the meta-reward model monitors the evolving training context and continuously adjusts the reward model's prompt to maintain high alignment, providing an adaptive reward signal that resists exploitation by the policy. This meta-learning approach promotes a more stable policy optimization, and greatly reduces the need for manual reward prompt design. It yields performance on par with or better than models guided by extensively hand-crafted reward prompts. Furthermore, we show that MPO maintains its effectiveness across diverse tasks, from essay writing to mathematical reasoning, without requiring specialized reward designs. Beyond standard RLAIF, MPO's meta-learning formulation is readily extensible to higher-level alignment frameworks. Overall, this method addresses theoretical and practical challenges in reward-based RL alignment for LLMs, paving the way for more robust and adaptable alignment strategies.

Samples drawn from much earlier stages of training may not be informative, as the training context and policy behavior could have evolved significantly. Given this, it may be more effective to prioritize recent samples or those with higher estimated informativeness when updating the rubric. Such an approach could make the refinement process more adaptive to the model’s current failure modes.\n\nAs the MRM continuously evolves the reward model’s rubric, the rubric appears to become increasingly complex and fine-grained over the course of training. This process resembles inferring highly detailed reward functions that fit the observed training context but may not generalize well to unseen or downstream tasks. In light of this, it might be useful to regularize the inferred rubric, for instance, by penalizing excessive complexity or enforcing smoothness constraints, to improve generalization and stability.\n\nAnother concern is that the scoring scale of the rubric can change dynamically during training. At one point, the maximum score might be 30, whereas at a later stage it could increase to 50. This variability may lead to inconsistent reward magnitudes for the policy. To address this, it would make sense to use a normalized reward score, $s\\in [0,1]$, ensuring a consistent and comparable reward scale across training iterations.\n\nFinally, the experiments are primarily conducted on smaller models (e.g., Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct), with limited evaluation on larger LLMs due to resource constraints.

Without results on more representative models (e.g., 7B+ scale) or alternative RL algorithms (e.g., GRPO), it is unclear whether MPO’s benefits are robust or merely artifacts of a narrow setup.\n\n2. **Rubric design appears misaligned with task heterogeneity**: The paper implies that a single evolving rubric is shared across all queries within a task (e.g., all essay prompts use one rubric).  However, it is natural that different queries may require distinct evaluation criteria (e.g., creativity vs. factuality in essays). The current design risks oversimplifying the complexity of human preferences.\n\n3. **Oracle rubric and evaluation protocol lack rigor**: The “oracle” rubric is derived from 60+ PPO runs on the same small model—an ad hoc and non-standard baseline. More convincingly, the paper could compare MPO’s evolved RM against a much stronger fixed judge (e.g., Qwen-2507-235B or GPT-4o) to assess whether dynamic rubric refinement truly closes the gap with top-tier static evaluators. As it stands, the claim that MPO “surpasses human-engineered prompts” is overstated given the weak oracle baseline and reliance on GPT-4o as the sole judge (which may favor its own prompt styles)."}, "questions": {"value": "seed weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "UIRKCnN8OX", "forum": "pvdf8ED6Qb", "replyto": "pvdf8ED6Qb", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14082/Reviewer_d9Cr"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14082/Reviewer_d9Cr"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14082/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761997709223, "cdate": 1761997709223, "tmdate": 1762924560467, "mdate": 1762924560467, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Meta Policy Optimization (MPO), a novel framework that tackles two persistent challenges in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) for large language models: vulnerability to reward hacking, where models exploit flaws in the reward signal, and the heavy reliance on brittle, manual prompt engineering for reward models.
