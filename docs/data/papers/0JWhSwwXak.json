While existing methods have advanced the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\\mathbf{x})$) or discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves state-of-the-art recovery rates on the Nguyen and Feynman benchmark suites, an impressive recovery rate of 61\\% on Nguyen-12 compared to the next best 2\\%, and strong placement on the error-complexity Pareto fronts on the Feynman equations and on a subset of 57 SRBench Black-box problems. Our results demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific discovery.

The paper proposes a feedback-based operator scheduling mechanism, but the design of this mechanism seems ad-hoc, lacking sufficient explanation and theoretical depth.

While empirically effective, there is no analysis of stability (e.g., whether motif reuse can cause premature convergence).

This limitation suggests that the system still struggles with extremely deep symbolic trees.\n\n4. **Results mostly deterministic; stochastic robustness not studied.**  \n\n   All experiments (Sec. 4.1–4.4) are run with fixed hyperparameters and deterministic seeds.

It is not possible for the reader to determine the difference as it is reported now. [1] has also proved that adding or removing algorithms that are not on the Pareto front can paradoxically cause the set of Pareto-optimal algorithms to change when aggregating ranks.

Also, can the paper include the results of SymMatika against the other methods as well, I can only find the results for Operon vs SymMatika. This is easy to resolve, so in the recommendation score, I am assuming that the confidence intervals/error bars and statistical test results for the other comparisons will be added.\n\nI can’t seem to find SNIP [2] in the left of Figure 3.
