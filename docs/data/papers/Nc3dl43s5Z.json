First, we propose a hierarchical hypergraph convolution network that integrates crime data with heterogeneous contextual factors to uncover dual-specific crime patterns and their co-occurrence relations. Second, we introduce an iterative online learning strategy to address concept drift by employing frequent fine-tuning for short-term dynamics and periodic retraining for long-term shifts. \nMoreover, we adopt a Partially-Frozen LLM that leverages pre-trained sequence priors while adapting its attention mechanisms to crime-specific dependencies, enhancing spatio-temporal reasoning under sparse supervision.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that ST-HHOL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, while also providing enhanced interpretability.

Particularly noteworthy is the authors' approach to addressing concept drift through an innovative online learning mechanism that explicitly disentangles spatially invariant and temporally variant components. This separation allows the model to freeze spatial parameters (Θs) associated with crime patterns while adapting temporal parameters (Θd(t)) for co-occurrence relationships, providing a principled solution to handle both short-term fluctuations and long-term distributional shifts.\n\n2. **Novel online learning mechanism**: The paper proposes a sophisticated iterative two-phase update scheme that combines frequent fine-tuning (every τ steps) for rapid adaptation to recent fluctuations with periodic retraining (every T steps) for capturing long-term gradual shifts. This mechanism effectively addresses the non-stationary nature of crime dynamics by balancing short-term responsiveness and long-term stability, which is a significant contribution to the online learning literature in spatio-temporal forecasting.\n\n3. **Effective LLM integration strategy**: Experiments demonstrate that the Partially-Frozen LLM (PF-FFN) approach is effective in leveraging pre-trained sequence modeling priors while adapting to crime-specific dependencies. The ablation study shows that this approach achieves a better trade-off between retaining pretrained knowledge and adapting to the target domain compared to fully frozen or fully tuned alternatives.\n\n4. **Comprehensive experimental evaluation**: The experimental evaluation is thorough and well-designed, featuring 14 diverse baselines spanning traditional methods (SVM, ARIMA), spatio-temporal forecasting models (DCRNN, STGCN, AGCRN, MTGNN, GMAN), crime-specific models (DeepCrime, ST-HSL, ST-SHN), and online learning models (DLF, FSNet, OneNet).

The key innovation and contribution of this hierarchical hypergraph construction (heterogeneous G^e for crime patterns and homogeneous G^o for co-occurrence) is not very prominent considering the existing literature on hypergraph-based spatial-temporal modeling.\n\n2. **Incomplete ablation study for LLM component**: The paper lacks a complete ablation experiment that entirely removes the PF-LLM component. While the authors compare different LLM variants (FPT, No Pretrain, Full Tuning, PF-A, PF-FFN), there is no comparison with a baseline that replaces the LLM with traditional neural networks (e.g., RNN, CNN, or MLP). This makes it difficult to assess the true necessity and contribution of the LLM component to the overall performance.\n\n3. **Limited LLM baseline consideration**: The paper uses GPT-2, which has relatively low foundational performance compared to existing near-human-level language models. This raises questions about the necessity of fine-tuning such a weak model. It would be valuable to explore whether more powerful large models could achieve better results through prompt-based in-context learning rather than parameter fine-tuning, especially given the potential computational overhead of the current approach."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Given that hierarchical hypergraph approaches have been extensively studied in recent years, what specific architectural innovations or theoretical contributions distinguish your hierarchical hypergraph design from existing methods beyond the particular application to crime prediction?\n\n2. Could you provide an ablation study that completely removes the PF-LLM component and replaces it with traditional sequence modeling approaches (e.g., LSTM, GRU, or Transformer without pre-training)? This would help quantify the actual contribution of the LLM component.\n\n3. Have you considered experimenting with more recent and powerful language models? Would a comparison with prompt-based approaches using stronger LLMs (e.g., through in-context learning) provide insights into whether the fine-tuning approach is truly necessary, or if the computational cost could be better justified?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "7f47yL5znt", "forum": "Nc3dl43s5Z", "replyto": "Nc3dl43s5Z", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4693/Reviewer_pemE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4693/Reviewer_pemE"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4693/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762129745329, "cdate": 1762129745329, "tmdate": 1762917514751, "mdate": 1762917514751, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a ST-HHOL for crime prediction to tackle the insufficiency of variety, high-order dependency, and non-stationality in sparse crime records.
