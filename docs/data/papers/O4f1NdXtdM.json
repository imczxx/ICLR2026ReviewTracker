Additionally, the domain gap between high-resolution (HR) gallery\nimages and low-resolution (LR) probe images poses a significant challenge. A\nsingle feature encoder struggles to generalize effectively across both domains when\nfine-tuned on an LR dataset, and this issue is further magnified by catastrophic\nforgetting. To address these challenges, we propose FaceMoE, a novel transformer-\nbased architecture enhanced with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) design. Specifically,\nwe introduce multiple specialized feed-forward network (FFN) experts and incor-\nporate a top-k router, which dynamically assigns tokens to appropriate experts.\nThis design promotes specialization across experts for different semantic regions of\nthe face, which enables FaceMoE to perform resolution-aware feature extraction.\nMoreover, the top-krouter facilitates sparse expert activation, enabling the model\nto preserve pretrained knowledge when finetuned on a LR dataset, while increasing\nmodel capacity without proportional computational overhead. FaceMoE is trained\nwith a combined face recognition loss, router z-loss, and load balancing loss to\nensure expert specialization and stable training.

To address these issues, the paper proposes FaceMoE, a transformer-based architecture enhanced with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) design. The core method involves integrating multiple specialized feed-forward network (FFN) experts into transformer MLP layers and introducing a top-k router that dynamically assigns input tokens to k out of N experts based on input resolution, enabling resolution-aware feature extraction.\n- For validation, the authors conducted extensive experiments across some datasets using two protocols: Protocol 1 (WebFace4M pre-training → BRIAR fine-tuning, evaluating BRIAR Protocol 3.1 and IJB-S) and Protocol 2 (WebFace4M pre-training → TinyFace fine-tuning, evaluating TinyFace and HR/mixed-quality datasets).

The paper mentions failure cases on BRIAR (e.g., <8×8 pixel crops, extreme poses) but does not investigate how the MoE architecture responds to these failures—for example, whether expert activation becomes random (e.g., occluded landmark tokens misrouted to non-landmark experts) or if certain experts are deactivated. It also lacks heatmap comparisons of expert activation between successful and failed cases (e.g., Figure 6 only shows activation before/after fine-tuning, not failure vs. success). \n* 3. mplementation details specify warm-up epochs (1 for pre-training, 2 for BRIAR fine-tuning, 2/4 for TinyFace fine-tuning) and polynomial LR scheduling but do not explain how these parameters were tuned or their impact on performance.

Why is the load balancing loss (Section 53) formulated with the product of \"sum of routing probabilities (∑p_b,t,i)\" and \"sum of indicator functions (∑𝟙[i∈TopK(z_b,t)])\" instead of simpler balancing metrics (e.g., variance of expert loads)?\n- Q2. The final token output is a convex combination of k expert outputs, but the paper does not discuss how the model handles conflicts—e.g., if Expert 0 (landmark-focused) assigns high weight to a \"nose\" feature and Expert 1 (cheek-focused) assigns high weight to a \"cheek\" feature for the same token. Additionally, it does not report whether certain experts consistently dominate outputs for specific token types (e.g., 70% of landmark token weight from Expert 0). \n- Q3. How does FaceMoE perform on images with resolutions between 8×8 and 16×16 pixels (e.g., 10×10, 12×12), and does the top-k routing hyperparameter (k) need adjustment for these ultra-low scenarios? The resolution ablation study (Table B.2) only reports results for 16×16 to 96×96 pixels but ignores ultra-low resolutions (8×8, 12×12). The paper mentions <8×8 pixels as failure cases but does not address 12×12/10×10 pixels (a middle ground with potential utility). For example, would increasing k from 2 to 3 improve performance for 12×12 pixels by leveraging more expert information? \n- Q4. Does expert-specific initialization (e.g., initializing landmark-focused Expert 0 with weights from a pre-trained facial landmark detection model) improve LR adaptation speed and final performance compared to the current global initialization (WebFace4M pre-training)? The paper initializes FaceMoE globally on WebFace4M but does not explore targeted expert initialization—an approach that could accelerate semantic specialization (e.g., Expert 0 quickly focusing on landmarks).
