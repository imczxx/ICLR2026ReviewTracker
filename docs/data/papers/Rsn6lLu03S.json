However, there is currently a lack of high-quality datasets specifically designed to evaluate the ability of large multi-modal models (LMMs) to discover medical insights. In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations. Our analysis indicates that existing LMMs exhibit limited performance on MedInsightBench, which is primarily attributed to their challenges in extracting multi-step, deep insights and the absence of medical expertise. Therefore, we propose MedInsightAgent, an automated agent framework for medical data analysis, composed of three modules: Visual Root Finder, Analytical Insight Agent, and Follow-up Question Composer. Experiments on MedInsightBench highlight pervasive challenges and demonstrate that MedInsightAgent can improve the performance of general LMMs in medical data insight discovery.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Insight Discovery", "Multimodal", "Multi‑Agent Systems", "Medical Analysis"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fd638e160df48665a4e97e95cb01a2e8570a8c29.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6a38dbcf799845c8680a281debcec83f1161ed7d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MedInsightBench, a new benchmark for evaluating medical analytics agents on the ability to discover multi-step, clinically meaningful insights from multi-modal medical data (particularly pathology images and reports).

Many “ground-truth insights” (e.g., HPV/p16 status, node counts, margins, R-status, IHC panels) cannot be inferred from an H&E image alone, especially after whole-slide downsampling to PNG. In Table 7 and case studies, several insights are report-only facts. If the benchmark input at test time is Goal + Image (as Table 2 indicates), a substantial subset of ground-truth is fundamentally unanswerable from the provided modality, confounding recall/precision/F1 and making negative findings uninterpretable. Unless I missed something, the benchmark input appears to exclude the report text at evaluation time; this undermines the “multi-modal” positioning and obscures what is measurable.\n- Baseline parity is not ensured. MedInsightAgent uses an additional domain-specific image-analysis tool (PathGen-LLaVA) and web retrieval; ReAct is restricted to a computation module and web search. If multi-tool access improves performance, ReAct should be given equivalent tools to isolate the effect of the orchestration strategy rather than tool availability.\n- Limited human evaluation and unclear rigor: The paper mentions 10 human experts for 100 data points and a separate 100-sample data quality audit, but provides no inter-annotator agreement, precise scoring rubric, or confidence intervals. Claims like “strong concordance with human judgments” lack quantified evidence (e.g., Pearson/Spearman/Kendall correlations, bootstrap CIs). There is also no statistical significance testing, confidence intervals, or variance reporting across methods. Reported gains (e.g., G-Eval F1 improvements of ~0.05–0.06) may be within evaluator noise.\n- I also couldn't figure out if PathGen-LLaVA was exposed to similar TCGA distributions (potential leakage) and how cases were partitioned. There is also no compute/latency/cost reporting for the agent loops.\n- Case studies show MedInsightAgent often produces general, textbook-like statements (e.g., “perineural invasion suggests aggressive tumor”), which can inflate “novelty” under the current metric but do not demonstrate image-grounded discovery. Without human verification that each output is supported by the image at the provided resolution, improvements may reflect better phrasing rather than better clinical insight. Consequently, the conclusion that “higher F1 corresponds to greater novelty” may be an artifact of the novelty scoring pipeline rather than a real causal relation.\n- The claims “first comprehensive benchmark for medical insight discovery” and “strong concordance with human judgments” are not sufficiently supported. Prior work targets medical agents and multimodal evaluation; the novelty claim too should be carefully scoped to “pathology image insight discovery with goal/question/insight structure.”"}, "questions": {"value": "1.
