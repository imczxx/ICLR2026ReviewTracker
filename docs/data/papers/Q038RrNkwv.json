Nevertheless, this process can introduce excessively long responses that inflate inference latency and computational overhead. To address this issue, existing RL-based length control methods often incorporate fixed penalties or heuristic reward shaping to encourage outputs of a desired length. However, such strategies may misalign the optimization objective with the underlying task, resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalization across model architectures and datasets. In this work, we propose \\texttt{LACONIC}, a lightweight reinforcement learning method that enforces a target token budget during training. Specifically, we update policy models using an augmented objective that combines the task reward with a length-based cost applied only to tokens exceeding the specified budget. Furthermore, to balance brevity and task performance, the cost scale is adjusted online throughout training. This formulation directly optimizes task reward subject to an explicit token budget constraint, delivering precise and performance-preserving length control. Across mathematical reasoning models and datasets, \\texttt{LACONIC} preserves or improves \\texttt{pass@1} while reducing output length by up to 43\\%. It maintains out-of-domain performance on general knowledge and multilingual benchmarks with a 44\\% reduction in tokens. Moreover, \\texttt{LACONIC} integrates into standard RL fine-tuning with no inference changes and minimal deployment overhead.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large language model", "reinforcement learning", "constrained RL", "LLM alignment", "RL fine-tuning", "length-aware LLM"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5757df1cc1006a4658020febee21ac0ed0b81c63.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces LACONIC, a reinforcement learning (RL) method designed to control the output length of large language models (LLMs) during fine-tuning.

Previous works like Sober reasoning (https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07086) have shown that RL on small-scale models might not be reliable. Further experiments on larger and more diverse models (7B or larger) are required to ensure that the results are conclusive and transfer to real-world scales.\n- The numbers in table 1 are categorically lower than the baseline numbers reported in the Sober Reasoning paper. Since this previous work suggests that strong tuning of baselines is important for making correct claims about the gains of RL, it is imperative to follow correct baseline reporting. It would be good and important to re-evaluate all the model checkpoints in tab 1 under the fair evaluation strategy proposed by that paper to convincingly show that the results hold strongly also under fair baselining.\n- Some important baselines that also aim to shorten the response lengths are missing: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04463, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01296. This paper should either add results comparing against these baseline methods or add a discussion regarding why these baseline comparisons are not valid / required.\n- The conclusion section claims that the LACONIC method can be flexibly used across RL algorithms like PPO / GRPO etc, however the paper only shows results for GRPO.

Various problems in RL (for example, safety) involve multiple constraints. This paper effectively borrows from these approaches by formulating the length restriction as a constrained optimization problem.\n- The proposed approach results in a minor modification to the standard training process for LLMs on reasoning tasks. Empirically, it achieves marginally better or similar performance compared to its baselines, while using fewer output tokens.\n- The experiments are thorough, and the ablation studies are well-executed. The inclusion of OOD (out-of-distribution) results is a valuable addition, especially since Laconic does not suffer a significant drop in performance when evaluated on reasoning problems outside the training dataset's distribution."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The primary weakness of the paper lies in the update rule for the Lagrange multiplier proposed in Eq. 6. It is unclear how that update rule is obtained, and it does not appear to follow the standard procedure of constrained optimization, where partial derivatives of the Lagrange function are set to zero and the system of equations is solved simultaneously. Furthermore, the cost expression in Eq. 3 is unbounded, and in certain cases, it might outweigh the reward term, resulting in undesirable updates. The approach prevents the LLM from producing responses beyond the specified token budget in expectation, but it does not necessarily result in succinct responses; for instance, “what is 2+3?” could still result in an unreasonably long response that is within the token budget, which is unnecessary.\n- Another significant weakness is that the Lagrange multiplier and the token budget are prompt-agnostic. This may have an unwanted effect in cases where a longer response is required for some questions, especially when the questions are sampled from a heterogeneous mixture of datasets (also as noted above in the “what is 2+3?” example).\n- On the experimental side, the paper would benefit from including results where the Lagrange multiplier is treated as a fixed hyperparameter and found via hyperparameter tuning. Such results would help to validate the benefits of the proposed update rule. The experiments section could be further strengthened by including more baselines, including certain prompt-based baselines that instruct the LLM to produce shorter reasoning traces and responses."}, "questions": {"value": "- A surprising finding is the performance improvement on certain benchmarks when the response length is restricted, as the expectation would be to maintain the same performance or see a slight degradation. The authors should offer a hypothesis for this unexpected result.\n- The paper should also address the counterintuitive performance drop observed across all datasets when the response length is increased from 2000 to 3000 tokens. This contradicts the improvement seen from 1500 to 2000 tokens and the general intuition that a larger budget should lead to better performance. An explanation for this anomaly is needed.\n- The justification for the ceiling on the Lagrange multiplier is unclear. It appears arbitrary and lacks an obvious mathematical derivation. The authors should explain how this was determined.\n- The paper would be strengthened by a discussion on selecting an appropriate token budget, particularly for unknown tasks. The authors should elaborate on the observed effects when the budget is set either too low or too high."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ZdyeXbeiUQ", "forum": "Q038RrNkwv", "replyto": "Q038RrNkwv", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21571/Reviewer_9Fv6"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21571/Reviewer_9Fv6"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21571/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762134098529, "cdate": 1762134098529, "tmdate": 1762941839154, "mdate": 1762941839154, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
