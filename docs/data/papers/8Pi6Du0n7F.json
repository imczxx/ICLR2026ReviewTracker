Instead of training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly leveraging anchor tokens directly, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2) bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture information from the entire context.Experimental results demonstrate that SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios.

Its generation pipeline follows the prevailing setup:\n\n- one language model acts as the compression model to produce compressed tokens from a given context, and\n- a (frozen) generation model consumes those compressed tokens to generate outputs for downstream tasks.\n\nPrior approaches----ICAE, 500xCompressor, and EPL ----first **pretrain with an autoencoding (AE) objective** to reconstruct the original context from compressed tokens, then fine-tune by passing the compressed tokens to a frozen generator, optimizing the LM objective and, finally, the downstream (e.g., QA) objective. The authors argue these methods require new, randomly initialized compression tokens*whose embeddings must be trained----on top of LoRA fine-tuning of the compression model----which \"lack inherent semantic information\" and thus demand extensive AE pretraining.  \n\nSAC addresses this by selecting anchor tokens directly from the original context, removing the need for AE pretraining and retaining only LM and task-level fine-tuning. Concretely, the context is partitioned into equal-length chunks, and the **center token** of each chunk is chosen as the **anchor** (following EPL). A fixed **anchor embedding** is then added to these tokens to highlight their special role. Finally, **bidirectional attention** is enabled **only in the compression model**, allowing each anchor to aggregate information from the **entire** context; the resulting **compressed KV states**----one per anchor----serve as the compact representation passed to the generation model. In experiments, the authors use Llama-3.2-1B for both compression and generation; during training, the compression model is fine-tuned with LoRA (r=128) while the generation model remains **frozen**.\n\nTo recap, SAC's contributions are twofold:\n1. **Eliminates AE pretraining**, relying only on **LM** and **downstream (QA) fine-tuning**.  \n2. **Replaces learned compression tokens** with **semantically grounded anchor tokens** taken **from the original context**.\n\nTwo simple architectural tweaks make this effective: (i) add a dedicated **anchor embedding** to mark anchors, and (ii) apply **bidirectional attention** (in the compression model) so anchors can gather information from both preceding and succeeding tokens.\n\nEmpirically on MRQA, SAC consistently outperforms strong AE-based baselines (500xCompressor, EPL) on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, with the gap widening at higher compression ratios (e.g., 15× and 51×). The method also shows better training efficiency due to removing AE pretraining."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The critique of the AE's inefficiency is valid.\n\n2. The core idea of using in-context \"anchor tokens\" is reasonable. It simplifies the compression training process and, as the t-SNE analysis (Fig. 5) suggests, produces compressed representations that are more aligned with the original token space. \n\n3. SAC consistently outperforms baselines on MRQA, as well as during training (Appendix C trade-off curves). The fact that its performance advantage *increases* at higher compression ratios (15x, 51x) makes it more compelling. The experimental setups and compression ratios are consistent with prior works.\n\n4. Table 5 shows that adding an AE task to the SAC architecture (SAC w/ AE+LM) actually *hurts* performance compared to the LM-only (SAC) model. This provides powerful evidence for the \"AE mismatch\" theory that the authors argue for, which is quite different from what the literature used to believe.\n\n5. By removing the costly AE pretraining step, the method is inherently simpler and faster to train (as shown in Appendix B.1, Table 7)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The paper's default strategy (uniform chunking) is simple and effective. However, the ablation in Table 4 shows it performs similarly to a more complex method (Lingua-2). This suggests the selection strategy is important, but the paper stops short of exploring it deeply. \n\n2. The baselines compared in the paper seem to be a bit outdated. The paper is missing an important baseline, DAST [1], which is also chunked compression but with a dynamic token budget, achieving decent performance at a high compression ratio. \n\n3. The evaluation is performed exclusively on MRQA, a question-answering benchmark. This is a good choice, as QA is a key application. However, the paper's central critique is that the AE task is misaligned with *downstream tasks*. For a task like long-document summarization, an AE-style reconstruction objective might be *more* aligned than a QA objective. It is unclear if SAC's superiority would hold on tasks that require a more holistic understanding of the full context, rather than just extracting specific facts.\n\n4. The paper states it \"modifies the standard causal attention to a bidirectional attention mechanism.\" For clarity, it would be beneficial to explicitly state whether this bidirectional mask is applied *only* to the anchor tokens (i.e., their queries can see all keys/values) or if the entire compressor LLM (with LoRA) is run in a fully non-causal (BERT-style) mode during the compression pass.\n\n5. All experiments are conducted on a single model at a single parameter size. It does not guarantee that the performance is generalizable to other models or models with much larger scales.\n\n**Reference**:\nShaoshen Chen, Yangning Li, Zishan Xu, Yongqin Zeng, Shunlong Wu, Xinshuo Hu, Zifei Shan, Xin Su, Jiwei Tang, Yinghui Li, and Hai-Tao Zheng. 2025.

This is a significant omission that prevents a full assessment of the \"middle token\" strategy and makes it difficult to judge if the performance gain comes from a truly better mechanism or just a better-positioned token.\n2. All experiments are conducted only on QA tasks. As the authors state, the AE task deviates from \"real-world usage,\" but using only QA to represent \"real-world usage\" is far from sufficient. SAC is a lossy compression (as it discards the AE objective), making it highly likely to have overfitted to the specific patterns of QA tasks. Its performance on other long-context tasks (e.g., summarization, story generation) is unknown.\n\n3. The paper's core argument is that AE-free is better. However, the authors never test the SAC + AE combination. That is, using SAC's anchor architecture (with bidirectional attention) to simultaneously perform the downstream task and the AE reconstruction task. It is plausible that SAC + AE would have slightly lower QA performance but be more robust and general-purpose (by retaining reconstruction).
