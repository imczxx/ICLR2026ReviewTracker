With quadratic cost, the OT problem can be reframed as a stochastic control problem in which a density $\\rho_t$ evolves under a controlled velocity field $v_t$ subject to the continuity equation $\\partial_t\\rho_t + \\nabla\\cdot(\\rho_tv_t)=0$. In this work, we introduce a velocity prior into the continuity equation and derive a new Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) formulation to learn dynamical probability flows. We further extend the approach to the unbalanced setting by adding a growth term, capturing mass variation processes common in scientific domains such as cell proliferation and differentiation. Importantly, our method requires training only a single neural network to model $v_t$, without the need for a separate model for the growth term $g_t$. Finally, by decomposing the velocity field as $v_\\mathrm{total} = v_\\mathrm{prior} + v_\\mathrm{corr}$, our approach is able to capture complex transport patterns that prior methods struggle to learn due to the curl-free limitation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["optimal transport", "action matching", "hamiltonian-jacobi equation", "cell trajectory inference"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/069b2ac1bd42fe98303114ae91622ef4f71ca827.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a method called VP-HJF that incorporates a velocity prior into Hamilton– Jacobi–Bellman flows to reconstruct single-cell trajectories.

Incorporating a velocity prior to improve trajectory inference is not entirely new; see, for example, (Gu et al., ICLR 2025), which also introduces prior-guided dynamics. Also, a very relevant reference is Curl flow matching (Petrović et al., NeurIPS 2025).  I think the author missed these important references. In addition, using a single network to solve (unbalanced) OT or RUOT (regularized unbalanced optimal transport)-style problems has already been demonstrated in (Neklyudov et al., ICML 2024; Sun et al., NeurIPS 2025), which derives and employs the general HJB formulation. Combining these two ideas naturally leads to the present method, making the contribution incremental in my view.\n2. In Figure 2 (upper table), VP-HJF is reported to achieve lower total kinetic energy than OT-FM. However, its higher $W_2$ distance raises the concern that it might not have correctly mapped $\\rho_0$ --> $\\rho_1$, which could trivially explain the reduced energy. The authors should rule out this possibility. Moreover, the exact form of the velocity prior $v_{\\text{prior}}$ used in this experiment is not clearly specified.\n3.  For the synthetic Lotka–Volterra dataset, only mass error is reported, with no analysis of velocity accuracy. The ablation compares only a “Prior-only” baseline but not a “Total velocity (without prior)” counterpart. Again, the form of $v_{\\text{prior}}$ is unspecified.\n4. The paper claims that VP-HJF excels at modeling rotational flows. However, the biological datasets used—Embryoid Body (EB) and bone marrow—primarily reflect developmental and differentiation trajectories, which are largely monotonic rather than rotational. Demonstrating the method on a cell-cycle dataset with pronounced curl-like behavior (e.g., as in Curl-Flow Matching, NeurIPS 2025) would be more convincing.\n5. The synthetic ablations show VP-HJF is sensitive to the orientation of $v_{\\text{prior}}$. On real scRNA-seq data, the method uses RNA velocity as the prior, but RNA velocity is known to be noisy and sometimes reversed (Bergen et al., Molecular Systems Biology). This raises questions about robustness.

Could you also report EMD/W2 metrics and compare to other baselines in EB experiments?\n* Could you provide baseline comparison (same set of baselines as in table 2) on bone marrow single-cell data and also report EMD/W2 metrics? How do you evaluate how close to the ground truth the learnt growth dynamics (shown in figure 3) is?\n* It would be very interesting to see some robustness analysis of the proposed method further tested in a toy setting. I wonder if authors tried running a simple case of velocity-prior applied in classic OT-CFM [2] or SF2M [3] matching setting with balanced-distribution transport and with sliced Wasserstein objective. Does this still allow you to learn cyclical patterns? In the balanced toy experiments where I assume Action Matching without unbalanced transport is used as an FM algorithm, have you tested this in a toy setting where $\\mu_0 = \\mu_1$ to show whether model can learn fully cyclical trajectories under $\\omega=const$ rotational field?\n* Line 258 mentions work by Sun et al (2025) [4] which also uses single network to train velocity field and growth dynamics. Could you expand this comparison and explain in which cases VRUOT would fail due to the lack of velocity priors? As mentioned above, it would be great to include empirical comparison across SW/EMD/W2 as well as computational cost on EB and bone marrow examples, if possible.\n* Are the weights in lines 174 to 180 same as weights in line 161? If not it would be good to add different notation to separate them. How does importance reweighting depend on the choice of temperature $\\tau$? It would be good to provide an ablation study.\n* Could you provide a further commentary on trade-off between using two separate networks used to model transport and growth? What is the guarantee that $s_t$ recovers correct growth dynamics in chosen experimental setting? It would be good to evaluate the quality of learnt growth dynamics in a synthetic setting and compare to baselines such as Sun et al (2025) [4]\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Petrović, Katarina, et al. \"Curly flow matching for learning non-gradient field dynamics.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2510.26645 (2025).\n\n[2] Tong, Alexander, et al. \"Improving and generalizing flow-based generative models with minibatch optimal transport.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.00482 (2023).\n\n[3] Tong, Alexander, et al. \"Simulation-free schr\\\" odinger bridges via score and flow matching.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.03672 (2023).\n\n[4] Sun, Yuhao, et al. \"Variational Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport: Single Network, Least Action.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2505.11823 (2025)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "jEpmsVn5OT", "forum": "N4ajXTx30Y", "replyto": "N4ajXTx30Y", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13960/Reviewer_C1pH"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13960/Reviewer_C1pH"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13960/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762152057548, "cdate": 1762152057548, "tmdate": 1762924461306, "mdate": 1762924461306, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
