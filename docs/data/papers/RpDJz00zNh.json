However, a critical issue is their tendency to produce excessively verbose reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting learnable hints (manually designed or learned on concise data) during the generation of the reasoning. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can effectively produce concise reasoning while maintaining the performance well. Moreover, we show that ConciseHint is flexible and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods to further push the upper bound of the efficiency.", "tldr": "We propose ConciseHint which improves the efficiency of large reasoning models by injecting learnable hints during the generation of reasoning process", "keywords": ["Efficient Reasoning", "Large Reasoning Models"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/477b892156e4d533c2150533d6c20465ef66fb60.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d6149dfd227ec4240f042dd1cb6d5e428a32ee5d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes ConciseHint, a framework that improves reasoning efficiency in large reasoning models by injecting concise hints during generation rather than before reasoning or through fine-tuning.

Hyperparameter Selection and Clarity\n- The strategy for determining hint injection intensity (parameters α and β) appears ad hoc.\n- Although the paper claims that hints are “learnable,” the positions and frequencies of injection are determined through manually tuned hyperparameters rather than learned mechanisms.\n- The description of α and β is confusing and inconsistent. For example, the paper suggests α should be “small,” yet sets α = 128 without clarifying what range is considered small or providing sufficient justification through sensitivity analysis\n\n2. Overreliance on Hyperparameters\n- The effectiveness of ConciseHint heavily depends on α, β, and γ, which undermines its claim of adaptivity.\n- The framework’s practicality is limited without a clear or automated method for selecting these hyperparameters. This raises concerns about reproducibility and robustness across unseen models. Obviously, the current hyperparameter settings are good for Qwen family models, but not as significantly effective in DeepSeek models.\n\n3. Incomplete Experimental Coverage\n- The comparison with baselines is uneven across models. For instance, Qwen3-4B includes BeConcise and other baselines, but DeepSeek-R1-14B results omit some of these. \n- It is unclear why BeConcise or similar prompting-based baselines cannot be combined with ConciseHint for stronger comparisons. These inconsistencies suggest the experiments are not yet fully comprehensive or standardized.\n\n4. Overclaim on Reasoning\n- The evaluation focuses primarily on math and physics QA datasets (GSM8K, AIME24, GPQA-Diamond). Such domains do not represent general reasoning; broader evaluations on coding, commonsense, or multimodal reasoning datasets are needed.\n- As a result, the paper’s claim of improving “reasoning efficiency” in general is somewhat overstated.\n\n5. Trade-off Between Accuracy and Efficiency\n- In Table 2, performance noticeably degrades when γ increases (e.g., γ = 1), indicating potential instability or limited generalization.\n- The results reveal a clear trade-off between conciseness and accuracy, which should be analyzed more thoroughly rather than only reported. A discussion of this trade-off would help readers better understand practical deployment choices.\n\n6. Writing and Presentation Issues\n- The paper is difficult to read, with dense notation and numerous hyperparameters that could be summarized more clearly.\n- Several equations (e.g., Eq. (1)–(3)) could benefit from intuitive explanations or visual aids describing the adaptive behavior."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "0sa1pt9dNg", "forum": "RpDJz00zNh", "replyto": "RpDJz00zNh", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3760/Reviewer_PxsQ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3760/Reviewer_PxsQ"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3760/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761636651874, "cdate": 1761636651874, "tmdate": 1762916971296, "mdate": 1762916971296, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "To address the inefficiency of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) caused by verbose Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation (e.g., redundant tokens and self-checks), this paper proposes ConciseHint, an in-reasoning intervention framework.
