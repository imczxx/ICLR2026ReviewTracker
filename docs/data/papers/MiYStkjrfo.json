The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently.\nThen, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering.\nTo train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems. \nThe results indicate that our approach not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods on the considered tasks but also exhibits superior generalization to settings with an increased number of obstacles.\nCode available upon acceptance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph neural network", "Multiple scattering", "Boundary Element Method"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/962f3c496eae95e18743a375e521c49dc819a9f6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work proposes PIBNet, a method that approximates the boundary solution of the multiple scattering problem.

The problem setting is unclear. The authors cite the reference for the multiple scattering problem, but it should be clearly formulated in the paper, as it is a central problem addressed in the work.\n2. The difficulty of dealing with multiple obstacles is unclear. Since GNNs can handle arbitrary domains, there is no fundamental difficulty with multiple obstacles. There may be marginal difficulty arising from the increased complexity of the boundary, but this is not clearly stated in the paper. If the difficulty of the multiple obstacles is different from that of a complex-shaped single obstacle, it should be stated clearly, too.\n3. The novelty of the proposed approach is not clear. The paper discusses upsampling and downsampling of the graph, but the critical difference from existing research (e.g., MGKN [Li+ NeurIPS 2020]) remains unclear. The authors should clarify the shortcomings of the past approaches and the benefits of the proposed method.\n4. The presentation of the proposed method is not clear enough. The paper says “$n_c$ candidate edges are proposed,” but does not explain how. Also, the rationale for calling the edge selection strategy “physics-inspired” is unclear. In addition, the explanation of how to predict physical values in the interior is missing —an inevitable part of the prediction process. The authors should elaborate more on their method.\n5. The experimental evaluation of the method is incomplete. Since the method is based on BEM, the authors should include BEM-based methods in the baseline (e.g.,  BINN [Sun+ Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 2023] and PIBI-Nets [Nagy-Huber and Roth J. Comput. Phys. 2023]). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed graph up- and down-sampling approach, a comparison with graph-UNet approaches (e.g., MGKN [Li+ NeurIPS 2020] and Graph U-Nets [Gao and Ji ICML 2019]) should be provided. In addition, there is no baseline for classical solvers, making the practical contribution of the work unclear. Since machine learning methods involve some error, the authors should compare speed and accuracy across varying convergence thresholds and mesh resolutions with classical solvers.\n6. The analysis of the generalization experiments is weak. The proposed method has the lowest error across all obstacle settings among the baselines, but the reason the error increases with the number of obstacles is not analyzed in depth. Since the proposed method also increases error, it is not a groundbreaking technology for the multiple scattering problem, whereas the method is dedicated to that problem. The authors should clarify the cause of the increase in error and the key breakthrough of the proposed method for the problem at hand.\n\n\nMinor points:\n\n* The domain of obstacles $\\Omega$ should be a closed set because the domain for PDE $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\Omega$ should be open to have well-defined differentiation everywhere.\n* Table 2: Some decimal points are written as commas instead of periods.
