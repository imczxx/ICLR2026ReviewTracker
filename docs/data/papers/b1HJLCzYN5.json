The authors are quite loose with the definition of a pharmacophore; interpolate-integrate seems more like enforcing global similarity to the reference molecule rather than specifically matching pharmacophoric features.

Our method is a training-free, inference-time conditioning framework built on a pretrained flow-matching backbone (SemlaFlow), designed specifically for ligand-based bioisosteric design, where the goal is to preserve 3D interaction geometry while allowing flexible chemical substitution. The advantages of our approach are its simplicity, fast sampling, and its ability to operate directly on raw, possibly disconnected fragment collections. Across all tasks, we show that our fast, simple conditioning strategy produces molecules on par with, and in several cases superior to, state-of-the-art methods. \n\nIn this general response, we summarize the main revisions to the manuscript and explain how they address the key themes raised across the reviews.\n\nMain changes:\n\n1.\tImproved transparency and reporting of unfiltered distributions.\n2.\tClearer explanation of pipeline differences and baseline inconsistencies, particularly for the bioisosteric merging task.\n3.\tExpanded ablations and stability analysis for Replacement Guidance, including:\n(i) clean vs. noised fragment injection,\n(ii) the effect of different conditioning signals,\n(iii) and the effect of the number of seed fragments.\n4.\tClarified the Interpolate–Integrate mechanism, including new ablations on:\n(i) its ability to “heal” disconnected inputs,\n(ii) and the effect of seed-fragment count.\n5.\tAdded a precise definition of the pharmacophoric features used.\n6.\tAdded a ProLIF-based interaction recovery analysis for the Mpro task.\n------\n\n1. **Improved transparency and reporting of unfiltered distributions**\n\nOur focus on filtered results and top-10 performance is motivated by the goal of mimicking a realistic drug-design funnel, where the quality of the best candidates matters more than average performance.

We also revised the Baseline Methods section (Appendix F.3.1) to better explain the baseline pipelines and to emphasize that the most relevant existing approaches (MolSnapper and DiffSBDD) were originally designed for atom-preserving linker or inpainting scenarios. In the newly added Analysis of Conditioning Behavior section (Appendix F.3.4), we show that when these methods are given an input that is not a physically valid molecule (e.g., an abstract pharmacophore profile), they attempt to preserve every atom exactly. This over-constrains the geometry and results in disconnected, distorted, or otherwise invalid structures (as illustrated in Figure 14). This analysis underscores the need for methods capable of handling abstract or partially specified structural constraints.

Theoretical Justification and Ablation for Replacement Guidance**\n\nI wonder the theoretical justification for the Replacement Guidance. As I understand it, the method control the ODE process by replacing a portion of the state $x_t$ with a clean fragment structure $x_{frag}$ at each step.This creates a partially 'clean', out-of-distribution (OOD) state that the SemlaFlow model never encountered during its unconditional training (which only included fully noised states). It would be helpful if the authors could elaborate on why this OOD state manipulation is effective and preferable to using a noised fragment $x_{frag; t}$ (which would be in-distribution).\n\nFurthermore, I am curious if the authors have explored the alternative of applying guidance to the self-conditioning term $\\hat{x_1}$ rather than manipulating the state $x_t$. \n\nThe paper would be significantly strengthened by including ablation studies on these design choices (e.g., clean vs. noised fragment injection, state $x_t$ vs. prediction $\\hat{x_1}$ manipulation).\n\n**2. Omission of Related Work on Bioisosteric Design**\n\nThe related work section provides a good overview of 3D conditional and inference-time methods, but it appears to overlook a relevant line of research focused specifically on fragment-based bioisosteric design and editing [1, 2]. While these methods may differ in their approach (e.g., 2D graph-based vs. 3D-native), they address the same core task. Including them would provide readers with a more complete context of the bioisosteric design field, even if direct experimental comparison is not the focus.\n\n**3. Limited Scope of Property Optimization**\n\nThe paper compellingly demonstrates control over 3D similarity and synthetic accessibility (SA score). However, bioisosteric replacement, especially in the lead optimization stage, often requires the simultaneous optimization of other key physicochemical properties (e.g., logP, TPSA, Molecular Weight) [1, 2]. It is not clear from the paper if or how the proposed conditioning strategies could be extended to incorporate guidance towards these scalar property targets. This currently limits the method's immediate applicability for multi-objective lead optimization, which is a primary use case for bioisosteric design.\n\n---\n**Reference**\n1.
