About the queries solvable by text-only LLM**\n\nI am curious why the authors do not drop VQA items that can be easily answered by a text-only LLM, which indicates that the question itself can be hacked without using the visual evidence and should not be included for VQA benchmarking. This is a common practice to avoid language shortcuts in curating VQA benchmarks [1--3].\n\n[1] MMMU-Pro: A More Robust Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark (ACL 2025)\n\n[2] PMC-VQA: Development of a large-scale medical visual question-answering dataset (Communication Medicine 2024)\n\n[3] MicroVQA: A Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark for Microscopy-Based Scientific Research (CVPR 2025)\n\n\n**2. About evaluation of medical-domain models**\n\nCurrently the benchmark only assesses general-domain MLLMs. It would provide more insights if including medical-domain [4-6] or dermatology-specialized MLLMs [7]. \n\n[4] MedGemma Technical Report (arxiv 2025)\n\n[5] HuatuoGPT-vision, towards injecting medical visual knowledge into multimodal llms at scale (EMNLP 2024)\n\n[6] GMAI-VL & GMAI-VL-5.5M: A Large Vision-Language Model and A Comprehensive Multimodal Dataset Towards General Medical AI (arxiv 2024)\n\n[7] Pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model Enhances Dermatological Diagnosis using SkinGPT-4 (Nature Communications, 2024)\n\n\n**3. About more details** \n- The paper notes large gaps in visually demanding tasks. I am wondering if there are per-ability error taxonomies for physicians versus models. That would sharpen which capabilities (e.g., boundary/size/color perception vs. region localization) most need architectural or training changes.\n- The authors mention that they use prompt tweaks for the open-ended scoring based on GPT-4 after observing disagreements (e.g., color/size strictness). This introduces circularity and instability: results hinge on a proprietary model’s behavior and prompt details. There seems no rigorous inter-rater reliability report (e.g., Cohen’s κ) between physicians and the judge-LLM. It seems that the authors did not upload the appendix; there is no content at the end of the PDF nor supplementary material.\n\n\n**4. Discussion with highly related works is missing**.

Question on the LLM-based scoring**\n\nThe use of commercial proprietary LLMs (GPT-4) might entail model/version drift risk since neither the API nor any specific snapshot is guaranteed to be available forever. Given this, I am wondering whether open-source models (e.g. Qwen series) are able to serve this and how the evaluation results will vary (e.g., will the scores differ drastically, or will there be any bias?). \n\n---\n\nMinor issues: \n- The “multiple-choice question” (selecting one single answer from multiple choices) in Line 277 seems to be “multiple-response question” (selecting all correct answers).\n- The first sentence in the Introduction section is a strong assertion (“Taking a photo and consulting multimodal large language models has become a main approach for addressing body surface health concerns”). I am not sure if this is the case for the global world. Any references/statistics to support such solution as “a main approach”?\n- Most of the references in this manuscript should use “\\citep” with parentheses to avoid confusion with the main texts.\n- In Figure 1, upper right part, “Leision Recognition” → “Lesion Recognition”."}, "questions": {"value": "Will the dataset be made publicly available?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "UWUMGmQhXp", "forum": "BYtqk6AVuL", "replyto": "BYtqk6AVuL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15645/Reviewer_UgBg"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15645/Reviewer_UgBg"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15645/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761239645265, "cdate": 1761239645265, "tmdate": 1762925904180, "mdate": 1762925904180, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MedLesionVQA, a multimodal benchmark designed to test how well AI systems can perform medical visual diagnosis for body surface conditions such as skin, oral, and nail diseases.
