This erodes trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generated image detectors that remain reliable across different generators. While recent approaches leverage diffusion denoising cues, they typically rely on single-step reconstruction errors and overlook the sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across multiple denoising steps. Instead of treating each denoising step in isolation, LATTE captures the trajectory of these representations, revealing subtle and discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Experiments on several benchmarks, such as GenImage, Chameleon, and Diffusion Forensics, show that LATTE achieves superior performance, especially in challenging cross-generator and cross-dataset scenarios, highlighting the potential of latent trajectory modeling.", "tldr": "We introduce LATTE, an approach that models the trajectory of latent representations across multiple denoising steps, to capture discriminative patterns that differentiate real from fake images.", "keywords": ["detection of diffusion generated images; latent diffusion models;"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8b531e2c12d200e056ab8ac1491c19ddd36d7626.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose LATent Trajectory Embeddings (LATTE) to tackle the problem of synthetic image detection.

The idea of using information in trajectories is not new. Consider including a discussion on the connection of this work with prior findings. For example, departure from single-step errors to exploit the multi-step nature of diffusion has been previously established in [1].\n\n2. The authors justification for the inclusion of LATTE in the overall pipeline is unclear. The ablations in Table 4 show that the LATTE features alone are not effective for the task. Instead, it is the visual backbone features that are most informative.\n\n3. Beyond improved metrics, there is little insight regarding the diffusion trajectories and how they may encode discriminative signals. The discussion and experiments here should be improved, especially since modeling trajectory evolution is advertised as one of the main contributions of the paper. The analysis in Appendix B is a good first step toward this but it is not entirely clear (e.g., see Questions 1 and 4 below) and the authors do not convincingly present arguments that motivate the trajectory analysis."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The authors model the LATTE features with five timesteps that are evenly spread across the trajectory. Is such an allocation optimal or are there regions of the trajectory that are more informative?\n\n2. It seems that most of the results emphasize performance on synthetic data while performance on real samples is omitted (e.g., Table 1, Figure 3). Could you please update your benchmarks to reflect overall performance? It is not possible to judge a binary classifier's performance based on conditional metrics.\n\n3. The authors have performed extensive experiments to find the best visual backbones and diffusion backbones. Given the thorough ablations, I am skeptical regarding methodological effectiveness: To what extent is the performance of your method attributed to the pretraining of the backbones vs. LATTE?\n\n4. Line 54: \"We hypothesize that real images, whose details and textures can lie outside the model’s learned manifold, will often produce small inconsistencies between successive denoising steps. On the contrary, fake images will follow smoother, more self-consistent trajectories aligned with the model’s generative prior\". However, Appendix B (line 900) states: \"Based on Figure 7, we observe a clear dichotomy between real and fake images across most generators. The real images follow a smooth, uniformly paced denoising trajectory, indicating that each denoising correction is modest in magnitude and spatially consistent.\"?\n\n[Minor] The paper is on synthetic image detection, consider rewording the title. For example, you also benchmark on samples from BigGAN, which I assume are ideally classified as generated in your framework.\n\n[Minor] Equation 6 does not correspond to reverse diffusion (see Algorithm 2 in DDPM paper).\n\n[1] Tracing the Roots: Leveraging Temporal Dynamics in Diffusion Trajectories for Origin Attribution, 2024"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "9o3lhZSDn9", "forum": "spq2xAdg4Z", "replyto": "spq2xAdg4Z", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3419/Reviewer_2rqs"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3419/Reviewer_2rqs"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3419/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761420245024, "cdate": 1761420245024, "tmdate": 1762916716053, "mdate": 1762916716053, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "lzAQC6hF0d", "forum": "spq2xAdg4Z", "replyto": "spq2xAdg4Z", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3419/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3419/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762984264160, "cdate": 1762984264160, "tmdate": 1762984264160, "mdate": 1762984264160, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose detecting a new method for fake image detection. The core idea is an extension of previous works which suggested that a real and fake image’s reconstruction (by the encoder + decoder) is different - the reconstruction is more accurate for fake images than for real images, a signal that can be used to detect fake images. The authors argue that simply considering the single step reconstruction misses out on other information available in the overall denoising process. Consequently, for a test image, they perform a complete forward and backward (denoising) process, and obtain the intermediate latents. These latents from different time steps are fused with visual features of the same image using attention mechanisms.

In other words, what is the conceptual issue (which is independent from empirical results) with not performing such grounding?\n\n    - Line 206 - what does it mean for the latents to be “enhanced”? \n\n    - Line 236 - What does it mean for the latents to be “enriched”?\n\n- Overall, the rationale for fusing these two modalities of data is not grounded sufficiently in some fundamental principle, and certain words that the authors have used (e.g., enhanced, enriched) seem pretty vague.\n\n- Furthermore, the analysis of the results is lacking.

It ties to the weakness mentioned above - it is not clear why the fusion is needed. Even beyond the fusion, it is not clear what additional information the latents are providing. I have already mentioned in the strengths that the usage of latents seems to be a new idea, but it is not clear what kind of information does it present the final linear classifier. Do the latents better capture the low level artifacts, or high level artifacts?\n\n    - Lines 400-401: no explanation is given for why these backbones perform better.\n\n    - It is not clear why the proposed method should be able to detect StyleGAN images (Table 3), even though that is not the main point of the proposed algorithm, since it cares only about the latents from a diffusion model?\n\n- While it will certainly be good if the authors can answer some of these questions, my objective is to point out that, right now, the paper is lacking substantial analysis of (i) the approach and (ii) results, and reads more like an idea which empirically seems to give good results. Consequently, it is not clear what the key insight the reader is supposed to get out of this work. \n\n- The proposed method is going to be computationally more expensive since it requires for each real and fake image to extract their latents at multiple time steps and also to fuse them with the visual features.

At higher noise levels, this would cause huge differences in the outputs produced by the network, hence there is a chance that this could affect the features extracted by the neural network. To clarify these doubts, the authors should present all the results as a mean/standard deviation over 10-15 evaluations. This sheds doubts upon one result (in Fig 3, training on SDv1.4 generalizes to BigGAN, but training on SDv1.5 does not). However, both of these are very similar distributions (detectors which train on one of these work on the other one).\n2. Related to above, in the Appendix A.2, why does DDIM perform so much worse than DDPM. The provided explanation of DDPM trajectories being \"richer\" than DDIM does not seem intuitive. Further explanation + additional evaluations as stated above would help alleviate these doubts.\n3. Experiment studying the importance of denoising steps, does not provide convincing evidence for the need for the whole trajectory information (which is the central claim). In Table 5 (n=1) which does not select the first timestep (most signal) achieves the lowest performance. This could suggest that in fact only the initial timesteps are useful and not the whole trajectory information. Further doubt is cast by the fact that if more 9 steps are sampled, the performance is severely affected. This seems contrary to the original hypothesis which emphasizes that extracting more information from the trajectory should help with detection. \n4. Perturbation analysis (Fig 5) should also compare with other methods (not only LARE). It is concerning that the performance drops for JPEG 50, where the image does not look overly distorted. It would be interesting to know if this method can be trained with some common post-processing operations as augmentations (would help with robustness).\n5.
