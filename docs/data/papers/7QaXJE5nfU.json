Limitations of Experimental Evidence\nThe experiments do not convincingly demonstrate that incorporating learning difficulty into contrastive learning is either sufficient or necessary for improving representation quality or model calibration. The reported gains are small, unstable across hyperparameters, and lack statistical validation, making it unclear whether the proposed mechanism—rather than confounding factors—actually drives the improvements.\n\nAccording to the authors, the ideal representation should satisfy two properties:  \n(1) positive sets encourage samples of different difficulty but the same class to cluster closely, and  \n(2) negative sets encourage samples of the same difficulty but different classes to remain apart.  \n\n**Sufficiency.**  \n* In the main results (Table 1), the reported accuracies are largely comparable across methods, and several contrastive learning baselines even underperform the simplest BERT fine-tuning baseline. This raises concerns about whether the baselines are implemented and tuned fairly, and whether the reported improvements are statistically meaningful.  \n* The paper claims significance (“SupCL-GSS improves the best baseline at *p* < 0.05 with paired *t*-test”), but it is unclear how this test was conducted. Since no standard deviations or multiple-run averages are reported, the reliability of this claim is questionable. Reporting mean ± standard deviation across multiple random seeds and showing training dynamics with confidence intervals would provide stronger evidence of stability and robustness.  \n* The hyperparameter sensitivity analysis (for $k$ and $\\tau$) appears somewhat unstable. For example, the results for $k$ show that the method performs best when $k=1$, with only small and inconsistent changes as $k$ increases.\n\n**Necessity.**  \nAlthough the authors hypothesise that aligning cross-difficulty positives and separating same-difficulty negatives improves representations, the paper does not empirically test whether these properties are *necessary* for the observed gains. For instance, the authors could have performed intervention-style analyses—systematically varying or even inverting these design choices—and observed how performance and calibration change while keeping other factors fixed. Showing a curve that reflects the effect of different levels of such interventions would also help visualise how strongly the proposed mechanism influences the outcome. Without such controlled experiments, it remains unclear whether the proposed mechanism is truly responsible for the improvements. This kind of control study is crucial for the scientific justification.\n\n\n### 2. Lack of theoretical justification\nThere are several theoretical perspectives on what constitutes a good representation in contrastive learning, such as the analysis in *Tian et al., “What Makes for Good Views for Contrastive Learning?” (NeurIPS 2020)*. Establishing a clearer connection between the authors’ notion of an “ideal representation” and this line of theoretical work would make the paper’s claims more convincing and help situate the proposed mechanism within existing understanding of contrastive objectives."}, "questions": {"value": "* The paper seems to inconsistently use `\\citep` and `\\citet` in several places (e.g., line 32).
