Spatio-temporal GNN-based models have recently gained traction for infection forecasting due to their ability to capture relations and flow between spatial regions, but most existing frameworks rely solely on spatial regions and their connections. This overlooks valuable genetic information at the case level, such as cases in one region being genetically descended from strains in another, which is essential for understanding how infectious diseases spread through epidemiological linkages beyond geography. We systemically formulate AIV forecasting problem by proposing a Bi-Layer heterogeneous graph fUsion pipEline (BLUE). This pipeline integrates genetic, spatial, and ecological data to achieve highly accurate outbreak forecasting. It 1) defines heterogeneous graphs from multiple information sources and multiple layers, 2) smooths across relation types, 3) performs fusion while retaining structural patterns, and 4) predicts future outbreaks via an autoregressive graph sequence model that captures transmission dynamics over time. To facilitate further research, we release the \\textbf{Avian-US} dataset, the dataset for avian influenza outbreak forecasting in the United States, incorporating genetic, spatial, and ecological data across locations. BLUE achieves superior performance over existing baselines, highlighting the value of incorporating multi-layer information into infectious disease forecasting.\n    The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BLUE-60F8/README.md.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multi-layer graphs", "Heterogeneous Graph Network", "Avian Influensa Forecasting", "Spatio-temporal Forecasting"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/174579f50f6915be6fa667cc9c883cfcce589462.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents BLUE, a bi-layer heterogeneous graph fusion network for avian influenza (AIV)\noutbreak forecasting.

My main concern is that  the novelty of the proposed model  is limited. The proposed approach, which combines many existing techniques into one large system, feels more like a complex engineering integration. It lacks the simplicity and fundamental novelty typically valued by the ICLR community.\n\n2. The proposed model is overly complicated, with insufficient ablation to support each component. The BLUE pipeline combines many existing techniques (R-GCN-like smoothing, LSH sampling, attention gating, spectral loss, autoregressive decoder). The ablation study, while decent, does not disentangle these components.\n\n3. The validation on Flu-Japan data is meaningless. The second experiment, on Flu-Japan, is invalid. By simulating a uniform, homogeneous “case layer,” the authors test a model component that is completely different from what they propose. This experiment fails to validate the paper’s core thesis about fusing genetic data and should be removed or completely reframed. As the authors mention: “We first construct the location layer based on the provided adjacency matrix. Each location node is assigned features based on the reported infection counts across prefectures. To represent case-level information, we simulate case nodes and associate them with their respective infected locations.”\n\nGiven this setup, the evaluation on Flu-Japan does not test real heterogeneous data. Thus, the evaluation relies on a single synthetic dataset that does not reflect the claimed capabilities of BLUE.\n\na. What is the scientific or empirical value of testing a heterogeneous fusion model on a homogeneous, simulated dataset?\nb. How does BLUE generalize to other human epidemiological datasets (e.g., influenza-like illness or COVID-19 variants)?\nc. How is “genetic similarity” translated into edge weights—through a fixed threshold, adaptive kernel, or another method?\n\n\n4. The fusion process is unnecessarily complex (LSH sampling + attention gating + spectral regularization). Could the authors provide an ablation that isolates the contribution of the LSH and attention components? For example, what is the performance if one uses a simple k-NN graph on the fused node embeddings but keeps the spectral regularizer? This would clarify whether the complex edge-generation mechanism actually contributes to performance improvements."}, "questions": {"value": "see weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "CRroFUGN2w", "forum": "hgj1LQmD09", "replyto": "hgj1LQmD09", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11513/Reviewer_4Tc6"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11513/Reviewer_4Tc6"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11513/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762158379755, "cdate": 1762158379755, "tmdate": 1762922613413, "mdate": 1762922613413, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper formulates avian influenza forecasting problem by proposing a Bi-Layer heterogeneous graph fUsion pipEline (BLUE).
