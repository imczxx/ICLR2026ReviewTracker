Most existing XAI models assume that GNNs are well-trained and that all nodes in the graph share similar data characteristics to those used during GNN training. In real-world applications, new nodes and edges are frequently added to the input graph during testing. \nThis dynamic environment can introduce out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes, potentially undermining the reliability of XAI models.\nTo address this issue, we propose an OOD Robust Explainer (ORExplainer), a post-hoc, instance-level explanation model specifically designed to provide robust and reliable explanations in the presence of OOD nodes, noise, and outliers in graphs. \nORExplainer incorporates Energy Scores to capture structural dependencies, allowing for prioritizing in-distribution nodes while reducing the impact of OOD nodes. \nWe conduct experiments with varying types of OOD node inclusion. \nORExplainer demonstrates superior robustness of generated explanations across synthetic and real-world datasets. \nOur code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ORExplainer-C52C/.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph Neural Network", "Explainable Artificial Intelligence", "Out-of-distribution"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/27b075edd0cd790bfaaf647f416d42abbd17b9f0.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an OOD robust explainer for GNNs and introduces a WEP mechanism that suppresses unreliable OOD nodes while emphasizing in-distribution information.

While the paper identifies three types of OOD nodes in Introduction, their definitions appear somewhat overlapping, as all are described in the context of new or injected nodes. It is unclear whether these categories are mutually exclusive or represent different perspectives of the same phenomenon. Clarifying the conceptual distinctions would improve the overall clarity of the problem setup.\n\n2. The authors mention that existing explainers assume a fixed graph, but the failure modes of prior works are not clearly articulated. A deeper analysis of why such assumptions reduce robustness, and how the proposed method directly addresses these issues, would make the motivation more convincing.\n\n3. Eq(3) defines WEP as a simple average between a node’s own energy and its neighbors’ energies. However, authors did not explain why this linear diffusion operation enhances robustness, or how many propagation steps k are used.\n\n4. The theoretical derivation assumes that ID and OOD nodes have disjoint energy intervals. This assumption seems strong, and it is unclear whether it holds for real-world graphs where ID and OOD distributions may overlap.\n\n5. Theorem 5.2 sets WEP as a lazy substochastic diffusion, showing that minimizing propagated energy reduces visits to high-energy nodes. However, this finding largely restates the intuitive effect of averaging over neighbors and does not offer a deeper theoretical guarantee of robustness or faithfulness. This analysis reads more like a mathematical restatement of the mechanism than a theory.\n\n6. The experiments are conducted on small-scale datasets, which may not adequately test scalability or robustness on larger and more complex graphs. Including larger datasets would make the evaluation more convincing."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to Weaknesses part."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "VVGn6ZiWxH", "forum": "zRacQXtyHB", "replyto": "zRacQXtyHB", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10825/Reviewer_1j5A"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10825/Reviewer_1j5A"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10825/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760968598232, "cdate": 1760968598232, "tmdate": 1762922031633, "mdate": 1762922031633, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes ORExplainer, a post-hoc explanation model designed to generate robust and reliable explanations for GNNs in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes.

Writing clarity issues.\nSome expressions are grammatically or semantically unclear. For example: Line 126: should read “The graph used for explanation …” instead of the current phrasing.

Unclear generation of OOD settings.\nLines 301–307 only describe how synthetic node OOD and real-world feature OOD are generated. It remains unclear:\nHow are node OODs created in real datasets?\nHow are feature OODs constructed in synthetic datasets?\nFor synthetic “unseen-label” OOD, is the largest label simply treated as unseen?\n\nFurthermore, the experimental design is inconsistent: synthetic datasets only test structural OOD, while real datasets only test feature and unseen-label OOD. Why not evaluate all three OOD types on both domains to support the claim of general robustness?\n\n3. Questionable assumption on excluding OOD nodes.\n Lines 199–202 state that explanations should consist mainly of ID nodes, with OOD nodes excluded or down-weighted. However, this assumption may fail when OOD nodes directly cause prediction errors. In such cases, removing them may hide the model’s failure mechanism rather than provide a faithful explanation. The authors should discuss this limitation explicitly.\n\n4. Missing extension discussion.\nCould the proposed ORExplainer framework be extended to graph-level classification tasks? Since the method currently focuses on node-level explanations, a discussion of potential extensions would be valuable.\n\n5.
