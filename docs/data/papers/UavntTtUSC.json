Our analysis of Vicuna and Qwen model families reveals a key finding: a strong correlation in truthfulness scores between LLMs and their finetuned MLLMs counterparts, even when they are finetuned or probed with different modalities and datasets. \nBuilding on this findings, we propose a soft gating method using the Truthfulness score to amplify the influence of these context-truthful heads to improve the context grounding ability while preserving the contributions of other heads.\nWe validate our approach on base LLMs on HaluEval benchmark, demonstrating an improved ability for context truthful reasoning.\nWe then show that the Truthfulness scores obtained from base LLMs can be effectively transferred and applied as a soft gate to its finetuned MLLMs, demonstrating its improved performance on POPE benchmark. \nThe performance gain from this transfer is comparable to that obtained by probing the MLLMs directly, highlighting the potential for a unified approach to enhance truthfulness across an entire model family.\nOur work demonstrates a novel method for leveraging a model's inherent, inherited traits to systematically improve its truthfulness.", "tldr": "Discovering truthful model components and adjustig model for truthfulness", "keywords": ["Truthfulness", "Hallucination", "LVLM", "LLM"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/88c3528503b9090380b4bc8b88b6d4d280a79581.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a86ac61f46b3e80841e2aa1a1fea460e37585a4a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates (1) whether the truthfulness of LLM can be inherited to the MLLM, and (2) whether it is possible to design a structure that leverages the truthfulness mechanisms to improves the MLLM's downstream performance on POPE benchmark.

While the authors mention a 4:1 train/validation split for probe training and use a held-out validation set (20%) for hyperparameter tuning, it remains unclear whether Table 1 evaluates on truly independent test data or data potentially overlapping with the probe training/validation sets. \n  - In Figure 3, the evaluation results are obtained by aggregating across three benchmarks, but the paper does not specify how the aggregation is performed or provide breakdown scores for each individual benchmark.\n  - Figure 2 presents truthfulness score breakdowns for each attention head across all layers, but the heatmap format offers a low information-to-noise ratio.\n\n- The rationale and evidence should be provided to support the probing applied at the final answer token position, as it may not be the place where untruthfulness manifests.\n\n- The methodology for evaluating truthfulness inheritance in MLLMs has limitations that weaken the paper's core claims.\n  - Evaluating MLLMs' truthfulness mechanisms primarily through text-based hallucination benchmarks (HaluEval) with blank images does not provide meaningful insights into multimodal truthfulness. This evaluation setting does not reflect typical MLLM use cases, where models process informative visual content alongside text. The approach conflates text-only reasoning capabilities inherited from the base LLM with genuine multimodal grounding abilities.\n  - The observed decrease in similarity when transitioning from text-only to multimodal settings (Figure 1(b) vs. Figure 3) may actually suggest that MLLMs develop new or altered truthfulness mechanisms distinct from their LLM counterparts, contradicting the inheritance hypothesis rather than supporting it.\n  - The cross-modal similarity comparison does not constitute strong evidence for inheritance. The authors compare models trained from scratch (Mistral) with fine-tuned derivatives to demonstrate family-specific patterns, but this contrast is insufficient. Different base models trained on different datasets with different procedures naturally exhibit different internal representations. The low correlation with Mistral (≈0.02) could simply reflect differences in pre-training rather than validating that fine-tuning preserves specific functional properties. \n\n- The experimental results show marginal performance differences between intervened and non-intervened models (Table 2 and Figure 5), raising questions about the method's practical effectiveness. To establish that the intervention produces statistically significant improvements rather than noise-level fluctuations, the authors should report results from multiple runs with different random seeds and conduct appropriate statistical significance tests."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the above section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "SvasyCH57w", "forum": "UavntTtUSC", "replyto": "UavntTtUSC", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24509/Reviewer_xfE4"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24509/Reviewer_xfE4"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24509/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761985748460, "cdate": 1761985748460, "tmdate": 1762943106907, "mdate": 1762943106907, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
