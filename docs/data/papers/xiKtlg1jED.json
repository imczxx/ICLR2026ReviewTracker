Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper, we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new benchmarks for GCD.

Including a “single-part” or “foreground-only” variant in the ablation (e.g., Figure 7) would help clarify this.\n***\n\n- It would be useful to better understand how the method performs on more challenging or long-tailed datasets such as Herbarium.

Using patch tokens from foundation models to extract fine-grained features is increasingly common. The specific formulation of first and second-order correspondences is the main technical contribution, but this feels incremental.\n\n- The reliance on DINO features for correspondence labels means PartCo inherits DINO's biases and limitations. If DINO fails to capture relevant part correspondences (e.g., due to severe occlusion or unusual viewpoints), PartCo will struggle. This dependency is acknowledged in limitations but not thoroughly analyzed.\n\n- The choice of second-order correspondence is not well-justified theoretically. Why stop at second-order? Have you tried third-order or higher? Is there a principle for selecting the order, or is it empirical?\n\n- Limited analysis of failure cases or when part-level features don't help. The paper shows PartCo improves performance on average, but are there categories or scenarios where it hurts? For example, what about categories distinguished by global shape rather than local parts?\n\n- Computational cost analysis is incomplete. How much does PartCo add to training time and memory? The paper mentions it's \"lightweight\" but doesn't provide concrete numbers or scalability analysis.\n\n- The part correspondence labels are treated as pseudo-ground-truth, but their quality is not validated. How accurate are these correspondences? Some analysis comparing against manually annotated part correspondences (available in CUB) would strengthen the paper.\n\n- The paper claims part-level features help with novel category discovery, but the analysis mostly focuses on fine-grained datasets where this is intuitive. The gains on ImageNet and CIFAR are smaller, suggesting limited benefit for coarse-grained categories. This limitation deserves more discussion."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
