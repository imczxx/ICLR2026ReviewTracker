Prior work has proposed unlearning benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how learning-time encoding in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge. \nWe conduct two studies: (i) examining how paraphrased descriptions influence unlearning performance, and (ii) analyzing unlearning when multiple facts are embedded within the same training text chunk. \nOur empirical study reveals two important implications: a new perspective for interpreting unlearning performance and practical strategies for improving LLM unlearning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large language model", "unlearning"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d2ae9f9016efbea3b0baa100801fa387d2fa3c57.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the problem of knowledge unlearning in large language models (LLMs). While prior work has primarily focused on developing new methodological approaches to improve unlearning performance on public benchmarks, this paper instead investigates how the way target knowledge is encoded in the training data affects the effectiveness of unlearning. To this end, the authors consider two main experimental settings: (1) examining the effect of text paraphrasing on unlearning, and (2) examining the effect of text chunk composition on unlearning. Through a series of controlled experiments, the paper observes that models trained with paraphrased data exhibit more effective unlearning, and that isolating forget knowledge within text chunks leads to more efficient forgetting."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "* This paper approaches the unlearning problem from a perspective, analyzing how the learning-time encoding (the way target knowledge is represented and learned during training) affects the effectiveness of unlearning. The framing that \"how and what is learned determines how well it can be forgotten\" clearly distinguishes this work from prior studies focused solely on algorithmic improvements. This is a valid and valuable perspective for deepening our understanding of knowledge unlearning in LLMs.\n* The paper systematically separates and investigates three factors, text paraphrasing, chunk entanglement, and sentence isolation, to examine how each influences the difficulty of unlearning. This stepwise, controlled design provides a meaningful experimental setup for exploring the structural causes of unlearning difficulty."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* In each experimental setting (e.g., FT-Single vs FT-Unlearn-Mul), the initial learning strength of the forget and retain knowledge differs. Models trained with paraphrased data tend to encode the same facts more strongly, resulting in higher initial scores and making unlearning appear more difficult. The paper attempts to account for this difference using the Norm-AUC metric, but this measure has a structural limitation: models with higher initial scores may be disadvantaged in relative evaluation, since the same absolute decrease in score yields a smaller relative change. Consequently, Norm-AUC does not fully normalize for differences in learning intensity. It would be more appropriate to analyze unlearning difficulty using models that are fine-tuned to have comparable initial forget/retain scores.\n* The results for Problem 3 and Problem 4 appear relatively self-evident given the experimental setup. When the forget and retain sets coexist within the same chunk, unlearning naturally fails, and when they are fully separated by chunk boundaries, performance improves as gradient interference is removed. These experiments therefore confirm rather than extend what is already understood about representation entanglement in unlearning.\n* The improvement observed in Problem 5 also lacks a sufficiently clear explanation. The only difference in this setting is that facts are arranged as independent sentences rather than connected text, yet the paper provides no theoretical or quantitative justification for why this should make unlearning more effective. While the empirical trend is interesting, the causal interpretation of this result remains underdeveloped.\n* The paper evaluates only two unlearning algorithms, Gradient Ascent (GA) and Task Vector (TV). Although these represent the optimization-based and representation-editing paradigms, respectively, this scope is too narrow to support general conclusions about unlearning mechanisms. It would be beneficial to include retain-aware or preference-based algorithms (e.g., Gradient Difference, Direct Preference Optimization, etc.) that explicitly leverage retain data during optimization, as such methods may exhibit different behavior with respect to the proposed encoding effects.\n* Minor typos\n  * Line 125: paraphased -> paraphrased\n  * Line 290: only three combinations are listed"}, "questions": {"value": "* In Section 2.3, the authors justify focusing on the fine-tuning stage for studying unlearning. However, fine-tuning typically involves a much smaller and more carefully curated dataset, often with significant manual filtering. In contrast, the pretraining stage usually carries a much higher risk of including sensitive or private user data. Could the authors elaborate on why fine-tuning is considered a more realistic or representative setting for privacy-sensitive unlearning?\n* As a learning-time strategy for improving the post-hoc efficiency of unlearning, the paper proposes separating knowledge during training. However, in the Problem 5 setting, where each fact is trained as an independent sentence, might this strategy introduce side effects such as degraded fluency, loss of contextual coherence, or weaker entity-level reasoning in generated text?
