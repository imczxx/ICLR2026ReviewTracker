While many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms incorporate memory, the field lacks a universal benchmark to assess an agent's memory capabilities across diverse scenarios. This gap is particularly evident in tabletop robotic manipulation, where memory is essential for solving tasks with partial observability and ensuring robust performance, yet no standardized benchmarks exist. To address this, we introduce MIKASA (Memory-Intensive Skills Assessment Suite for Agents), a comprehensive benchmark for memory RL, with three key contributions: (1) we propose a comprehensive classification framework for memory-intensive RL tasks, (2) we collect MIKASA-Base -- a unified benchmark that enables systematic evaluation of memory-enhanced agents across diverse scenarios, and (3) we develop MIKASA-Robo -- a novel benchmark of 32 carefully designed memory-intensive tasks that assess memory capabilities in tabletop robotic manipulation.

Recognizing the absence of a standard evaluation suite for memory-based RL, especially in robotic manipulation, the authors propose a taxonomy of four memory types: object memory, spatial memory, sequential memory, and memory capacity. Building upon this taxonomy, they release two complementary components: MIKASA-Base, a consolidated collection of existing memory-intensive RL environments unified under a common API, and MIKASA-Robo, a new suite of 32 tabletop robotic manipulation tasks that require various forms of temporal and spatial memory. Experimental evaluations with online RL, offline RL, and VLAs demonstrate that current models, such as PPO-LSTM, Decision Transformer, and Octo, struggle to generalize across tasks with strong memory dependencies. The results highlight that while RL agents can perform well under full observability, their performance deteriorates sharply when memory retention is required, validating MIKASA as a rigorous benchmark for developing and assessing memory-centric RL algorithms."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper introduces a benchmark that systematically studies memory in reinforcement learning for tabletop manipulation, extending ManiSkill3 with new task variants emphasizing temporal dependency and spatial recall. The motivation is relevant and well-grounded, as memory remains a key bottleneck for long-horizon robotic reasoning. The paper provides clear organization, a well-documented codebase, and thorough evaluations across multiple RL and imitation learning baselines. By categorizing tasks based on distinct memory demands, the benchmark offers a structured framework for analyzing policy retention and forgetting behaviors. The authors also contribute useful diagnostic discussions and visualization tools for understanding agent performance over time. Overall, the work is timely and thoughtfully executed, offering a meaningful step toward standardized evaluation of memory mechanisms in robotic learning, even though its scope remains largely limited to simplified simulation settings."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "There are some weaknesses arise:\n\n1.This benchmark foucs on solving memory issuse encuntered in the table top manipulation scenarios. The benchmark is build upon maniskill3, where there is only a franka panda arm as the embodiment. And the manipulation task distribution is limited at pick-place blocks with various colors. However, in the real-world, more complex spatial resoning and operations are required. The lack of more diverse, real-world tasks and embodiments (such as retrieving a can of cola from a closed refrigerator, or a humanoid robot sequentially using both arms to assemble components collaboratively) undermines the overall contribution of this benchmark. Therefore, this benchmark can be considered merely an incremental supplement to the previous Maniskill3.\n\n2.This benchmark does not conider the sim2real gaps that encounter in the real-world deployment, even though the authors claimed that their unified framework that can enable more robust systems for real-world use. Lack of real-world performance as evidence undermines the overall contribution of this benchmark. The RL memory problems that authors analyzed occur only in simulation or also in real-world? If memory problems (such as occuled objects, spatial reasoning) also encounter in the real-world, current evidence reported in the paper is not enough to support the claim about real-world application. Although I acknowledge simplfied simulation task setup is useful for controlled testing, these settings may not capture the sensory noise, continuous dynamics, and unstructured complexity found in real robot environments.\n\n3.As this benchmark is an incremental work of maniskill3, current task distribution is limited in pick-place various blocks. However using such tasks for spatial/object evaluation is already covered in previous benchmarks, such as Ravens, LoHoRavens. Moreover, benchmark like LIBERO involve both object/spatial reasoning tasks and also include long-horizon tasks that require long-temporal dependencies, and the operated objects are more close to the real-world setting (e.g., coffee machine).  \n\n4.Although the benchmark divides tasks by memory type, the evaluation mainly reports success rates. It lacks diagnostic tools to analyze why an agent fails—whether due to perception errors, memory decay, or decision confusion. This makes it difficult to understand failure mechanisms for each memory type.\n\n5.A minor point as the paper mentions that the evaluation of models like Octo and OpenVLA was restricted due to computational constraints, and fine-tuning was minimal. This means the reported performance may not reflect their full capability, reducing the fairness and depth of comparison across architectures. More extensive large-model adaptation is needed for a complete evaluation.\n\nIn summary, while the benchmark extends ManiSkill3 with 32 tasks, its contribution to memory-intensive RL remains limited because it does not address the sim-to-real gap and relies solely on success rates without richer diagnostic metrics. Most tasks center on pick-and-place cubes. Therefore, it is unclear how this benchmark provides substantial improvement over existing RL manipulation benchmarks."}, "questions": {"value": "1.How well do the tabletop tasks in MIKASA-Robo reflect real-world robotic manipulation challenges? Since most tasks are simplified color or position memory exercises, can performance on these synthetic environments meaningfully predict how well an agent will perform in real, noisy physical settings?\n\n2.The paper proposes four memory categories (object, spatial, sequential, capacity). How are the metrics and evaluation protocols designed to isolate these different memory mechanisms? Could overlapping factors (e.g., attention or perception) interfere with measuring pure memory ability?\n\n3.MIKASA currently uses RGB and joint states for perception. Would incorporating other sensory modalities such as depth, tactile feedback, or language instructions change the evaluation of memory skills? \n\n4.Has the author considered scenarios where occlusion exists from the outset (e.g., retrieving a bottle of cola from a closed refrigerator)? Can the task be accomplished solely with RGB+joint data in such cases? Additionally, can this benchmark support extensions like dual-arm coordination for humanoid robots and other heterogeneous embodied systems? Could the authors provide a unified interface to facilitate such expansions?\n\n5.Have the authors considered adding diagnostic metrics or analyses beyond success rate, such as error decomposition or memory recall tracking, to better reveal the failure causes across different memory types?\n\n6.The evaluation of large-scale vision-language-action models like Octo and OpenVLA was limited due to computational constraints. How might more thorough fine-tuning or longer training horizons change the conclusions about these models’ memory abilities? Does the benchmark currently support scalable training for such large architectures (provide scalable dataset or distributed training)?\n\nI reserve the possibility of raising my score if the authors can adequately address all the concerns raised during the rebuttal phase."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Awc2o84fuL", "forum": "9cLPurIZMj", "replyto": "9cLPurIZMj", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25030/Reviewer_KGih"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25030/Reviewer_KGih"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25030/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761705582610, "cdate": 1761705582610, "tmdate": 1762943289335, "mdate": 1762943289335, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a comprehensive classification framework for memory-intensive RL tasks, integrating multiple previous tasks into a unified benchmark (MIKASA-Base).
