The emergence of large language model (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing LLM-based drama generation methods often result in agents that lack initiative and cannot interact with the physical scene. Furthermore, these methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These limitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time performance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent framework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple topic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent improvisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given an autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based on their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to conversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of scene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon. The change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know and care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the quality of drama performance generated by HAMLET, we designed an evaluation method to assess three primary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and interaction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can create expressive and coherent theatrical experiences.", "tldr": "Our paper introduces a system that gives AI agents their own \"minds\" to autonomously create and act out a complete, interactive drama from just a single topic.", "keywords": ["Drama generation", "Role-playing language models", "Multi-agent collaboration", "Agentic workflow", "Finetuning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bc135d152ca850e75386528d9e6c03f8d1226ba9.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces HAMLET, a multi-agent framework for AI-driven theatrical performance that integrates both offline narrative planning and online embodied improvisation.

In long-form, multi-actor scenarios, this will lead to an unacceptable increase in LLM calls and context content expansion. Meanwhile, although the paper seems to mention a Memory module (Figure 4), it is not clearly described. Most of the memory likely exists as context. As the number of actors expands, the exponentially growing actor actions and system information will quickly exceed the model's context length. This will severely limit HAMLET's scalability, running counter to the \"Live\" theatrical experience the framework aims for.\n2. Subjectivity of Evaluation: HAMLETJudge is trained on the preferences of five experts, which risks embedding a specific taste in drama into the critic model. A more detailed analysis of the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) during the dataset's creation to quantify the level of subjectivity would provide a useful reference.\n3. Insufficient analysis and evaluation of the Offline Planning stage. HAMLET's online performance entirely follows the blueprint generated in the offline planning stage. Therefore, the final performance quality heavily depends on the offline planning quality, but the paper seems to lack analysis of this stage, focusing more on the online performance part. The examples provided use well-known scenarios like Hamlet. I would like to know the robustness of the offline planning for completely new or abstract topics. More evaluation of this stage's quality would strengthen this paper.\n4. Typos: There are many grammatical errors. I will list a few. I suggest using a grammar-checking tool to correct them. \n    1.

About the memory module: Is any memory module currently incorporated into HAMLET's design? Figure 4 (regarding PAD) seems to mention it, but I am unsure if this is just an abstract concept.\n2. About the human actor: It seems that the progression of drama in HAMLET is strictly controlled by the PAD and other control modules. Does this create a phenomenon of \"over-control,\" especially for human actors? Cases 2-4 mainly consider humans acting as simple disruptors. However, in practice, a creative human might attempt to \"out-smart\" the system and drive the plot in an unexpected (but logical) direction. I would like to know if you have considered this concern and if there are any potential solutions.\n3. About Backward Planning: I would like to know how you generate a reasonable end-point at the beginning of planning if a topic is open-ended. Have you compared the quality of blueprints generated by sequential planning versus backward planning?

Undoubtedly, the paper proposes a carefully-designed multi-agent system to achieve the goal.

While the complexity is not a disadvantage, the paper doesn't include experiments to isolate and verify the role and effectiveness of each agent. For example, how does the reviewer agent work, does it improve the quality of the generated narrative? Without such ablation, the soundness of the multi-agent design are hard to assess.\n\n2. **The performance of offline planning is unclear.** The experiments assess the overall dramatic performance of one LLM-based drama (if I was wrong please correct me). These numbers can be affected by so many factors, including the quality of the narrative blueprint, which is generated by offline narrative planning. There must be a causal relationship between offline planning and the eventual performance. However, this relationship is subtle and not clear so that the evaluation cannot be post-hoc. This makes hard to judge whether the reported performance truly reflects the quality of the offline narrative planning.\n\n3. Indeed, after reading the paper, I am still confused on what an LLM-based drama exactly looks like. Is it like an animation or a text-based game? While the experiments show the effectiveness of the methods, **there is no demonstration or qualitative examples provided.** It is hard for readers to assess the real playing experience of the work.\n\n4. **The evaluation dimensions are too rough.** I can't believe \"character performance, narrative quality, and interactive experience\" are informative enough to show the performance of an LLM-based drama. There are many factors that contribute to a nice dramatic experience, for example, scenery, narrative logics, and sense of suspense. I can't find clues in the paper to show me these things.\n\n5. **The acting efficiency issue is not discussed in the paper.** To me, this is an important issue valued detailed discussion. For example, how is the latency of the online performing? Since there are four agents working collaboratively, does it meet the practical requirement of users, does the latency ensure a nice user experience?\n\n6. **The experiments can be more insightful.** From Table 1, the reasoning LLMs perform better than non-reasoning ones. It will be interesting to discuss more on this issue to provide more insights . Additionally, it will provide further insights if the authors can discuss the scaling performance of the method, like when the backbone LLM increases in size, how the performance changes as a result."}, "questions": {"value": "Covered in the last section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "nwzfb2zZ5Y", "forum": "MKwW04UHW1", "replyto": "MKwW04UHW1", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6498/Reviewer_ggC5"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6498/Reviewer_ggC5"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6498/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761970866475, "cdate": 1761970866475, "tmdate": 1762918867931, "mdate": 1762918867931, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents HAMLET, a multi-agent framework for autonomous and interactive AI-driven drama generation.
