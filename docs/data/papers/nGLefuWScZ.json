While existing methods struggle to capture both long-term dynamics and cross-channel dependencies under such irregularities, we tackle this by formulating time series forecasting as a conditional generation problem and introducing FITS, a conditional diffusion model for IMTS forecasting that leverages pseudo-future exogenous covariates. Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a novel density-aware adaptive patching scheme that generates data-driven segments with dynamic boundaries determined by the information density. This scheme overcomes the limitations of traditional fixed-length or fixed-span segmentation in preserving continuous local semantics and modeling inter-time series correlations. Second, we develop a transformer-based prior knowledge extractor that captures forward-looking covariate dependencies via a novel cross-variate attention mechanism. The transformer structure is integrated into the conditional diffusion generative process as a unified framework, enabling precise distributional forecasting for IMTS. Extensive experiments on six datasets with four evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of FITS.", "tldr": "Proposed a conditional diffusion model for IMTS forecasting that leverages pseudo-future exogenous covariates", "keywords": ["time series forecasting"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a3344b494a359cc527e4907922b09d48643eec57.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/28f210a3e7307141f7d1bb52df299bb17524c3ae.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes FITS, a conditional diffusion framework for irregularly sampled time series forecasting.
