While recent GNN-based approaches have achieved strong performance by enforcing geometric symmetries, encoding high-order features or incorporating neural-ODE mechanics, they typically depend on explicitly observed structures and inherently fail to capture the unobserved interactions that are crucial to complex physical behaviors and dynamics mechanism. In this paper, we propose PAINET, a principled SE(3)-equivariant neural architecture for learning all-pair interactions in multi-body systems. The model comprises: (1) a novel physics-inspired attention network derived from the minimization trajectory of an energy function, and (2) a parallel decoder that preserves equivariance while enabling efficient inference. \nEmpirical results on diverse real-world benchmarks, including human motion capture, molecular dynamics, and large-scale protein simulations, show that PAINET consistently outperforms recently proposed models, yielding 4.7% to 41.5% error reductions in 3D dynamics prediction with comparable computation costs in terms of time and memory.

Incomplete Theoretical Analysis​\nInsufficient explanation of the energy function’s physical meaning: While extended from Zhou et al.’s (2004) quadratic energy, its connection to real physical systems (e.g., van der Waals forces, protein hydrogen bonds) is unclear. The concavity assumption of the ρᵢⱼ function only cites Yang et al. (2021) without analyzing its validity boundaries in 3D dynamic scenarios (e.g., particle type differences, dynamic interaction changes), raising doubts about applicability in extreme cases (e.g., strong nonlinear force-driven systems).​\nThough SE(3) equivariance is fully proven, model performance under complex symmetries (e.g., mirror, scaling symmetry) common in real physics is unaddressed. Additionally, equivariance preservation of adaptive pairwise mappings Φ and Ψ in the attention network is not verified individually; while overall equivariance holds, the symmetry transfer mechanism of individual modules remains unclear.​\n2. Room for Improvement in Experimental Design​\nMolecular dynamics experiments ignore force field impacts (e.g., CHARMM, AMBER), only validating on MD17’s quantum force field, limiting generalization to classical force fields. Testing focuses on 8 common small molecules, lacking complex molecules (e.g., metal-containing molecules, polymers), restricting applicability in specialized chemical scenarios.​\nProtein simulation relies solely on Adk protein equilibrium trajectories, excluding other protein types (e.g., membrane proteins, antibodies) or non-equilibrium dynamics (e.g., protein folding, ligand binding), insufficiently evaluating performance in complex conformational changes. Multi-step prediction only tests T=5, without exploring error accumulation at longer steps (e.g., T=10, T=20), inadequately validating long-term prediction ability.\n3.
