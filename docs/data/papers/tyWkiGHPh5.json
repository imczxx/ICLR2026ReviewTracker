To address this challenge, we introduce $\\textit{latent PDE mapping}$, a technique for mapping geometry-specific partial differential equations (PDEs) to a shared latent PDE representation using the deformation gradient. We embed latent PDE mapping into the PINN framework (LPM-PINN), enabling PINNs to capture geometric variability while preserving the governing physics. This integration facilitates accurate predictions of nonlinear, time-dependent systems even in geometries well beyond the training distribution. We demonstrate LPM-PINN on a challenging nonlinear time-dependent PDE with sharp gradients, the Aliev–Panfilov model of cardiac electrophysiology, in both 2D and 3D. Our results show that LPM-PINN generalizes robustly across diverse geometries, including shapes with drastically changing boundaries. These findings establish latent PDE mapping as a promising approach for extending PINNs to applications with variable geometries and complex physics.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["physics-informed neural networks", "cardiac electrophysiology", "latent representation", "variable geometry"], "primary_area": "neurosymbolic & hybrid AI systems (physics-informed, logic & formal reasoning, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a1e6de5c2c2b9bdd74ea1b1f92cd21a8161ff5c7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "A physics-informed neural network training for partial differential equations defined on varying domains."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "- Easy to read and understand; e.g., input concatenation approach for dealing with parametric dependence.\n- An uncommon benchmark problem (Aliev--Panvilov)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Pulling back to the reference geometry is standard, not new (e.g., shell-FEM).
