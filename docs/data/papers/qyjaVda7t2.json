The paper applies the modern neural-scaling methodology to neural interatomic potentials, an important area in AI-driven chemistry.  This fills a gap for the field.\n2. The paper is well written and easy to follow."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "As the first paper (that I am aware of) to investigate the neural scaling law in the MLIP domain, I think the standard / stakes are high, and incorrect claims could lead to consequences in following model design. In this paper, the authors draw a lot of methodology directly from NLP, but I think these two fields have some fundamental differences. I found the following critical flaws in the three aspect of scaling law: Compute (1, 2, 3), Data (3, 4), and Parameters (5), and additional issues (6,7)\n1. Insufficient training / compute to claim asymptotic scaling: The scaling-law fits are based on small training budgets.  From Figure 1 and Section 4, the largest models run correspond to only \\~10^1 GPU-hours (per run) or \\~10^3 PFLOPs of compute.  This is tiny compared to typical scaling-law studies, which span orders-of-magnitude more compute (e.g. billions of tokens or thousands of TPU/GPU years). Even for MLIP training, this is too small: the eSEN small direct model is trained for around 10^5 PFLOP (80 Epochs) in OMol 4M, where the authors is training 10^3 PFLOPs on OMol 34M. That is **100x less FLOPs on 8x more data**. Moreover, each model is trained for only a single epoch through 34M samples (no repeated passes).  For neural potentials, one epoch training is extremely light: standard MLIP practice often trains tens of epochs to convergence.  The plots (e.g. Figure 1) do not show curves flattening -- the losses keep decreasing.  This suggests models are not converged even at the largest scale tried.  Fitting power laws in such a sub-convergent regime is problematic: the “effective” exponent can vary dramatically in early vs late training. In short, scaling laws are **asymptotic** statements, and here the training scale is too small to robustly infer asymptotic behavior.  This undermines the claim that explicit symmetry consistently improves scaling: with more compute, any performance gap might shrink or change.\n2. Single-epoch training regime. In Section 3.1, the authors intentionally use **only one epoch** (each sample seen once) to mirror LLM practice. However, this contradicts common MLIP training, where models typically see the data many times (e.g. \\~**80 epochs** in the OMol 4M baselines). Single-epoch training likely means none of the models fully fit the data distributions; indeed the validation losses are still dropping at the end of training. This choice can distort scaling-law estimates. For instance, early in training, increasing model size might seem more beneficial (higher \\alpha) simply because larger models learn faster per data pass, but with multi-epoch training a smaller model could catch up. By never allowing converged fits, the authors effectively inflate the “scaling advantage” of larger/equivariant models. They justify this by wanting to “avoid confounding effects”, but do not analyze how one vs multiple epochs alters the conclusions. Without at least one multi-epoch comparison, we cannot be sure the reported power-law behaviors would hold under standard MLIP training. This is a **major methodological gap**: the conclusions about scaling hinge on a very nonstandard (for this domain) training regime.\n3. Global target vs. token-wise analogy. The paper frequently draws analogies to language scaling laws, but **the supervised targets here are fundamentally different**. In language models, the loss (cross-entropy) is accumulated over **each token prediction**. Here, the primary target is the global energy of a molecule (plus per-atom forces, calculated by the gradient of the energy, thus is heavily correlated with the total energy). Each system yields **only one energy scalar despite many atoms**. The authors do treat atoms as “tokens” in counting dataset size, but this is a loose analogy: the model must capture a global property that depends on all atoms jointly. This could be a much harder task than NLP cross entropy target. Thus, as we discussed in weakness 2, seeing each atom once may not be analogous with LLM training, and the model requires much more training time to converge. As a result, statements like “we follow LLM scaling methodology” may be overreaching without addressing that molecular systems are global-structure tasks.\n4. Limited dataset regime (neutral split only). The OMol dataset is a high quality and diverse dataset, but all experiments use only the **neutral-molecule subset** of OMol (\\~34M samples), despite the full dataset being ~100M with diverse splits. This choice (claims to be taken due to memory limits, which if that's because of the system size, the authors could always decrease the batch size, since the batch size they chose was quite large (64) ) of using the neutral split, rather than **random sample**, could bias the domain. As described in the OMol paper, **non-equivariant models, such as GemNet, performs much better than equivariant models in EF error** when trained on all splits, such as biomolecules and electrolytes. This dataset selection clearly favors the equivariant baselines, and leads to a misleading or even incorrect results. I.e. the conclusions about “symmetry matters more at scale” could be dataset-specific. The authors should justify why neutral-only results would hold in the full OMol or other datasets (none of which is provided).\n5. Unfair comparison by raw parameter count. In NLP, comparing models by parameter count is largely meaningful because mainstream LLMs use a homogeneous Transformer architecture: blocks are architecturally identical, most weights live in token-wise MLPs and attention projections, and the compute per parameter and weight reuse pattern are effectively uniform across models. As a result, plotting loss vs. parameters is reasonably apples-to-apples. In contrast, **for GNN-based MLIPs the notion of “one parameter” does not carry across architectures**: (i) parameters are shared and reused across all nodes/edges; (ii) different designs incur very different work per parameter (e.g., dihedral terms in GemNet-OC, high-order tensor ops in eSEN); (iii) body order and tensor order change effective capacity and FLOP intensity; and (iv) throughput at the same N can differ drastically. This is largely why the kappa number varies between architectures. Consequently, the Fig. 5 style plots of loss vs. N conflate capacity, compute, and inductive bias, and can be misleading. A fair comparison should be iso-compute (FLOPs or GPU-hours), or at least normalized by an architecture-dependent cost.\n6. Exponent reliability and fitting issues. The fitted power-law exponents (α, β, γ) are central to the paper’s claims, but their reliability is questionable. First, as noted, the data range is relatively narrow (datasets from 10%-100%, models \\~10^6-10^7 parameters): typically one requires several orders of magnitude variation to robustly determine an exponent.  Here both N and D spans are \\~1-2 orders of magnitude at best. Second, the assumption $L_\\inf \\approx 0$ (irreducible loss) is ad hoc and may bias exponents high.  In real molecular data there should be some finite noise/error floor (analogous to the entropy in NLP); assuming zero means the model is “expected” to achieve perfect prediction eventually.  Small positive L_\\inf can drastically change a fitted β or γ in a power law fit (as studied in Hoffmann et al. 2022).  Third, Figure captions reveal instability: GemNet-OC needed smoothed loss, and the authors exclude the first 1–10% of training from fits.  These steps suggest the raw curves were not clean power laws. With such variance, the numeric exponents conflict across FLOPs vs wall-time (Fig.1).  Without error bars or fit-statistics on α,β (only γ had CIs in Table 1), it’s hard to trust these values.  In summary, the power-law behavior is claimed too strongly: given the limited and noisy regime, the reported exponents may not reflect true asymptotic trends. The results could be artifacts of the experimental choices (one-shot training, hyperparams, smoothing).\n7. Additional concerns: (i) The study considers only four architectures; it is not clear if these are representative. For example, EGNN and GemNet are relatively simple and old models -- how would a more modern one (PaiNN, DPA-1/2, EScAIP, even NequIP) behave? (ii) The paper also mixes different body-order and tensor-order notions without clarity. (iii) Hyperparameters (depth, widths) are tuned only at ~1M params and then scaled; it’s possible that later models were not fully optimized. (iv) The authors do not report if they repeated experiments to measure variability (confidence intervals are absent for N,D scaling). (v) Finally, the broad claim that one should “not leave symmetry to be discovered by scaling” may overstate the results. The bitter-lesson cited in the intro suggests that even biased models can eventually be outperformed by larger unconstrained ones; these experiments do not go far enough to test that (no extremely large unconstrained model was trained). In its current form, the paper’s strong conclusion about avoiding bitter lesson is not fully justified by the limited empirical data."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Why restrict training to a single epoch?  Have you tried multi-epoch training (e.g. 10 or 80 epochs) on a smaller scale to see if exponents change?  How do you justify that one pass through data captures the scaling behavior of fully trained models?\n2. How do you expect inclusion of the charged/large molecules (omitted in the neutral split) to affect your conclusions?  Could the symmetry advantages reverse or diminish in chemically diverse subsets?\n3. How sensitive are your results to the learning-rate and batch-size choices? You tuned these at 1M parameters and then scaled. Is it possible that some models (e.g. the largest eSEN) were suboptimally trained? \n4. The introduction cites Sutton’s “bitter lesson” about scale overtaking bias. Given your modest scaling regime, how confident are you that “we should not leave symmetry to be discovered by the model”?
