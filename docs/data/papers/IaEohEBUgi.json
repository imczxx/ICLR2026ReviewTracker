To overcome this, we introduce the non-conservative generalized Schrödinger bridge (NCGSB), a novel, energy-varying reformulation based on contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity. Furthermore, CWG supports guided generation by modulating a task-specific distance metric. We validate our framework on tasks including manifold navigation, molecular dynamics predictions, and image generation, demonstrating its practical benefits and versatility.", "tldr": "We introduce a non-conservative reformulation of the Schrödinger Bridge problem, along with a ResNet parameterization that can efficiently learn its solution.", "keywords": ["Schrödinger Bridge", "Generative Models", "Hamiltonian", "Contact Hamiltonian", "Differential Geometry", "Wasserstein metric"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c0b84c6d3bcde53544e2d235fd02e9ec6e227b5a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the nonconservative generalized Schrödinger bridge (NCGSB), which covers a mathematical generalization of SB for nonconservative systems, increasing model flexibility.

Moreover, the core ideas of the proposed method appear too late in the manuscript. In my opinion, it would be better to move the Related Work section toward the later part of the paper and highlight the main contributions more prominently.\n\n- Insufficient Emphasis on Mathematical Notation: The manuscript includes all key equations and attempts to distinguish important terms using various colors. However, the chosen colors are not sufficiently distinguishable, and the equations are interspersed throughout the text, which somewhat reduces readability. To emphasize key terms more effectively, it would be helpful to use a separate table or structured summary highlighting the core notations.\n\n- Inconsistent Explanation of Intermediate Marginals: In Equation (9), the loss function appears to require intermediate marginal distributions. However, in the actual experiments, only a subset of them—or none at all—seems to be used. This inconsistency is not clearly emphasized. It would strengthen the manuscript to consolidate and highlight these explanations right after Equation (9), rather than scattering them across different sections.\n\n- Novelty of Guided Generation: The authors emphasize guided generation as the main contribution of their work. In my view, guidance-based generation should ideally enable generation through indirect guidance rather than direct guidance toward an intended mode. In the current formulation and experiments, however, it seems that only interpolation between intermediate distributions during the optimal transport process is evaluated.\n\n#### Minor Weaknesses\n\n- In Appendix D.2, the notation for the intermediate distribution is inconsistent. It should be corrected from $\\rho_n$ to $\\rho_m$.\n- In Appendix D.3, the time complexity analysis could be strengthened by comparing it with other existing methods. Such a comparison would help to better emphasize the novelty of the proposed approach."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "NOmaD2R4mB", "forum": "IaEohEBUgi", "replyto": "IaEohEBUgi", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14590/Reviewer_7xEZ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14590/Reviewer_7xEZ"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14590/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761984377498, "cdate": 1761984377498, "tmdate": 1762924972924, "mdate": 1762924972924, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
