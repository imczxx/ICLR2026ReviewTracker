These limitations restrict their adaptability and effectiveness in constructing optimal portfolios. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Agent Scaling Simulation (MASS), a novel framework that leverages multi-agent simulation for direct, end-to-end portfolio construction. At its core, MASS employs a backward optimization process to dynamically learn the optimal distribution of heterogeneous agents, enabling the system to adapt to evolving market regimes. A key finding enabled by our framework is the exploration of the scaling effect for portfolio construction: we demonstrate that as the number of agents increases exponentially (up to 512), the aggregated decisions yield progressively higher excess returns. Extensive experiments are conducted on a challenging, proprietary cross-market dataset from 2023, showing that \\MYMETHOD~gains enhanced performance over nine state-of-the-art baselines. Further backtesting, stability analyses, the experiment on data leakage concerns, and case studies validate its enhanced profitability and robustness.

The use of simulated annealing as an optimizer is conceptually inconsistent with a dynamic market learning framework. SA requires hundreds of perturbations for convergence, whereas financial markets demand fast, step-wise adaptation. This slow, global optimization process fundamentally conflicts with the model’s claim of online learning and timely market responsiveness. Moreover, in MASS’s experiments, the dataset only covers stock market daily data from 2023, providing merely a few hundred data steps. Given such a limited time horizon, can SA truly converge in practice?\n2. Market disagreement hypothesis plays a critical underlying role in the MASS portfolio management method. However, the definition of the signal in Eq4 implies that higher disagreement reduces the resulting signal, leading to a negative portfolio allocation for the stock when applying the top-K strategy. This is somehow inconsistent with the market disagreement hypothesis, which states that greater disagreement may actually lead to higher prices due to optimistic investors dominating valuation under short-selling constraints.\n\n3. MASS evaluates performance using IC, RankIC, and related correlation metrics to measure alignment between its signals and realized returns. This experimental design is essentially identical to that used in classic factor-based models [1, 2], where factors are constructed to predict future returns and assessed through the same correlation metrics.\n\nHowever, the paper explicitly states that the framework is not intended for price prediction (lines 90–92). Given this positioning, it would be beneficial to clarify the relationship between MASS and traditional factor-mining approaches. In particular, including representative factor model methods [1, 2] as baselines could help demonstrate whether the proposed multi-agent simulation captures information beyond conventional return-predictive factors. Otherwise, it remains somewhat unclear how much of the reported performance improvement should be attributed to the agent-based design.\n\n​\t\n[1] [22'AAAI]FactorVAE: A Probabilistic Dynamic Factor Model Based on Variational Autoencoder for Predicting Cross-Sectional Stock Returns\n[2] [23'IJCAI]HireVAE: An Online and Adaptive Factor Model Based on Hierarchical and Regime-Switch VAE\nsome concerns addressed in weakness part"}, "questions": {"value": "Some concerns addressed in weakness part"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "pQg0lBHcGs", "forum": "NNpE9iiPNR", "replyto": "NNpE9iiPNR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3728/Reviewer_xnHx"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3728/Reviewer_xnHx"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3728/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761635665292, "cdate": 1761635665292, "tmdate": 1762916948971, "mdate": 1762916948971, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces the Multi-Agent Scaling Simulation , a framework that employs multi-agent simulations for direct, end-to-end portfolio construction.

Your efforts have been instrumental in helping us strengthen our manuscript.\n\nWe are encouraged that the reviewers recognized the novelty and contributions of our work. We have summarized the highlighted strengths below:\n\n- **Conceptual Novelty:** Reviewers praised our work for its \"strong conceptual and empirical contribution\" (QTnN) and for reframing portfolio construction as a dynamic learning process. The core idea was found to be \"conceptually appealing\" (xnHx), and the framework's design was described as \"vivid\" (ym2m). Reviewer EMCk appreciated the \"originality\" of viewing our framework as a \"new approach to direct portfolio construction.\"\n- **Methodological Strength:** The backward optimization mechanism was described as \"novel and elegantly designed\" (QTnN). Reviewers also noted that this is the \"first work that explores the influence of scales when leveraging multi-agent settings for stock trading\" (ym2m).\n- **Empirical Rigor & Evaluation:** Our experiments were deemed \"extensive\" (QTnN) and \"solid, with varied SoTA baseline methods\" (ym2m). The \"scaling effect analysis is particularly impressive\" (QTnN), and the \"Ablation study is conducted to sufficiently justify the choice of each component\" (ym2m).\n- **Reproducibility & Openness:** We are glad reviewers appreciated that the \"release of code and dataset enhances openness and encourages further research\" (xnHx) and that this transparency \"further enhance[s] its reproducibility and practical relevance\" (QTnN).\n\nWe have categorized the reviewers' concerns and suggestions below, along with a summary of how we addressed them.\n\n**1. Concerns about Generalizability and Realism**\n\n- **Concern:** The experiments were limited to the Chinese A-share market, raising questions about generalizability to other markets and asset classes (QTnN, EMCk).\n- **Our Response:** To directly address this, we conducted new experiments on the US market, evaluating MASS and all baselines on the **Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500** indices for both the 2023 and Q1 2025 periods. The results, added to Table 8 in the Appendix, show that MASS maintains its enhanced performance in a completely different market environment, confirming its robustness and generalizability.\n\n**2. Concerns about Methodological Soundness and Feasibility**\n\n- **Concern:** The use of Simulated Annealing (SA) was questioned for its computational feasibility and consistency with a dynamic online learning framework (QTnN, xnHx).\n- **Our Response:** We clarified that MASS operates on a daily frequency, where the sub-10-minute optimization time is highly practical. To further demonstrate robustness, we conducted a **new sensitivity analysis** on SA's hyperparameters (cooling rate and number of iterations), showing that performance is relatively stable across a reasonable range of settings.\n- **Concern:** The framework's success might depend heavily on prompt engineering, and the agent reasoning process lacked interpretability (QTnN, ym2m).\n- **Our Response:** We explained that agent diversity is programmatically generated, not manually prompt-engineered. To prove this, we conducted a **new experiment where we radically rephrased the core prompts** and showed that performance remained stable. For interpretability, we added **two  new, detailed case studys** in Appendix 3.5, providing full agent prompts and a micro-level walkthrough of how the system adapts to a market regime shift.\n- **Concern:** The relationship between MASS and traditional factor models was unclear, and key factor model baselines were missing (xnHx).\n- **Our Response:** We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now **added two state-of-the-art factor models (FactorVAE and HireVAE)** as baselines across all of our experiments. This includes four new sets of comparisons: on the Chinese market (2023 & 2025), and the US market (2023 & 2025). The results show MASS outperforming these strong baselines, demonstrating that our agent-based simulation captures information beyond conventional factors.\n- **Concern:** The paper lacked a theoretical justification for the scaling effect's limits (QTnN, EMCk).\n- **Our Response:** We extended our empirical validation. We ran **new experiments scaling MASS to 1024 and 1536 agents**. The results, which show diminishing but still positive returns,  are crucial for understanding the trade-off between performance gains and the onset of performance saturation at larger scales."}}, "id": "IEuPCklT3q", "forum": "NNpE9iiPNR", "replyto": "NNpE9iiPNR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3728/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3728/Authors"], "number": 34, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3728/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763398541408, "cdate": 1763398541408, "tmdate": 1763398541408, "mdate": 1763398541408, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
