The first strategy is infrequent communication, a core feature of the FedAVG algorithm, controlled by the number of local steps $\\tau$. The second is gradient compression, a widely-used technique to reduce data volume, governed by a compression ratio $\\delta$. However, finding the optimal ($\\tau, \\delta$) pair is a major challenge in realistic settings with device heterogeneity and network fluctuations. Existing works assume that the effects of $\\delta$ and $\\tau$ on the model convergence are orthogonal, optimizing them separately. In this work, we chanllenge this orthogonality assumption. We are the first to propose two virtual queues at distinct temporal granularities, helping derive the bound of the noise introduced by the two lossy strategies, respectively. We demonstrate that the convergence rate of FedAVG with gradient compression is critically affected by a key term $2^\\tau / \\delta^2$. This finding proves that $\\tau$ and $\\delta$ are intrinsically coupled and must be co-designed for efficient training. Furthermore, we propose WingsFL, which fixes the key convergence rate term and minimizes the end-to-end training time under device heterogenity by solving a one-variable Min-Max problem. WingsFL achieves up to $2.00\\times$ and $2.18\\times$ speed-ups over FedAVG and static strategy respectively, under realistic conditions of device heterogeneity and network fluctuations.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Federated Learning; Convex Optimization; Gradient Compression; Infrequent Communication"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/50071c1b291d668274cb0e768c588e7e8e795bf1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses communication bottlenecks in FL by jointly optimizing two key communication strategies: infrequent communication (number of local steps τ) and gradient compression (compression ratio δ) aiming to minimize end-to-end training time.

The contribution appears incremental, with no demonstrated advantage in convergence rate, computational \ncomplexity, or general applicability.\n\n3. The conversion from a two-variable minmax problem to a single-variable formulation via fixing $\\phi$ lacks theoretical support.

The paper claims that $2𝜏/𝛿^2$ governs the convergence rate but does not provide a clear, quantitative interpretation of how communication savings trade off with model accuracy or convergence speed.

However, the paper neither visualizes nor explains how WingsFL balances these conflicting forces beyond stating that the key term is “fixed.” Without a clear trade-off analysis, it is hard to evaluate whether WingsFL’s gains come from better communication scheduling or simply from tolerating more approximation error.\n\n2. The algorithmic core, i.e., solving a one-variable minimization based on the derived coupling, is a straightforward adaptation rather than a fundamentally new optimization technique. The insight that τ and δ are not independent is interesting but somewhat incremental, as similar interdependencies have been implicitly discussed in works like PASGD and adaptive compression frameworks.\n\n3. The experimental results mostly report speed-up ratios without showing how convergence rate or final accuracy changes as τ or δ vary. Missing are plots that explicitly demonstrate the communication–accuracy or convergence–communication trade-off. Such analysis would substantiate the claimed “joint optimization.”\n\n4.
