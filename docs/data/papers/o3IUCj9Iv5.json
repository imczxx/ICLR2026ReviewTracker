Moreover, existing models are built to only consider ground state or mean conformations, rather than conformational ensembles that more accurately describes peptides. We introduce CycLOPS (a Cyclic Loss for the Optimization of Peptide Structures), a model-agnostic framework that conditions Boltzmann generators to sample valid cyclic conformations—without retraining. To overcome the scarcity of cyclic peptide data, we reformulate the design problem in terms of conditional sampling over linear peptide structures via chemically informed loss functions. CycLOPS encompasses 18 possible inter-amino acid crosslinks enabled by 6 diverse chemical reactions, and is readily extensible to many more. It leverages tetrahedral geometry constraints, using six interatomic distances to define a kernel density-estimated joint distribution from MD simulations. We demonstrate CycLOPS’s versatility via two distinct generative models: a modified Sequential Boltzmann Generator (SBG) (Tan et al., 2025) and the Equivariant Normalizing flow (ECNF) of Klein & Noé (2024). In both settings, CycLOPS successfully biases the Boltzmann distribution toward chemically plausible macrocycles.", "tldr": "We condition CNF and DNF-based Boltzmann generators for cyclic peptide design.", "keywords": ["Peptide Design", "AI", "BioML", "Cyclic peptides", "Protein Dynamics", "Flow matching", "Boltzmann generators"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/32f36dbb87a700c7d24d7da3e03924f7b5cfd59c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces CYCLOPS, a model-agnostic conditioning framework that enables Boltzmann Generators (both discrete and continuous normalizing flows) to generate cyclic peptide conformations without retraining.

The paper explicitly cites CPComposer [A], which addresses essentially the same task, that is to generate cyclic peptides from linear peptide data under composable geometric conditions.
