We propose a novel game-theoretic model for this problem that generalizes settings studied in diverse literatures, and analyze it under different assumptions on agent information. Given complete-information, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a pure Nash equilibrium (NE) in this generalized setting. This is shown to be efficiently computable but has worst-case unbounded price of anarchy. Alternatively, under partial-information with a common prior, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE), which is also efficiently computable. Finally, we propose a more realistic learning setting for the game, where agents have partial information but no common prior. Instead, they must learn how to act given online contextual feedback from interactions in stochastically sampled game instances. We provide sufficient conditions on agents doing simultaneous no-regret learning for convergence to Bayesian coarse-correlated equilibrium (BCCE) or last-iterate convergence to the BNE.

Once equipped with Lemma 1, Section 3 and 4 rely on fairly standard tools for these kind of problems. In particular, the positive results are kind of expected given the specific structure of the problem being considered. \n\nSection 5 is the one I find most interesting. However, Theorem 4 follows fairly standard ideas and is largely expected given similar results on convergence to BCCE in other games. Theorem 5  is largely based on proving that the problem being considered meets the requirements to apply the theorem by Jordan ed al. (2024).\n\nMoreover, given the nice connection to practical applications, I would have appreciated a longer discussion about the feedback available to the online algorithm, and whether it makes sense in practice. From the discussion in paragraph starting at 359 this is not entirely clear. For instance, is assuming access to stochastic gradient feedback reasonable in practice? I would probably expect to have something closer to bandit feedback. Some discussion on this would be a useful addition.\n\nFinally, simulations display some interesting behaviours (eg phase transitions) but they are all carried out on extremely simplified settings and it is difficult to extrapolate general insights from them. Extending the experimental analysis to richer synthetic or real-world settings would also be a nice addition to the current set of results. \n\nTypos: ““proprety” line 239; “stochstic” line 420"}, "questions": {"value": "See question on feedback above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "QeYrK33s10", "forum": "KxXWGI5ijv", "replyto": "KxXWGI5ijv", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19664/Reviewer_Ntpc"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19664/Reviewer_Ntpc"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19664/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761777441682, "cdate": 1761777441682, "tmdate": 1762931514870, "mdate": 1762931514870, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper analyzes a class of games involving agents attempting to acquire resources.

The strong monotonicity results seem pretty straightforward from the definitions, so the strength of the paper boils down completely to understanding how important this class of games is. I do not feel well placed to evaluate that---I come from a computer science background, and I am admittedly relatively unfamiliar with the more economic side of this paper. Thus, I will not attempt to do so, in the hope that at least one other reviewer has a better understanding here. \n\nMinor note on the comment at L829 about CCE collapsing to NE in this class of games: I do not think that this follows from the preceding argument. It is not true that strict concavity of utilities implies that CCEs collapse to NEs. Instead, Theorem 1 (monotonicity of the associated VI operator) is what shows that CCE collapses to Nash---or, at least, that the marginals of any CCE form a Nash.
