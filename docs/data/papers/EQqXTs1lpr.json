While DNA-Encoded Library (DEL) technology can generate the massive datasets required for this task, its primary signal---sequencing read counts---is an indirect and often noisy proxy for true molecular binding affinity. To address the scarcity of public benchmarks for developing robust models that can overcome this data challenge, we introduce CA-DEL. CA-DEL is a multi-dimensional public benchmark featuring screens against three homologous carbonic anhydrase isoforms. Notably, it is the first public DEL dataset to integrate both 2D chemical structures and pre-computed 3D protein-ligand conformations. Crucially, CA-DEL includes a validation set with experimentally determined binding affinities ($K_i$ values). This unique feature enables the direct evaluation of a model's ability to predict true biological activity, rather than simply modeling the noisy enrichment signal.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["DNA-Encoded Library (DEL)", "Drug Discovery", "Anti-Cancer", "Database", "Cheminformatics"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2dbe18ae3550a57d84190a920fab82313a9f99dd.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce a benchmark for protein-target binding for DNA-encoded libray (DEL) data.

It would be valuable to experiment with a new method for uncertainty modeling or elaborate on the discussion about it.)\n\n2) The authors focus exclusively on a single protein family of proteins (carbonic anhydrase isoforms). This choice is scientifically well-motivated since isoform selectivity is difficult and clinically relevant, but additional diversity across protein families would strengthen the dataset's generalizability and broaden its applicability.

Since this is a paper in the \"datasets and benchmarks\" area, the dataset should be shared for review. I believe this is the most critical point because the dataset is the sole contribution of this paper (no new models or algorithms are introduced). We need to verify if the data is accessible, of high quality, and usable by other researchers.\n- The Authors emphasize that this is the first DEL dataset containing 3D poses, but the KinDEL dataset also contains 3D poses predicted with molecular docking.\n- It is unclear what the shaded background in Figure 2 means. It seems that these ranges should correspond to the Lipinski rules (MW<500), but why is the upper bound of QED not set at 1 (perfect QED score)? The figure caption mentions LogP, but this figure does not contain this information.\n- The details on the source libraries are missing. There is no citation of CAS-DEL, DOS-DEL, and ChEMBL in the section on dataset construction. These sources should be cited, and their licenses should be discussed as CA-DEL is a combination of these datasets.\n- In Section 3.3.2, the Authors say that they \"decouple model performance from known unreliability of docking scoring functions\" by evaluating their docking protocol by re-docking analysis. However, re-docking only one molecule per structure does not guarantee good docking poses and scores in general. Re-docking is rather a standard practice to see if the original ligand can be re-docked in the same place of the pocket of a protein in the exact same conformation that was observed for this ligand in the experimental structure.\n- The text says that Sp and SubSp of the simple physicochemical baselines approach zero, demonstrating no meaningful predictive capacity. However, in Table 2 for 5doh and 3p3h, \"Mol Weight\" achieves Sp of -0.25 and SubSp of -0.125, which is not close to zero and very close to the best methods in this table (within the reported standard deviation). In other cases, the Benzene baseline also produces competitive correlation, for example, for 2hkf and 5fl4.\n- The caption of Figure 4 should be more detailed to allow readers to understand the plot without reading the whole paper.\n- I do not understand the motivation behind the zero-shot experiment. These are different proteins, so predictions of a model trained on one protein's data and applied to the other will not work very well. A detailed analysis should be performed to compare binding pockets and estimate the extent to which the same ligands can bind to both pockets. I suspect that only non-selective ligands can be discovered in this manner.\n- A few typos should be corrected, e.g. \"Tabel 2 and Tabel 3\"\n- In Figure A5, I do not see green sticks that are mentioned in the caption, only the cyan ligand."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Where do you plan to publish the dataset and under what license? Will it follow FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles?\n2. The Authors say that they deliberately chose testing molecules with a significant distributional shift to simulate the progression to optimized lead compounds. Later, the Authors say that their benchmark \"directly evaluates a model's capacity to guide lead optimization.\" However, I am unsure if such a model trained on noisy DEL data can be useful for lead optimization, where structural changes may be very small and the activity is rather nuanced. Furthermore, the evaluation metrics are focused on top molecules, which simulates hit identification more than lead optimization. Do you expect the models that solve your benchmark to be good at both hit identification and lead optimization?\n3.
