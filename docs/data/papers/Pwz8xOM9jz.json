However, existing studies often fail to adequately address the unique characteristics of power systems, such as the sparsity of network connections and the critical importance of the unique Slack node, which poses significant challenges in achieving high-accuracy estimations. In this paper, we present SenseFlow, a novel physics-informed and self-ensembling iterative framework that integrates two main designs, the Physics-informed Power Flow Network (PPFNet) and Self-ensembling Iterative Estimation (SeIter), to carefully address the unique properties of the power system and thereby enhance the power flow estimation. Specifically, SenseFlow enforces the PPFNet to gradually predict high-precision voltage magnitudes and phase angles through the iterative SeIter process. On the one hand, PPFNet employs the Virtual Node Attention and Slack-Gated Feed-Forward modules to facilitate efficient global-local communication in the face of network sparsity and amplify the influence of the Slack node on angle predictions, respectively. On the other hand, SeIter maintains an exponential moving average of PPFNet's parameters to create an ensemble model that refines power state predictions throughout the iterative fitting process. Experimental results demonstrate that SenseFlow outperforms existing methods, providing a promising solution for high-accuracy power flow estimation across diverse grid configurations.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Physics-Informed Design", "Self-Ensembling Iterative Fitting", "Power FLow Estimation"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8a23671a3584b70af399d2cd53449a8128f4e00c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6dab566019dfe2ad00da3d460636a6a6fbcaa702.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose SenseFlow that combines two components designed in this work: PPFNet and SeIter.

Also the slack bus itself merely absorbs system mismatch, not a source of “global influence” that must be learned. In reality, system works in distributed slack fashion (Dhople et. al. ) where all generators shares a mismatch of power, compared to schedule dispatch. Also, existing GNNs already capture network sparsity and coupling through the incidence or admittance matrix, so the claimed need for a special slack-aware attention is conceptually weak. Note that Gaussian Process–based models with physically informed kernels have already demonstrated how both local and global relationships in power systems can be modeled effectively and with far fewer samples (Bandong et.al., Pareek et.al.). Here, the network requires hundreds of thousands of samples  which raises concerns about scalability and true learning of physical structure.\n\n**Major Concerns:** \n\n1. **Slack bus understanding and discussion:** \nThe SGF block assumes a single slack bus and distributes its features globally. In practice, this is not physically meaningful under uncertainty — real systems use distributed slack where all generators share imbalance. This has been studied extensively (e.g., Dhople et al.). The current approach ignores this and risks non-physical generalization. Further, I am not sure how can you make NRLF converge for 50-150% uncertainty in load with single slack bus. A slack bus in these systems with this much load variation (specially when you hit 150%) but be supplying way beyond its capacity, which is far away from real situations and thus biasing the data towards slack-bus attention artificially., \n\n2. *Related work (GP, distributed slack, classical solvers):*  Gaussian process–based power flow/state estimation works;Distributed slack formulations; Modern scalable solvers such as nonlinear algebraic multigrid and HELM are not discussed. See _Machine Learning for Solving Power Flow Equations_ at https://energy.hosting.acm.org/wiki/index.php/ML_OPF_wiki . This makes the contribution positioning unclear.\n\n3. **Experimental issues:** Extremely large training sets (up to 500k samples) with no analysis of data efficiency. Think like these, why should I not just solve power flow on a particular instance if I need to solve these many to train. Also no comparison to modern numerical solvers; only older GNN baselines and PyPower runtime is given + No report of FLOPs, wall-clock, or inference cost relative to solver accuracy.\n\n4. **Lack of theoretical grounding**\nThe iterative SeIter process lacks any convergence or stability analysis. It is unclear whether it always improves residuals or can diverge.\n\n\n**Minor Concerns**\n\n– Missing hyperparameters: number of layers, K, attention heads, etc.\n– Equations (7–12) need clearer explanation or pseudocode.\n– Several typos and unclear notation (e.g., PV vs PQ example).\n\nDhople et. al. : Reexamining the Distributed Slack Bus, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems ( Volume: 35, Issue: 6, November 2020)\nBandong et.al. : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15950\n\nGP Works+Local Kernel + Topologies: Pareek et.al.

It’s not clear whether you’re solving power flow or state estimation — sometimes the paper reads like one, sometimes the other (especially when talking about missing Q or uncertain data). Can you clarify exactly what the task is and what inputs/outputs the model sees?\n\n2. The slack bus treatment is physically confusing. The slack only absorbs system mismatch; it’s not a “global messenger.” Why is a special Slack-Gated module needed, and how would this extend to the more realistic distributed slack formulation where all generators share mismatch?\n\n3. The model uses hundreds of thousands of samples for training — that’s a lot. How data-hungry is SenseFlow? Would performance degrade sharply with smaller datasets?
