However, their overall performance is frequently hampered by class imbalance and the inherent complexity of mammogram images. In this work, we propose a novel generalizable enhancement that can be seamlessly integrated into any CNN architecture aimed at improving classification outcomes for mammographic images. In order to rigorously evaluate its effectiveness, the proposed approach was  applied to six commonly used CNN models and assessed on an imbalanced multiclass mammogram images dataset. The experimental results showed consistent and significant improvements in all key performance metrics, such as  accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Precision-Recall Curve (PRC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC), which highlights the robustness and adaptability of our method. This enhancement provides a generalizable strategy for strengthening CNN-based mammogram classification systems, thereby promoting more reliable computer-aided diagnosis in breast cancer screening.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Convolutional Neural Networks", "Mammogram images classification", "Imbalanced data", "multiclass classification"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/eaecdca82973194ab02135fabdef5c1fd2a421c2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a \"weight selection optimization\" enhancement strategy applicable to various CNNs, aiming to improve accuracy in multi-class, imbalanced mammography (BI-RADS) classification.

Lack of innovation: The method proposed in the paper is similar to the common model checkpointing early stopping paradigm, lacking distinctiveness.  It fails to establish a new theoretical framework or introduce novel mechanisms, nor does it provide a comparative analysis with traditional methods.\n2.  Lack of comparison with cutting-edge requirements: The experiments in this paper only compare \"the same CNN before and after application enhancement\" rather than benchmarking against external SOTA methods, failing to provide a comparison with the latest research approaches from top-tier conferences and journals.\n3.  Supplementary Related Work: The discussion on related work should be more in-depth, with a suggested addition to the discussion on deep learning-based mammography classification methods.\n4.  Lack of Visualization in Experiments: Most experimental data relationships in the paper are not presented with intuitive charts, making it difficult to evaluate the actual improvements and interpretability of the method across different categories and difficult cases.\n5.  No ablation experiments: The paper only mentions \"randomly splitting the dataset 5 times,\" which constitutes merely a repetitive validation of data partitioning rather than an ablation study.\n6.  Missing Overall Architecture/Flowchart: There is no complete experimental flowchart, making it difficult to fully grasp the core of the paper.  The only figure provided in the paper is the accuracy curve.\n7.  Ambiguous Methodology: The lack of a clear definition for \"optimal weights\" in the paper may lead to the risk of overfitting.\n8.

The core idea of the proposed approach is to monitor the loss function during training and save the \"optimal weights\" corresponding to the minimum loss, instead of using the weights from the final training epoch as in traditional practices. The method is evaluated on six CNN architectures (RegNet, ResNet152, MobileNetV3, InceptionV3, NasNetLarge, NasNetMobile224) using an imbalanced multiclass mammogram dataset (2,881 images, BI-RADS 0–5). However, the paper suffers from three critical flaws: first, the research objective is ambiguously articulated (e.g., the connection between weight selection and solving class imbalance is not clearly justified); second, the related work section is incomplete (failing to cover key relevant methods with similar ideas); third, the experimental design is insufficient—only comparing the proposed method with the \"baseline (unimproved) version\" of each CNN model, without any comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., transfer learning or ensemble learning approaches discussed in its own related work), leading to weak persuasiveness of the claimed \"generalizability\" and \"effectiveness\"."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "No obvious strengths are identified in this submission.

The proposed approach of monitoring the loss function during training bears strong similarities to curriculum learning paradigms. However, the authors have not conducted adequate literature retrieval—there is no citation of such relevant work, nor any discussion or comparison to distinguish the proposed method from these existing techniques. This omission raises concerns about the novelty of the work and suggests a lack of understanding of the broader research landscape.  \n\n2. **Inadequate Experimental Comparison**. While the related work section mentions important techniques for mammogram classification, the experiments only compare the \"improved\" CNN models (with the proposed weight selection) against their own \"unimproved baselines\" (using final-epoch weights). There is no quantitative or qualitative comparison with the aforementioned transfer learning, ensemble learning, or other state-of-the-art methods. Without such comparisons, it is impossible to verify whether the proposed method outperforms existing solutions or merely provides a marginal improvement over a naive baseline—greatly undermining the paper’s claim of \"enhancing CNN-based mammogram classification systems\".  \n\n3. **Poor Organization and Unclear Research Objectives**. The paper lacks a coherent structure and clear research focus. The research objective (e.g., \"how does selecting optimal weights address class imbalance?\") is never explicitly and logically justified—only stating that the dataset is imbalanced but not explaining why the proposed weight selection strategy can mitigate this issue. Overall, the writing requires substantial revision to improve clarity and logical flow."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Regarding the first weakness: Are the authors aware of curriculum learning methods that use loss to guide parameter selection? \n2. Regarding the second weakness: Given that the related work discusses transfer learning and ensemble learning as competitive techniques, why were these methods not included in the experimental comparisons? \n3.
