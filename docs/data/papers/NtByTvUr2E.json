Explicitly modeling human values and preferences is challenging when tacit knowledge is difficult to formalize, as Michael Polanyi observed, \"We can know more than we can tell.\" To address this challenge, we propose generative near-optimal policy learning (GenNOP). Our framework leverages a conditional generative model to reliably produce diverse, near-optimal, and potentially high-dimensional stochastic policies. Our approach involves a re-weighting scheme for training generative models according to the estimated probability that each training sample is near-optimal. Under our framework, decision-making algorithms focus on a primary, measurable objective, while human decision-makers apply their tacit knowledge to evaluate the generated decisions, rather than developing explicit specifications for the ineffable, human-centered objective. Through extensive synthetic and real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "tldr": "We propose a novel framework for human-AI collaboration in decision-making that aligns with human values and preferences.", "keywords": ["generative models", "human-AI collaboration", "human-centered decision-making"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3cf4a74cb7c3b2c8246e45a2aa4905cac9689865.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes GenNOP, an algorithmic decision-making method that tries to align with hard-to-specify human values.

The proposed solution uses many different techniques (e.g., Extreme value theory, VAE, causality), but their contributions are only briefly sketched or relegated to the Appendix. Given that GenOP has many moving parts (and all of them come with their own assumptions), I believe this method could have trouble generalizing beyond the very synthetic scenario of the lab (e.g., or at least it would require a stronger experimental evaluation than the one provided).\n\n- I believe assumptions should be stated within the main text, or at least summarized textually in layman's terms to make the reader understand the limits (and strengths) of the proposed theoretical formulation. Propositions 1,2, and 3 seem to require many assumptions (6!), but they are buried within the Appendix. I believe they need to be made more explicit in the main text. \n\n- I do not fully understand the experimental support of the real dataset experiment (line 428). GenOP can generate a distribution of actions similar to the observed one, but I believe that is because GenOP is a generative model trained on real-world data. Thus, it is somewhat trivial that it will learn “$\\epsilon$-optimal” actions close to the physician policies (furthermore, we cannot even evaluate counterfactual effects in this case). For example, it would have been nice to see the comparison between $m$ actions generated by GenOP and $m’$ actions generated by a simple VAE, to understand the benefits of the GenOP architecture. \n\n- The paper does not mention other alternative forms of human-AI complementarity that appeared in the past years. These are important to contextualize this work within the human-AI collaboration literature. Notably, decision support systems that restrict human agency, thus preventing overreliance and leading to provable improvement in performance [1,2], and _“learning to defer”_ approaches, which learns when and how to optimally defer decisions to a human decision maker over uncertain instances  [3]. See this survey for further inputs [4].\n\n- The code provided in the supplementary comprises only the GenOP implementation, without any code to run the experiments or the evaluations in the paper. Therefore, I believe that it is not useful in assessing the reproducibility (or to clear any of my doubts with the setup). \n\n[1] Straitouri, E., Wang, L., Okati, N., & Rodriguez, M. G.
