Despite these developments, the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence on the final prediction—errors introduced at this stage can substantially degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source reasoning models.

Limited novelty and conceptual depth.\n\nThe main claim (“the first step matters most”) is quite trivial and incremental, especially considering the previous works (e.g. Lost in the Middle, and other efficient CoT and overthinking works) which study the importance of reasoning steps. This claim is only supported by the semantic similarity rather and a causality analysis. Besides, the actual reason why the first step shows more similarity is not explored, because it is possible that both the first step and the final prediction rephrase the original problem statement and then begin to answer. A deeper understanding is needed.\n\n2. The concept of 'reasoning step' in this work seems to be confused. The authors extract steps from the 'thinking token' of reasoning models, which represents the internal thinking of the models. According to the authors' definition, the 'reasoning step' discussed in this work can actually contain a full plan to solve the problem, rather than a single step as commonly defined in CoT. This confusion can hinder readers from getting the idea, especially when the authors do not provide any details of prompts and detailed examples of the experiments.\n\n3. The methodology is also simple and kind of trivial.\n\nThere are many step-wise evaluation, selection, and pruning methods, and the detailed methods include using self-reflection, reinforcement learning, and external reward models [1-8]. This work simply proposes to use an external reward model to select the first step, which is a simplified version of selection and pruning for each step. I can hardly see any novel or interesting contribution.\n\n4. The experiments are not convincing.
