However, their focus on pairwise relationships restricts their ability to learn pervasive higher-order interactions in real-world systems, which can be naturally modeled as hypergraphs. To tackle this issue, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have garnered substantial attention in recent years. Despite the proposal of numerous HNNs, the absence of consistent experimental protocols and multi-dimensional empirical analysis impedes deeper understanding and further development of HNN research. While several toolkits for deep hypergraph learning\n(DHGL) have been introduced to facilitate algorithm evaluation, they provide only limited quantitative evaluation results and insufficient coverage of advanced algorithms, datasets, and benchmark tasks. To fill the gap, we introduce DHG-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for HNNs. Specifically, DHG-Bench systematically investigates the characteristics of HNNs in terms of four dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness. We comprehensively evaluate 17 state-of-the-art HNN algorithms on 22 diverse datasets spanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks, under unified experimental settings. Extensive experiments reveal both the strengths and limitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights and directions for future research. Furthermore, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use library for training\nand evaluating different HNN methods.

Hyperedge prediction uses random splits with mixed heuristic negative sampling. This ignores temporal/inductive drift and can create unrealistic candidate sets. The paper can be strengthened by adding (a) temporal splits (train earlier hyperedges, predict future ones), (b) inductive splits with disjoint node/hyperedge partitions, and (c) open-world negatives drawn from realistic candidate generators (size- and motif-conditioned but respecting time).\n2. All tasks are supervised. Many real deployments use self-supervised pretraining or contrastive objectives. The benchmark can be strengthened by adding self-supervised learning tracks (node/hyperedge masking, motif prediction, contrastive pretraining) and evaluate fine-tuning across tasks to reflect modern practice.\n3. The paper successfully demonstrates that HNN performance varies significantly across datasets (a key insight for RQ1), but it falls short of explaining why. The analysis largely stops at reporting performance rankings."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Is performance sensitive to datasets with a few very large hyperedges versus many small ones?\n2.

However, for models that explicitly take connectivity into account, not observing a drop in performance at a 90% perturbation ratio seems more like a negative result than a positive one. The paper presents robust performance across different perturbation levels as a desirable outcome, but to me, this suggests either that the dataset does not require higher-order processing or that the model does not properly incorporate structural information. I suggest that once the new metric is introduced, the authors also include a discussion on how a good hypergraph model is expected to behave under such conditions. ****\n- It would be interesting to see more statistics on the datasets used in the experiments to highlight the extent to which they are representative of higher-order interactions. For example, it is known that PubMed has around 80% of its nodes isolated. Reporting statistics such as the number of isolated nodes, the number of nodes involved only in pairwise interactions, and the number of nodes participating in higher-order interactions would be particularly useful for node-level classification tasks, where the performance on isolated nodes would depend solely on the MLP component, regardless of the model used."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the Weaknesses section"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "eTtUOrSgMp", "forum": "lhsb1ChUDF", "replyto": "lhsb1ChUDF", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17538/Reviewer_uqj6"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17538/Reviewer_uqj6"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17538/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761816317295, "cdate": 1761816317295, "tmdate": 1762927409915, "mdate": 1762927409915, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
