Low-rank gradient estimators have been successfully applied by methods such as Galore and Flora for LLM training on consumer hardware, by compressing gradients and optimizer tensors. However, the underlying gradient estimation methods are biased or subject to a high variance. Moreover, low-rank optimizer states, such as the first and second moments under the previous subspace, become misaligned whenever the projection is updated. This misalignment can lead to instabilities during training with low-rank gradients.\nWe propose Plumage: Probabilistic Low‑rank Unbiased Minimum‑vAriance Gradient Estimator. \nPlumage can be applied as a drop-in replacement for low-rank LLM training without introducing new hyperparameters beyond the chosen rank $r$ and the update interval $\\tau$. In addition, we resolve the misalignment of low-rank statistics.\nWe apply Plumage as a drop-in replacement for the fixed top-k components estimate used in Galore to observe how the gradient bias-variance tradeoff impacts the optimization of LLMs. \nThe resulting Plumage+Adam shrinks the full-rank optimization's gap in the pre-training evaluation loss by 33\\% on average across models, with a 34\\% improvement on the commonsense benchmark for the 1B models.

The scope of efficiency is narrowly defined. PLUMAGE focuses primarily on computation and memory efficiency but does not consider communication efficiency or distributed scalability, which limits its practical applicability in large-scale multi-GPU or distributed training scenarios."}, "questions": {"value": "Q1: PLUMAGE operates within a fundamental bias–variance–adaptivity trade-off:  Switching subspaces enables exploration of diverse gradient directions and reduces bias but increases variance, while fixing a single subspace lowers variance at the cost of stale, biased gradients that cannot capture evolving curvature. Although the paper claims to balance these effects through probabilistic linear projection and periodic realignment, it remains unclear how this mechanism explicitly mitigates bias without constraining directional diversity. Could the authors clarify whether any quantitative metric (e.g., gradient–subspace alignment, principal-angle drift, or bias–variance decomposition) or visualization (such as alignment trajectories or spectral evolution) is available to demonstrate that PLUMAGE indeed achieves an optimal trade-off between bias, variance, and adaptivity?\n\nQ2: GALORE deterministically selects the top-\\(k\\) singular components via SVD, preserving gradient fidelity but introducing bias, whereas PLUMAGE stochastically samples \\(k\\) components using the “Wheel-of-Fortune” mechanism. However, this raises concerns about sampling instability—what if, by chance, low-energy (“bad luck”) components are selected, causing large deviation from the true gradient? The paper should clarify how such cases are prevented or bounded and provide justification for why this probabilistic selection can outperform deterministic top-\\(k\\) truncation. Is the improvement primarily due to reduced bias, and is this the main reason PLUMAGE requires fewer training steps compared with GALORE? A quantitative or theoretical comparison between probabilistic and monotonic top-\\(k\\) selection would substantially strengthen this claim.\n\nQ3: PLUMAGE samples gradient components probabilistically, enforcing unbiasedness by matching the expected subspace to the full gradient and minimizing estimator variance. However, the FLORA paper also performs stochastic decomposition, treating LoRA as a gradient compressor through random Gaussian projections. What, then, is the fundamental distinction between PLUMAGE’s probabilistic sampling and FLORA’s stochastic approach, is it primarily the variance minimization objective? Furthermore, given that PLUMAGE only samples a fixed budget of components, is the full SVD decomposition strictly necessary? In principle, FLORA’s random-projection method might offer comparable computational efficiency with lower overhead. The paper would benefit from a direct quantitative comparison with FLORA under the same stochastic-variance setting to justify the need for SVD-based probabilistic sampling and its claimed advantages in variance reduction and convergence stability.\n\n\nQ4: PLUMAGE derives an unbiased, minimum-variance gradient estimator by taking an expectation over the stochastic sampling of singular components. However, in practice, this expectation is never explicitly computed—the unbiasedness is instead guaranteed through the projection mechanism, where each sampled component is reweighted by its inclusion probability \\(p_i\\). Could the authors clarify how this projection-based design ensures the expectation property is maintained throughout training, especially when projections are reused over multiple steps? Moreover, does this expectation formulation translate into tangible variance reduction during optimization, or is the benefit primarily theoretical? Empirical evidence—such as variance trajectories or gradient–projection alignment metrics—would help validate that the projection mechanism indeed achieves the claimed minimum-variance behavior in practice.\n\n\n\nQ5: PLUMAGE emphasizes using only a left-sided projection matrix for gradient estimation, unlike prior low-rank compression methods such as  PowerSGD[1] that employ both left and right projections. Could the authors clarify whether a symmetric right-sided counterpart exists—i.e., would applying a right-sided projection yield an equivalent estimator in expectation? Furthermore, what is the theoretical or empirical rationale for retaining only the left projection? Does this one-sided formulation fully preserve the statistical properties (e.g., unbiasedness and minimum variance) of the two-sided estimator, or might it introduce asymmetry or a loss in representational fidelity? Providing a short theoretical justification or ablation demonstrating the equivalence between left- and right-sided projections would strengthen the validity of this design choice and its practical implications.\n\n\n\nQ6: The paper claims that PLUMAGE can employ an adaptive update interval \\( \\tau \\) to dynamically control how often the SVD and projection subspace are refreshed, yet no quantitative or ablation comparison with a fixed \\( \\tau \\) is presented. Could the authors clarify how this adaptive mechanism is implemented in practice—specifically, what metrics or thresholds determine when the projection is updated—and whether it leads to measurable efficiency or convergence benefits compared to a fixed interval? In the absence of empirical evidence, it remains unclear whether the adaptive \\( \\tau \\) contributes to meaningful computational savings or improved training stability. A direct comparison between adaptive and fixed \\( \\tau \\) settings would help validate this claim.\n\n\nQ7: Although PLUMAGE is presented as an efficient training approach for large language models, the paper primarily reports validation perplexity as the key metric for evaluating optimization quality and performance. However, perplexity alone may not fully capture broader aspects such as generalization, calibration, or downstream task performance, even if this evaluation setting is consistent with GALORE. Could the authors justify why perplexity is considered a sufficient proxy for optimization progress in this work, and whether improvements in perplexity reliably translate to better model capability? Including complementary evaluations—such as downstream task accuracy, calibration error, or convergence efficiency—would help substantiate the claim that PLUMAGE achieves meaningful training efficiency beyond loss-level improvements.\n\nQ8: While PLUMAGE is presented as an efficient optimization framework, the paper appears to focus primarily on reducing computational and memory costs (e.g., via low-rank projection, one-sided estimation, and adaptive SVD updates) rather than communication overhead in distributed training. Could the authors clarify whether PLUMAGE is intended solely as a computation-efficient method, or if it can also be extended to communication-efficient scenarios such as multi-GPU or distributed optimization? Additionally, have the authors considered evaluating the method’s impact on communication volume or synchronization cost to substantiate its scalability claims in distributed environments?\n\n[1]Vogels, Thijs, Sai Praneeth Karimireddy, and Martin Jaggi. \"PowerSGD: Practical low-rank gradient compression for distributed optimization.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 32 (2019).\n\nThis paper deserves a certain degree of discussion. Although the current version is not yet sufficient for acceptance, it presents several promising ideas that could develop into a strong contribution with further clarification and empirical support. I have raised multiple questions (Q1–Q8) regarding the methodology, empirical validation, and evaluation scope, and there remain additional issues beyond those listed.

More importantly, the paper correctly identifies that optimizer state realignment is a critical and often overlooked issue in low-rank optimization methods that use periodic projection updates. The proposed realignment strategy (Eq. 18 and 19) provides a well-reasoned potential solution to this problem, which is highly inspiring for future work in this area."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Minor Typos in Appendix: The analysis in Appendix A, while ultimately arriving at a standard and correct result (Eq. 22), contains several confusing typos. Specifically, Equation (21) misrepresents the matrix inner product within the Trace. Maybe it should be $v_i u_i^\\top u_j v_j^\\top$ in the left one and $v_i v_i^\\top$ in the right one. \n2. The paper's primary contribution is its formulation as an unbiased minimum-variance estimator, distinguishing it from biased top-k methods like GALORE. However, the practical significance of this distinction is worth discussing given the known properties of LLM gradients. The premise of methods like GALORE is that LLM gradient spectra are \"top-heavy,\" with rapid decay, meaning the top-k singular vectors capture the vast majority of the gradient's energy and information. This empirical phenomenon is well-documented [https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07476], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03507]. Under this top-heavy assumption, the PLUMAGE sampling algorithm will likely behave in a predictable way: the deterministic rank will automatically capture these dominant directions by assigning them $p_i=1$ (because for these directions their dominant singular values satisfy $(k-r)\\sigma_r \\ge \\sum_{i=r+1}^n \\sigma_i$. Consequently, the sampling process will be truncated: the top $r^{\\*}$ components are selected with high probability (identical to top-k), and the remaining $k-r^\\*$ rank budget is used to probabilistically sample from the vast \"tail\" of non-dominant directions. Because the singular values in this tail are small and relatively uniform, the sampling probabilities $p_i$ for these tail components will be small and near-uniform ($p_i \\approx (k-r^\\*) / (n-r^\\*)$).\n3. In practice, PLUMAGE's estimator may be functionally equivalent to a standard top-k projection, augmented with adaptive, near-uniform sampling in the non-dominant subspace. While this achieves statistical unbiasedness, the paper does not sufficiently argue why this sampling of the low-energy tail is so impactful, versus simply being a minor algorithmic difference from top-k projection. Therefore, it may be necessary to provide some metrics during the training process and conduct corresponding ablation studies. For example, what is the specific distribution of $p_i$ for different parameters (like attention or MLP parameters) in the early and late stages of training, and does it indeed align with the characteristics of top-k truncation in practice? Alternatively, what are the spectral properties of the full-space gradient in the early and late stages of training? This could affect the method's difference from methods like GALORE, as this difference might emerge during the training process. For instance, does PLUMAGE's advantage stem from exploring more directions in the later stages of training? I believe these points need to be clarified in the paper.\n4. The experimental results presented do not show that the PLUMAGE method has a significant advantage. The training curves in Figure 7 suggest that the advantage over GALORE is not significant, and this effect diminishes as the model size increases. Therefore, I am curious about the true effectiveness of the method in larger-scale practical pre-training tasks. Furthermore, PLUMAGE still relies on SVD in Algorithm 5, which is not eliminated. Therefore, when considering the model sharding and parallel strategies required for large-scale experiments, an additional all-gather operation might be necessary to perform SVD on the full gradient, potentially introducing extra communication overhead."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "bHszht4Dwl", "forum": "3Tdj7p9uK3", "replyto": "3Tdj7p9uK3", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2102/Reviewer_qx4C"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2102/Reviewer_qx4C"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2102/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761926561817, "cdate": 1761926561817, "tmdate": 1762916026851, "mdate": 1762916026851, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes PLUMAGE, a probabilistic low-rank gradient estimator that aims to overcome the bias–variance limitations in existing low-rank optimizers such as GaLore and FLORA.
