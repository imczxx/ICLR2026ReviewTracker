We introduce ResPINNs, which reformulate PINNs as residual flows, networks that iteratively refine their own predictions through explicit corrective steps, in the spirit of classical iterative solvers. Our analysis shows that this design mitigates both pathologies by keeping updates aligned with descent and by preserving informative gradients across depth.

The theoretical analysis is not fully convincing. The paper identifies gradient shattering and flow mismatch as the main failure modes of PINNs and uses several theorems to justify the need for residual connections. However, prior studies have shown that other issues such as gradient conflicts, spectral bias, etc can also be major sources of error. The authors should provide quantitative evidence or controlled comparisons to demonstrate that the proposed failure modes are indeed the dominant ones.\n\n2. The experimental design in Section 5.2 is questionable. The gradual freezing strategy may seem to support iterative refinement since all stages share the same decoder. However, freezing earlier blocks fundamentally changes the optimization process compared with a standard residual network trained end to end. To support the claim, the authors should visualize intermediate blocks of ResPINN to directly show refinement behavior. \n\n3. The empirical evaluation is relatively weak. Several strong baselines are missing. The authors should compare with more competitive works such as Urbán et al. [1] and Wang et al. [2] to provide a fair and convincing performance assessment.\n\n4. The benchmarks used in the paper appear much simpler than those in recent studies [1,2], which have demonstrated substantially higher accuracy on more challenging PDEs. If existing methods already achieve better accuracy, then it may suggest that the proposed failure modes may not be the primary limitation of PINNs. The authors should consider harder tasks and report better accuracy to better support their claim.\n\n5. It seems that Piratenet has already explored the challenges of scaling PINNs to deeper architectures, but this connection is not clearly acknowledged or discussed in the paper. Without clarifying how the proposed approach differs from or extends PirateNet, the claimed novelty appears overstated.\n\n[1] Urbán, J.F., Stefanou, P. and Pons, J.A., 2025.
