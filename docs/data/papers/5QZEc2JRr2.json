Our algorithms are based on Skip List Networks (SLN), which is natural extension of skip lists that supports pairwise communication. In particular our work goes beyond learning-augmented single-source skip lists (studied recently in ICLR 2025 by Fu et al. and ICML 2024 by Zeynali et al., considering a prediction model where each node of the network individually receives a local prediction of its future communications to the rest of network. We utilize this model to develop a distributed, learning-augmented SLN to optimize the serving of any weighted pairwise demand.\n\nWe first solve the optimization problem of finding an optimal SLN given a certain demand, which we show is polynomial with a dynamic programming approach. We then introduce a novel network structure called Continuous SLN, where the heights of each node is relaxed to be any real number. Finally, we show how a random, uniform noise on top of each node's height makes the network robust against any predictions, even adversarial, while the performances are kept unchanged when the predictions are desired. Concretely, adversarial predictions can cause our network to be a logarithmic factor away from any optimal network without prediction. Furthermore, we show that, for highly sparse demands, a refined version of our algorithm shows no drawbacks in asymptotics for any prediction and presents exponential improvements when the predictions are good. Finally, we empirically show that our learning-augmented overlay network demonstrate resistance against small error with evaluations on synthetic and real-world data-sets.", "tldr": "A peer-to-peer network with improved connectivity performances in case of correct traffic predictions and still performances guarantees when the predictions are arbitrary.", "keywords": ["learning-augmented algorithms", "peer-to-peer protocol", "dynamic system", "skip list"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6125cfbc45c8d804b0cd7f0bc1d74228620fa839.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies a routing problem in networks using so-called overlay networks. More specifically, they study Skip List Networks to route demands between nodes in a network. A SLN over n nodes is defined by assigning each node a height. These heights then imply edges and routing paths. The cost for routing a bit of demand between two nodes is equal to the length of the routing paths in the number of edges.\nThe goal is to find height such that the routing cost is not too big compared to the optimal heights for the given input.\n\nThere are three main contributions:\n- A polynomial algorithm to compute the optimal heights and SLN for a given demand matrix via a dynamic program.\n- A new P2P routing protocol via continuous skip lists: here the heights are sampled uniformly at random. This matches SOTA P2P protocols.\n- Finally, the authors study this problem in a learning-augmented setting. They assume that they are given a prediction to achieve both consistency and robustness, that is, the performance if the prediction is correct or arbitrary. The prediction model is number per node, one can think of it as the optimal height for the coming demand. They present an algorithm that is $O(1)$-consistent and $O(\\log^2 n)$-robust.  \n\nMoreover, the paper contains empirical experiments that show the benefits of the proposed algorithm under synthetic data (demand matrices and predictions)."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The paper is one of the first to study network routing in a learning-augmented setting. \n- It gives a reasonable consistency-robustness tradeoff given the current SOTA bounds.\n- Besides learning-augmented results, it also contains results for the offline and oblivious setting.\n- The paper verifies its theoretical findings experimentally."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- A major weakness is that the paper only studies consistency and robustness.
