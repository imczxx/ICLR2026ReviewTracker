A common empirical defense strategy is adversarial training, yet the theoretical underpinnings of its robustness in ViTs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first theoretical analysis of adversarial training under simplified ViT architectures. We show that, when trained under a signal-to-noise ratio that satisfies a certain condition and within a moderate $\\ell_2$ perturbation budget, adversarial training enables ViTs to achieve nearly zero robust training loss and robust generalization error under certain regimes. Remarkably, this leads to strong generalization even in the presence of overfitting, a phenomenon known as \\emph{benign overfitting}, previously only observed in CNNs (with adversarial training). Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets further validate our theoretical findings.", "tldr": "We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that Vision Transformers can exhibit benign overfitting under adversarial training.", "keywords": ["Learning Theory", "Benign overfitting", "Adversarial training", "ViT"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1bcf29e013a000d479b14164c2bb01186cadabf7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "A theoretical analysis of a two layer vision transformer with adversarial training is done.

The choice of datasets are too small and not impactful. The authors only test on a synthetic dataset and MNIST. Actually, even the MNIST dataset they use is not the true MNIST dataset. The dataset the authors test on is a binarized version of the MNIST dataset. These days CIFAR-10/100 experiments are the minimum for experimentally demonstrating a viable adversarial robustness technique (with Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet also becoming norms). \n\n2.

APGD would be a much better choice (instead of PGD) and an L2 version of the APGD code has been available for multiple years:\nhttps://github.com/fra31/auto-attack\n\nI also question WHY the authors only use the l2 metric.

Generality beyond Vision Transformers:\nI am wondering whether the current theoretical investigation could be extended beyond the simplified two-layer ViT model to encompass more general Transformer architectures—for example, models with multiple self-attention layers, residual connections, layer normalization, or feed-forward blocks. It would be valuable to understand whether the derived benign overfitting behavior and robustness–generalization relationships continue to hold under these more realistic architectural settings, and whether the theoretical scaling laws remain consistent when evaluated on larger and more complex datasets beyond MNIST.\n\n## 2. Applicability to ViT variants:\nI am also curious about how the proposed theorems and analysis apply to different variants of Vision Transformers, such as Swin Transformer, DeiT, or hierarchical ViTs that modify the attention mechanism or token structure. Do the key theoretical conditions, particularly those involving the signal-to-noise ratio and perturbation magnitude, still characterize the transition between benign and harmful overfitting in these variants? Some clarification or discussion on the generality of the theoretical framework across ViT architectures would strengthen the paper’s impact and scope.\n\n## 3. Empirical validation of theoretical regimes:\nThe paper identifies three distinct regimes of adversarial perturbation (clean-like, linear-collapse, and failure). Could the authors provide more detailed empirical evidence or visualizations to confirm these transitions—perhaps by monitoring changes in attention distributions, feature alignment, or representation collapse across varying perturbation strengths? Such results would make the theoretical phase transition more tangible and strengthen the connection between theory and practice."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Dm00hF3hG1", "forum": "LsMvAGGjGc", "replyto": "LsMvAGGjGc", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7381/Reviewer_zyXo"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7381/Reviewer_zyXo"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7381/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761960304215, "cdate": 1761960304215, "tmdate": 1762919507689, "mdate": 1762919507689, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper gives a theoretical account of robust benign overfitting in a simplified two‑layer ViT trained with ℓ₂ adversarial training.
