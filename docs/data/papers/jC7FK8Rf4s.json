However, modalities observed in the source environment may differ from the modalities observed in the target environment due to multiple factors, including cost, hardware failure, or the perceived informativeness of a given modality. This shift in missingness between the source and target environment has not been carefully studied. \nNaive estimation of the information gain associated with including an additional modality without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that modality's value in the target environment. \nWe formalize the problem of missingness, demonstrate its ubiquity, and show that the subsequent distribution shift results in bias when the missingness process is not explicitly accounted for. To address this issue, we introduce ICYM2I (In Case You Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance and information gain under missingness through inverse probability weighting-based correction.\nWe demonstrate the importance of the proposed adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multimodal learning", "Distribution shifts", "Missingness"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fe200e888bf2da105f7b2918ef9cd3090f9ee963.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses missingness-induced distribution shifts in multimodal learning, a largely overlooked issue where source and target environments differ in observed modalities.

The proposed use of inverse probability weighting is theoretically grounded in classical missing-data and statistical literature, and its adaptation to multimodal settings is elegant. The integration with information-theoretic concepts, particularly the extension of PID under missingness, is well-motivated and contributes to a deeper understanding of modality interactions. Overall, the paper is well-written, the motivation is convincing, and the theoretical framing is solid and potentially impactful."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Despite its strong conceptual foundation, the paper’s methodological presentation is somewhat difficult to follow. Understanding the full framework requires frequent reference to the appendix, which makes it challenging to reconstruct the complete algorithmic pipeline from the main text. In particular, Step 2 and Step 10 of Algorithm 1, which concern the estimation of the missingness mechanism $p_{\\Omega_\\phi}(m|C)$ and its integration into the weighting scheme, are crucial for comprehension and should be explicitly detailed in the main body. It also remains unclear how exactly this missingness model is parameterized or estimated in practice. Moreover, the objective of minimizing $I(Y; (X_1, X_2))$ appears counterintuitive and should be clarified, as mutual information is typically maximized in multimodal fusion. From an empirical perspective, while the synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments are carefully designed and demonstrate the motivation, the work lacks convincing real-world evidence that the proposed correction improves downstream predictive performance. Correcting modality informativeness estimates is valuable, but readers are left wondering whether a practitioner facing genuinely missing modalities would actually see performance gains by applying ICYM2I. Finally, the framework’s dependence on a particular parameterization $q_\\theta = \\exp(f_1 f_2)$ is restrictive; demonstrating that the approach generalizes across different fusion architectures would strengthen the empirical case and enhance credibility. Lastly, a weakness regarding the submission is that the code has not been shared, either in the supplementary material or via an anonymized GitHub repository, which limits reproducibility and verification of the claims.
