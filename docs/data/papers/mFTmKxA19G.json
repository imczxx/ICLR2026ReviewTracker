In such cases, a few-shot training set is necessary to define the classification task on demand. Motivated by this, we investigate the performance of VLMs in open-set recognition (OSR), where an VLM is fine-tuned on a few-shot training set to recognize closed-set classes while identifying and rejecting samples from open-set ones, i.e., without compromising its open-vocabulary capabilities.We design a comprehensive benchmark to study this problem, varying along four key axes: (1) label granularity (fine- vs. coarse-grained classes), (2) the semantic distance of open-set classes from closed-set ones (OSR hardness), constructed using hierarchical taxonomies, (3) the number of training samples per class, and (4) fine-tuning objectives (discriminative vs. likelihood-based). Through systematic evaluation of CLIP-based and diffusion-based VLMs, we find that discriminative approaches are often misaligned with standard OSR hardness metrics, leading to unreliable rejection behavior. In contrast, the likelihood-based paradigm becomes tractable in the context of VLMs, and we propose a simple method based on a likelihood-ratio test that achieves strong OSR performance when given sufficient examples to model class-conditional likelihoods.Overall, our results demonstrate that OSR remains a relevant and underexplored challenge even in the era of VLMs. We provide actionable insights and a new benchmark to support future research toward more robust open-world recognition.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["open-set recognition", "vision-language models"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cd7b6b12831a4a0b8624c089c54f7d06987d7d7c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/273fbbbed92d03f7184d701865ccd10c862ad76b.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces OpenVL-Bench, a large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate Open-Set Recognition (OSR) capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under few-shot fine-tuning.

The description of Equation (7) is somewhat confusing. The equation seems to imply that if the class-conditional generation result is closer to the unconditional generation, it indicates a weaker match between the given class condition and the input image. However, it is unclear how the authors justify that the unconditional generation result is necessarily close to that obtained under an incorrect class condition. In other words, as the denoising process proceeds, the diffusion model may already be capable of producing high-quality reconstructions even without any conditioning at the later timesteps. How do the authors account for or eliminate the influence of this effect in their formulation?\n2. What changes occur in the image generation quality of SD-LRT before and after LoRA fine-tuning?
