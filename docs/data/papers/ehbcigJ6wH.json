Standard spectrograms, based on the short-time Fourier transform, are constrained by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, consequently, fixed-resolution detectors often miss critical information.  We propose MRS-YOLO, a multi-resolution extension of YOLO that processes spectrograms at complementary scales through parallel branches and fuses them with an attention block.  On a challenging dataset of heterogeneous radio-frequency signals with spectral congestion, low SNR, and stealthy emissions, MRS-YOLO achieves higher recall in low-SNR regimes and stronger classification accuracy than single-resolution baselines, demonstrating the value of explicit multi-scale representation learning in TF analysis.

The multi-resolution formulation is well-motivated by the Heisenberg uncertainty trade-off, and the analogy to multi-scale vision detection is articulated with clarity and precision.\n2.  The integration of parallel spectrogram branches with pyramidal fusion is elegant and computationally efficient. The SCSA-based fusion and TF-Attn block demonstrate an insightful adaptation of attention to spectro-temporal data.\n3. The authors conduct a detailed series of ablations isolating the effect of backbone design, fusion strategy, and attention mechanism, giving the reader confidence in the architectural choices.\n4.  The paper provides multiple metrics (mAP, recall at varying SNRs, confusion matrices) and well-controlled baselines (five single-resolution YOLOv11 variants plus an oracle ensemble).\n5. The structure is methodical, figures and tables are generally informative, and the technical descriptions are mathematically consistent."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Weaknesses\n1. The dataset is fully synthetic and unavailable due to security concerns. Without public access or at least detailed signal specifications, reproducibility and external validation are limited. The lack of evaluation on any real RF or audio dataset weakens claims of generality.\n2. All baselines are internal YOLO variants. There is no comparison against other contemporary TF-detection models (e.g. Transformer-based or CNN–RNN hybrids) beyond citation. Including such results would help quantify the practical significance of the proposed method.\n3. While numerous design factors are tested, statistical variation (e.g. standard deviation across runs) and significance tests are missing. The improvements, though consistent, may be within normal training noise.\n4. The novelty is incremental rather than fundamental—essentially a careful engineering synthesis of known ideas (multi-resolution processing + attention-based fusion). The manuscript could benefit from a more critical discussion of why TF-Attn or SCSA outperform simpler attention blocks in spectrogram domains.\n5. Although runtime efficiency is claimed, FLOPs and latency are compared inconsistently across models. The fairness of these comparisons (especially versus the oracle ensemble) should be clarified.\n6. A few sections verge on tutorial style; condensing the literature survey would improve focus. The “LLM usage disclosure” is unnecessary for a scientific paper and should be omitted in a final version.\n7. No results on transferability, robustness to unseen modulation types, or sensitivity to window parameter choices are provided. These are crucial for applications in electronic warfare or spectrum monitoring."}, "questions": {"value": "plz see my detailed comments above"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "jOolgOVNLa", "forum": "ehbcigJ6wH", "replyto": "ehbcigJ6wH", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24326/Reviewer_vBRR"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24326/Reviewer_vBRR"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24326/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761927024927, "cdate": 1761927024927, "tmdate": 1762943042620, "mdate": 1762943042620, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "MRS-YOLO is the method introduced by the authors for TF based signal detection.
