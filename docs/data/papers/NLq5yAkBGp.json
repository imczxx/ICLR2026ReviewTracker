The paper contains many typographical errors, inconsistent reference formats, incorrect indentation, possibly irregular line spacing, and even the format of the title. These formatting issues significantly reduce readability and professionalism.\n\n2. The paper lacks intuitive visual explanations. It mainly relies on dense text and formulas without providing a clear framework or pipeline diagram to help readers grasp the overall architecture. A method figure illustrating the interaction between the world model, semantic modules, GNN, and policy learning would be highly beneficial.\n\n**Content**\n\n3. Large portions of the appendix repeat content from the main text or from previous works (e.g., Appendix A). This redundancy dilutes the technical contribution and makes the paper unnecessarily long. The appendix should instead focus on additional experimental details or proofs.\n\n4. The claimed novelty—a free-energy formulation integrating geometric uncertainty, semantic novelty, and Age of Information (AoI)—is not well supported in the main text. The proposed framework, SCENE, appears as a combination of existing components (semantic segmentation, implicit neural mapping, GNN coordination, MARL training) rather than a clearly novel formulation. Much of the main content describes prior methods rather than highlighting what is new. The manuscript would benefit from a sharper focus on how the proposed free-energy objective differs from or generalizes existing EIG-based exploration frameworks.\n\n5. The reinforcement learning reward is defined purely as the reduction in global free energy, which essentially maximizes exploration. However, no task-specific objective is considered, making the learned behavior potentially suboptimal or misaligned with missions. The framework should clarify how goal-oriented collaboration emerges beyond exploration alone.\n\n6. The paper merges Introduction and Related Work into one section, resulting in an incomplete discussion of prior literature. Given the heavy use of established methods, the authors should include a dedicated Related Work section addressing at least: Cognitive free-energy or active inference frameworks in robotics; GNN-based multi-robot coordination; Multi-agent reinforcement learning for exploration and collaboration, and so on.\n\n**Experiments**\n\n7. The experiments lack several important baselines and ablation studies, especially those testing the contribution of individual components in the free-energy formulation. Additionally, insufficient analysis of hyperparameters (e.g., weighting factors, only half a page with one simple result) is provided, leaving unclear how sensitive the performance is to these choices. More comprehensive evaluation and sensitivity analysis are necessary to substantiate the claimed robustness and generality.\n\n8. All evaluations are conducted in simulated environments.
