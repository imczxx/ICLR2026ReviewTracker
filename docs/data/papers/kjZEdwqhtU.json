While VLMs are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring comparative judgment, including automated evaluation, re-ranking, and retrieval-augmented generation, no systematic framework exists to measure their performance in these scenarios. We present PairBench, a simple framework that evaluates VLMs as customizable similarity tools using widely available image datasets. Our approach introduces four key metrics for reliable comparison: alignment with scores derived from human annotations, consistency across pair ordering, distribution smoothness, and controllability through prompting. Our analysis reveals that no model consistently excels across all metrics, with each demonstrating distinct strengths and weaknesses. Most concerning is the widespread inability of VLMs to maintain symmetric similarity scores. Interestingly, we demonstrate that performance on our benchmark strongly correlates with popular benchmarks used for complex reasoning tasks, while providing additional insight into controllability, smoothness and ordering. This makes PairBench a unique and comprehensive framework to evaluate the performance of VLMs for automatic evaluation, while offering an efficient predictor of model capabilities for more complex tasks.", "tldr": "We introduce a benchmark to evaluate how good models are in terms of comparing data.

Currently, applications of the visual comparison like automatic evaluation, retrieval re-ranking, and retrieval-augmented generation lacks systematic assessment. Existing evaluation methods either fail to isolate comparison ability from other model capabilities, rely on costly human annotation, or overlook critical flaws in state-of-the-art VLMs (e.g., score asymmetry when reversing image pair order). To address this, the author proposes PAIRBENCH, a low-cost, reproducible framework for evaluating VLMs’ visual comparison reliability. The framework’s design is anchored in two key components: (1) A controllable dataset of 70K pairs, derived from three public benchmarks (ImageNet, MS-COCO, WhatsUp), with pairs categorized as Identical (near-duplicate/images-text matches), Transformed (images with controlled manipulations like color jitter), or Irrelevant (unrelated content); ground truth (GT) scores are validated via 70+ human annotators. (2) Four complementary metrics to quantify reliability: MMScore (Kendall Tau alignment with human rankings, primary metric), ε-RelaxSym (order consistency, ε=1), Smoothness (score distribution diversity via entropy), and Controllability (responsiveness to prompt instructions). Experimental results across VLMs reveal no model dominates all metrics (e.g., GPT-5 achieves the highest MMScore (83.63%) but lower Smoothness, while InternVL2.5-8B leads open-source models (MMScore: 81.50%)). Critically, PAIRBENCH metrics (notably MMScore) exhibit strong correlations with complex reasoning benchmarks (90% with MMMU, 80% with HallusionBench)."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "Methodological Rigor in Dataset and Metric Design: The dataset is controllable and human-validated, which is derived from 3 public benchmarks (ImageNet, MS-COCO, WhatsUp) to ensure reproducibility, with pairs categorized into Identical/Transformed/Irrelevant to isolate specific visual variations.

Instead, it frames comparison ability as a core engine for complex tasks."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Disconnect between the bench’s Pair design and practical visual comparison demands: The current framework defines three Pair types (Identical/Transformed/Irrelevant) based on trivial visual manipulations (e.g., color jitter, basic rotation, Gaussian blur) or simple content overlap (e.g., near-duplicate images, random irrelevant content). However, these designs fail to capture the core real-world capabilities users actually care about: specifically, a model’s ability to (1) recognize the same object across diverse perspectives (e.g., a chair viewed from the front vs. side vs. top, with varying lighting/occlusion) and (2) establish cross-scenario consistency (e.g., identifying a cat in a studio photo vs. a street scene vs. a cartoon illustration). For example, the \"Transformed\" Pair in PAIRBENCH only applies superficial, single-dimensional changes (e.g., shifting hue or rotating by 90°) that rarely challenge a model’s fundamental object identity cognition. In contrast, real applications (e.g., retail product retrieval, autonomous driving object tracking, medical image diagnosis) require models to ignore viewpoint or scene variations while preserving object consistency. This \"toy-like\" design reduces the bench’s ecological validity: even if a model performs well on PAIRBENCH, it provides little assurance of its utility in scenarios where visual comparison truly matters. The paper also fails to justify why it prioritizes trivial manipulations over these high-stakes real-world needs, weakening the motivation for the bench’s existence.\n\nInappropriate statement: The paper’s core value proposition that framing PAIRBENCH as an \"efficient surrogate for model selection\" (via MMScore’s correlation with complex benchmarks like MMMU) suffers from flawed causal inference. The observed strong correlations (e.g., 90% between MMScore and MMMU) are not evidence of PAIRBENCH’s \"representativeness,\" but rather likely a byproduct of a confounding variable: the model’s general visual understanding ability. A model with strong inherent visual capabilities will naturally perform well on both PAIRBENCH (which relies on basic visual similarity judgment) and complex multimodal tasks. The paper provides no evidence to rule out this alternative explanation: for instance, it does not test whether there exist models with weak general visual ability but strong PAIRBENCH performance (that then fail at complex tasks), or vice versa. Without such control experiments, the claim that PAIRBENCH is a \"valid surrogate\" collapses into a trivial observation: \"models good at visual tasks are good at visual tasks.\""}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Treating all distinct images as maximally dissimilar regardless of semantic content makes it difficult for me to see how insights from the benchmark can be generalized. Though perhaps I am missing something in the pair construction or the ground-truth score assignment.\n- As a corollary, setting ground-truth similarity scores to only 3 distinct values could affect the validity of MMScores.
