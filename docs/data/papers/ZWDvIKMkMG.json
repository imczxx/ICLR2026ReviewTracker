Existing methods struggle in such settings. Pretraining routines\ntypically overlook structural anomalies under limited supervision, while online\nmodels often fail to adapt to changing fraud patterns without labeled updates. To\naddress these issues, we propose the Continual Fiedler Vector Graph model (Con-\nFVG), a fraud detection framework designed for label-scarce and non-stationary\nenvironments. The framework comprises two key components. To mitigate la-\nbel scarcity, we develop a Fiedler Vector-guided graph autoencoder that lever-\nages spectral graph properties to learn structure-aware node representations. The\nFiedler Vector, derived from the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Lapla-\ncian, captures global topological signals such as community boundaries and con-\nnectivity bottlenecks, which are patterns frequently associated with collusive\nfraud. This enables the model to identify structurally anomalous nodes without\nrelying on labels. To handle evolving graph streams, we propose a Subgraph At-\ntention Fusion (SAF) module that constructs neighborhood subgraphs and applies\nattention-based reweighting to emphasize emerging high-risk structures. This de-\nsign allows the model to adapt to new fraud patterns in real time. A Mean Teacher\nmechanism further stabilizes online updates and prevents forgetting of previously\nacquired knowledge.

The design of the proposed method heavily relies on the core assumption that \"connected nodes share similar smoothness values.\" However, it does not provide relevant statistical evidence on the medical insurance dataset to validate this assumption.

The proposed solution, combining spectral graph theory (Fiedler vector) for unsupervised representation learning with a continual learning framework (subgraph attention and mean teacher) for adaptation, is a novel and clever integration of ideas from different domains.\n\n- The experimental results are comprehensive and convincing. The authors demonstrate that ConFVG consistently outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines, including both offline and online models, across multiple datasets (Medical, YelpChi, Amazon) and under challenging low-label rate scenarios (1% and 10%). The performance improvement is substantial, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed components.\n\n- The method is well-grounded in theory. The use of the Fiedler vector to capture global topological anomalies like community boundaries and bottlenecks is theoretically sound for identifying collusive fraud. The design of the Subgraph Attention Fusion module to handle evolving graph structures is intuitive and addresses a key limitation of traditional GNNs that focus only on existing connections."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The core of the pre-training phase relies on calculating the Fiedler vector, which involves an eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix (𝐿).

While the paper demonstrates strong results on the given datasets, it does not address how this approach would scale to real-world graphs containing millions or billions of nodes.\n\n- The online learning phase introduces a Subgraph Attention Fusion (SAF) module that unconventionally operates on the complement of the graph's largest components. The paper lacks a clear and deep intuition for this design choice. While traditional GNNs learn by aggregating information from existing connections (neighbors), it is not immediately obvious how aggregating features from non-connected nodes helps the model adapt to new and emerging fraud patterns.\n\n- The method introduces a critical hyperparameter 𝜖  in Equation 4 to connect disparate graph components. The choice of this value is crucial, as too small a value may not enforce connectivity, while too large a value could introduce significant noise and distort the graph's original spectral properties, which are fundamental to the Fiedler vector's utility.
