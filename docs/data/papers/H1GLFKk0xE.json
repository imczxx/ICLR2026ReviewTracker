However, this direction remains underexplored due to challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain signals.\nIn this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a novel hierarchical decoding framework  that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction.\nFurthermore, we introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. \nUnlike conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\\% accuracy on average yet generates each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast and clinically scalable solution.", "tldr": "A cognitive process-inspired fMRI-to-video framework that hierarchically aligns brain features with CLIP representations and enables subject-agnostic applicability.", "keywords": ["fMRI", "brain decoding", "video reconstruction", "cross-subject generalization", "visual cortex", "contrastive learning", "zero-shot decoding"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5f472d616ec0ec0b52a0f7da333585ff8455ba23.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4f3fbe5c365ea47bde2f2065957b086708992186.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes VCFLOW, a cognitive process–inspired architecture for cross-subject fmri-to-video decoding.

I agree that generalization to unseen subjects is very important. However, I do not fully agree that the reliability of the method can be demonstrated in the video reconstruction task. As is well known, current brain video reconstruction largely depends on the pre-trained Diffusion model to achieve its effects. Then, we calculate the indicators based on the generated videos. I believe the results are heavily influenced by the generation model rather than actual brain decoding. (In other words, brain decoding might only produce very high-dimensional and not detailed semantic information, which the diffusion model then uses to generate the video. In fact, the results shown in Figure 5 also reflect this point. Current brain decoding is likely to have provided only very vague information. We evaluate everything based on the generated video, and there are too many factors in between that can influence the outcome.)\n\n2. Based on the article's indicators, the improvement is minimal. In the 50-way scenario, it only increased by 2% to 4% compared to other pre-training methods, resulting in just 2 to 4 more images correctly identified out of 100 samples. Additionally, the pixel-level metrics are very low, so they offer limited comparative value. Even a completely black image can reach a PSNR of around 10. \n\n3. The study had too few subjects. With only three participants involved, it is very difficult to rule out coincidental factors and establish a clear pattern. The works Clip-Mused [1] and TGBD [2] focus on retrieving image/video frames based on brain signals for multiple subjects. Particularly, TGBD is also designed for unseen subjects, utilizing the HCP[3] dataset (with over 170 participants). The main conclusion is that as the number of participants increased, the generalization ability on unseen participants significantly improved. I think TGBD could provide inspiration for this work and should be included by related works, as one of the few studies that focused on the unseen subjects. Maybe the author's method is limited by the number of participants. When the number of participants is sufficient, a much greater performance gap might be achieved.\n\n\n[1] CLIP-MUSED: CLIP-guided multi-subject visual neural information semantic decoding, ICLR2024\n\n[2] Toward Generalizing Visual Brain Decoding to Unseen Subjects, ICLR2025\n\n[3] The WU-Minn Human Connectome Project: An Overview.

The research area of this paper is fMRI-to-video reconstruction, with a focus on the challenge of cross-subject transfer (generalization to new/unseen subjects).

Although the authors emphasize the cross-subject issue, only about one-third of the proposed methods (Section 3.2) are actually related to this problem, with the majority focusing on designing fMRI model architectures that better align with human visual mechanisms and on improving representation learning methods.\n\nFurthermore, I believe the paper lacks certain methodological and evaluation details regarding cross-subject transfer; the authors do not explain how the model adapts when new subjects are introduced.

The abstract and the first two paragraphs of the introduction strongly emphasize the issue of transfer/generalization to unseen subjects. However, in the third paragraph of the introduction (lines 73–94), the methods described by the authors have no relation to this issue. This creates a jarring shift in the writing. Similarly, after reading the Introduction, I think the authors should focus on how to achieve transfer to unseen subjects. Yet, in the methods section, only one design is actually related to this issue. Therefore, I believe the introduction of the manuscript requires substantial revision and should not solely emphasize the transfer to unseen subjects.\n\n2. I am fairly familiar with the related work. Essentially, the token extension method proposed by the authors in Section 3.2 assigns subject-specific tokens to each participant. This approach has actually appeared previously in fMRI-to-Image studies [1]. However, it should be acknowledged that in the fMRI-to-Video task, the authors may indeed be the first to apply this method.\n\n3.
