This work investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed at enhancing OOD algorithmic generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii) algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively, these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust OOD generalization abilities.", "tldr": "This paper explores a set of architectural mechanisms to support algorithmic generalization in Transformers through a recurrent latent space reasoning approach.", "keywords": ["algorithmic generalization", "out-of-distribution", "OOD generalization", "compositional", "systematic generalization", "transformer", "transformer architecture"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6eb41b42a3b59dd5485abdfe878265192c3305ae.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies Transformer length generalization on a modular arithmetic on computational graph task.

Algorithmic generalization is an open and important challenge in AI; approaching the problem in a principled way with a controllable dataset that does not impose any secondary effects (as in natural language) is commendable.\n2.\tThe paper indeed goes to incredible lengths to make the performance of individual architectures hyperparameter invariant. Indeed, hyperparameters of every architecture are individually optimized, and the extensive Appendix describes all ablations. The rigor in hyperparameter search is highly appreciated."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "My main concern is the missing connection to related work. The paper is written like starting from a blank sheet of paper. While this makes the reading very coherent and easy to follow, it makes the distinction to already known insights from the literature difficult. Specifically, I would appreciate the following connections to related works:\n\n1.\tMissing connection to arithmetic tasks testing length generalization. There is an active area of research on evaluating the expressiveness of neural networks on algorithmic tasks [Dziri et al. 2023, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18654 ] [Thomm et al. 2024, https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05785 ], specifically targeting length generalization too. Having a comparison to some of the tasks, would be appreciated. It is crucial to situate the proposed task within existing benchmarks and compare the task's difficulty and characteristics against well-known algorithmic generalization tasks.\n2.\tMissing connection to results reported in the literature. As already mentioned in the strengths, the paper creates reasonable baselines for their task. Yet, it could still be that some techniques had been missed [Csordás et al. 2022, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12284 ]. One way to have a more credible comparison is to use (or better reproduce) results from the literature. Given that there already exist tasks on algorithmic length generalization (see Weakness 1), one could use these tasks and baseline performance as an anchor point. To strengthen the claim that the current task is uniquely challenging or that the proposed architecture is necessary, the authors should reproduce and report the performance of the standard feed-forward Transformer on a canonical, related task to establish a clear anchor and ground the observed failures.\n3.\tMissing connection to findings on recurrent neural networks. I find it quite hard to categorize the insights gained in this work. The main issue lies in that many of the techniques have already been proposed and validated in previous works (though in different tasks): recurrence [35] [Abnar et al. 2023, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08866 ], or discretization [Wang et al. 2025, https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734 ]. Hence, the main contribution of the paper can be read as finding the necessary ingredients to enable OOD length generalization on a single task. I am convinced that the findings can translate to other algorithmic tasks; it just would have to be demonstrated. The major issue is the task-specific nature of the findings. I strongly encourage the authors to demonstrate the generalizability of the necessary ingredients (recurrence + supervision + discretization) by applying the full successful model to at least one other standard OOD length generalization task from the literature."}, "questions": {"value": "Besides answering the main weaknesses (W1-W3), I have the following minor questions:\n\n1.
