To train agents for this dynamic process, particularly in multimodal contexts, we introduce a sandbox environment for reinforcement learning (RL) that supports tool calling and speech-based user simulation. Our core strategy, Turn-level Adjudicated Reinforcement Learning (TARL), addresses the challenge of credit assignment in long-horizon tasks by employing a Large Language Model (LLM) as a judge to provide turn-level evaluation. To enhance exploration, we integrate a mixed-task training curriculum with mathematical reasoning problems. This unified approach boosts the task pass rate on the text-based $\\tau$-bench by over 6% compared to strong RL baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate our framework's suitability for fine-tuning a multimodal LLM for agentic tasks. By training a base multimodal LLM on interleaved speech-text rollouts, we equip it with tool-use abilities, paving the way for more natural, voice-driven interactive agents.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Interactive Tool-Use Agents", "Multimodal Agents", "Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/12df17e280c544c4bef5040194fdeb77c0a0c484.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper provides several interesting contributions to the community, namely: (1) a sandbox for text and speech training with RL and (2) ablations showing that training with *speech and text* with RL is more effective on both domains than training with text alone, (3) a method using trajectory level rewards designed by an LLM-as-a-judge annotating turn-level rewards that improves performance significantly on tao-bench, and (4) results demonstrating that mixed-task training and curriculum learning are an effective strategy for RL."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The abstract, introduction & title of the algorithm all seem to indicate that turn-level (e.g. token level) reward assignment is critical to algorithm success.
