We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation.\nPrior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view—attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from $~2\\times$ to $4\\times$. Remarkably, it improves Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233\\% and 40.5\\% over the previous best method at $4\\times$ extrapolation. Furthermore, our method generalizes seamlessly to downstream tasks such as controllable video synthesis and editing.", "tldr": "We present a training-free, plug-and-play method that pushes the practical extrapolation limit from 2× to 4×.", "keywords": ["video diffusion model", "video generation", "diffusion transformer", "video length extrapoaltion"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1a3ead9eda55a672ae65635896899b00cacdda10.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/cadfb1f7840280ea36c400b23761699b27a3ea16.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Video Length Extrapolation adapts pretrained video diffusion transformers to generate sequences longer than training in a single pass, but models typically loop content and lose quality beyond trained length 𝐿.

State-of-the-art text-to-video diffusion models are trained on fixed-duration clips (e.g. 5 seconds) and struggle beyond that length. The paper highlights the two failure modes that emerge as sequence length grows: (i) periodic content repetition, and (ii) quality degradation affecting all models. These issues worsen at longer extrapolations, limiting practical use. Prior work such as RIFLEx addressed repetition via positional encoding tweaks but did not solve the widespread quality drop. The author(s) of this paper identify a unified cause behind both failures, i.e, attention dispersion. When generating beyond the trained window, new frames dilute the model's learned attention focus, causing it to spread attention too broadly. In extreme cases, Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) harmonics can organize this dispersion into a periodic pattern, explaining the looping behavior. More generally, dispersion leads to the model losing focus on fine details and mixing unrelated temporal contexts. Building on this insight, the paper introduces UltraViCo. It is a training-free, plug-and-play method to restore the model’s focus during long video generation. The author(s) claim impressive gains in video quality and temporal dynamics on multiple text-to-video diffusion models (HunyuanVideo 1.3B, CogVideoX 5B, and Wan 2.1) and various extrapolation lengths."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

UltraViCo down-weights the influence of very distant frames. A possible side effect is that the model might lose some long-term context or consistency. The paper asserts that important content is preserved while removing irrelevant far-context influence but it does not rigorously quantify scene consistency over extremely long videos. In one ablation, using too small an $\\alpha$ caused a car tire to disappear in later frames, indicating that overly concentrating attention can indeed harm persistent content.\n\n2.  The approach requires a massive computational cost for generating long videos. The authors report needing ~8 A800 GPU-hours per video for 4x extrapolation on the largest model, which forced them to use a reduced number of samples for evaluation.\n\n3. The paper focuses comparisons on inference-time extrapolation techniques (RoPE/PE variants and RIFLEx), which is appropriate, yet omits direct comparison to some alternative approaches for long video generation. For example, sequential generation methods like FIFO-Diffusion or diffusion re-initialization schemes (NUWA-XL, Flexible Diffusion Modeling for long videos Neurips 2022, interactive video generation via domain adaptation, and others) could also produce long videos. The authors cite these works and justifiably note they are different.\n\n4. The theoretical analysis stops short of fully justifying the chosen solution. The idea of suppressing out-of-window attention is intuitively motivated and empirically validated, but there isn’t a formal framework proving it as an optimal or necessary fix. For example, the harmonic analysis (Proposition 1) explains when periodic repetition arises, but there’s no analogous theory for why a constant decay factor is the best way to concentrate attention."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Does suppressing distant-frame attention risk any long-term coherence issues? In particular, how does UltraViCo ensure that important elements present in the first few frames like background setting, main character identity, etc. are still represented in later frames, given those early frames’ influence is decayed?\n\n2. The paper positions as complementary to other long-video generation techniques. Have the author(s) tested or considered combining UltraViCo with such methods? For instance, could one apply UltraViCo in a sliding-window generation to further improve consistency at the window boundaries, or use it alongside a method like FreeNoise to additionally boost temporal stability?\n\n3. The implementation mentions setting the first frame decay factor to a negative value to counteract blurring. Could the authors clarify why the first frame needed special treatment?\n\n4. How should one choose the decay parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ for a new model or a different extrapolation ratio?
