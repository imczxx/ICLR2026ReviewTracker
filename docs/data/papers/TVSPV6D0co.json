This bit-centric view imposes a hard ceiling on capacity and prevents watermarks from carrying useful information. We propose LatentSeal, which reframes watermarking as semantic communication: a lightweight text autoencoder maps full-sentence messages into a compact 256-dimensional unit-norm latent vector, which is robustly embedded by a finetuned watermark model and secured through a secret, invertible rotation.\nThe resulting system hides full-sentence messages, decodes in real time, and survives valuemetric and geometric attacks. It surpasses prior state of the art in BLEU-4 and Exact Match on several benchmarks, while breaking through the long-standing 256-bit payload ceiling. It also introduces a statistically calibrated score that yields a ROC AUC score of 0.97-0.99, and practical operating points for deployment.\nBy shifting from bit payloads to semantic latent vectors, LatentSeal enables watermarking that is not only robust and high-capacity, but also secure and interpretable, providing a concrete path toward provenance, tamper explanation, and trustworthy AI governance. Models, training and inference code, and data splits will be available upon publication (code available in a the supplementary zip file).", "tldr": "LatentSeal turns watermarking into semantic communication: encode a sentence into a 256-D unit-norm latent, secure it via key-conditioned rotation, embed robustly to survive common edits, decode in real time with calibrated AUROC 0.97–0.99.", "keywords": ["Computer Vision", "Watermarking", "Autoencoder", "Security", "Representation Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d684d0cfc85f07a53c73a58c281039c519c7869f.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3b116136a555b6803bf4199f7e90703a72b4109e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a novel image watermarking method called LatentSeal, which shifts the watermarking paradigm from the traditional \"bitstream\" approach to a \"semantic communication\" model.

Comparison to existing work. My understanding is that LatentSeal is autoencoder + VideoSeal. It is helpful to further explain the difference and innovation compared to VideoSeal. \n2. Watermark detection. The detection mechanism and its justification remain unclear. Specifically, in Figure 1, $\\hat{y}$ denotes the latent vector extracted from an image, and $\\hat{y}{\\mathrm{rec}} = E \\odot D(\\hat{y})$, where $E$ and $D$ represent the encoder and decoder, respectively. The authors claim that an image is authentic if $\\hat{y}$ is close to $\\hat{y}{\\mathrm{rec}}$. However, for any in-distribution latent vector $y$, a well-trained autoencoder typically satisfies $E \\odot D(y) \\approx y$. This suggests that closeness between $\\hat{y}$ and $\\hat{y}_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ alone may not imply authenticity, as the relationship between $\\hat{y}$ and the true latent vector $y$ remains unknown. Could the authors clarify how the confidence score in Equation (4) effectively captures this relationship?\n3. Secret Rotation. What is the motivation for introducing the secret rotation layer? Please provide an example or real-world scenario where this component is necessary or advantageous for security or robustness.\n4. How does the method’s performance change if the latent vector dimensionality is altered (e.g., not fixed at 255)? Some empirical evidence would strengthen the claims of generality. \n5. I would suggest add more basline methods such as DwtDct [1], Stable Signature [2], RAW [3], and etc. Comparing with them in terms of the AUC-ROC score helps to understand the cost of embedding meaningful messages. \n\n[1] Cox I J, Miller M L, Bloom J A, et al.
