These fundamental properties reveal the functional relationships that sustain ecosystems, enabling more accurate predictions of biodiversity responses to environmental change. Existing methods are computationally expensive, not scalable, and hard to interpret ecologically. We provide a first rigorous formalization of food web alignment based on network motifs, and show existing methods popularized in the ecological community are equivalent to minimizing a Fused Gromov-Wasserstein-like cost functional, termed Wasserstein Motifs. Moreover, we propose an interpretable and provably correct algorithm that efficiently computes non-deterministic alignments between food webs by leveraging their representation as feature measure networks. As a byproduct, we introduce a novel approach for the identification of non-deterministic backbones of interactions. Experiments on a continental-scale dataset of 129 Sub-Saharan African mammal food webs demonstrate significant gains in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability over state-of-the-art methods.

The paper gives clear formalization of a long-standing ecological heuristic. Proposition 2 shows that in the deterministic case with $\\alpha$=1 and Pearson-based feature discrepancy, the objective (Eq. 1) matches the annealing score of Mora et al. up to an additive constant, hence they share minimizers.  This provides a principled geometric footing for that heuristic within their OT-style framework.\n\n2. The formulation presented in the paper naturally supports many-to-many correspondences via a transport plan $T$ under $\\leq$ marginal constraints. The objective splits into a zeroth-order feature term <T, C> by using motif-role features and a first-order, adjacency-aware term <T,A_1 (T⊙C) A_2> that promotes neighborhood-consistent matches. A self-alignment penalty controlled by ε discourages degenerate self-mass solutions, improving ecological plausibility. Algorithm 1’s KL-BAPG with Dykstra projections gives a lightweight routine and enforces the ≤ marginal constraints by simple multiplicative rescaling, making the method easy to implement and numerically stable.\n\n\n3. The paper generalizes the backbone concept to non-deterministic mappings by introducing a role-similarity score and a fractional, triangle-based transitivity.
