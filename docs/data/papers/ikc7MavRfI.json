While observational studies (OBS) are a primary data source for estimating CATE, they are susceptible to bias from unmeasured confounding. The marginal sensitivity model (MSM) addresses this by quantifying the robustness of causal conclusions to such confounding via a sensitivity parameter, Γ. However, a significant limitation of MSM is the need for researchers to subjectively specify Γ, which lacks a data-driven basis and undermines the reliability of inferences. Recent methods that use randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to calibrate Γ are promising but critically depend on having a large RCT sample, which is often unavailable in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Bayesian Marginal Sensitivity Calibration (BMSC) framework. BMSC learns the sensitivity parameter Γ directly from fused RCT and OBS data, shifting the paradigm from subjective specification to data-driven estimation. Our approach constructs a CATE envelope from OBS, calibrates Γ by assessing the alignment with RCT estimates, and produces robust CATE intervals with valid coverage guarantees. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show that BMSC provides sharper, more accurate intervals than methods using subjective Γ values, and remains effective even when the RCT sample size is very small.

Is the goal to infer gamma to quantify confounding strength within the observational data, or is it to infer the CATE? I doubt the latter would benefit from inferring gamma but would rather require a data fusion approach, as in, for example, \"Removing Hidden Confounding by Experimental Grounding\" by Kallus et al. Additionally, I am not convinced why we would ever need to report the partially identified CATE interval for RCTs. EIther, (i) we should use the identified RCT estimator and report confidence intervals, or (ii) report an observational-data enhanced estimator (e.g., from Kallus) and also obtain confidence intervals. This way we obtain an asymptotically consistent estimator with vanishing interval size, while the partial identification bounds can be non-informative and do not get tighter with increasing sample size.\n- Related to the previous point, it is unclear to me why the proposed method outperforms data-fusion methods. Estimating gamma should not be necessary when the target is CATE estimation; a simple debiasing approach should be sufficient. I suspect that the improvements are due to modeling choices and not due to the actual benefit of estimating gamma.\n- Unclear theoretical claims. Theorem 1 and its proof are known in the literature.

The separation between novel contributions and existing results (e.g. Theorem 1) is unclear, and the first four pages feel redundant. Several statements are labeled as \"Remarks\" (e.g. Remark 1, Remark 2) that would read better as standard paragraphs. Assumptions for key theorems (e.g. Theorem 2) are missing or only partially stated in the main text; this obscures the scope and impact of the contribution and undermines confidence in the theory.\n2. Novelty: The work appears to assemble established components (MSM envelopes, simple grid posterior) with the main novelty being the posterior construction for $\\Gamma$. Several proofs read as straightforward applications of Bayes’ rule rather than introducing fundamentally new ideas.\n3. Assumptions behind Theorem 2. Assumption 1 (Appendix A.1.4) models the RCT-based CATE estimate as $\\hat{\\tau}(x) = \\tau(x) + \\mathcal{N}(0,\\hat{s}^2(x))$, where $\\hat{s}^2(x)$ is a random quantity depending on the RCT. At minimum, the variance term should be treated as a (conditionally) non-random population quantity. In any case, the conditional Gaussianity is restrictive and should be discussed in the main text. Additionally, this requires an analysis of how the method behaves (for small sample sizes) if this assumption is violated.\n4. The estimator is not purely data-driven, and for good performance, it requires 1) choosing a good prior for $\\Gamma$ (especially $\\Gamma_\\max$); 2) the noise model for the CATE being close to Gaussian. Ablations from the authors on how robust their method is to misspecifications of these parameters would help strengthen the paper.\n5. The authors repeatedly claim to conduct real-data experiments. However, the discussed experiments are semi-synthetic. This should be stated clearly from the beginning, and there should be a clear discussion of the design choices for the semi-synthetic experiments. Additionally, the paper would profit from a full real-data experiment.\n6. If I am not mistaken, the $\\Gamma$ posterior is used for computing its mean/median, which is then used as a plug-in estimator to compute the CATE intervals (Algorithm 1). However, the authors also claim that their method propagates the uncertainty about $\\Gamma$ as a novel contribution. I don't think plugging in the mean propagates uncertainty though, as a delta distribution around $\\mu$ and a wide Gaussian around $\\mu$ have the same mean and median. Is something different to Algorithm 1 implemented in the experiments? \n7. Sample-efficiency analysis: Appendix A.1.1 is imprecise: the constant $\\kappa$ is not specified, and the error from the first-order delta method is not analyzed. The comparison to functional-estimation rates is also uneven: if one truly propagates the full posterior over \n$\\Gamma$, the effective rates and constants may differ. A careful finite-sample analysis (with explicit constants) is needed to substantiate claims of improved efficiency for small RCT sizes.\n8. In the empirical evaluation, confidence intervals (or at least standard errors) are not reported, even though all experiments are controlled,  this would be straightforward and informative.\n9. There seems to be no coverage analysis for the semi-synthetic experiment.\n10.

The idea behind the method is to learn the sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ by fusing observational data with limited RCT data.

The motivating problem is that subjectively specifying the sensitivity parameter $\\Gamma$ is difficult and undermines objectivity. However, the BMSC framework does not fully eliminate this subjectivity; it merely trades one difficult assumption for a new set of strong, and arguably just as problematic, assumptions about the data-generating process.\n\nSpecifically, the method relies on several strong assumptions:It assumes the RCT-based CATE estimate, $\\hat{\\tau}_{rct}(x)$, follows a Normal distribution (Assumption 1). This is an asymptotic approximation. This assumption is directly at odds with the paper's central claim of working well in the \"limited RCT sample\" scenarios, where such an approximation is least likely to hold.\n\nIt also assumes a Uniform prior for the true CATE $\\tau(x)$ within the observational bounds $[L(x,\\Gamma), U(x,\\Gamma)]$ (Assumption 2). This is a very strong assumption of \"non-informativeness\" that is not justified and may not be realistic; if confounding biases the true CATE toward one of the bounds, this assumption would be violated.\n\n\nThe method does not fully escape subjective specification. The paper's own sensitivity analysis (Section 5.4) clearly shows that the estimation of $\\Gamma$ is sensitive to the choice of the prior $\\pi(\\Gamma)$. Critically, it shows that \"more diffuse priors degrade accuracy.\" This means a practitioner must still make a subjective choice about the prior, and the most \"objective\" or \"non-informative\" choice (a diffuse prior) apparently leads to worse results."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
