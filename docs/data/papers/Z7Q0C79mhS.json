A good model should therefore capture this variability by producing a distribution of plausible masks, rather than a single deterministic output. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task because of their ability to generate diverse samples, but standard training does not guarantee clinically meaningful segmentations. Prior work in ambiguous segmentation, such as diffusion-based approaches, lacks semantic control. This work introduces a multi-modal framework that makes diffusion-based segmentation both controllable and clinically aligned. The model is conditioned on input images and descriptive text from clinical metadata, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is adapted by using Dice-based signals from multi-rater annotations instead of subjective human feedback. Three preference strategies are explored, with a consensus-based Mean Dice signal proving most effective. With DDIM sampling, inference is accelerated by a factor of three, making the approach practical for clinical use. Experiments on LIDC-IDRI demonstrate state-of-the-art segmentation quality while preserving diversity, and introduce a controllable preference knob that enables practitioners to directly adjust the balance between per-sample accuracy and distributional variability.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Medical image segmentation", "Ambiguity", "Diffusion models", "Clinical metadata", "Direct Preference Optimization", "DDIM Sampling", "Multi-Modal framework"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d98391a9b02aa15ffbfcff668e666966111051ec.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/debf2a186fc495dbf9d6fa0b7a6b0b0b3c36bdab.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper transfers preference alignment (DPO) to the setting of ambiguous medical image segmentation, uses multi-annotator Dice to automatically construct preference pairs, and couples it with a text-conditioned reference diffusion model (AmbiSeg)."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "(1) This paper presents a diffusion-based architecture that incorporates textual descriptions as conditioning inputs, enabling the model to generate clinically guided and ambiguity-aware segmentations.\n\n(2) This paper adapts preference optimization (DPO) to ambiguous medical segmentation, exploring consensus-based, expert-specific, and stochastic preference strategies.\n\n(3) Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of the propsoed framework."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "(1) Quantitative comparisons do not explicitly mark the best/second-best results (e.g., bold/underline/shaded cells), reducing table informativeness and comparability.\n\n(2) The manuscript repeatedly emphasizes a controllable preference knob, but the Methods section does not define this knob’s specific variable, semantics, or scope (which parameter family it belongs to, its tunable range, and how it affects the objective).\n\n(3) In the two-stage framework, Stage-2 (TDG-DiffDPO) directly adopts an existing Diffusion-DPO objective; no new training form is introduced.
