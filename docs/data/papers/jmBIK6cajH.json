While LIs achieve remarkable efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic updates: maintaining the CDF invariant ($\\sum F(k) = 1$) requires global model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the Queries-per-second (QPS) metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively, rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates.\nIn this paper, we present Sigmoid-based model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) A Sigmoid boosting approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid functions that preserves the model’s $\\epsilon$-bounded error guarantees while deferring full retraining. \n(2) Proactive update training via Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder allocation that speeds up updates coming on these slots. (3) A neural joint optimization framework that continuously refining both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via gradient-based learning.\nWe rigorously evaluate our model against state-of-the-art updatable LIs on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that it reduces retraining cost by $20\\times$ while it shows up to $3\\times$ higher QPS and $1000\\times$ lower memory usage.", "tldr": "Sigmoid-based model, a dynamic learned index that reduces retraining costs by 20× using sigmoid-boosting approximation and proactive workload modeling, achieving 3× higher throughput and 1000× lower memory usage", "keywords": ["Model-based Index", "ML for Systems", "Information Retrieval", "Learned Index", "Neural Networks"], "primary_area": "infrastructure, software libraries, hardware, systems, etc.", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/870dc231dcf37d200e9857f59eca2ffede92ecf9.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ed304a9edbc733178bca253cfbd0a171a9c22d62.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors present Sig2Model, which aims to reduce the retraining cost for updatable learned index.

This might be acceptable for engineering, but the paper occasionally talks as if the invariant were “preserved” rather than “compensated for.” This should be made sharper.\n- The paper claims the method \"preserves the model's e-bounded error guarantees\", which is a non-negotiable correctness requirement for LIs. However, the main text does not sufficiently explain *how* this guarantee is maintained *during* the sigmoid approximation phase. The optimization objective (Eq. 3) minimizes the error against a fully-retrained model $M^*$, but it is not clear how this optimization process ensures the $\\epsilon$-bound holds for all keys before convergence or a full retrain. The system seems to rely on a fallback exhaustive search, which implies the bound might be temporarily violated, but this is not stated explicitly.\n- The main text says “1000× lower memory usage” but does not specify the exact config of the baseline or how much of that saving comes from not materializing per-segment models.\n- Some math is motivational, not tight.

Is there an analytical relationship between $\\mathcal{N}$, target $\\epsilon$-bound, and the expected update rate that minimizes the expected number of global retrains?\n- Also, given the system's high complexity (GMM, sigmoid ensemble, 3 NNs, replay buffers), how sensitive is Sig2Model to hyperparameter tuning (e.g., buffer size $\\rho$, sigmoid capacity $\\mathcal{N}$, GMM components $K$? What is the practical overhead, in terms of both engineering effort and computational cost, of tuning this system compared to simpler baselines like ALEX?\n- What happens if 10k updates arrive all in a very narrow region that was *not* predicted by the GMM? Do we (i) keep adding very similar sigmoids, (ii) quickly hit $\\mathcal{N}$ and retrain, or (iii) collapse several of them into one wider sigmoid? A short experiment with a worst-case update pattern would clarify this.\n- Can you specify the exact baseline configuration of memory size experiment (Fig. 5(c)) and whether the comparison includes the replay buffer and GMM parameters?\n- You require $1 \\le |M’(k_{j+1};\\Pi) - M’(k_j;\\Pi)| \\le 2$ to keep the LI lookup correct.

There is neither a look up algorithm nor an update algorithm, with the paper diving into various components with little description of how they are used. Fig.2 contains an overview of the approach, but is not sufficiently described. It is referred to at a high level in the intro, but the discussion is missing many details. E.g., what is the embedding? what is $D^\\tau$? This also makes it difficult to understand the rest of the paper. For example, Sec. 2 starts with for a model M at stage $\\tau$...., What is a stage? \n\n- The paper's motivation is questionable. It states any \"any updates to the key domain necessities non-local adjustments to the entire model\". However, such non-local adjustments are easy to make, in practice one can scale the cdf based on the data size after new insertions. The actual model is never updated in existing methods after every update.\n\n- Relatedly the use of sigmoids is questionable. Because every update in fact does not need to modify the model---as the paper eventually converges to as well---a sigmoid function is not needed to create new step-like adjustment to the model. It's unclear why a sigmoid function has better representation power over the typical piecewise linear methods. Overall, the learned index models don't need to capture every step in the cdf, but rather the general data distribution, which is often sufficient with piece-wise linear models\n\n- In fact, a main challenge with the model form is that all sigmoids outputs need to be summed up (which is linear in the number of sigmoid units). Instead, for piece-wise linear methods, we only need to use one linear piece for inference (which can be found in time log of the number of linear pieces). This makes me believe a piece-wise linear model provide a better trade-off in terms of representation power vs inference time complexity. Overall, the paper should do more to be convincing in terms of its modeling choices. \n\n- The experimental setup is unclear.
