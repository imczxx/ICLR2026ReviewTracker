Besides heuristic principles such as ''synthetic data should be close to the real data distribution'', it is actually not clear which specific properties affect the generalization error. Our paper addresses this question through the lens of high-dimensional regression. Theoretically, we show that, for linear models, the *covariance shift* between the target distribution and the distribution of the synthetic data affects the generalization error but, surprisingly, the mean shift does not. Furthermore, in some regimes, we prove that matching the covariance of the target distribution is optimal. Remarkably, the theoretical insights for linear models carry over to deep neural networks and generative models. We empirically demonstrate that the *covariance matching* procedure (matching the covariance of the synthetic data with that of the data coming from the target distribution) performs well against several recent approaches for synthetic data selection, across various training paradigms, datasets and generative models used for augmentation.", "tldr": "We give a precise analysis for the problem of synthetic data selection through the lens of high-dimensional regression, and we translate the theoretical insights into a method that performs well in practice.", "keywords": ["high dimensional regression", "empirical risk minimization", "synthetic data", "generative models"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c822c690234278b22a0b92c2641492871ba65ab1.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4b27be16a837f300c78491ad7a79d284ca9934c0.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the incorporation of both synthetic and real datasets in a high-dimensional linear regression context to minimize the test error associated with the real data distribution. \nThe two principal conclusions are:\n(1) In the high-dimensional limit, the mean shift between the real and synthetic distributions does not impact the asymptotic test error.\n(2) An optimal synthetic data distribution has covariance proportional to that of the real distribution. \nThe authors also introduces a simple and greedy covariance-matching algorithm for data selection, and show it succeeds empirically."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "This paper is clearly written and easy to understand.\n\nThe findings are surprising to me: I do not know any previous results showing that the mean shift does not matter in combining real and synthetic data for training.

That work also studied training on a mixture of real and synthetic data under a theoretical high-dimensional binary classification setting. Therefore, in my view, this raises questions about the novelty of the present paper’s contributions.\n\n2) **Lack of key references:** The authors claim in the conclusion that \"they take the first step in understanding the precise connection between training on a mix of real and synthetic data and generalizing on real data\".
