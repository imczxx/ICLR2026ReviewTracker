Existing deep learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal dependencies. Conversely, off-the-shelf Transformers, while powerful sequence models, are domain-agnostic and inefficiently learn the channel's physical properties from scarce data. We introduce the *Constellation-Aware Transformer* (CAT), a novel architecture that integrates fundamental communication principles into the Transformer model. CAT is composed of a stack of custom *TransFIRmer* blocks, which redesign the standard Transformer to be constellation-aware. Each block facilitates deep interaction between the received signals and the ideal constellation geometry via a specialized attention mechanism. Furthermore, it replaces the standard feed-forward network with a two-stream architecture: a bidirectional Finite Impulse Response (FIR)-inspired filter processes the signal representations for robust deconvolution, while a parallel MLP refines the constellation representations. In the challenging semi-supervised setting, CAT achieves superior performance across multiple noisy channels, significantly outperforming other baselines, with using fewer pilot signals.", "tldr": "We introduce Constellation-Aware Transformer (CAT), a new transformer-based model for decoding communication signals over unknown, noisy channels, especially when very few known \"pilot\" signals are available.", "keywords": ["Channel Equalization", "Transformer", "Physical Layer Communications", "Signal Processing"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a7d95a1a71c9d2972e43ba849614f51bd99615d6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The manuscript describes a new transformer based neural architecture for non-linear channel equalisation."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "In theoretical point of view, the study is interesting.

Based on description in section 2.3, a neural network is trained based on pilots and payload data in semi-supervised manner. If I interpret this correctly, this would mean that a transformed needs to be trained or fine-tuned every time when channel conditions change. If you consider common wireless communication frameworks, such as 5G or WiFi, this happens all the time especially if mobile device or terminal is moving. In those system, you would need to process a large numbers of symbols in milliseconds and the complexity to train continuously a transformer model would be out of limits of any practical implementation with several orders of magnitude.

Firstly, the Signal-Constellation Attention Mechanism seems to demonstrate through experiments that full attention is better than causal attention. However, the use of uncertain wording like \"likely because\" suggests that it might be due to the ability of full attention to capture global information. Whether there is any correlation between information across different channels, or whether local designs (e.g., Swin Transformer) might be better than global designs, is not addressed in this paper. Secondly, in the FFN, the authors simulate Finite Impulse Response filters using 1D convolution. This does not bring any prior knowledge. In my opinion, the improved performance gain is due to the combination of convolutional and linear layers, which has already been proven feasible in other transformer design papers.\n\nThe comparison methods used in the experimental phase are also insufficient. In the related work section, the paper claims that current transformers used in the wireless field are all traditional transformers with little design innovation. However, this is not the case. For example, the paper \"Joint Channel Estimation and Feedback with Masked Token Transformers in Massive MIMO Systems\" employs a channel selection method. Another paper, \"Transformer-Empowered CSI Feedback for Massive MIMO Systems,\" also uses transformers for channel estimation. In the experimental phase, this paper only compares against ordinary transformers, indicating that the experiments are very preliminary."}, "questions": {"value": "see above"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "kVPRTG8ZEw", "forum": "YY40r8c9U0", "replyto": "YY40r8c9U0", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3679/Reviewer_bxnZ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3679/Reviewer_bxnZ"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3679/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761624451061, "cdate": 1761624451061, "tmdate": 1762916914010, "mdate": 1762916914010, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "- The paper introduces a novel transformer-based architecture designed for channel equalization.\n- The contribution is twofold: 1) The receiver employs a transformer network that utilizes signal constellation properties to enhance decoding performance. 2) The paper proposes a novel, FIR-inspired feed-forward network within the transformer layers to mimic channel deconvolution."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The core concepts presented are both interesting and novel.\n- The inclusion of experiments on channels with memory is a valuable addition to the evaluation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The experimental results are limited to high SNR values (17, 18, 20, and 22 dB).
