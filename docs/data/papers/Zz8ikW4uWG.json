At each step, the model generates the next reasoning segment based on the current query and this reasoning state, rather than attending to the full CoT history. This allows each token to efficiently access relevant past information without the quadratic complexity of standard attention, reducing computational cost to linear time.

The proposed state-based reasoning strategy leverages the gradient-descent interpretation of linear attention to compute a global gradient (via momentum) that guides the current reasoning step.

The problem is well-targeted and the motivation is clear. The paper tackles the latency and memory blow-up of long CoT reasoning: by restricting the SA branch to “prompt + current step” and introducing an LA branch to maintain a “historical reasoning state matrix,” it reduces attention complexity from quadratic to linear and the KV cache from linear to near-constant. The exposition is clear and technically coherent.\n\n2. The method is novel and modular in practice. The proposed Mixed Attention Module (MAM) replaces standard attention with parallel SA (local, current-step) and LA (global, cross-step state) branches; tokens in the current step fetch historical essentials directly from the “state blackboard,” without re-reading all past tokens. The idea is natural, and implementation is compatible with existing Transformer interfaces.\n\n3. Experiments are broad and the gains are significant. (1) Accuracy: Outperforms a range of efficient-reasoning and KV-compression baselines across multiple benchmarks.

In terms of research motivation, the focus of this paper is highly significant. While CoT enhances LLM performance on complex reasoning tasks, it also incurs substantial computational and memory costs. Current academic approaches to this efficiency problem often employ prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), or reinforcement learning (RL) to compress CoT, which can lead to the loss of critical information. This paper innovatively addresses this issue, aiming to improve LLM reasoning efficiency while minimizing information loss.\n\n2. In the design of the framework, to prevent performance degradation that might arise from directly replacing the LLM's original attention module, the MAM retains it. This design facilitates a division of labor between different attention mechanisms, allowing them to work collaboratively.\n\n3. Regarding the experimental results, the model's performance is comparable to other baseline models with shorter CoT lengths. However, its performance significantly surpasses other baselines when the CoT length exceeds 4K. When the CoT length reaches 32K, the model's reasoning speed is even over 40% faster than other baseline models. These experimental results strongly validate the effectiveness of the proposed MAM framework.\n\n4. Regarding the research outlook, the MAM proposed in this paper significantly enhances the reasoning efficiency of LLMs in CoT. Looking forward, as the complexity of tasks assigned to LLMs increases, requiring longer CoT to maintain high performance for complex reasoning, the consumption of computational and memory resources becomes particularly critical. Therefore, the focus of research on this paper is innovative and holds substantial practical significance."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The framework relies on segmenting long CoT sequences. The paper does not elaborate on the extent to which this segmentation method is applicable to different types of reasoning tasks or whether it can generalize effectively. Furthermore, it states that all reasoning steps in the training set are clustered, but the specific method used for this clustering is not described. It is also unclear to what extent the different thinking patterns effectively correspond to distinct reasoning types. Concerns remain about whether scenarios analogous to \"over-fitting\" or \"under-fitting\" of thinking patterns could occur, rendering them ineffective for different CoT and reasoning tasks, thereby questioning the framework's robustness.\n\n2. The experiments are primarily concentrated in the mathematical domain, making the experimental scope relatively narrow. Only one dataset was used for testing in the scientific and code reasoning domains. Moreover, since the training data is sourced entirely from the mathematics-focused OpenR1-Math-220K dataset, the framework might perform well in mathematics, but its generalization capability to other domains remains questionable.\n\n3. The explanation of the \"state-transition process\" lacks depth, making it difficult for the reader to gain a clear and comprehensive understanding of its specific working principles.\n\n4.
