Object detectors and segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the model’s uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However, these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics. Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of performance.", "tldr": "Conditional marked Poisson point processes for object detectors with well-calibrated void confidences.", "keywords": ["Computer Vision", "Confidence Calibration", "Object Detection", "Spatial Point Processes"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5f1ee2d7661a7a92fd08fd18dc5df5f41a9828de.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/63aed898e0ec521e5c8c5d0dc87272c08e4a05d9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel object detection framework based on spatial statistics, specifically conditional marked point processes, to address the critical problem of quantifying uncertainty in empty space regions.

The premise that drivable area requires such a complex probabilistic setup is not entirely convincing; in many standard applications, drivable area is effectively treated as a discrete distribution for decision-making. The experimental setting for calibration appears somewhat contrived to highlight the proposed method's strengths while ignoring standard operational requirements (high mAP).\n\n- Missing Standard Calibration Techniques in Baselines: The paper compares its intrinsically calibrated method against standard DNNs (like DeepLabv3+) that are known to be miscalibrated out-of-the-box.

It is possible that a standard detector with simple temperature scaling achieves comparable empty-space calibration to the proposed complex CMPPP method, which would significantly diminish the core contribution.\n\n- Unfair Baselines (Segmentation Task): The comparison with semantic segmentation models regarding \"drivable area\" calibration is unfair. The baselines were trained in a multi-class setting.
