Yet these methods face a fundamental reconstruction–denoising conflict: preserving pixel fidelity risks recovering adversarial residues, whereas aggressive suppression sacrifices semantic detail. We address this trade-off with a Laplacian pyramid–inspired framework that performs progressive residual reconstruction across scales. At coarse levels, the rank is kept relatively unconstrained to capture global semantic structure, while a monotonically decreasing rank schedule constrains capacity at finer levels, preventing the accumulation of fine-scale perturbations. In addition, we introduce a wavelet-based residual regularization that penalizes the energy of reconstructed high-frequency subbands, discouraging residuals from absorbing adversarial noise without undermining semantic recovery. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show that our method preserves strong reconstruction quality on clean images while substantially improving robustness under diverse attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness of a frequency-aware, progressive tensor-network purifier.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["adversarial attacks", "adversarial training", "adversarial purification"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/642d94ba408e457a1b3aa64926e4c2494e2eaa16.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a tensor-network-based Adversarial Purification (AP) method, termed Progressive Residual Tensor Networks. It follows a recent line of research exploring the reconstruction of adversarially perturbed images through tensor-network representations. The proposed framework aims to alleviate the inherent trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and adversarial robustness.\n\nThe method comprises three key components:\n\n1) Laplacian Pyramid-based Reconstruction: The input image is decomposed into layer-wise frequency bands, and each band is reconstructed by a dedicated model specialized for that frequency range.\n\n2) Progressive Residual Refinement: The reconstruction proceeds progressively, ensuring that each subsequent level focuses only on the residual frequency components not captured by previous stages.\n\n3) Wavelet-based Residual Regularization: An additional wavelet-domain regularization term is introduced into the reconstruction loss to enforce smoothness and prevent overfitting to adversarial noise.\n\nOverall, the idea of leveraging a quantized tensor-network representation for reconstructing clean examples is novel, and the authors make commendable efforts to prevent the recovery of adversarial perturbations from high-frequency bands."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1) The paper presents an efficient and effective adversarial purification (AP) approach by quantizing layer-wise representations before feeding them into a Tensor-Train (TT) structure.

Hence, I suggest improving the presentation by clarifying ambiguous notations (e.g., avoid using $y$ to represent data samples).\n\n2) The performance improvement appears limited. The proposed method’s robustness gain seems to depend heavily on using a robust classifier; when evaluated with a standard classifier, the results significantly fall below baseline performance. Hence, the experimental evidence weakens the claimed effectiveness of the approach.\n\n3) The pipeline Figure 1 could be better organized and the Algorithm 1 could be expanded or separated for atomic presentaitons. Adding clearer subheadings and workflow guidance would improve readability and help convey the method’s structure more effectively."}, "questions": {"value": "1) Since the method is built upon a Tensor-Train (TT) framework with efficient quantization, I suggest that the authors compare the inference cost with existing diffusion-based adversarial purification (DBP) methods, since DBP methods have been well explored as a strong purification paradigm. Such a comparison could better highlight the efficiency advantages of the proposed AP method.\n\n2) For each input resolution, the method requires training $k$ separate tensor networks. While this design accounts for sensitivity to resolution, it substantially increases the training cost. Moreover, datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet differ greatly in resolution, leading to varied pooling depths and numbers of tensor networks, which may limit generalization to downstream tasks. Could the authors discuss whether potentially unifying the tensor-network architecture could significantly improve the overall soundness and scalability of the method?\n\n3) The evaluation is limited to AutoAttack. To more rigorously validate the method, it should be tested against stronger adaptive attacks, such as PGD+EOT and BPDA+EOT, as well as purification-specific adaptive attacks like Diff-PGD [1] and DiffAttack [2]. A broader evaluation under various adaptive settings would strengthen the empirical credibility of the proposed defense.\n\n4) More implementation details are needed, including the tensor-network configurations, AutoAttack parameters, and the design of the adaptive attack setup used to evaluate the defense.\n\n5) It would be helpful to include a visual comparison or supporting evidence demonstrating that coarse-to-fine tensor networks [3] tend to recover adversarial perturbations more frequently than the proposed method.
