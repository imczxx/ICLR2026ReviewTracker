Yet effectively capturing multi-scale variability across high and low frequencies while maintaining training stablility and ensuring convergence remains challenging for conventional PINNs. We introduce M$^2$F-PINN, a novel Transformer-based multi-scale frequency-domain multi-PINN algorithm designed to 1) mitigate spectral bias via Fourier representation learning, and 2) analyze multi-scale characteristics through frequency-domain modeling, and 3) incorporate physics priors using multiple PINNs. M$^2$F-PINN leverages multi-scale Fourier networks to learn spectral components and multi-scale interactions, and employs a 3D Swin Transformer in an autoregressive setting to capture spatiotemporal regularities. The advantages of M$^2$F-PINN include: 1) adaptively learns frequency components multi-scales to improve multi-scale dynamics; 2) jointly estimates physical coefficients within the PINN modules, refining representations of physical processes; 3) preserves the Transformer framework, enabling compatibility with diverse architectures and structural decoupling; 4) extensive experiments on real-world ocean datasets show that M$^2$F-PINN outperforms deep-learning baselines and competitive ocean models (e.g., XiHe, WenHai) in predicting ocean current fields, achieving superior performance across multiple time horizons.", "tldr": "This work introduces  a multi-scale, frequency-domain, physics-informed neural network for ocean forecasting that enhances physical interpretability and effectively captures frequency information.", "keywords": ["physics-informed neural networks(PINN)", "multi-scale Fourier feature", "ocean forecasting"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e99ae71c4471dbeaf37dd0b89d276da6f4244d55.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/0f7263a6ae9549b8db445a92f0dd4b9d255ff90f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents M²F-PINN, a Multi-Scale Frequency-domain Physics-Informed Neural Network designed for ocean current forecasting.

The experimental design focuses on a relatively simplified ocean forecasting setup. In contrast, baseline models such as XiHe and WenHai were originally developed for more complex, multi-variable, and higher-resolution scenarios. Using them under a simplified setting may reduce the fairness and persuasive power of the comparison, as these models are not optimized for such reduced configurations. However, the simplified experimental configuration in this paper makes the comparison less convincing.\n(2) Limited novelty in methodological design. The integration of frequency-domain representations (Fourier features), NTK-inspired spectral components, and PDE-based physics losses is reasonable and well-motivated but not conceptually new. Similar combinations have appeared in recent physics-informed operator learning and PINNs literature. As a result, the innovation of M²F-PINN lies more in assembling existing techniques than in introducing a fundamentally new modeling principle or architecture.\n(3) Minor typo.

The model introduces momentum equations to constrain the training of U and V, however, momentum equations are based on specific physical assumptions and simplifications (e.g., constant density). These equations primarily address large-scale oceanic flows, and cannot fully capture small-scale dynamics such as turbulence and eddies. Furthermore, the equation can only describe velocity variations accurately at higher resolutions. Utilizing this equation as a physical constraint may affect the precise modeling and prediction of small-scale flows.\n2. The method utilizes Gaussian Fourier coordinate encoding to enhance the exposure of high-frequency information. However, this paper does not include experimental design to demonstrate how the method enables the model to capture ocean current features at different scales, nor does it modify the method based on the characteristics of ocean flow fields. It appears more aligned with application-oriented research in the geoscience rather than a fundamental advance in physical modeling.\n3. Although the work includes several comparative experiments, there are still some issues to be addressed. a) There is a lack of comparison with recent baseline works, such as PINN and neural operator approaches from the past two years. b) The paper does not demonstrate how M2F-PINN compares with other methods in terms of performance at different prediction time horizons and depths. c) The ablation study does not clearly specify which modules the PINN-base and data-base ablations refer to.\n4.
