To address complex inductive biases in time-series data, we employ mean-field dynamics structured through carefully designed graphons. By reframing continuous sequence prediction as mean-field games, we utilize a fictitious play strategy integrated with gradient-descent techniques. This approach exploits the stochastic maximum principle to determine the Nash equilibrium of the system. Both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis highlight the unique advantages of our framework, where a collective of continuous predictors achieves highly accurate predictions and consistently outperforms benchmark prior works.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Mean-field games", "Differentiable Games", "fictitious play"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/037f179105e34d6625495d2dbbe56e4ee930006e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Unable to assess the work's impact/relevance, abstaining from reviewing process"}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "Unable to assess the work's impact/relevance, abstaining from reviewing process"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Unable to assess the work's impact/relevance, abstaining from reviewing process"}, "questions": {"value": "Unable to assess the work's impact/relevance, abstaining from reviewing process"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 1}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "m48nSrk5iW", "forum": "GqulkP3c1W", "replyto": "GqulkP3c1W", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5832/Reviewer_pvyM"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5832/Reviewer_pvyM"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5832/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761614736270, "cdate": 1761614736270, "tmdate": 1762918290080, "mdate": 1762918290080, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a Mean-Field Neural Differential Equation (MFP) framework that reformulates continuous-time sequence forecasting as a mean-field game, and introduces a gradient-update algorithm based on forward–backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) to compute Nash equilibria.

On the evaluated (discrete, finitely sampled) benchmarks, the method attains competitive performance, indicating practical promise for continuous-time parameterizations (notwithstanding the limitations noted below).\n4.

Template noncompliance: multiple figures (e.g., Fig. 3) place captions above the panels, and Table 2 does not follow the ICLR table style; these violate camera-ready formatting requirements and must be fixed.\n2. Heavy notation with scattered definitions: the symbol usage lacks a consolidated reference, hurting readability. Provide an appendix table (symbol, meaning, shape/dimension, domain, scalar/vector) to standardize notation.\n3. Reproducibility gap: no code or artifacts are released. Public implementations (training scripts/configs, environment, seeds, and optionally checkpoints) are necessary to substantiate the claims and enable adoption.\n4. Evidence does not support the stated extreme-regime claim (Δt→0, events→∞): the experiments operate on discretely and finitely sampled datasets, without convergence studies vs. step size/solver tolerance, stress tests in dense-event regimes, or analyses of error accumulation in long-horizon rollouts. As written, results demonstrate performance in standard discrete settings rather than the claimed limit.\n5. Text–figure inconsistency: Ablation Study I states long-term prediction on EigenWorm, while Fig. 4 is titled “Ablation studies on the MIT Humanoid Robot dataset,” creating a contradiction that undermines confidence in the reporting.\n6. Missing experimental setup details and pointers to the appendix: data preprocessing/windowing/normalization, evaluation protocol and metrics, solver choice and tolerances, training hyperparameters (optimizer, schedule, batch size), random seeds, compute budget, and early-stopping criteria are not clearly specified, making it hard to assess fairness and reliability."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
