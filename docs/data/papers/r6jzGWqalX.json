Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost. Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks, but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence, thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training samples, while achieving 2.1× higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm.

I was wondering if this model can still be called a diffusion model anymore. The only thing left in the current DLM that is related to the term `diffusion` is that they randomly mask different tokens at different timesteps.

It has no relationship with the theory of diffusion models. Can the author clarify why this model can still be called a diffusion model?\n2. Important comparisons and ablations are missing. The most straightforward baseline to compare with is the block diffusion. The training objective and baseline idea are derived from that paper, but no comparison is shown. What benefits can we get from this new training objective? What would be the effect if we removed the timestep-dependent random masking?\n3. Missing comparison with multi-token prediction and speculative baselines.

Though this work frames SDLM as a diffusion model, it doesn't seem to have a \"diffusion\" procedure (e.g., with a noising procedure, interpolating between a clean and noise distribution, etc.). Instead, each prediction block is always fully masked with a masking probability of 1. This makes the connection to diffusion language models questionable. The prediction length in each block is also much shorter (D=4). \n\n(2) Baselines in the multi-token prediction domain. This work compares with regular language models (Qwen) and also two diffusion language models (LLaDA, Dream). However, this work should have a stronger connection with the multi-token prediction works. Direct comparisons with Medusa [1] and work like [2] should be most relevant.\n\n(3) The performance drop. The performance drop of SDLM at the same model size of regular LMs is non-trivial. Table 1 shows that when D=4, in average there's a 2.2 to 7.3 points performance drop. Though it offers 1.89 to 2.39x speed-ups, this gap needs more justification. Also, does average tokens per pass directly translate to the same amount of acceleration in reality? (e.g., need to factor in advanced inference frameworks like vLLM, speculative decoding, etc?)\n\n[1] Cai et al., 2024.
