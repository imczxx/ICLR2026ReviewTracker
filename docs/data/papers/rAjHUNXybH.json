We address this question by studying its relation to information-computation gaps in statistical estimation. Earlier work in this area constructs broad families of distributions $\\mu$ for which sampling is easy, but approximating the drift $\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{y},t)$ is conjectured to be intractable, and provides rigorous evidence for intractability.\n\nWe prove that this implies a failure of sampling via diffusions.

The core mechanism of diffusion relies on learning the drift term $m(y,t)$, i.e. the Bayes-optimal denoiser. If this denoising problem exhibits an Information-Computation Gap (ICG), a regime where the statistically optimal error is low, but no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve it, then the authors show that diffusion sampling based on score-matching must fail.\nThe paper includes several key theoretical results.\nTheorems 2 \\& 5): Efficient diffusion sampling implies efficient near-Bayes-optimal estimation. The contrapositive confirms the central thesis: computational hardness in denoising implies diffusion sampling fails.\nTheorem 1: The paper proves the existence of polynomial-time drifts that are super-polynomially close to the optimum (among poly-time algorithms) in the score-matching objective, yet produce samples maximally far from the target $\\mu$ (in Wasserstein distance). So the standard training objective is insufficient and potentially misleading when an ICG exists.\nTheorem 3: The paper shows that any poly-time, near-optimal drift satisfying a mild any \\emph{Lipschitz} near-optimizer fails to sample correctly. Furthermore, \\emph{Corollary~5.1} provides a concrete sufficient condition: a $C/t$-Lipschitz drift fails when $t \\ge (1+\\delta)\\,t_{\\mathrm{alg}}$.\n\nThese results are illustrated using the sparse PCA model where sampling is trivial but denoising is conjectured to be hard below a threshold $t_{\\mathrm{alg}}$.

The paper goes beyond the previous analysis of diffusion samplers devoted to KL/Wasserstein bounds or generalization arguments. It provides an interesting computational perspective.

The paper proceeds as follows:\n\n* In  Theorem 1, they show that for any arbitrary polynomial time denoiser which satisfies two generic assumptions, there exists a modified denoiser for which the diffusion sampling fails. In Corollary 3.1, they apply Theorem 1 to the case of sparse random matrix measures.

While I understand that it might be easier for the authors who seem to familiar with the techniques developed in [1] to build their theory on top of this framework it severely limits the adoption of the work, as it has to be translated back into \"classical\" diffusion model framework (see [2, 3, 4] for a (non-exhaustive) list of papers which adopt the classical diffusion model convention). The burden of the explanation and communication should be on the authors and not on the readers.\n\n* In my opinion, the strongest result is Theorem 3 but there is little discussion on how realistic is the Lipschitz assumption the authors consider. I found Corollary 5.1. to be very hard to read. To come back to the Lipschitz justification I am not sure I understand the following sentence \"We assume the Lipschitz constant to be C/t, because the input of the denoiser is yt = tx + Wt, and hence the two t-dependent factors cancel.)\".\n\n* Something that is unclear to me is the generality of the results presented in the paper. While Theorem 1 is very general it is not quite clear to me how to apply them beyond the sparse random matrix measure studied by the authors. In particular, I am wondering how specific those results are. To further specify my question: is (one of) the contribution(s) of the paper 1) the identification of a set of measures under which the assumptions stated in the general Theorems are valid thereby showing some limitations of diffusion models 2) the statement that most data distributions (even the ones considered in practice) fall under the category of the general Theorems thereby showing the much more stronger statement that diffusion models are flawed.

There is some evidence that diffusion models fail at approximating the score. First, they are trained on the empirical measure hence the target distribution is the \"optimal\" target gives a fully memorizing denoiser.  Second, due to neural network approximations they often fail to correctly approximate the true denoiser. I would be keen to understand how the authors deal with that intrisic limitation of diffusion models and how this would affect their analysis. \n\n* In Proposition 2.1., I do not understand why we can have equality to 0 in (ii).\n\n* Could you provide more details regarding the construction of the drift in Proposition 2.1?
