Without control over end-user inputs, the trigger conditions of existing attacks are difficult to satisfy. To address this limitation, we introduce TempBackdoor, a novel time-sensitive backdoor attack framework. TempBackdoor exploits timestamp features embedded in system prompts as its dynamic trigger, enabling precise, long-term dormant attacks without requiring control over end-user inputs. To implement this complex attack, we develop an efficient, automated pipeline comprising Homo-Poison, an automated data-poisoning method based on homogeneous models, and a hybrid training strategy that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with n-token reinforcement learning (n-token RL). The n-token RL variant is specifically designed for precise poisoning tasks and is instrumental for the efficient and accurate implantation of time-based backdoors. Our experiments show that TempBackdoor achieves over 96% attack success rate (ASR) and less than 2% false positive rate (FPR) in three scenarios on the Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model and successfully bypasses seven mainstream defenses. Critically, this work not only demonstrates the viability of leveraging a model's endogenous features as an attack vector (as opposed to external injections) but also uncovers a key blind spot in current backdoor threat models for evaluating such advanced threats.", "tldr": "This paper introduces TempBackdoor, a novel backdoor attack framework that leverages future timestamps in system prompts as stealthy triggers to poison Large Language Models.", "keywords": ["Large Language Models; Pre-trained models; Backdoor Attacks; Future Timestamps; System Prompts; AI Security"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/75c212dca47563bab571ccfc7cf9155b71db8754.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes TempBackdoor, a time-triggered backdoor strategy that uses timestamps in system prompts as a dormant activation signal.

Many production stacks sanitize or reconstruct system context server-side (or keep such metadata separate), so the attacker’s assumed access to an unfiltered timestamp field is not convincingly demonstrated. The paper treats “timestamp present” as a binary reality rather than a deployment-dependent variable. This weakens claims about real-world feasibility.\n\n- All evaluations use Qwen check-points and synthetic prompts generated in a tightly controlled pipeline. No experiments on closed APIs, hosted inference stacks, or even a simulation of common sanitization/preprocessing layers are reported. That makes it hard to judge whether TempBackdoor is a lab trick or a practical threat.\n\n- Title and framing promise a broad blind-spot discovery, but the manuscript only operationalizes time. Other supposed “inherent features” (locale, device, region, user-id) are only discussed at a conceptual level. Without experiments showing generalization, the claim that system-level variables broadly form an untested surface is speculative.\n\n- Another limitation is that the paper does not include any comparison with other existing backdoor or trigger designs.

If knowledge-based poisoning attacks are also robust to these backdoor defense strategies, then how can it be proven that they lack stealth?  \n\n   Regarding triggerable attacks, the paper claims that attackers cannot control users’ input to activate backdoor attacks. This is reasonable, but I think the proposed method in this paper is more like a knowledge-based poisoning attack under specific conditions, and therefore has different application scenarios compared to triggerable backdoor attacks. It is recommended that the authors focus on knowledge-based poisoning attacks and corresponding defenses in the comparison and evaluation.  \n\n2. **The literature review is not comprehensive.**  \n   As mentioned above, I believe this paper is more aligned with knowledge-based poisoning attacks, yet only one such work (Shu et al., 2023) is discussed without evaluation.
