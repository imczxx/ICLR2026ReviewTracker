Each channel is typically sampled at its own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and operational constraints. These characteristics pose three fundamental challenges involving channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of which must be addressed simultaneously to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical settings. However, existing architectures typically address only parts of these challenges in isolation and still rely on simplifying assumptions, leaving unresolved the combined challenges of asynchronous channel sampling, test-time missing blocks, and intricate inter-channel dependencies. To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based forecasting framework with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets reflecting practical settings, along with one private real-world industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.", "tldr": "To address a trio of real-world challenges involving inter-channel dependencies, asynchronous sampling, and test-time missing blocks, we introduce ChannelTokenFormer that achieves robust performance without requiring explicit temporal alignment.", "keywords": ["Time Series Forecasting", "Channel Dependence", "Asynchronous Sampling", "Missing Blocks"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/504f1fb3bbccb3a5b6818c1add59aaafb7bd50a7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/16ab3562bd6163a81d659e57efaa0bc2dad0cefc.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies the multivariate time series forecasting problem and focus on modeling cross-channel correlations, handling misalignment in sampling frequencies and periods, and dealing with missing data.

The authors identify three key challenges that often co-occur in practice but are typically addressed in isolation by existing methods: (1) complex inter-channel dependencies, (2) channel-wise asynchronous sampling (different channels having different sampling rates), and (3) block-wise missing values at test time.\n\nThe core contribution is a unified model that handles these three challenges simultaneously without relying on interpolation, which can introduce spectral distortion. The key components of CTF are: 1.Channel Tokens: Repurposed from prior work, these tokens act as global summaries or \"attention anchors\" for each channel. 2. Frequency-Based Dynamic Patching: Each channel is patched non-uniformly based on its dominant frequency (detected via FFT) and sampling rate, naturally accommodating asynchrony. 3. Unified Mask-Guided Attention: A single attention mechanism processes both local (patch) tokens and global (channel) tokens. A carefully designed attention mask controls information flow, allowing local tokens to attend only within their channel, while channel tokens can aggregate information from their own local tokens and other channel tokens, enabling cross-channel communication. 4. Patch Masking: Missing blocks are handled by simply removing the corresponding local tokens from the input, a strategy for which the model is prepared via random patch masking during training.\n\nThe authors conduct extensive experiments on \"practical\" versions of four standard benchmarks (ETT, Weather, SolarWind) and two real-world datasets (EPA-Air, LNG Cargo Handling). The results demonstrate that CTF consistently outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art models in settings with asynchronous sampling and test-time missingness."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The unified attention mechanism has a computational complexity that is quadratic in the total number of tokens (patches + channel tokens). The authors' own analysis shows OOM at 280 channels on a 24GB GPU.

While practical motivation for the mask-guided attention and frequency-based patching is strong, the formal theoretical analysis is somewhat lacking.  For example, the impact of frequency-based patching on generalization is empirically supported but not mathematically justified.\n2. The bulk of the validation is empirical, with most arguments for effectiveness given by ablations and performance gains. The absence of principled theoretical results or proofs (e.g., why the particular masking scheme is optimal or robust under certain classes of missingness) is noticeable. For example, the construction of attention masks (as shown in **Figures 7, 8, 9**) is justified via heuristic motivation rather than analytical optimality or formal properties.\n3. The manuscript provides a detailed exposition of the proposed method; however, certain sections are densely structured and may be difficult for readers to follow. In addition, the notation conventions—such as the definitions of the mask matrix, channel tokens, and sampling factors (see Sections 3 and 4)—are somewhat cumbersome and could benefit from simplification or clearer explanations. Moreover, some formulas are embedded directly within the main text, which further hinders readability and could be better presented as numbered equations or in a dedicated formula environment.\n4. The modification of canonical datasets into \"practical\" versions (e.g., Weather-practical, SolarWind) relies on synthetic resampling and missingness injection, which may bias the comparison to baselines. While the intention and utility of these datasets are strong, it is unclear how they reflect real-world statistical complexity versus controlled synthetic heterogeneity, and possible overfitting to constructed artifacts cannot be ruled out.\n5.  While the main architecture is described at a reasonably high level, some key hyperparameters are not specified in detail and are only provided as approximate ranges. Given the relatively complex pipeline and variable-dependent model configuration, this may hinder independent replication.\n6. Appendix B discusses the spectral effects of interpolation (with supporting figures), but the argument remains somewhat qualitative. Providing a more comprehensive, formal, and comparative mathematical analysis, including its impact on prediction accuracy and data outcomes, could enhance the scientific value and make the frequency-related discussion more broadly applicable.\n7.  The paper acknowledges some scalability and generalization challenges in the conclusion but otherwise does not engage deeply with possible failure modes or cases where ChannelTokenFormer might underperform (e.g., non-stationary environments, highly irregular or bursty missingness patterns, or settings with weak cross-channel structure).\n8. Limited Superiority in Conventional Settings: Although the model is evaluated on regularly sampled multivariate time series without missing values to demonstrate its general applicability, the results shown in Table 15 indicate that it does not consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art baselines in this conventional forecasting setting. This suggests that the architectural advantages of ChannelTokenFormer—designed primarily for handling asynchrony and missingness—may not translate into clear gains when data are fully observed and regularly sampled."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can the authors provide more insights or theoretical grounding for why the proposed mask-guided attention scheme is robust to a wide variety of missingness patterns and channel asynchrony, beyond heuristic and experimental support?\n2. How sensitive is the model to hyperparameters governing patch size selection—especially when the dominant period is weak or ambiguous? Could a poorly tuned FFT threshold degrade performance?\n3. Regarding dataset construction: can the authors clarify to what extent the practical benchmark setups (modified from canonical datasets) reflect organic missingness and sampling asynchrony found in the wild, rather than synthetically controlled structures? Can the robustness of CTF be validated on additional non-synthetic real-world datasets?\n4. Could the authors expand on which failure modes arise with their approach (e.g., with highly bursty, uncorrelated missingness, or in scenarios with low cross-channel redundancy)?\n5.
