Although significant progress has been made in intelligent solving approaches for small- and medium-scale VRPs, current methods still face three major limitations when dealing with real-world large-scale multi-task scenarios: 1) Neural heuristic models trained on small-scale datasets struggle to generalize effectively to larger problem instances; 2) The computation time of traditional optimizers grows nonlinearly with problem scale, making them impractical for real-time decision-making; 3) Current solution approaches lack systematic mechanisms to handle the complex interactions and constraints between multiple concurrent tasks in an integrated manner. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the MoE-Based Partitioning and Merging (PAML) framework, with two key innovations: 1) A learnable and scalable implicit partitioner capable of handling multiple VRP variants, which optimizes partitioning strategies through end-to-end reinforcement learning, effectively overcoming training data scale limitations; 2) A dynamic merging mechanism based on polar angle clustering that enables intelligent control of subproblem sizes. This design allows efficient parallel solving of the partitioned VRP subproblems. Experimental results demonstrate that across various synthetic and real-world multi-task VRP variants of different scales, the PAML method shows remarkable improvements over its base solver model: reducing route length by up to 48.71\\% for 2000-node problems and 20.66\\% for 1000-node problems. For real-world CVRP-LIB instances, PAML achieves a 16.78\\% reduction in routing distance compared to MVMoE while maintaining solution quality within 4.93\\% of OR-Tools. Remarkably, PAML requires only one-tenth of OR-Tools' computation time (0.95s vs 14.23s on average).", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Combinatorial Optimization", "Large-scale VRPs", "Multi-task VRPs", "Learning to Optimize", "Mixture of Experts (MoE)"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/557fe433417acd6b85a6f95d114f60d34542703e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9b5f9f2d786ce76e9f7f698555d51f6e84e378c7.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents the PAML framework, a novel partitioning-based method designed to tackle medium- to large-scale Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) instances and their variants.

While it utilizes existing decomposition models and multi-task solvers like MVMoE, it fails to introduce significant novel elements or methodologies to genuinely advance the field.\n\n2. The appendix results reveal that the method's performance on 1000- and 2000-node instances is underwhelming, indicating a notable gap between the paper's theoretical promises and its practical effectiveness.\n\n3. The methodology section is encumbered by redundant formulas and lacks clarity in explaining key processes. The end-to-end training of the partitioner, subproblem merging, and final solution combination are not adequately detailed. The appendix also fails to provide vivid or comprehensive explanations, relying too much on text without visual aids. A more concise and clear description of these processes in the main text is essential to enhance the paper's technical validity.\n\n4. The figures in the paper are repetitive and do not add significant value. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the same workflow without offering complementary insights, and they are not referenced or explained in the main text, which reduces their utility.\n\n5. The experimental section has multiple issues. The descriptions of the generated datasets and real-world benchmarks are vague, making it hard to evaluate the testing scenarios. The lack of detailed numerical tables obscures the model's specific performance and the experimental design's validity. Additionally, the baselines are too limited, only including OR-Tools and MVMoE, which restricts a comprehensive assessment of the model's capabilities.\n\n6.

The paper should clearly articulate what is genuinely novel beyond the combination of these existing techniques, and provide stronger motivation for the design choices. Furthermore, since the subproblem-solving capability depends entirely on pre-trained multi-task VRP solvers (e.g., MVMoE), the performance of PAML is inherently constrained by the underlying solver’s capacity.\n\n3) Presentation quality issues: The paper suffers from important main results demonstration, poor figure quality (Figure 5 has poor readability with lines overlapping), and technical justification missing from main text, which are the major concerns of the presentation quality of whether the paper should be accepted. For example, there are missing justification for the important formula (8b) in section 4.2.5 and long-winded explanations in section 5.1.1 and conclusions (which could be improved by removing the detailed generation methods to the appendix, and refining the conclusion instead of repeating the contributions with much details. Adding limitations analysis or future works are also improvements).

Is this a specific named method or just the general approach of using polar angle sorting with adaptive target sizes from Table 1?  This could be explained better.\n\n2) In eqn (6), the author uses the concatenation of the best found solution to get an optimized solution for the complete problem. Can you explain why concatenating the optimal solutions of subproblems can optimize the objective solution of the complete problem? VRP is a global optimization problem where local optima in subproblems don't guarantee global optimality. How does your partitioning and merging naturally divide good clusters of subroutes that lead to near-optimal complete solutions?\n\n3) Why use this LMoE gating mechanism (in eqn (9)) for MOE gating instead of other MOE gating variants like expert choice or soft gating? An appropriate reference to such a mechanism and justification is could improve the methodology presentation. \n\n4)The training setups seem to be missing in the main manuscript or lack a reference to the Appendix. Without those details, it is difficult to evaluate the reproducibility of the proposed method. Could you add a training configuration table in the main text or provide a clear reference to the appendix section containing these details?\n\n5) How does PAML guarantee constraint satisfaction (capacity, time windows, route length) when merging subproblems? The penalty terms in Equation 8b (V_cap, V_tw, V_route) suggest soft constraints during training—what happens if merged subproblems become infeasible during inference? Do you verify feasibility before passing to the solver, and if so, how do you handle infeasible merges?\n\n6) Can you compare the proposed method with other SOTA MTL solvers?
