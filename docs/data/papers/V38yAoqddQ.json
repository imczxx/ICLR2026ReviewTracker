In Transformers, positional information is typically encoded using Positional Encodings (PEs). One such popular PE, namely Rotary PE (RoPE), has been widely used due to its empirical success. \nRecently, it has been argued that part of RoPE's success emerges from its ability to encode robust positional and semantic information using large and small frequencies, respectively. In this work, we perform a deeper dive into the positional versus symbolic dichotomy of attention heads behavior, both at the theoretical and empirical level. We provide general  definitions of what it means for a head to behave positionally or symbolically, prove that these are two mutually exclusive behaviors and develop a metric to quantify them.  \nWe apply our framework to analyze Transformer-based LLMs using RoPE and find that all heads exhibit a strong correspondence between behavior and frequency use.  \nFinally, we introduce canonical tasks designed to be either purely positional or symbolic, and demonstrate that the Transformer performance causally relates to the ability of attention heads to leverage the appropriate frequencies. In particular, we show that we can control the Transformer performance by controlling which frequencies the attention heads can access. Altogether, our work provides a detailed understanding of RoPE, and how its properties relate to model behavior.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Transformers architecture", "positional encodings", "Transformers theory", "large language models"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/54dfcffc59dd2a6e0f6c41b9e4a5f3ca3c407178.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors formalise what it means for a head to behave positionally or symbolically.

It further introduces two properties, locality and symmetry, to measure the two behaviors. Basically, a high (or low) locality corresponds to positional (or symbolic) behaviors. In other words, the locality here can depict the positional-symbolic profile of a language model, i.e., a high locality is aligned with the RoPE with a high frequency. However, the authors did not discuss the main distinction of this work compared to prior studies, which undermines the contribution of this work.\n\n* The presentation requires further improments.
