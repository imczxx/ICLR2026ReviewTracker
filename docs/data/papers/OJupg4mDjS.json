It has a common thread running through it that makes it easy to follow the story. Thus, I could read it in one go and understood all the core ideas. Furthermore, I think all the necessary information is included in the paper needed to reproduce the method and the experiments. The division of information between main text and appendix is also sensible.\n\n**Novelty:**\nI think the introduced method is novel and advances the state-of-the-art in measure-based (geometric) data analysis. Thus, I consider it to be a contribution worthy of being published at ICLR. The distinction to similar methods (esp. TPCA) is clearly made and well-explained.\n\n**Theory:**\nThe included theory is sound and reasonable. To me, all the included theoretical results clearly connect to the overall story of the paper and are well explained. \n\n**Reproducability:**\nWith the provided information, the method (esp. the ac. formulation) should be easy to implement. I liked especially that pseudo-code (Alg. 1) was provided, as this always makes things easier to understand. Furthermore, all the experiments are well documented to level where one could reproduce them."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Scalability:** I am a bit worried about the scalability of the method.

Thus, the paper leaves the gap what would happen for larger datasets and what kind of resources the method requires in such a scenario.

As mentioned above, the examples are small and restricted to synthetic examples. Thus, I do not see on which applications the paper could have an (immediate) impact. As I see this as a more of a theoretical/modelling work, I do not consider this as a major issue.

This can be used to define for instance an outlier score, by comparing distance between each datapoint and the PCA subspace. The authors do not consider this, but the fact that it is easily possible reveals the general value of the technique."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I am worried about the following:\n* **Use of regularization in neural network objectives.** In particular, using regularization to enforce geometric constraints is much weaker than incorporating them as a hard constraint via a clever parametrization. In practice, I suspect the different directions do not end up orthogonal, and it would be helpful to quantify how much this is a problem in practice, and how sensitive it is to hyperparameter tuning. I did not see an experiment directly addressing this.\n* **Experiments: Gaussian case should have at least *some* kind of non-synthetic evaluation.** Gaussian experiments are limited to toy datasets designed to highlight differences with ordinary PCA. While this is certainly necessary, it would have been better to also include some kind of non-synthetic datasets where the Gaussian mean and covariance is estimated empirically. For example, in continuous action imitation learning and RL, one often considers policies consisting of neural networks that learn a mean and covariance. In this domain, the authors' form of PCA could be used for things like outlier detection. I am not suggesting the authors necessarily need to add this specific example, more that it's important to have *something* non-synthetic for the Gaussian case since it's a central part of the paper.\n* **Experiments: why is there a theorem in the experiments section?** Theory should be presented separately from evaluation, this part should be moved to some part in main body.\n* **Experiments: Gaussian case is missing obvious baselines.** In 5.1, a natural baseline is to compare against is Euclidean PCA in the space of Cholesky coefficients of the covariance matrix. How would this produce different results compared to Euclidean PCA with respect to the SPD cone coordinates, or the proposed method?\n* **Experiments: non-Gaussian case is missing obvious baselines.** For the point cloud data presented, the most obvious way I can think of to do PCA is take some kind of off-the-shelf model like PointNet, and perform PCA in its latent space, and present the results. While this is certainly a much heavier method, I think some kind of visual comparison needs to be included in the main body, as this is the single most obvious performance question that readers might have.\n* **Experiments: no evaluation of downstream applications of PCA like outlier detection.** The authors do not evaluate how good the principal components produced are for any downstream purpose, instead they are just plotted to show their properties. I would like to see at least some kind of quantitative evaluation. For instance, this could be considered for outlier detection, to compare how well linear vs. the proposed geodesic PCA performs. Non-linear PCA has been studied for this specific purpose before, see for instance \"Quadric Hypersurface Intersection for Manifold Learning in Feature Space\" by Pavutnitskiy et al. which includes full experiments on this. Note that I am not suggesting the authors implement this specific downstream application of PCA, instead I think it is important to have at least some kind of evaluation of this kind."}, "questions": {"value": "The overwhelming majority of my concerns with this paper concern the comprehensiveness of evaluations and specifically comparisons with various baselines like PCA on PointNet latent space.
