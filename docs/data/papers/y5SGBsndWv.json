We introduce Asynchronous Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest observation, the predicted action from VLA(base action), a positional feature that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the base model’s competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23% point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control.", "tldr": "Real-time inference of VLAs with action chunking via lightweight correction model", "keywords": ["Vision-Language-Action", "Action Chunking", "Closed-Loop Control", "Robotics"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/453591194321556f5a9861794c2c962cfff10fb5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper aims to address latency problems with robotic policies at inference time by training an additional correction policy.

The motivation for this paper is quite clear, especially due to Figure 1 which clarifies the latency issues with robotic policies. The method is clearly written and is accompanied by several figures (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4) that clarify the complete system adequately. \n2. Residual policies are not completely new, but A2C2 proposes a very simple method for training one that does not require either reinforcement learning or additional demonstrations (as in the style of DAgger).  \n3. The paper has tested their proposed method on a range of environments (12 tasks in Kinetix and 10 tasks in LIBERO)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The paper does not compare A2C2 with a few important baseline methods like temporal ensemble (Zhao et. al.) and bidirectional decoding (Liu et. al.). The latter would be a valuable comparison because they also use a weaker policy to guide the action selection. These are standard baseline methods as used in papers such as real-time chunking (Black et. al.). \n2. No comparison against real-time chunking (RTC) on LIBERO Spatial. This is confusing because RTC was used for comparison in Kinetix but not on LIBERO Spatial. Unlike in Kinetix, you use a significantly larger correction head (of 32M params) in LIBERO Spatial, which makes the delay $d > 0$ when $e = 40$. This makes the comparison against RTC very crucial to understand how having an additional correction head fares against the guidance provided by inpainting. \n3. One of the benefits of using action chunking is the ability to capture temporal consistency in actions executed (Liu et. al., Torne et. al., Black et. al.) which is captured by either conditioning on a longer context of observations (generally not preferred because of overfitting issues), longer context of actions or by predicting the chunk of actions. The correction head of A2C2 only conditions on the most recent observation, the most recent base action and the most recent latent representation. It is not clear to me how the correction head ensures temporal consistency across actions in this situation. As an illustration, the correction head’s residual action could cause the policy to switch from high velocity to low velocity and so on. \n4. The need for ablations here is quite large to help us understand whether the performance gains of A2C2 come from greater closed-loop responsiveness or whether it comes from residual action correction or whether it comes from being able to use action correlations across time-steps (Torne et. al.). In particular, I am interested in ablations over what the correction head can condition on i.e., how important is it that the correction head conditions on base policy’s action, latent representations, current observation, and time signature. \n\nMinor: \n1. It would be good to indicate that the action is sampled from a stochastic policy i.e., $A_t \\sim \\pi(\\cdot \\mid o_t, l)$, since the current notation almost suggests that the policy is deterministic. \n2. The paper could benefit from a rigorous check on spelling (such as capitalizations in phrases like “Average Success rate are…”) and polishing the syntax (such as using $\\pi_\\mathrm{base}$ instead of $\\pi_{base}$)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The importance of conditioning on the time feature is unclear to me. In line 199, you claim that it brings about greater “chunk level smoothness”. Some ablations could be helpful here since, intuitively, it almost feels like conditioning on the observation, base action and base policy’s latent representations might be sufficient? \n2. The central assumption here seems to be that the correction head can be made significantly smaller than the base policy. This is, certainly, an interesting scientific question, and it requires more empirical support. For generalist policies, it is not clear whether this assumption is fair. The language instructions, observations, etc. become more complex and diverse. How large the correction head needs to be able to learn this complexity is unclear. This question is not sufficiently well-answered since the complexity of the tasks (and the fact that the policy is not conditioned on image observations) in Kinetix is quite low and the tasks in LIBERO Spatial do not consist of a sufficiently large diversity. \n3. Extending on (1), the need for the correction head to be strong is greater when the policy needs to both generalize and react to environmental stochasticity. In the case of A2C2, even though you may benefit from a robust base policy, it is not clear to me whether you can get a correction head that also generalizes while also not suffering from large inference-time. Similarly, if the need for reactivity is such that the correction head does not merely need to add a residual correction to the base action but change the mode in the distribution altogether, then we might require a much stronger correction head and it’s not clear to me why the inference-time of such a model would be sufficiently small for A2C2 to be able to handle delays. \n4. Figure 5 shows the average over all tasks but a separate comparison within each task would be very important since some tasks in Kinetix require significantly greater closed-loop responsiveness over others. Perhaps this could be done in the appendix? Furthermore, it would be good to show that standard deviation/error within the average result plot."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "yPXao5w2dg", "forum": "y5SGBsndWv", "replyto": "y5SGBsndWv", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7354/Reviewer_b9NY"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7354/Reviewer_b9NY"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7354/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761000013967, "cdate": 1761000013967, "tmdate": 1762919489930, "mdate": 1762919489930, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a novel method, Asynchronous Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), to deal with the drawbacks of traditional action chunks, where the chunk length is fixed.

The authors identify that the common practice of \"action chunking,\" where a sequence of actions is predicted at once, leads to performance degradation in dynamic environments because the executed actions are based on stale observations. To mitigate this, they propose A2C2 (Asynchronous Action Chunk Correction), a lightweight add-on module that refines the base policy's pre-computed actions in real-time using the most recent observation. A2C2 is trained to predict a residual action, which is added to the base action, effectively closing the loop and providing reactivity without retraining the large, expensive base VLA.

The paper clearly formulates a critical, real-world problem—the loss of reactivity due to inference latency in large VLAs—that becomes more pressing as models scale. The framing of the problem, including the definitions of delay (d), horizon (H), and execution horizon (e), is precise and insightful.\n\n2. The proposed A2C2 method is conceptually simple, architecturally lightweight, and highly practical. Its design as a plug-and-play residual correction head that can be attached to any pre-trained chunking policy is a major strength, as it avoids the prohibitive cost of fine-tuning large foundation models.\n\n3. The paper provides a thorough empirical validation across two diverse simulation environments (Kinetix and LIBERO), which have different characteristics (highly dynamic vs. spatial reasoning). The experiments systematically test the method under varying delays and horizons, convincingly showing that A2C2 outperforms baselines across the board. The inclusion of inference time benchmarks (showing a 20x speedup over the base policy) solidifies the claim of low overhead.\n\n4. The performance gains are substantial. For instance, on LIBERO with a significant delay (d=10, e=40), A2C2 improves the success rate from 67% to 84%. The results in the Kinetix environment (Table 4) are particularly striking, where A2C2 maintains high success rates even under large delays where other methods fail catasthetically.\n\n5.

While the core method is validated, a more detailed ablation study would strengthen the paper.

Understanding which components are most critical would provide deeper insight.\n\n2. The paper focuses on success rates but provides little discussion or qualitative analysis of how the correction head fails when it does, or in what scenarios it might not help. A discussion of the limitations and potential failure modes (e.g., in extremely out-of-distribution states) would provide a more balanced view.\n\n3. The correction head uses different architectures for the two benchmarks (a simple MLP for Kinetix and a more complex transformer encoder for LIBERO). The rationale for this difference, and an ablation showing whether the simpler MLP could suffice for LIBERO (or vice versa), is missing. This leaves some questions about the general architectural requirements for the correction head.\n\n4. The evaluation in LIBERO, while valid, uses a set of instructions that are structurally very similar (all variations of \"pick up the black bowl and place it on the plate\").

Were there any observed issues with the correction head producing overly large or unstable corrections that could lead to jerky or unsafe motions, especially at the boundaries between chunks? Is the smoothness purely emergent from the data, or was it explicitly encouraged?\n\n3. The results show that A2C2 helps even in the absence of delay (d=0) on long horizons (e.g., H=50).
