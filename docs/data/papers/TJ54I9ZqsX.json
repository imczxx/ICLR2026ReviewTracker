However, these models are fundamentally constrained by their discrete-time, Markovian framework, which neglects long-range temporal correlations and inevitably leads to error accumulation in long-horizon forecasting. To address this limitation, we introduce the Equivariant Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (EG-NODE), a novel framework that directly learns the continuous-time evolution laws of physical systems. Instead of predicting discrete future states, EG-NODE leverages an equivariant GNN as its core to directly model the ordinary differential equation governing the system’s instantaneous rate of change the physical laws of motion thereby natively preserving SE(3) symmetry within the learning process. This continuous-time paradigm enables high-precision predictions at arbitrary time points and allows for the use of adaptive step-size solvers to dynamically balance computational efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on N-body, molecular, and fluid dynamics benchmarks demonstrate that EG-NODE significantly outperforms existing discrete models in long-horizon prediction accuracy and effectively suppresses error propagation. Our work establishes a more fundamental, first-principles-based paradigm for learning continuous physical laws from data.", "tldr": "Graph Neural Networks; Ordinary Differential Equation", "keywords": ["spatio-temporal; out-of-distribution"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a6b57b6dcb7526818ae07385cf2f055e2103c7f4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work presents a method to mitigate error accumulation in physical system simulations using deep learning. The approach combines three key components: (1) a message-passing graph neural network (GNN), (2) equivariant engineered features derived from particle positions and velocities, and (3) a Neural-ODE–like integration scheme that enables the model to learn a continuous-time representation without relying on an explicit time step. The motivation is to alleviate the error accumulation typical of discrete integrators such as Euler methods, while reducing data requirements and improving generalization through the use of equivariances. The method is evaluated on three benchmark problems: N-body dynamics, molecular dynamics, and fluid dynamics, demonstrating superior rollout predictions compared to existing approaches.

Moreover, several prior works have already explored the integration of NeuralODEs with non-equivariant GNNs. Consequently, the main novelty of this paper lies primarily in the use of equivariant GNNs, rather than in the combination of NeuralODEs and GNNs itself (see Questions for more information).\n* Even though the code is available, the paper lacks any details about the datasets used."}, "questions": {"value": "* Line 137: While it may indeed be the first attempt to combine NeuralODEs with equivariant GNNs, there already exists a substantial body of work integrating NeuralODEs with non-equivariant GNNs, which the authors overlook in the literature review.
