Despite their strong modeling ability, most diffusion-based recommenders face limited generative control because the standard classifier-free guidance derives its repulsive signal from a global and user-agnostic unconditional prior, which prevents the model from directly exploiting negative feedback at inference. A natural solution is to replace the unconditional prior with user-aware negative conditions. However, this is challenging because, unlike in text-to-image tasks where negative prompts acquire stable semantics from a pre-trained text encoder, item embeddings in recommendation are learned dynamically. As a result, a ''negative condition'' is not guaranteed to provide effective repulsive guidance unless the model is explicitly trained to recognize it as a signal for avoidance. To enable effective and steerable negative guidance in diffusion recommenders, we propose **SteerRec**, a novel framework built upon two core innovations. At inference, we introduce Positive-Negative Guidance (PNG) inference mechanism, which replaces the generic unconditional prior with a user-aware negative condition. To ensure the negative condition provides meaningful repulsive guidance in the dynamic embedding space, we design a Guidance Alignment Triplet Loss (GAL). The GAL is a margin-based objective that explicitly aligns the training process with PNG by ensuring the model’s prediction under a positive condition is closer to the target item than its prediction under a negative condition. Extensive experiments on three widely used public benchmarks provide strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness of SteerRec.

Traditional diffusion-based recommenders struggle with incorporating negative feedback during inference, as the existing classifier-free guidance (CFG) mechanism relies on a global, user-agnostic prior, which limits control over the generative process. SteerRec addresses this limitation by introducing Positive-Negative Guidance (PNG), which uses user-aware negative feedback to explicitly steer the generation process away from undesired items.

SteerRec's key contribution is the Positive-Negative Guidance (PNG) mechanism based on the well-known classifier-free guidance, which directly integrates user-aware negative feedback into the inference process of diffusion model-based recommenders, providing enhanced control over the generation process. To further optimize the proposed of PNG, the authors introduce the Guidance Alignment Triplet Loss which ensures that the negative guidance is both meaningful and effective during training. This alignment makes the model's predictions more reliable and better aligned with user preferences. The combination of both modules is both logical and effective.\n\n2. SteerRec converges faster than its counterparts like PreferDiff, demonstrating that its direct and efficient learning signal enhances the model's ability to learn user preferences quickly."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Paper Writing:** A major issue in the paper's writing is the lack of a detailed comparison between SteerRec and previous methods (e.g., DreamRec [1], PreferDiff [2]). This omission assumes that readers are already familiar with diffusion-based recommenders, which increases the reading burden for those who may not have such background knowledge. Further\n\n2. **Brute Force Sampling:** I think the author's motivation is both reasonable and compelling. Replacing CFG with recommendation-tailored guidance is essential. However, in practice, the method of constructing the negative condition during inference by randomly sampling a set of items from the global item corpus seems somewhat crude. This approach overlooks the unique preferences encoded in the user's historical representation, potentially leading to less precise guidance. I think more tailored approaches for selecting negative samples that are more in line with the principles of diffusion-based recommenders.   I also noticed in Appendix F that the authors' experiments show SteerRec performing well when high-quality negative samples from the MIND dataset are used. **However, obtaining high-quality negative samples is challenging in most real-world scenarios.** Addressing this issue should be a key focus of the paper, as both PNG and GAL are quite intuitive ideas. A potential solution could involve methods to generate or identify high-quality negative samples in settings where they are not readily available.\n\n3. **Missing Some Hyperparameter Experiments** I find some key experiments related to diffusion, such as the impact of the diffusion steps and DDIM steps, were not presented. If SteerRec requires fewer diffusion or DDIM steps compared to PreferDiff, it would further highlight the efficiency brought by the introduction of negative guidance. Showing these results would provide stronger evidence for the practical benefits of SteerRec's approach.\n\n4. **Need More Novelty on Negative Guidance** The use of relevant negative signals aggregated into a centroid is shown to be effective in PreferDiff, but this approach lacks some novelty in SteerRec. A potential improvement could be to explore why other users' representations are not used as negative samples. Incorporating negative samples from different users might provide richer and more diverse guidance.\n\n\n[1] Yang, Zhengyi, et al. \"Generate what you prefer: Reshaping sequential recommendation via guided diffusion.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2023): 24247-24261.\n\n[2] Liu, Shuo, et al. \"Preference Diffusion for Recommendation.\" The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "wOTr5JLpw5", "forum": "nT7UlrSJzF", "replyto": "nT7UlrSJzF", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10573/Reviewer_kUAa"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10573/Reviewer_kUAa"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10573/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761931808794, "cdate": 1761931808794, "tmdate": 1762921843729, "mdate": 1762921843729, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focuses on the improvement of conditional guidance strategies for diffusion-based recommender systems.

Nevertheless, the paper does not include any discussion or analysis regarding the cold-start problem.\n3. **Training–inference inconsistency:** The proposed method computes the negative condition during training using in-batch negatives; however, batch information is unavailable during inference, so only random negative sampling can be applied. In this case, if positive items are accidentally sampled as negatives, it may undermine the validity of the negative condition.\n4. **Lack of efficiency analysis:** The proposed method requires explicit random negative sampling during inference to compute the negative condition, which could further reduce the model’s recommendation efficiency and even affect its applicability in online settings.
