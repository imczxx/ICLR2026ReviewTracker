Internal representation–based methods have emerged as the prevailing direction for detecting hallucinations, yet the internal representations often fail to yield clear separability between truthful and hallucinatory content. To address this challenge, we study the separability of  the sensitivity to prompt-induced perturbations in the internal representations. A theory is established to show that, with non-negligible probability, each sample admits a prompt under which factual samples exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt-induced perturbations than hallucinatory samples. When the theory is applied to the representative datasets, the probability reaches nearly 99%, suggesting that sensitivity to perturbations provides a discriminative indicator. Building on this insight, we propose a theory-informed method Sample-Specific Prompting (SSP), which adaptively selects prompts to perturb the model’s internal states and measures the resulting sensitivity as a detection indicator. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SSP consistently outperforms existing hallucination detection methods, validating the practical effectiveness of our method SSP in hallucination detection.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Hallucination Detection", "Large Language Models", "Prompt Learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/66488d1ef8a4e92ad8ef067d06d95fd1ba248fd9.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel approach to detect hallucinations in LLMs by analyzing the sensitivity of internal representations to prompt-induced perturbations.

The paper should better situate itself among prior perturbation-based hallucination detection methods (e.g., SPUQ[1]), which often find hallucinated outputs to be more sensitive.

It would be beneficial to decode and display the perturbed prompts  and report model performance under perturbation.If performance degrades significantly, the method requires two inference passes per sample -- one for generation, one for decoding. In that case, comparisons to simpler baselines, such as linear probes, may no longer be fair given the added computational cost.\n\n3. The proof in Section 3 appears to formalize the intuition rather than justify it. It assumes the existence of a prompt per sample that maximizes sensitivity for non-hallucinated outputs and minimizes it for hallucinated outputs. However, a symmetric argument could be made in the reverse direction if the prompt is assumed to minimize sensitivity for hallucinated outputs. This does not resolve the tension noted above and can make the theoretical claim more confusing.\n\n4. The motivation for defining a separate “separation” metric is unclear. It seems closely related to AUROC and does not appear in prior literature; the added value should be clarified.\n\n5.

The central claim—that prompt-induced sensitivity can differentiate truthful from hallucinatory outputs—appears largely empirical and circular, since prompts are tuned per sample in a way that trivially enforces separability - if I am not missing something. The “theoretical” results are more notational restatements of empirical intuition rather than proofs grounded in meaningful probabilistic assumptions. The dependence on oracle-style prompt optimization raises questions about scalability and real-world feasibility—how such per-sample prompt adjustments can be achieved during inference is unclear.\n\nMoreover, the methodology is excessively complex for what amounts to a perturbation-based scoring heuristic. Theoretical bounds presented (Theorems 1 and 2) are neither practically verifiable nor rigorously linked to model architecture or data distributions. The authors claim near-perfect separability (~99%) but later concede that this is merely an “oracle lower bound,” which significantly weakens the practical impact. In the experiments, improvements in AUROC are modest (a few percentage points) once fair baselines and realistic labeling conditions are considered. There is also no statistical significance testing or error analysis to justify the claimed robustness.\n\nConceptually, the idea of “sensitivity-guided detection” overlaps with well-known approaches in adversarial robustness and influence functions, but these connections are not acknowledged. The paper’s novelty claim therefore feels overstated.
