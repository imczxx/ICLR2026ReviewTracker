The theoretical foundation of VSR hinges on a simplified assumption that disjoint supports (gaps) exist in high-dimensional data manifolds. This assumption holds for synthetic or low-dimensional distributions (e.g., 1D/2D Gaussians, discrete combinatorial datasets like Cards/ChessImages), but it may easily break down for continuous, correlated natural image manifolds. For example, in the high-dimensional image space, distributions of semantically different classes such as cats vs. dogs, or cats vs. tigers, may overlap in the feature manifold as they share visual attributes like eyes, fur, and texture.\n\n2. Lemma 1, lacking a formal proof and relying on the above assumption, is more a heuristic hypothesis than a mathematically valid lemma. As a result, the derived bounds may not apply to real-world generative tasks where class manifolds are continuous and overlapping.\n\n3. The lower bound derived in Theorem 2 relies on strong regularity assumptions including L-Lipschitz continuity, bounded scores, and compact boundaries, which rarely hold for high-dimensional natural images. The bounds thus provide conceptual intuition but limited quantitative predictive power.\n\n4. The proposed regularizer encourages larger Jacobians, but intuitively, large Jacobians can also cause instability or excessive curvature in score fields, potentially harming training stability if not carefully tuned.

The introduction is a bit misleading. It mentions hallucinations in large T2I models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion 3.5 (L31–35, L39-42) and links them to fairness issues, but the proposed score regularization method can’t directly be applied to those models. These models are flow-matching based and don’t expose their variance heads. It would be good to clarify what kind of diffusion models this method can actually work on, and whether it’s limited to toy.\n\n2. The jump from the theorem to the method isn’t convincing. Section 4 argues that smooth scores lead to nonzero mass in “gap” regions, but the proposed loss simply increases the Jacobian norm everywhere. There’s no argument that this increase happens only on the data manifold. In low-density regions the score and Jacobian can already be large, so this might even amplify off-support gradients—the opposite of what’s intended. The paper should either analyze this behavior region-wise or show empirically that larger Jacobians actually correlate with fewer hallucinations.\n\n3. The paper is hard to follow, e.g., Tables 2 and 3 are confusing.  \n   - Table 2 shows H% values above 100 (e.g., 521.73) even though it’s described as a percentage.  I couldn’t find a clear explanation of what these numbers mean or how they’re computed in the paper.\n   - The same metric switches notation between H% and %H in Table 3.  \n\n4. Figure 4b is also hard to interpret. The plot suggests that when $\\lambda=0.0$, the learned score is closer to the true score, and increasing $\\lambda$ makes it worse. This looks opposite to the claim that the regularizer improves the score field. In L252, it seems the regularization strength is the weight of the proposed loss? \n\n5. It’s not clear how the smoothness loss is balanced with the standard denoising loss over time. The score magnitude changes a lot with t, so applying the same weight $\\rho$ everywhere might over-regularize some steps. The paper doesn’t show any per-t weighting or sensitivity analysis for $\\rho$ and $\\eta$.

The biggest weakness of the paper is that its theorems are the unsurprising consequences of the assumptions (P1-3, A4), and the reviewer believe it is not responsible for the actual effect of the regularizer. By assuming that a smooth function has positive values on the boundary of a region, it is natural that it has non-empty integral in the interior. All the quantities (Lipschitzness, norm bounds) are merely quantities in the assumption and the paper does not show the scale of these quantities in experiments, therefore we cannot conclude that whether the assumptions are playing a significant role in inducing hallucinations in practice.\n\nFurthermore, the theorem highlights that in order to reduce hallucination, we may need to enlarge the sharpness of the learned function in gap regions. However, the regularizer proposed in the paper encourages sharpness in the non-gap regions (training data supports). Therefore the theorem is not accountable for how the regularizer work in practice. Furthermore, in the experiments the paper is comparing models with / without regularizer with different score errors, making the comparison ineffective as score error is an important confounder for generation quality and hallucination rates.\n \n2.
