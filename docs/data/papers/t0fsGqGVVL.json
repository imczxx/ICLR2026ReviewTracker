While recent advances in deep learning and foundation models have led to substantial improvements in general time series forecasting, most existing approaches fail to capture the complex spatial interdependencies and uncertainty inherent in electricity markets. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset across 24 European countries (38 regions), spanning from 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01. Building on this groundwork, we propose PriceFM, a spatiotemporal foundation model that integrates graph-based inductive biases to capture spatial interdependencies across interconnected electricity markets. The model is designed for multi-region, multi-timestep, and multi-quantile probabilistic electricity price forecasting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm the model’s effectiveness, consistently outperforming competitive baselines and highlighting the importance of spatial context in electricity markets.", "tldr": "We present a comprehensive dataset and propose PriceFM, a foundation model with generic structure for probabilistic electricity price forecasting.", "keywords": ["Day-Ahead Electricity Market", "Electricity Dataset", "Foundation Model", "Probabilistic Forecasting"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/371eae50e42fe6760b66fb918b83864a27264a3e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b3174d4eadbc15ad881d7aa3f6cff514070e5b9f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents PriceFM, a foundation model for probabilistic forecasting of electricity prices in the European market.

Addressing it effectively could benefit a wide range of stakeholders across the energy ecosystem.\n\n- **Large-scale and comprehensive analysis**: The study is conducted at an unprecedented European scale, integrating data from multiple interconnected markets. To the best of my knowledge, this is among the first works to tackle electricity price forecasting at continental resolution, which greatly enhances its practical relevance.\n\n- **Strong empirical performance**: PriceFM achieves consistently positive results across benchmarks, outperforming or matching strong baselines in most regions and time horizons.\n\n- **Extensive ablation study**: The paper includes a thorough and well-designed ablation analysis, providing clear insights into the contribution of each architectural component and validating the robustness of the proposed approach."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **Limited exploration of foundation model capabilities**:One of the defining aspects of a foundation model is its ability to generalize and adapt to downstream tasks via fine-tuning or task-specific adaptation. While the paper presents strong results for day-ahead price forecasting, it does not explore whether PriceFM retains its performance when adapted to other related forecasting problems, such as load, renewable generation, or multi-step prediction. Demonstrating this adaptability would strengthen the claim of PriceFM being a true foundation model.\n\n- **Missing simple baselines for context**: It is well known that simple models such as XGBoost can achieve competitive results in electricity price forecasting. Even if these models might not outperform deep architectures at large scales, including them would provide valuable context for understanding how much PriceFM improves over widely adopted, industry-standard approaches.\n\n- **Clarity of exposition and figures**: Although the method is understandable, some parts of the exposition could be clearer. Figure 3 and the explanations in Section 4 are somewhat difficult to follow. A higher-level schematic in Section 3 showing the overall architecture, complemented by more focused sub-figures or diagrams for the specific modules in Section 4, could improve readability. However, I understand that space limitations might make this challenging.\n\n- **Discussion on temporal window length**: The paper states that the optimal input window size is 24 hours, which is somewhat surprising given prior work showing that longer temporal lags can be beneficial [1], especially for exogenous variables that encode past consumption and generation patterns. Could the authors elaborate on this? Is this limitation due to the architecture (e.g., difficulty modeling long-term dependencies), or has it another reason? Extending the model with transformer-based encoders might allow the incorporation of longer temporal contexts. This does not undermine the contribution, but a deeper discussion would help delineate the model’s limitations and potential future extensions, as we are talking about a foundation model.\n\n- **Training data representativeness**: The main concern lies in the training period. The training dataset spans 2022–2024, a period heavily affected by the European energy crisis following the war in Ukraine, which led to reduced Russian gas supply, significant price spikes, and direct market interventions by national governments [2–4]. As a result, the model might have learned representations tied to an anomalous regime rather than general market dynamics. Since this work positions PriceFM as a foundation model, it would be important to test its robustness and transferability to other periods, for example, by training on pre-crisis data, performing zero-shot evaluation, or exploring simple fine-tuning on different years to assess its adaptability under more typical market conditions.\n\n[1] Vega-Márquez, B., Solís-García, J., Nepomuceno-Chamorro, I.

The model is trained from scratch on one domain and does not demonstrate cross‑task/region transfer, pretraining, or in‑context generalization typically associated with \"foundation models.\" The paper partially reframes \"foundation\" as reusable architecture (citing a survey), but experiments do not evaluate zero‑shot to unseen regions, fine‑tuning efficiency, or few‑shot adaptation that would substantiate the term. Consider tempering the claim or adding transfer studies.\n\nThere are some baseline fairness / inconsistencies.\n\nQuantile‑capable baselines are missing. For probabilistic forecasting, strong references like TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformer) with quantile loss, MQ‑RNN/DeepAR‑style distributional heads, LightGBM‑QR, or NGBoost are standard: current TS FMs are evaluated only on point metrics (no AQL/CRPS), limiting the strength of the probabilistic claim. \n\nThere is an internal inconsistency: Sec. 5.1.3 says TS FMs ingest all regions concatenated (single multi‑region model), but Appendix E states they are \"limited to single‑region prediction\" requiring 38 separate models. Which setting produced Table 1? This affects both capacity and data exposure comparisons. Please clarify.\n\nThe statistical testing details are insufficient. The Diebold‑Mariano (DM) test is computed by pooling all instances (Appendix H.7), but for multi‑step daily horizons the loss differential is likely serially correlated. No HAC/Newey‑West variance correction is mentioned, which may inflate significance. Clarify whether a robust DM variant was used.\n\nThe calibration is not evaluated. Beyond AQL and AQCR, probabilistic quality should include coverage, interval width, PIT histograms, or CRPS/WIS. This is crucial in markets with fat tails and spikes (the chosen test period intentionally contains many). Without calibration evidence, the practical value for risk metrics (VaR/ES) is unclear.\n\nThe \"Joint\" forecasting claim is ambiguous. The head outputs quantiles across all T simultaneously, but the paper does not model or evaluate joint dependence across time or regions (e.g., multivariate calibration or energy score). Calling the output \"joint\" may be misleading, currently it is vector‑valued marginal quantiles with within‑vector monotonicity.\n\nOverall, the paper has some solid points, but there are many circumstances that show limited novelty in terms of the paper's real-world applicability. For example, the graph prior is static and overly coarse: the decay relies on topological hop distance computed via BFS and a scalar curvature per region. European interzonal congestion, NTCs, and physical flows are highly time‑varying; a static, unweighted distance likely mis‑specifies influence during islanding or congestion events. We need to see how good the results are during congestion events."}, "questions": {"value": "For FEDformer / iTransformer / PatchTST / TimesNet / TimeXer, did you train one multi‑region model (features concatenated, as in Sec. 5.1.3) or 38 region‑specific models (as in Appendix E)?
