However, while convergence analyses for SL algorithms such as Sequential Split Learning (SSL) and Split Federated Learning (SFL) are well-established, their generalization bounds, especially those dependent on iteration-specific factors, remain largely unexplored, hindered by challenges like client drift and biased gradient estimates. In this work, we introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the generalization error of SL algorithms, leveraging an on-average stability approach to account for both local update drift and aggregation-induced errors. Our framework provides a novel connection between optimization and generalization, revealing how SSL and SFL differ in their stability profiles and generalization behavior. Specifically, we demonstrate that SSL excels in sparse client participation and long-horizon training, while SFL benefits from balanced participation in non-convex regimes, offering a clear guide for selecting the appropriate aggregation strategy. By deriving precise stability bounds for both convex and non-convex settings, we provide deep insights into the role of data heterogeneity, client drift, and aggregation mechanisms in SL. Extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 benchmarks validate our theoretical predictions, highlighting the robustness and applicability of our framework across a range of practical scenarios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Spilt learning", "Stability", "Generalization"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5309428f3c775aadae8f8a56a75ad97ef56b4e92.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the generalization error for Split Learning.

The paper simply lists the generalization upper bounds for SSL and SFL without offering clear guidance on which method is preferable under different scenarios.\n2.Limited Novelty: The novelty of the work is questionable, as there are existing analyses on the convergence bounds of SSL and SFL[1]. Generalization is a closely related field to convergence, and a more thorough discussion of how this work's theoretical contributions significantly advance the state of the art beyond existing convergence results is needed.\n3.Contradiction Between Theory and Experiments: The theoretical analysis concludes that the stability and generalization bounds improve as the number of participating clients per round decreases (i.e., a smaller M̃ for SSL or a smaller participation rate q for SFL). This directly contradicts the empirical observation in the experimental section, which states that \"higher client participation consistently improves stability.\" The authors do not provide any explanation for this significant discrepancy.\n4.Insufficient Experiments: The experiments are not comprehensive enough to fully validate the theoretical claims. A more robust evaluation would involve a wider range of datasets, models, and more detailed ablation studies to investigate the impact of key factors identified in the theory, such as data heterogeneity and the number of local steps.\n5.Formatting Issues: There are some formatting problems that need correction. For instance, in Theorem 4.5, the equation extends beyond the page margin, which affects readability.\n\n[1] Li, Yipeng, and Xinchen Lyu. \"Convergence analysis of sequential federated learning on heterogeneous data.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2023): 56700-56755."}, "questions": {"value": "1.Can the authors elaborate on the practical implications of their theoretical bounds?

In fact, the proofs inaccurately used the global model definition w to represent client-side model which should have been something like w_c. Since the  separation between client-side and server-side models in SL is a key difference to FL, hence without detailing this in the proofs it would be difficult to assess the technical challenges/contributions of the paper. \n\n- The authors stated in Appendix B that SFL-V2 would achieve similar results to SFL-V1 without providing proofs, which the reviewer found to be not convincing. SFL-v2 requires the server-side model to sequentially interact with the client-side models, while SFL-V1 operates essentially the same to FL. Hence, the reviewer is expecting different results between the two. \n\n- Another major concern is that all generalization errors converge to zero with large M or N, even under non-convex and data heterogeneity. This basically implies that the client drift issue disappears with a large client number, which is surprising. Instead, the reviewer is expecting an error term related to data heterogeneity that does not diminish to zero with large M or N. Can the authors clarify on this?\n\nThere are also some other minor concerns:\n\n- In Figs. 3-4, the vertical axis is a stability measure, but what does x'_t mean? Also, should x be w? In addition, the reviewer expects the measure to be a difference between train and test errors. Can the authors clarify on this?\n\n- Some typos are scattered, e.g., in line 143, \"generakization\" -> \"generalization\"; in Fig. 3e, after \"size\" there should be \"on\"; in line 1404, the theorem numbering is missing."}, "questions": {"value": "See above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "1ZvEZBn7XM", "forum": "sNZh5dqOof", "replyto": "sNZh5dqOof", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23163/Reviewer_itNX"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23163/Reviewer_itNX"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23163/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761606004074, "cdate": 1761606004074, "tmdate": 1762942538433, "mdate": 1762942538433, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents the first theoretical framework for analyzing the generalization error of Split Learning algorithms, specifically focusing on Sequential Split Learning and Split Federated Learning.

The paper builds upon existing work on stability and generalization in other machine learning paradigms.\n\nFor deep neural networks, especially modern architectures, smoothness can vary across the loss landscape. Some regions might be relatively flat (small $\\beta$), while others, can be non-smooth (large or even undefined $\\beta$). The $\\beta$-smoothness assumption is mathematically convenient, but in practice $\\beta$ is not fixed. Also, it is architecture dependent.\n\nBounded Heterogeneity assumption in reality rarely holds and is highly restrictive.  In many realistic SL scenarios, heterogeneity can be extreme. Consider a federated keyboard model where some users primarily type in slang while others use formal language. In these cases, the local gradients can point in nearly opposite directions. The assumption that holds for all model weights is highly restrictive. As the model trains, it might enter regions where client gradients diverge more significantly.\n\nThe conclusion that SFL excels in heterogeneous non-convex systems is relying on this bounded heterogeneity assumption."}, "questions": {"value": "Do you see challenges with the $\\beta$-smoothness assumption in the loss landscapes of Transformers?
