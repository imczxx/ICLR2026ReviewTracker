Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong adaptability in dynamic environments, existing methods still depend on predefined state spaces and cannot directly perceive the environment. Consequently, they fail to exploit visual semantic information, which restricts their ability to generalize to unseen or evolving traffic conditions during training. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViRL-TSC, a unified framework that integrates RL with Vision–Language Models (VLMs). A Foundation Model-Driven Visual Reasoning Engine (FM-VRE) fuses visual inputs with structured information matrices to generate high-level multimodal semantic representations of intersections. These representations are then processed by a Foundation Model-Driven  Decision Evaluation Engine (FM-DEE), which integrates them with the RL agent’s proposed actions. The RL policy ensures efficient control in scenarios encountered during training, while the VLM leverages logical reasoning and contextual analysis to handle rare events beyond the scope of RL training. By combining RL’s task-specific policy optimization with the VLM’s rich semantic understanding, ViRL-TSC maintains high efficiency during routine operations and selectively intervenes to enhance robustness under long-tail traffic conditions.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Vision-Language Models", "Traffic Signal Control"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/acd2b5febaefe73fac98984d409bd7bffe8e3cd4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposed a unified framework that using RL with VLM called ViRL-TSC to robust traffic signal control.

Prior work, such as [1], has already integrated VLMs with deep DRL model TSC, including specialized mechanisms for emergency vehicle response. The present study replicates most of this paradigm and only introduces a justified alignment mechanism between VLMs and DRL policies. Unfortunately, this alignment is also problematic (see detailed questions).\n- **Limited baselines**: The experimental design omits several critical and directly comparable baselines. Recent studies have demonstrated the use of large language models (LLMs) [2–4] and VLMs [1] for adaptive and interpretable TSC, achieving strong generalization across diverse urban environments. However, these representative methods are not included for comparison. The omission prevents readers from evaluating whether the proposed method further improves interpretability and robustness.\n- **Insufficient experiments**: The experimental evaluation lacks depth and scalability analysis. Most TSC studies assess their frameworks across multiple intersections (typically 12 or more) to capture complex traffic interactions and coordination challenges. In contrast, this paper’s experiments are confined to a single intersection, limiting the external validity of the findings. The absence of large-scale or heterogeneous network tests raises doubts about the method’s practicality in real-world deployments. Furthermore, key metrics such as transferability across layouts, robustness under non-stationary demand, and computational overhead are missing, further weakening the empirical evidence."}, "questions": {"value": "- Existing studies [5, 6] have already established RL as the standard baseline for TSC agents.

Could the authors clarify this process? Specifically, is the transformation handled internally by the VLM, or is an additional language model or projection module implemented to interpret the visual embedding?\n- The deep RL model outputs discrete actions, while the VLM operates through open-ended reasoning. How do the authors ensure that the alignment between the VLM’s reasoning process and the RL’s policy output is both semantically coherent and behaviorally consistent?\n- The paper argues that RL models lack generalization and fail under unseen conditions.
