This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments. To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000, Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2% performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management.", "tldr": "Traditional clustering fails on multivariate financial time series; we capture synchronization-desynchronization dynamics through multi-scale encoding and dynamic attention.", "keywords": ["time series clustering", "synchronization patterns", "graph neural networks", "financial time series"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b9905ef71ddb8e5ea87be0ae918fb1507b1d96f8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose FTSCommDetector for identifying communities in multivariate time series, with a specific application to financial markets.

Even when augmented with a temporal encoder, these models are fundamentally unequipped to model temporal evolution within their graph learning mechanism. A convincing evaluation would require comparison against state-of-the-art methods designed for dynamic graphs or temporal community detection, e.g., DyGFormer or similar which are mentioned in the introduction.\n\nW3: The model seems to heavily rely on their novel \"NAV-based modularity\" embedding. While clever, this is a highly domain-specific feature engineered for financial portfolio theory. I wonder if this limits the paper's claim of providing a general framework for multivariate time series and how would this method perform on non-financial data where such a modularity concept does not exist?

The paper positions itself as temporal graph learning, comparing against temporal graph neural networks. But looking at the problem definition, this is clearly a multivariate time series clustering problem, not a temporal graph learning problem. In reality, the graph construction in Appendix A.6 happens once per window using correlation thresholding. The graph does not evolve continuously; it is reconstructed per window from correlations. This mismatch makes the entire baseline comparison questionable.\n\nW2: For a problem that is explicitly formulated as multivariate time series analysis, the paper completely omits the relevant literature:\n- time series clustering methods (K-means with dynamic time warping distance, hierarchical clustering with temporal distances)\n- modern deep time series models (TimesNet, PatchTST, Informer, iTransformer for representation learning)\n- financial time series specific methods: Mantegna (1999) \"Hierarchical structure in financial markets,\" Tola et al. (2008) Cluster analysis for portfolio optimization\nSimple hierarchical clustering on correlation matrices (computed per window) would be the most direct baseline. The paper never compares against this fundamental approach, making it impossible to assess whether the complex architecture provides value beyond standard correlation-based clustering.\n\nW3: The experimental evaluation has several critical ambiguities and potential methodological issues. Section 4.1 mentions \"sliding windows\" but provides no details on total number of windows in each dataset, how windows are divided into training, validation, and test sets, whether evaluation is on held-out temporal windows (proper out-of-sample) or in-sample, and how temporal leakage is prevented. There's a circular evaluation concern: Appendix C.2 states \"We use NAV-based clustering quality metrics for both early stopping and final evaluation, computed directly from price data every epoch\", but If the same metric computed on the same data is used for both early stopping (model selection) and final evaluation (performance assessment), this is circular validation.\n\nW4: The paper claims to provide \"practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management\", but lacks rigorous validation of practical utility. Do portfolios constructed using these communities outperform alternatives out-of-sample? Does cluster membership help predict volatility spikes or drawdowns? Case studies provide qualitative insights but no quantitative evaluation on downstream financial tasks. The discovered patterns are interesting but their practical utility remains undemonstrated.\n\nW5: Limited novelty: The \"synchronization-desynchronization\" framing is essentially correlation-based clustering with sliding windows, which is standard in time series analysis. Multi-scale architectures are common in time series analysis."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "B7Zf5Q142k", "forum": "IFdg7jCIDE", "replyto": "IFdg7jCIDE", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6632/Reviewer_ghmw"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6632/Reviewer_ghmw"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6632/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761993427496, "cdate": 1761993427496, "tmdate": 1762918947732, "mdate": 1762918947732, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
