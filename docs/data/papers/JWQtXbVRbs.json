The abstract actually makes sense. It is trying to model the non-additive interactions and use a design from ANOVA decomposition. It paints an intuitive high-level picture of what it is, with main effects and interaction effects. \n\nMinor points: the acronyms, although standard, are used a lot. You can spell them out. \n\nI'm also confused: it mentions \"MLP forecaster\" earlier in the abstract, and then in the middle part of the abstract, it says \"access via linear self-attention.\" So I don't see how the linear self-attention plugs in here. That's okay, I can wait.\n\nI look forward to the transparent cross-term explanations. \n\nIn the middle of the abstract (the line starting around line 19-20), I start to get a little bit lost, but that's okay—I can read the main paper.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe first two paragraphs of the background in the introduction are really good. The third paragraph is also very good. Basically, it gives the background pretty well.\n\nThe proposed method is called Time Series Interaction Machine. It's an MLP forecaster explicitly aligned with ANOVA/Hoeffding decomposition. Interesting. A lightweight branch captures the main effect, and a DCN-style cross stack.\n\nDCN means Deep Cross Network. The mathematics is pretty simple—it's basically an MLP path that learns implicit nonlinear interaction effects. \n\nThe criticism of transformers is correct regarding their quadratic time and memory complexity. There are linear transformers available. But the authors are using linear transformers. Otherwise, I have no complaint about the introduction. It's pretty good.\n\nA lot of the references in page 2 of Section 2.1 go to pages 5 and 6, making it a little bit difficult to read. But it's just a minor point. For better smoothness, I'm actually going to glance through 2.1 without paying too much attention, and move on to 2.2.\n\n## Method\n\nIt's already using linear attention in line 94. So that's good. The interpretation of a kernel smoother is established in the literature (line 100). \n\nSo the key in Section 2.1.4 should be multivariate interaction features that are learned. I didn't see in the introduction right here how linear attention is used. Or is linear attention just used as a benchmark?\n\nAlright, I see. Figure 1 makes this really helpful. I'm assuming in Figure 1 the Feature Feat Fusion is the main innovation. Now, the extra multivariate interaction effects—yes, like cross-vector, like DCN in time. And component (b) is a linear transformer backbone going through a channel-independent structure. I see.\n\nSo really, the new thing here is the first block—the Feat Fusion that extracts multivariate interaction effects. Yes, so in that sense, the time fusion and transformer backbone previously can be thought of as a main effect only model. And this work is adding the Feat Fusion to add interaction effects. Very interesting.\n\nI don't quite see what the residue branches are doing. It seems that it's just capturing anything not in the main model as residue, kind of like a skip connection or something like that. I would be curious about how important the Res Fusion is, and why it is essential.\n\nInteresting. So because Time Fusion and Res Fusion are per-variable channel-independent, the multivariate effect is solely captured in the Feat Fusion.\n\nI'm a little confused. In line 190, how can Time Fusion, Feat Fusion, and Rest Fusion share the same architecture? They are designed for very different things. In what sense are they sharing the architecture?\n\nFrom lines 191 to 211, the goal and the interpretation of those fusion mechanisms are intuitive and easy to read. Algorithm 2 is useful and clear for the overall flow. It aligns well with Figure 1.\n\n## Theoretical Connections\n\nI feel Section 3 is a little bit sudden. I just thought that I had finished reading the method, and then there seems to be some alignment that needs to be done. I'm a little bit confused. \n\nAlso, in line 240, it starts to introduce regression targets, which confuses me. Is it about loss function construction, or is it about the interpretation of each component?\n\nI get Section 3.2—the decomposition is somehow theoretically justified. Is the claim that the architecture mirrors this ANOVA decomposition, and therefore, the learned components will have a good correspondence to the theoretical components? Is that the story?\n\nOh, that seems to be the case. After reading line 278, it seems that the cross-branch and main effect correspond to the earlier architecture. \n\nSo I don't quite get what's the purpose of presenting Section 3.4, Section 3.5, and Section 3.6, together with Section 3.7. They are all remarks and connections to some theoretical study—theoretical interpretation. Is that right?\n\n## Experiments\n\nNow I move on to Section 4, the experiment session. I can see that the dataset descriptions are all standard datasets. The SOTA baselines are also standard.\n\nThe ablation study actually includes \"without RES\" That confirms my intuition that the residue seems to be least coherent to the story. I get that it helps with performance. Is there any discussion on the high-level intuition about why the residue is absolutely needed?\n\nLike you mentioned in line 397, “RES processes univariate time series as tokens and captures cross-variable dependencies.\" Therefore, what is the exact contribution of RES? That's a good place for you to remind me.\n\nYes, in line 403, you actually mentioned why the \"without RES\" setting seems to be still ok. But you didn't remind me why the RES connection is absolutely needed.\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\nOverall, I think it's an interesting paper. From a different angle, I can see that it can complement a lot of the recent developments in time series forecasting methods, especially transformer-based time series forecasting methods. This Feat Fusion does seem to capture interaction effects.\n\nIt also appears to me that you can actually switch the transformer backbone. So for the ablation study, I would say a more fair ablation study would be: if you're using DLinear as the backbone, then you have TIM plus DLinear; TIM applied on DLinear, see how good it is. Use PatchTST as the backbone, and then TIM plus PatchTST, see how good it is. Or iTransformer as the backbone. You get what I'm saying. I think that would illustrate how important the interaction effect and this residue prediction really are. Because I really think the Feat Fusion is the most impressive new thing here.\n\nOverall, I think this is a good paper. An interesting one. I wouldn't say the entire thing is—the entire thing is a solid read. There's some confusion, but there's one part of the idea that I really like. I'm not too convinced about the Time Fusion and the Res Fusion, but I really like the Feat Fusion perspective."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "7jm0TOyEgc", "forum": "JWQtXbVRbs", "replyto": "JWQtXbVRbs", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25513/Reviewer_qG8Q"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25513/Reviewer_qG8Q"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25513/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761879110012, "cdate": 1761879110012, "tmdate": 1762943458085, "mdate": 1762943458085, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes TIM, which employs the decomposition of features, time, and residuals, to effectively capture both additive and interaction effects with minimal computational overhead. \nThe paper's experiments demonstrate that TIME outperforms classical time series forecasting baselines in terms of both accuracy and efficiency across multiple datasets."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "This paper proposes TIM, which employs the decomposition of features, time, and residuals, to effectively capture both additive and interaction effects with minimal computational overhead. \nThe paper's experiments demonstrate that TIME outperforms classical time series forecasting baselines in terms of both accuracy and efficiency across multiple datasets."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.
