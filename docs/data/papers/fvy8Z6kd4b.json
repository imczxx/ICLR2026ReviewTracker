However, current models struggle with fine-grained negative emotion recognition tasks due to the limited granularity in existing multimodal emotion recognition datasets. To address this, we refine coarse-grained emotion categories, expanding negative emotions from conventional 4-5 types to 8 specific categories. Based on this refined taxonomy, we construct **Libra-Emo**, a comprehensive dataset for multimodal fine-grained negative emotion detection. It comprises **Libra-Emo Trainset** for model development and **Libra-Emo Bench** for evaluation, collectively containing 62,267 video samples annotated through a novel human-machine collaborative active learning strategy, surpassing existing datasets in both granularity and scale. We present extensive experimental results from zero-shot evaluations using Libra-Emo Bench and instruction-tuning experiments with Libra-Emo Trainset on leading Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our findings demonstrate that while current MLLMs exhibit limited proficiency in fine-grained negative emotion detection, models fine-tuned on Libra-Emo Trainset show substantial performance improvements that generalize effectively to out-of-domain evaluations. This work addresses critical limitations in existing multimodal emotion recognition datasets regarding emotion category granularity and representation of negative emotions, thus advancing research in fine-grained emotional analysis.

The paper addresses a significant problem with existing emotion recognition corpora: the limited granularity of emotion labels and the underrepresentation of negative emotions. To solve this problem, the authors expand Ekman's basic emotion categories to 13 more specific ones, including 8 categories for negative emotions, and propose the Libra-Emo corpus, which contains a large number of 62,267 samples.\n2. The author proposed an active learning framework that combines model voting with targeted human verification. This strategy helps reduce annotation costs while improving label quality iteratively. Additionally, the authors synthesized label-consistent natural language explanations. The ablation studies confirmed that this boosts performance.\n3. The corpus evaluation covers several aspects: (1) zero-shot performance of closed-source and open-source MLLMs on the Libra-Emo Bench; (2) instruction tuning across different model scales and architectures; (3) modality ablation; (4) data scaling analysis.\n4.

Only 24,764 out of 61,625 samples (approximately 40.2%) were manually chaked during active learning, with 13,000 being labeled in Round 1 and 11,764 being labeled in Round 2. Approximately 59,8% of the samples retained the model's consensus labels without human verification, which raises concerns about the reliability of the labels for fine-grained distinctions.\n2. The dataset was derived from 385 source videos. However, the paper does not provide information about: (1) the number of unique speakers; (2) speaker overlap between the Trainset and the Bench; (3) distributions of age, gender, and ethnicity. These limitations make it difficult to assess speaker independence and potential demographic biases. The validity of the experimental design is questionable.\n3. The annotation prompt instructs the labeling of \"the emotional label expressed by the people\", but no protocol is provided for dealing with conflicting emotions among multiple visible individuals. Given that the clips require faces in more than 99% of frames, it is likely that multi-person scenes will be included, but the consistency of the labels remains unclear.\n4. The term “Libra-Emo” is used for both the corpus and the fine-tuned models (e.g., Libra-Emo-8B). This conflates data and model artifacts. Model names should explicitly reflect their base architecture (e.g., InternVL-2.5-8B-Libra) to avoid confusion.\n5. The zero-shot evaluation of the DFEW dataset (Table 7) includes only one specialized emotion recognition model, Emotion-LLaMA, as a baseline. This limited the ability to fully understand the advantages of the Libra-Emo fine-tuned model. To get a more comprehensive comparison, it would be necessary to include additional emotion-specific models in the evaluation."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The main concerns are the weak psychological and conceptual foundation\n\nThe 13-class taxonomy is not theoretically grounded in any established emotion framework (e.g., Plutchik’s wheel, Shaver’s hierarchy, or OCC appraisal model). According to the emotion wheel theory, there are more than 40 negative emotions. \n\nBut why do authors choose specifically 8 emotions, the design details and motivations are unclear. \n\nThere are plenty of important negative emotions missing in this regard, e.g., bitter, awkward, and awful. \n\nBesides, if you examine it carefully, category overlap is severe: Sad and Despairful should be in category; the difference is intensity variation, not a distinct category. Frustrated and Angry only differ by controllability. Ironic is a communicative style, not an emotion.\n\nNo Valence–Arousal–Dominance (VAD) validation, appraisal mapping, or inter-annotator reliability (κ/α) is reported.\nTherefore, the dataset’s construct validity is questionable.\n\n2. Missing Key Baselines and Model Comparisons\n\nThe literature review in the paper is insufficient. The paper omits all major contemporary models in multimodal emotion understanding and efforts addressing the issues of fine-grained emotion recognition:\n\nImportant MLLM baselines for MER recognition, such as EmoVIT (CVPR 2024) and AffectGPT (ICML 2025), are not referred.\n\n EmoSet (ICCV2023) tries to use different attributes to achieve emotion reasoning with LLMs via detailed datasets.\n\nOVMER (ICML 2025) enables open-vocabulary emotion reasoning and continuous affect generation with more than 200 labels, which enable the community to generate rich, fine-grained emotion descriptions, see MER 2025 challenge results.\n\n3. Experimental results\nThe experimental results can prove that the reliability of the proposed emotion categories is doubtful: \"our model performs poorly in distinguishing between despairful and sad, as well as hateful and angry.\" Because they are in the same emotional category. This can be addressed only when valence and arousal are introduced.\n\n4. Methodological and Experimental Deficiencies\n\nThe so-called “active learning + explanation generation” pipeline is not novel—it replicates standard LLM-assisted annotation practices (already used in EmoSet and AffectGPT etc.).\n\nThe benchmark size (642 videos) is too small for robust evaluation; it's only 1% of the training set, which can be affected by noise easily.\n\nNo ablations on modality contributions (video, audio, text), explanation effects, or hierarchical label structures.\n\nNo cross-dataset evaluation to demonstrate transferability."}, "questions": {"value": "Please carefully address the concerns above.
