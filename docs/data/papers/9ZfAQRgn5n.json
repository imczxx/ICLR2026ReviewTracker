While existing methods primarily focus on the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) for fully observed outcomes, real-world data often suffer from missingness. Direct CATE estimation using only complete cases can introduce bias and reduce efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose the Surrogate-Assisted Learner (SA-learner), which leverages surrogate outcomes—auxiliary variables expected to predict the effect of a treatment on the primary outcome and is more readily observed—to improve CATE estimation. The SA-learner enjoys double robustness, ensuring consistent CATE estimates even under misspecification of certain nuisance functions. We also establish its convergence rate, requiring only slower-rate convergence of nuisance function estimators without restrictive model assumptions. This property enables flexible implementation using off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms. Extensive experiments on synthetic data further demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["causal inference", "heterogeneous treatment effect", "missing mechanism"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/64fb1db00413992dd03b862cac215901f17d5404.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e9765afc29606fa21c6812406c94271cce677c40.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a new orthogonal meta-learner for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) in a semi-supervised setting with outcomes missing at random and observed surrogates.

The efficient influence functions used in this paper are, to the best of my knowledge, known in the literature. As such, the contribution of this paper reduces to the construction of orthogonal learners, which follows the established standard framework and limits novelty. Also, the theoretical results follow from this general framework and essentially leverage the properties of the known EIFs.\n- Related work: The authors draw connections to surrogacy causal inference literature and semi-supervised learning, but I think that key works are overlooked. For example, prediction-powered inference (Angelopoulos et al.) and various follow-up works consider a very similar setting and also leverage semiparametric inference. In this literature, there are also existing approaches for learning CATE-like functions (i.e., considering estimation for conditional averages instead of the mean), e.g., \"Doubly Robust Self-Training\". I recommend a careful and more comprehensive literature search. Finally, the following paper considers a very similar setting to CATU: \"A Meta-learner for Heterogeneous Effects in Difference-in-Differences\" (Example 4.2).\n- The experiments are relatively limited. It would be nice to see some more comprehensive experiments (e.g., a larger variety of surrogate strengths, or generally of the DGP). It would also be nice to add a case study using real-world data to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed learners."}, "questions": {"value": "- Could the authors ellaborate on their contribution as compared to existing works?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "uVvlIpeMn7", "forum": "9ZfAQRgn5n", "replyto": "9ZfAQRgn5n", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23140/Reviewer_wHbY"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23140/Reviewer_wHbY"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23140/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760531186479, "cdate": 1760531186479, "tmdate": 1762942528935, "mdate": 1762942528935, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work introduces the surrogate assisted (SA) learner, which is a doubly-robust learner for estimating CATE when outcomes are missing at random (SAR), but surrogate outcomes are available.

While extending this approach to a new setting is a novel contribution, it is the view of the reviewer that the difficulty lies in the EIF derivation, which the review understands to already exist in the literature (Kallus & Mao 2024). Additionally, the mechanism of the existing framework is not presented clearly.\n- Propositions 2 and 3 are statements about the ATE estimator implied by the CATE estimator. It is the understanding of the reviewer that existing work (Kallus & Mao 2024) has derived an efficient doubly robust estimator for the ATE in the data missingness setting.  If the claimed gap in literature concerns CATE estimators only, then these propositions are irrelevant.\n- The first claimed contribution is demonstrating neyman-orthogonality of the CATE loss. This claim is not mentioned again anywhere in the paper. Keywords \"Neyman-orthogonal\" or just \"orthogonal\" are mentioned in the entire paper only once, in the claimed contribution. It is understanding of the reviewer that neyman-orthogonality falls out directly as a result of how the sa-learner is constructed, however, this is never mentioned by the authors (and the construction method is not novel to the paper).
