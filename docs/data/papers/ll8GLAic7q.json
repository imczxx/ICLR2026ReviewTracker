Impact of Width Expansion on Linear Mode Connectivity", "abstract": "Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves the input–output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\\times$ width multiplier for ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that, even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs. Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity (LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving linear mode connectivity.", "tldr": "Width expansion probably facilitates linear mode connectivity without permutations.", "keywords": ["deep learning", "linear mode connectivity", "permutation symmetries"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f98cba57b85c98a296e343d3e7512a50e86e17f5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tackles the task of merging different checkpoints of the same architecture trained from scratch with different seeds.

The observed permutation-free linear connectivity may stem from overparameterization-induced robustness rather than genuine connectivity. In very wide networks and easy tasks (e.g. CIFAR-10, MNIST), independent checkpoints can lie in flat regions of the loss landscape where large parameter perturbations (like naive weight averaging) don’t affect accuracy. In this perspective, the reported effect might be explained by functional redundancy and flatness rather than the what is stated in the paper. It would be interesting to see the following experiments to better understand if this is the case:\n    - Train seeds with constraints that violate the sufficient conditions for LEWC by setting  zero weight decay and spectral regularizers against low-rank. Measure ReLU weak additivity, reciprocal orthogonality and merge success. If merging still works despite not exhibiting relu weak additivity and reciprocal orthogonality then it doesn’t have to do with LEWC and it’s rather just functional redundancy.\n    - Compute the norm of the difference between A and B, then traverse a random direction *u* by that same distance and plot the loss barrier throughout. The loss should clearly increase in that direction, but if it’s still low at $\\lambda$ = 0.5 then we might be again observing functional redundancy.\n- Limited practical utility. The effect appears only for very wide models trained on simple datasets, under settings that are not those used in realistic large-scale systems. Moreover, the need for temperature calibration, strong weight decay, and substantial width multipliers means that the reported phenomenon does not affect practical model-merging pipelines.\n- Experimental evidence is limited to toy models and datasets. While this is somewhat common in prior literature, its applicability and theoretical impact would greatly benefit from considering more complex architectures such as ViTs. This could be done by following e.g. [1].\n\nOverall, I find the analysis and insights interesting and worth sharing, but requiring the proposed additional experiments to ensure we are not just observing spurious explanations for unknown, possibly trivial phenomena. \n\n[1] Theus, Alexander, et al. \"Generalized Linear Mode Connectivity for Transformers.\" NeurIPS 2025."}, "questions": {"value": "- To what extent are the observed results a consequence of extreme overparameterization and the smoothness of the loss landscape, rather than a new structural mechanism such as LEWC? \n- Do suggested experiments in Weakness 1 confirm LEWC?

One issue is that the theory and experiments are somewhat detached as the theoretical setup and some predictions (depth particularly) don't have solid connections with the empirical evidence. Some of the definitions/conditions (e.g. low rank weights leading to LMC) feel arbitrary and accidental rather than clearly supported by intuition and evidence. The other issue is that I'm not sure what to conclude - can we predict when LMC will arise due to width alone? What are the implications (practical or otherwise) of the findings?\n\nCurrently, the empirical results cannot rule out the possibility that there is a lower floor on how small the barrier becomes with increased width. First, for the higher width scales, it is important to report the actual loss or accuracy barriers (such as in a table, zoomed-in plot, or plotting width vs max barrier) since \"LMC\" in the permutation literature (e.g. Ainsworth et al.) requires \"essentially no barrier\".\n\nAlong this line, I don't find the random permutations experiment (Figure 13) useful - in a sense, two randomly initialized and trained networks are already randomly permuted with respect to each other, since the probability of initializing $\\theta$ is equal to that of $\\pi(\\theta)$ for any permutation $\\pi$. Instead, I would like to know whether as width increases, the difference between barriers from a known good permutation and a random one goes to 0. For the known good permutation, one could use permutation-finding algorithms, or networks from the same initialization that are LMC (Frankle et al. 2020).\n\nI find the argument in 5.2 (low rank structure reduces overlap) somewhat unconvincing - first, the intuitive example is coordinate-aligned and I don't see how the same applies to arbitrary low-rank transformations which are not coordinate-aligned. It's possible that activations are coordinate-aligned in practice due to ReLU being a coordinate-aligned transform, which figure 6 supports. In general, I think a statement like \"width leads to sparser activations, which induces weak additivity\" would be stronger than the current \"low rank\" explanation.\n\nSmall problems with the presentation:\n- Missing citations for line 59: \"In addition, several studies have shown that widening ResNet-50 trained on the ImageNet dataset improves the test accuracy of the merged model when interpolating the weights of two trained models with permutation\"\n- The plot colors are hard to read for the different layer widths - maybe consider using a graduated palette (e.g. viridis)?\n- The \"standard deviation with respect to 0\" (defined in figu re 5) should be called the square root of the second (uncentered) moment\n- I suggest moving figure 5 to the appendix in favour of figure 9 - section 5.4 (reduced weight decay stops the effect) adds a much-needed ablation in my opinion. Actually, more ablations would really help establish that weak additivity and reciprocal orthogonality are necessary and sufficient conditions for LMC sans permutation."}, "questions": {"value": "An interesting implication predicted by LEWC is that the exponential decay in activation magnitude as depth increases.
