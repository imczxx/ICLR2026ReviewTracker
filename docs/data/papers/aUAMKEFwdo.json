One of the possible tools is Helmholtz's theorem, which can decompose a vector field into a potential and a harmonic component. This has been shown to be effective in finite and normal-form games. However, applying Helmholtz's theorem by connecting it with the Hodge theorem on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (which is the strategy space of the Differentiable game) is non-trivial due to the non-compactness of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Bridging the dynamic-strategic disconnect through Hodge/Helmholtz's theorem in Differentiable games is then left as an open problem in Letcher et al. 2019. In this work, we provide two decompositions of Differentiable games to answer this question: the first as an exact Potential part, a near Solenoidal part, and a non-strategic part; the second as a near Potential part, an exact Solenoidal part, and a non-strategic part. We show that Potential games coincide with potential games proposed by Monderer and Shapley, 1996, where the gradient descent dynamic can successfully find the Nash equilibrium. For the Solenoidal game, we show that the individual gradient field is divergence-free, in which case the gradient descent dynamic may either be divergent or recurrent.", "tldr": "We show that any Differentiable game can be decomposed in direct sum into a Potential game, a near Solenoidal game, and a non-strategic game", "keywords": ["Differentiable Games", "Direct Sum Decomposition", "Nash Equilibrium", "Gradient Descent"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fa909d55c5d539c4b60b0acc40495d612d5e8faf.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e358e913f5b7d17769b2c63bfba52fc540c35e55.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors consider a class of games with continuous (and differentiable payoffs) and consider a corresponding Sobolev space of games. \nUsing Hodge theorem and related orthogonal decomposition the authors propose to decompose games into direct sum of potential game (i.e gardient flows)  and their complement as well as decomposing divergence free vector fields and theor orthogonal complement. \nSome conclusions about the dynamics (namely Poincaré recurrence) are are also proved."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "a)  The paper is well written and the technical details are explained in a satisfactory manner.\n\nb) The decomposition of games in Sobolev space is novel and actually seems very natural and promising.\n\nc) The problem of understanding and classifying the family of games is a worthy endeavor as game theoretical concepts are now used in a great variety of fields, computer science, economics, evolutionary biology, physics etc..."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "a) The conclusion about the game dynamics for divergence free game is very generic (namely Poincare recurrence which is a soft result)\nand it is not clear why this is relevant.

The main difference and contribution of the paper is that the authors consider differentiable games, that is, games with continuous action sets and differentiable utility functions, as opposed to the finite game setting of Candogan et al (2011).\n\nThe authors' main result can be summarized as follows: any differentiable game with smooth, compactly supported utilities can be written as a sum of a potential, a near-solenoidal, and a non-strategic game. [Here, solenoidal means that the divergence of the game's individual gradient field vanishes, and non-strategic means that the gradient field is zero. In this regard, the solenoidal component mirrors the harmonic component of the decomposition of Candogan et al (2011).]\n\nThe authors complement their analysis by comparing their decomposition to the symmetric / skew-symmetric decomposition of the Jacobian of the game due to Letcher et al. (2019), who introduced the notion of a Hamiltonian game (games with skew-symmetric Jacobian). They show in particular that any Hamiltonian game is solenoidal, but the converse need not hold."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "The setting and general question is an interesting one."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The reason that I'm giving this paper a low score is that it  is stating several times that a major difficulty and contribution is the fact that the authors are treating games over $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which makes it difficult to apply Hodge-theoretic tools and results. To quote the authors: \"applying [the Hodge theorem] on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is non-trivial due to the non-compactness of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This is, indeed, a major difficulty, which the authors sidestep by working with games with $C^\\infty$-smooth functions and compact support. This means that the payoff functions of the game are equal to zero outside a compact set, and this degradation is smooth.\n\nThis is a very limiting assumption: it cannot be used to model standard unconstrained games (like the go-to min-max example $u_1(x_1,x_2) = - u_2(x_1,x_2) = - x_1 x_2$) because this game does not have compact support, and it cannot be used to model constrained games (like normal form games) because, in such games, the payoff functions do not vanish smoothly. This rules out all the toy examples used by the authors for illustration purposes—and, in fact, I am not aware of any application-relevant game satisfying this assumpion.\n\nThis is not easy to spot: in L205, the authors define the Hilbert $C_0$ as the closure of $C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ under the Sobolev L2 norm. This would give the impression that the authors are able to treat unconstrained continuous games, but this is not so. The Sobolev norm is not even defined on all of $C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ (consider the simple one-player game with $u(x) = x$), so the closure is meaningless. Instead, I strongly suspect that the authors meant to consider there the closure of $C_c^\\infty$, that is, games with compactly supported payoff functions: this is further supported by L226 where the authors are considering the intersection of $C_0$ with $C^\\infty$ (which would be redundant otherwise), and several other points in the paper, where the authors are talking about compactly supported payoff functions.\n\nThe compact support assumption also trivializes Theorem 2.6: if the game's payoff functions are smooth and compactly supported, the trajectories of the gradient dynamics are de facto bounded, so Assumption C.1 in Lemma 2.4 (which, annoyingly, is only stated in the appendix) is itself trivially satisfied. Again, however, I struggle to think of an application-relevant example satisfying the compact support assumption, so this theorem is also of very limited conceptual value.\n\nFinally, there is the issue of writing. The authors rely on the readers having a solid understanding of several advanced differential-geometric concepts (differential forms and Hodge / de Rham theory in particular), which would make the paper inaccessible to a large part of ICLR's audience (even the theory component).\n\nIt is for these reasons that I'm giving a \"reject\" recommendation and \"fair\" to \"poor\" scores overall. I do believe the authors' basic decomposition idea via Hodge theory has a lot of merit and is worth pursuing, but the current version of the manuscript is not yet close to clearing the bar of acceptance to a top-tier generalist venue like ICLR. The various low scores are thus intended as a measure of the distance that needs to be covered, and they should not be interpreted as a harsh criticism of the authors' work."}, "questions": {"value": "None."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "iB0b8zSls5", "forum": "aUAMKEFwdo", "replyto": "aUAMKEFwdo", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10256/Reviewer_KVkg"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10256/Reviewer_KVkg"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10256/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761875620196, "cdate": 1761875620196, "tmdate": 1762921611199, "mdate": 1762921611199, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
