On HM3D and MP3D datasets, FPE matches or exceeds the performance of the detector-controlled InstructNav-GT baseline, achieving the highest SR on HM3D and highest SPL on MP3D, while requiring 0 API cost and running significantly faster.

The ablations clearly disentangle the roles of geometry and language.\n- **Clarity**: Concepts like frontier islands, FPE, and SHF are clearly defined, well-illustrated, and accompanied by concise pseudocode. The writing is precise, and comparisons to prior work are fair and transparent."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **Insufficient practical deployment discussion**: Although the paper mentions computational efficiency, it doesn't discuss the practical implications of deploying FPE and SHF on real robots with limited computational resources. The authors should address potential challenges (e.g., memory usage, real-time constraints) and propose solutions for real-world deployment.\n- **Limited analysis of SHF’s design choices**: SHF uses $k=5$ LLM votes per step, but the choice of $ k $ is unexplained. Is this critical for performance? A small ablation would help justify the cost–accuracy trade-off and support the claim that “minimal language priors suffice.\n- **Ambiguity in “training-free” and experience assumptions**: While FPE/SHF require no model training, they rely on ground-truth semantics and perfect frontier detection. Does this assume oracle perception? If so, how would performance degrade under realistic detectors?\n- **Contribution**: The paper’s main strength lies in its empirical revelation—frontier-based geometric exploration alone can rival or exceed LLM-driven planners in ObjectNav. This is a valuable corrective to the field’s current emphasis on language-centric designs. However, this work does not propose a new framework or solve a recognized problem, or offer clear guidance for future system design beyond “use strong geometric priors.” While insightful, this level of contribution may be insufficient for a full ICLR publication."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "YS2oSSjpZ6", "forum": "YUkJvitGKY", "replyto": "YUkJvitGKY", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24146/Reviewer_55wB"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24146/Reviewer_55wB"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24146/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760618676435, "cdate": 1760618676435, "tmdate": 1762942959586, "mdate": 1762942959586, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focuses on the rapidly evolving field of LLM-based object navigation and conducts an in-depth, critical analysis of existing approaches.

This severely limits the conclusions that can be drawn from this study, because there is only a single LLM-based method (InstructNav) that gets access to the same GT. This leaves much room for the option that simply InstructNav is not a great way of incorporating a LLM into planning, and other methods such as VLFM (which also incorporates geometric planning) are a much better planning approach that might have significant margin over the geometry-only approach. A much more sound study would be to split this up: compare FPE and SHF with an open-vocabulary detector to all the baselines in Table 1 and add ground-truth semantics to 1-2 additional methods and conduct a fair comparison in a different Table.\n- Given that the constructed baselines are partially based on LFG (shah et al), I am surprised not to see this method anywhere in the comparison\n- There are some inclarities and ambiguities in the introduction of the study that can make it confusing to readers and might lead them to wrong conclusions:\n  - Habitat and MP3D are not photorealisitic. One criterion for photorealisitic is e.g. disentangled lighting and shading [[ref]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Roberts_Hypersim_A_Photorealistic_Synthetic_Dataset_for_Holistic_Indoor_Scene_Understanding_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf) which matterport datasets do not habe\n  - The summary of the finding in lines 46 and following does not specify the task. The usefulness of semantic & language priors differs a lot between explortion, object goal navigation, and instruction following, so it is very important to specify here that the task is 2D object goal navigation in unseen environments.\n  - line 70: The definition of Object-Goal Navigation is wrong. This task is not per-definition in novel environments, but the task that this study looks at is a subcategory. Consider e.g. [HOV-SG](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss20/p077.pdf) that also studies Object-Goal Navigation, but in known environments.\n  - line 104 introduces the task as reaching an instance in a 3D environment, yet Section 3.2 restricts all methods to a 2D navigation map. Compared to works that actually can do 3D multi-floor navigation (eg. HOV-SG above), it is important to distinuish that this study is much more limited to 2D navigation.\n  - the phrase \"frontier islands\" is quite confusing. Usually literature just calls these clusters frontiers.\n\n\nOverall I find this work very valuable and the question highly relevant. However, the study has big limitations that reduce the value of the findings. I would be open to raise my score in case that some of these concerns are addressed."}, "questions": {"value": "- Not a weakness but a suggestion: The authors may want to consider not only SPL as a metric, but also weighting by \"action\". Usually for these ICLR-style works a big limitation is that methods are overfit to \"spin in place\" because this behaviour is \"free\" resp. not accounted for as cost in the SPL metric even tough it significantly increases search time. Weighting per action (e.g. as proposed by [FrontierNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04597)) is a more fair comparison and might actually show some more advantages of the geometric approach.\n- Figure 2b: Why does the FPE planner turn in place in the top-right corner and goes back to the left part of the corridor? Why does it leave some small frontiers to the left and right of the corridor unexplored? This looks suspicious and suggests that this planner is quite tuned/overfit towards matterport scans.\n- Figure 3: It is very hard to understand for me what a reader is supposed to see in this map.
