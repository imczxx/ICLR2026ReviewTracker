Such analyses provide deeper insights into model behaviors and often motivate the development of improved models and the establishment of new benchmarks. However, identifying strengths and weaknesses typically requires extensive human effort, consuming a significant amount of time and resources. To address this challenge, we explore the automatic generation of natural language explanations that describe the performance differences between two models. We introduce three evaluation metrics for explanations: Completeness for correctness and overall informativeness, Density for token-level informativeness, and Token Length for the verbosity of explanations. Building on these metrics, we propose three explanation generation methods: Raw Differences, which enumerates all performance differences; Summarization, which condenses them into concise summaries;\nand Optimization, which optimizes explanations for both informativeness and conciseness. We evaluate our framework on CMNIST, CLEVR, and CelebA, showing that Optimization effectively uncovers model differences and biases in natural language. For reproducibility, we will release the code and data.", "tldr": "We present an automatic framework for generating natural language explanations of comparison of two vision models and introduce three evaluation metrics and methods.", "keywords": ["Explainability", "Agent AI", "Synthetic Data"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7be7eb3bbb7bb4f74c00dd6a270e77b0a9c32015.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes to explain the differences between two vision models using natural language, using an LLM and a conditional data generator.

Most of the cases are binary cases (e.g., gender), based on toy, unrealistic datasets such as CMNIST and CLEVR, and even with those, very controlled experiments where authors train their own models on their own bias conditions. I am not really sure how this paper would have an impact in the field. On the other hand, GLOVE [R1] is a similar work in essence, that also uses LLMs as implicit optimizers to generate input prompts for vision-language models. Here, the authors \"explanations\" can be viewed as input prompts. Furthermore, GLOVE shows how useful the method is on a variety of real-word tasks and models, such a CLIP, and autoregressive VLMs, across a huge variety of tasks including multi-label zero-shot classification, generalization and VLM safety. \n\n- [W2] I believe that simply designing datasets, models, and conditions, and then evaluating them on self-proposed metrics without demonstrating their broader applicability, offers limited value to the community. While such metrics can indeed serve as useful reward signals for guiding LLMs (as in GLOVE), reporting them in isolation—without showing their practical relevance or impact—does not meaningfully advance the field.\n\n- [W3] The explanations are highly built on synthetic data, which might differ from the real data distribution that the model is trained on. How do the authors fix this issue? This leads to completely misleading explanations if that is the case. \n\n[R1] GLOV: Guided Large Language Models as Implicit Optimizers for Vision Language Models, TMLR 2025"}, "questions": {"value": "While the idea is nice and interesting, W1 and W2 are major and sadly enough, my decision will be negative.

Since the paper does not compare against this natural baseline in the related work or experimental evaluation, the effectiveness of the proposed method remains unconvincing.\n2. The paper primarily uses Raw Differences as a baseline but does not clarify how the Conditions \\(c\\) for generating Raw Differences is chosen. The quality of Raw Differences is highly sensitive to the choice of \\(c\\)s. Intuitively, selecting an appropriate condition could significantly improve the results. In Section 4, the authors draw an analogy between conditions and concepts. However, existing methods for concept selection[1] already provide effective ways to identify concepts that strongly influence model predictions, which could also improve Raw Differences. The lack of comparison with such established methods further weakens the paper’s claims.\n3. The authors introduce three new metrics for evaluating explanation quality. However, evaluation of explanations is already a well-studied problem[2-4].
