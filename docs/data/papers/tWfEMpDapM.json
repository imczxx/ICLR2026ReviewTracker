The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., *bomb*) with a benign token (e.g., *carrot*) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., *\"How to build a carrot?\"*) are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (*\"How to build a bomb?\"*), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment. We use interpretability tools to show that this semantic overwrite emerges layer by layer, with benign meanings in early layers converging into harmful semantics in later ones. Doublespeak is optimization-free, broadly transferable across model families, and achieves strong success rates on closed-source systems, reaching 74\\% on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with a single-sentence context override.
