While existing models such as Cox proportional hazards, MTLR, and deep neural networks provide partial solutions, they often rely on strong parametric assumptions or lack interpretability. In this work, we propose a Bayesian network (BN)-based framework for survival prediction that explicitly models the joint distribution over covariates, survival time, and censoring status. We learn the structure of the BN using Gibbs sampling and parameterize the conditional distributions using flexible parametric models tailored to variable types.\nProducing the ISD for an instance is performed by inference, which is done via sampling over the Markov blanket of survival and censoring nodes, enabling efficient estimation of personalized survival curves. We evaluate our method on a real-world (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) dataset and compare against state-of-the-art baselines using metrics such as C-index, MAE, and D-calibration. \nResults show that our BN-based model offers competitive or superior performance in estimating full ISDs, while also providing interpretability.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Survival analysis", "Bayesian networks", "Individual survival distribution", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/17bfa4bd5f22b129f0138406cda2ad2dc7f64ae8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a Bayesian Network (BN)-based framework for modeling time-to-event (survival) data, providing a probabilistic, interpretable, and flexible alternative to classical and deep survival models. The approach encodes relationships among covariates, latent variables, and event times within a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where edges represent conditional dependencies. Through Bayesian inference and structure learning, the model captures nonlinear, multivariate, and potentially non-proportional hazard effects while incorporating censoring within a coherent probabilistic formulation.\n\nThe method supports uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and extensibility to heterogeneous datasets. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world clinical datasets show that the BN-based survival model achieves competitive or superior performance in C-index and calibration compared to Cox proportional hazards, random survival forests, and deep learning–based methods. However, the paper also notes challenges related to computational scalability and the complexity of structure learning, particularly in high-dimensional datasets. The quality of learned structures can be sensitive to prior choices and data sparsity, which may limit applicability in very large or noisy datasets.\n\nOverall, this paper offers an interpretable contribution to survival analysis.

Please condense prelims and expand technical sections (structure priors, proposal kernels, local score caching, acyclicity enforcement, and computational cost).\n* Empirical evaluation is narrow and omits strong modern baselines. Only a single clinical dataset (ALS) is used, with small n (e.g., 57–150 instances after filtering). Strong recent baselines such as DeepHit, Deep Survival Machines (DSM), Neural Frailty Machine (NFM), and state-of-the-art discrete/continuous-time neural hazards (e.g., LogisticHazard/Cox-Time) are missing; these are commonly included in current survival work and often excel in ISD estimation and calibration. [1-4]\n* Heavy use of formal “definitions” without theory: the manuscript lists numerous “Definitions” and standard assumptions yet provides no novel identifiability, consistency, or risk bounds for the proposed hybrid BN (no theorems/lemmas/propositions). Consider either removing the formal “Definition” framing for prior art or adding genuine theoretical results (e.g., conditions where MB-restricted inference is risk-consistent for ISDs under censoring). \n* Conceptual concern with “Method 2” (conditioning on δ=1 at prediction). δ denotes whether the event was observed before censoring—an administrative variable, not a patient attribute. Conditioning on δ=1 at prediction could bias ISD estimates relative to the unconditional S(t|x) typically reported; please justify with care and compare “Method 1 vs 2” against standard practice. \n* Calibration reporting is unclear. D-calibration is presented as “k/5” with no p-values or bin choices.
