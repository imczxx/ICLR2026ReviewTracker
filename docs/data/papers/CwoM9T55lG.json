Our work studies the alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there are no efficient input-prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals (architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system’s intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["alignment", "safety", "cryptography"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/445c012c50a27c6672a84b33e75425ceb66b046b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/25e6d80292b31dd42de9fedbd17fa367bb2b9fff.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper considers two natural methods of filtering LLM content to prevent the generation of unsafe information—input and output filtering.

The explicit requirement that the filter be computationally weaker than the LLM in Theorem 1 is a realistic constraint for many practical black-box or proprietary LLM deployments.\n\nComprehensive Scope: The paper doesn't stop at simple detection filters but also considers mitigation filters (Section 1.4) and explores scenarios involving shared secrets or public keys (Section 1.5), offering a well-rounded analysis of potential external defenses.\n\nConnecting Theory to Practice: The inclusion of empirical evidence (Table 1) using state-of-the-art safety filters (Llama Guard, Shield Gemma) adds concrete, real-world relevance to the abstract theoretical findings.
