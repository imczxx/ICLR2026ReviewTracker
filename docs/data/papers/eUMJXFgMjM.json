Even if FLOPs are similar, introducing numerous small block operations may lead to increased kernel launch of CUDA, which could potentially result in a large amount of overhead. It is recommended to have a further discussion on the computation overhead.\n3.

Proposition 1 claims that BoRA requires only $b^{2} r$ additional parameters to increase the weight rank by a factor of $b$. In contrast, LoRA needs $(m+n)(b^{2} r)$ parameters to achieve the same bound, which, however, is incorrect. To achieve a rank of $br$, standard LoRA would need to set its rank parameter to $br$, which would require $r'(m+n)$ parameters where $r'=br$, thus $br(m+n)$ parameters - not $(m+n)(b^{2}r)$. A correct comparison is thus  LoRA (rank $br$) with $(m+n)br$ parameters vs. BoRA (rank bound $br$) with $(m+n)r + b^{2}r$ parameters. The authors should compare these two terms in practice.\n\n3.
