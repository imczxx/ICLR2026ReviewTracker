(2022), and denoted as Forward Looking Best Response MWU (FLBR-MWU). These dynamics are based on the approach of extra gradient methods, with the tweak of using a different learning rate in the intermediate step. So far, it has been proved that this algorithm attains asymptotic convergence but no explicit rate has been known. We answer the open question from Fasoulakis et al. by establishing a geometric convergence rate for the duality gap. In particular, we first show such a rate, of the form $O(c^t)$, till we reach an approximate Nash equilibrium, where $c<1$ is independent of the game parameters. We then prove that from that point onwards, the duality gap keeps getting decreased with a geometric rate, albeit with a dependence on the maximum eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis with an experimental comparison to OGDA, which ranks among the best last-iterate methods for solving 0-sum games. Although in practice it does not generally outperform OGDA, it is often comparable, with a similar average performance.", "tldr": "The main result of the paper is  an improved analysis with a concrete convergence rate for the method FLBR-MWU for 0-sum games", "keywords": ["Nash equilibria", "Zero-sum games", "Duality gap", "last-iterate convergence"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/170c1bbd7333cbdf4d88f1384b54ffb2f27b88ad.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies the FLBR-MWU dynamics, which is an extragradient version of OMWU, but where the intermediate stepsize is large.

A missing interpretation in the paper is the following: if we are choosing \"large $\\xi$\" then we are turning the algorithm into a well-known algorithm. In particular, for very large $\\xi$, we get that each player is simply best responding to the other player. At that point, you have decoupled the dynamics, and we are simply looking at the intermediate step as a subgradient calculation. At that point, you can instead describe FLBR as follows: we are running subgradient descent, but instead of using projected gradient descent, we use mirror descent with an entropy regularizer. This has implications e.g. for the forgetfulness question. More generally, this interpretation suggests that for large $\\xi$, this is not really a \"dynamics,\" it is simply running entropy-based subgradient descent on each player's problem $\\min_x f(x), \\max_y g(y)$, where $f,g$ encode the fact that the other player best responds. Since the paper repeatedly appeals to \"sufficiently large $\\xi$\" with no upper bound on how large $\\xi$ needs to be, I think it is fair to say that the main interpretation of this algorithm should be as subgradient descent.\n2. A second issue with the \"large enough $\\xi$\" occurs in the proofs. In the proof of Theorem 1, you rely on choosing  \"large enough $\\xi$\" such that Corollary 1 holds. However, Corollary 1 is a limit statement where you take a limit on $\\xi$  after committing to $x^{t-1},y^{t-1}$. On the other hand, Theorem 1 is a statement about choosing  and then generating the sequence of iterates. Thus, I do not think that Corollary 1 can be invoked the way you are doing, since Corollary 1 is only proved for a fixed pair of iterates, whereas you are now having iterates that are determined by your choice of $\\xi. More generally, the proof of Theorem 1 is not sufficiently rigorous or detailed. For one, I think you should provide a complete proof rather than say \"following the proof of Fasoulakis et al.\" If you want to invoke Fasoulaskis et al., you should invoke a precise result proven in their paper, and then build from there, not say \"the reader can look at their paper and retrace our left-out steps.\"\n3. On forgetfulness experiments: I am not sure these experiments are all that convincing regarding whether FLBR is forgetful or not. First, I couldn't find a specification of what $\\delta$ is in these plots. Was it sufficiently small? In either case, ideally you'd try several smaller and smaller $\\delta$ choices, to get a sense of whether you chose a small enough $\\delta$. Intuitively, it appears plausible that FLBR is forgetful for large $\\xi$, due to the \"subgradient descent\" interpretation that I described above, but these experiments are far too underspecified for me to feel sure either way."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

However, this is very much dependent on the approximation required of the NE, as once the game dependent geometric rate kicks in, the separation seems to disappear and OGDA seems to practically still perform better (except in 'structured' games). I think this reduces the significance of the results somewhat, as there is no clear reason to implement FLBR unless you know the game is 'structured' in some way. One way to address this would be to theoretically justify some classes of games (e.g. symmetric) for which the game dependent constant is small, thereby explaining the speedup of FLBR compared to OGDA.\n- The discussion on forgetfulness is interesting but not convincing to me. The example used in Cai et al 2024 was a degenerate example for the case of OFTRL, but while the paper states that the larger intermediate update avoids forgetfulness, this statement is not substantiated. The Cai paper shows negative (non-forgetful) results, but to prove that FLBR is forgetful would require more work. For example consider the setting of Braverman et al (2018) and Kumar et al (2024), both cited in Cai's paper, who studied a similar property to forgetfulness. Kumar et al proved that OGDA is not exploitable by an adversary, and is thus in some sense 'forgetful'. However this is in the context of no-regret algorithms, which FLBR is not. I believe there is more depth and subtlety here to be explored, and would be very curious to know if the authors have studied this in more detail as it would improve the paper.\n- While the paper is quite clear in it's structure, I found the writing to overall be very stylized and occasionally imprecise, which reduces the clarity of exposition. For instance, in the last paragraph of the introduction, the authors describe 'positive' and 'negative' results without clarifying what they are, ending with the vague statement that 'the landscape is overall less clear'. In the experimental section, FLBR is described to perform 'close enough' to OGDA in random gaussian games, and 'FLBR comes on top/OMWU is far away' in RPS games. The imprecise language makes it unclear what the threshold for 'close enough' should be. \n\nIn light of the above, I find the paper is marginally under the threshold of acceptance to ICLR, as the writing needs more polishing and more theoretical justification is needed for FLBR compared to existing methods."}, "questions": {"value": "- Purely out of curiosity, how does FLBR perform in other game classes which are non-zero-sum?

Moreover, the Jacobian-type analysis of dynamics near an equilibrium in Theorem 2 is also well-known in the literature; for example, see Theorem 4 in (Fasoulakis et al., 2022) and Section 3 in (Daskalakis & Panageas, 2018). These types of Jacobian analyses usually provide an exponential convergence rate related to the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at equilibrium. Comparing the results of Theorem 2 with these related works, it is unclear what new information is provided. This makes the theoretical contribution incremental.\n\n* Given that Extra Gradient methods are not no-regret algorithms, and the FLBR-MWU algorithm is very similar to the extragradient method, with the only difference being the use of a different step size in the intermediate step (Mertikopoulos et al., 2018), it is not surprising that FLBR-MWU is also not a no-regret algorithm.\n\n* The discussion of the forgetfulness property of FLBR-MWU (Section 4.2) remains at a rough level, with only one toy $2 \\times 2$ example provided to explain the phenomenon.

For example, it is stated that *\"if a method is not forgetful, the produced strategies can get stuck at almost the same profile over many iterations, which slows down convergence.\"* However, in Figure 1, it is not explained how the algorithms get stuck at nearly the same profile.
