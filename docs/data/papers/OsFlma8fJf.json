Yet such collaboration can also amplify errors if agents prematurely converge on unreliable conclusions. We propose a lightweight monitoring framework, Consensus Energy Minimization (CEM), that regulates collaborative decision-making without requiring domain-specific supervision. CEM formalizes deliberation as a dynamical system, where a confusion-aware consensus energy functional tracks both disagreement and convergence in low-reliability regions. The monitor applies stopping-time rules to either halt, continue, or steer discussion toward an agent’s local expertise, ensuring convergence to high-confidence consensus. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that, under mild reliability assumptions, CEM provably avoids harmful convergence and achieves stability in safe consensus regions. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework on synthetic and real-world classification tasks, where CEM reduces uncertainty and improves joint accuracy across diverse interaction scenarios (ideal, asymmetric, and noisy). Our results highlight that principled monitoring, rather than model accuracy alone, is key to harnessing the benefits of deliberation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Consensus Energy Minimization", "Collaborative Deliberation", "Reliable Convergence"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1217fd21a64a0a7fff0e455d66729dec66f95551.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Consensus Energy Minimization (CEM), a lightweight monitoring framework designed to regulate collaborative deliberation between heterogeneous agents (like humans and AIs).

Agent heterogeneity limitation:\n\nThe paper's central motivation is to regulate deliberation among \"heterogeneous agents,\" including humans and AI systems. However, the core methodology proposed appears to fundamentally contradict this claim in two major ways:\n\n- Inapplicability to Human Agents: The paper explicitly names \"Agent H (human or human-like)\" as a target participant. Yet, the primary intervention mechanism, STEER , is defined as a \"small projected gradient step\" used to update a numerical feature-weight vector w_H​. The authors offer no mechanism or discussion for how this purely mathematical operation could be applied to a human's cognitive reasoning, rendering the human-AI collaboration claim unsupported by the method.\n\n- Requires Homogeneous Feature Space: The STEER mechanism's objective function relies on minimizing the term $∣∣w_H​−w_{expert(t)}​∣∣^2$ . This is a squared Euclidean distance between the feature-weight vectors of the two agents. This calculation is only possible if both agents' reasoning is represented by vectors of the exact same dimension. This implies a high degree of homogeneity in the agents' architectures, which directly undermines the paper's goal of managing truly heterogeneous agents (e.g. a human and a deep network).\n\n2. Practical and Theoretical Flaws in Confusion Matrix Usage:\n\nThe framework's reliability measure is based on an agent's confusion matrix $C_a$​. This component introduces two significant limitations:\n\n- Practical Scalability: The paper suggests $C_a$​ can be \"estimated from historical data or a calibration set\". This is a practical approach for a small number of classes (K), but the $K\\times K$ matrix becomes quadratically large and sparse as K increases, requiring an enormous calibration set to estimate accurately. This severely limits the method's applicability to complex, real-world classification tasks.\n\n- Contradiction with Agent Updating: The methodology assumes a static confusion matrix based on \"historical\" performance. However, the STEER mechanism is explicitly designed to change the weaker agent's reasoning by updating its weights. An agent whose predictive model is actively being changed will, by definition, have a new and different confusion matrix. The framework provides no mechanism for updating Ca​ after a STEER operation, meaning all subsequent \"Consensus Energy\" calculations would be based on stale, incorrect reliability data. The fact that \"Dynamic reliability\" is listed as a future extension confirms this is a fundamental flaw in the current method.\n\n\n3. Major Inconsistencies and Lack of Rigor in Presentation:\n\nThe paper suffers from significant inconsistencies and a lack of notational rigor.\n\n- The paper's mathematical formalism is inconsistent. For example, Figure 1 is internally contradictory: It first presents the energy functional using $\\beta_1$​ as a simple coefficient: $\\epsilon = \\dots + \\beta_1(1-r_L)+\\dots$. It then immediately re-defines $\\beta_1$​ as a function of reliability on the next line: $\\beta_1=a (1-r_L)$. Such inconsistencies suggests the paper was prepared in a rush and makes the core methodology ambiguous.\n\n- Unclear Experimental Setup: The paper's experimental setup is not described with sufficient clarity for reproducibility. Furthermore, the paper provides no details on how these models were pre-trained or initialized, which is a critical omission. For instance, it's unclear if the models were trained on a dataset or simply initialized with pre-defined weights, as implied by the synthetic data setup."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
