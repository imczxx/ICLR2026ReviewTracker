Our experiments revealed several issues in the AICrowd Mapping Challenge dataset, where nearly 90% (about 250k) of the training split images had identical copies, indicating a high level of duplicate data. Additionally, we found that approximately 56k of the 60k images in the validation split were also present in the training split, amounting to a 93% data leakage.\n\nFurthermore, we present a data validation pipeline to address these issues of duplication and data leakage, which hinder the performance of models trained on such datasets. Employing perceptual hashing techniques, this pipeline is designed for efficient de-duplication and leakage identification. It aims to thoroughly evaluate the quality of datasets before their use, thereby ensuring the reliability and robustness of the trained models.", "tldr": "This study presents the results of data quality analyses conducted on three popular remote sensing image datasets: (i) the AICrowd Mapping Challenge, (ii) INRIA Aerial Image Labelling and (iii) SpaceNet 2: Building Detection v2 datasets.", "keywords": ["data leakage", "deduplication", "perceptual hashing", "data quality analysis"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/55eede3b93dd9581f05dc9404cffa55678bfb58b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper conducts a data quality analysis of three remote sensing image datasets — INRIA, SpaceNet 2, and AICrowd.
