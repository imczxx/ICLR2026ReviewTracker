Existing methods, however, are often purely data-driven and physics-agnostic, overlooking essential physical principles and struggling to generalize. To address these challenges, we present the Physics-Aware Tensor Field Neural PDE (PA-TFNP), a forecasting framework that embeds rotation-equivariant tensor-field neural operators directly on the sphere, couples them with a numerically rigorous gradient operator based on spherical transforms and physically consistent boundary treatment, and augments the learned dynamics with diffusion terms derived from the atmospheric primitive equations. These innovations enable our model to achieve superior performance through strict physical fidelity and efficient learning.

No code revealed for reproducibility check. The implementation details and reproducibility remain limited. Important training hyperparameters, computational costs at large scale, and code availability are not discussed in depth. These omissions make it challenging for others to replicate or extend the proposed approach.\n\n2. While the model introduces diffusion and drag terms inspired by the atmospheric primitive equations, these additions are applied uniformly across all variables. This uniform treatment overlooks the fundamental physical differences between quantities such as temperature, wind, and geopotential height. Each obeys distinct physical laws and should ideally have customized formulations rather than a single shared diffusion process.\n\n3. The benefits of rotation-equivariance, though central to the model’s innovation, appear to be confined largely to global-scale forecasting, and have been used by many previous works already. The only physics-aware part is according to the advection structure design of the PDE, which is also not new. ClimODE did the same already. **This is the main reason for me recommending paper reject**. The authors should try rebuttal on this first before everything else.\n\n4. While comparisons to ClimODE and ClimaX are thorough, the paper omits quantitative benchmarks against more recent large-scale foundation models like Aurora or GraphCast, both of which represent strong baselines in this field. Including such comparisons would strengthen the empirical claims of superiority. ClimODE is well-known to not perform well enough compared to large FMs, and its core contribution is more on guiding people to use physics and AI inherently together by methods other than just tuning loss functions. Simply showing an advantage over ClimODE is not entirely surprising or impactful, unless novel techniques/paradigms are proposed.\n\n5. Another limitation lies in the evaluation metrics. The study relies primarily on RMSE, without assessing physically meaningful diagnostics such as conservation of mass, energy, or vorticity, nor does it provide uncertainty estimates. This omission makes it difficult to judge whether the model’s forecasts are physically consistent, beyond being numerically accurate."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The authors used the lowest resolution data in WB (5.625°), and even its lower resolution version (11.25°), which is not up to the standard of other works in this field.\n- The main experimental result in Figure 3 is also poorly presented: apart from lacking strong baselines, it also does not show Climatology and IFS-HRES, two must-have baselines in weather forecasting. Moreover, I am confused why the authors evaluated short-term forecasts for the 11.25° data and long-term forecasts for the 5.625° data instead of plotting for all lead times, and why do we need evaluation at an additional lower resolution of 11.25°?\n- The empirical performance of the proposed method does not make much sense. Both ClimODE and the proposed method perform extremely poorly across various variables, being worse than Climatology at day 10 for the 5.625° data, and even at 12 hours lead time for the 11.25° data. This is nowhere near the performance of modern methods.\n- The introduction brings up generalization across diverse geophysical scenarios and error accumulation as the weaknesses of existing methods, but does not show in the paper how the proposed method resolves these problems. \n\nOther comments:\n- The paper does not cite many recent works in deep learning for weather forecasting: Fuxi [1], NeuralGCM [2], Stormer [3], Gencast [4], and Omnicast [5], just to name a few.
