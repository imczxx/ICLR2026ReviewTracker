Synthetic mobility data offers a viable alternative, but many existing approaches require extensive data inputs or model retraining, raising barriers to reproducibility and privacy assurance. We present a data-minimal framework for generating synthetic human mobility trajectories without additional model training and using only two external sources. The method comprises three conceptual components: (1) profile generation to define agent attributes, (2) agent-based decision-making to plan full-day activity sequences, and (3) route and waypoint visualization to produce structured trajectories and geographic renderings. This design enforces semantic coherence and temporal feasibility while preserving privacy by avoiding real user data. The result is a reproducible, extensible approach for creating synthetic mobility datasets suitable for research and policy analysis under stringent data constraints", "tldr": "This paper presents a novel ensemble approach to generating realistic synthetic mobility data without input data for nearly any well-mapped region.", "keywords": ["synthetic data", "human mobility", "generative", "agents", "privacy"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4a9ef33b70ad29782aee52d23315c9b215adb945.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a Data Minimal Framework designed to address the challenge of obtaining real human mobility data, which is difficult to acquire due to privacy concerns. The proposed framework generates synthetic mobility trajectories using only limited input data (a central point and OpenStreetMap data) without requiring additional model training. Its core methodology comprises three steps: 1. Using a LLM to create diverse synthetic agent profiles; 2. LLM agents generate sequences of stop points throughout the day based on their profiles and real facility data from OSM; 3. Connecting these stop points using OSM routing services to produce final trajectories matching the actual road network.
