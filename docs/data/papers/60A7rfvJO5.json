Singularly perturbed differential equations present unique computational difficulties due to rapid transitions within thin boundary or interior layers, where ML methods often struggle. Moreover, these problems require massive adaptive mesh refinement, making dataset generation computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce eFEONet, an enriched Finite Element Operator Network designed to overcome these challenges. By leveraging singular perturbation analysis from PDE theory, eFEONet incorporates special basis functions that capture the asymptotic behavior of solutions, enabling accurate modeling of sharp transitions. Our approach is highly data-efficient, requiring minimal training data or even functioning without a dataset. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis and empirically validate eFEONet across various boundary and interior layer problems.", "tldr": "Data free operator networks for solving singularly perturbed differential equations using finite element space.", "keywords": ["scientific machine learning", "operator networks", "singularly perturbed PDEs", "spectral bias", "boundary and interior layer"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/099d2be13effdfcbf4ed6a2d6d779ced0842c341.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/21d2fd0f8b9aabef10e5f97765f735443c54d18e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduced a kind of neural operator called eFEONet, to solve singularly perturbed differential equations.

These corrector functions seem to make the key difference with FEMNet and are the key enabler for capturing the fine details in the PDEs considered. However, how to identify such corrector function class is not discussed in the paper, and I believe it is a rather challenging task and the same corrector function might not generalize well across different PDE instances, which greatly limit the applicability of the method.\n2. The comparison with baselines might not be fair under the current setting. For the original basis function, the paper proposes to use Galerkin approximation to find such basis. It is well known that Galerkin methods require many pre-generated solution data points to find good basis functions, and it seems that in Appendix D.1 the varying forces are used for that besides training the NN. If this is the case, the proposed method seems to have further limited applicability compared with methods such as FNO, where such a procedure is not required.\n3. The experiments lack closely related baseline methods and benchmark problems. Since the proposed method is a natural extension of FEMNet, comparison with this method is needed. Furthermore, if possible I would love to see how the proposed method performs compared with other state-of-the-art methods such as [1] and baselines therein. In addition, there is a lack of experiments on benchmark PDE problems such as ones in [2].
