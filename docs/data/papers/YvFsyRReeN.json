One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error,\nwhich occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but\nthis constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions.\nAnother challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and\ndifficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this\nproblem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that\nenforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a\nBC flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the\naction distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise\nfor the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across\n40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.", "tldr": "Considering offline RL, we propose ReFORM, a two-stage flow policy that realizes the support constraint by construction and avoids the OOD issue without constraining the policy improvement.", "keywords": ["Offline reinforcement learning", "support constraint", "flow model"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/14eb1f2f612de46c6e15701cb41dad9dfda973ca.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9f2f2d923e451ce0bd85b7c0c21d708d30a554ea.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes ReFORM, an offline RL method that builds a flow-policy constrained to the support of the behavior policy by construction.
