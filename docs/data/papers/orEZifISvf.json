However, existing approaches may suffer from error accumulation during the interaction between luminance and chrominance components, and the lack of fine-grained modeling of color distribution can lead to unsatisfactory enhancement results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel low-light image enhancement framework, Learning to Enhance Low-Light Images with Reliable Attention and Reinforced Distribution Alignment. Specifically, we introduce two key modules: the Reliable Cross Attention (RCA) module, which aggregates luminance and chrominance features with reliable queries, and the Reinforced Distribution Alignment (RDA) module, which robustly fits the color distribution in a more fine-grained manner. These designs significantly improve the quality of enhanced images under low-light conditions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing approaches.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Attention Mechanism", "Gaussian Mixture Model", "Low-Light Image Enhancement"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1532c49760aab0415aae50efbe6cd228d7d2d020.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel framework for low-light image enhancement, titled Learning to Enhance Low-Light Images with Reliable Attention and Reinforced Distribution Alignment.

The overview for learning-based methods is not comprehensive, especially lacking many papers (Flow-based: LLFlow+SKF; Codebook-based: RQ-LLIE, GLARE; Retinex-based: ECMamba) published in top venues.\n\n3. As the core of the Reliable Attention Module, the idea of learnable query vectors is first proposed in PromptIR and then is used in many later works. The originality of this part is a concern to me.\n\n4. Some details in the methods are not clear to me. (1) The calculation of $R_Q$ is not presented in Figure 2; (2) If $M <<N$, the illustration of  $R_M^{I}$ and  $R_M^{HV}$ are impossible to be square; (3) The downscaling and upscaling of SCA are not discussed in the manuscript; (4) Are a and b hyperparameters in equation (7)\n\n5. The presentation of experiments is poor. (1) For SICE, why are test images randomly selected? It's better to follow baselines to split train/test subsets; (2) I have concerns on numbers reported in Table 1: results of some methods are calculate using GT-mean (LLFlow, Retinexformer), while some are calculated without GT-mean (RetinexMamba). Besides, I believe many baseline results are copied from their  original paper or obtained from their official weights, however, the training configurations of this paper (training on 400*400 patches) are different baselines, leading to a risk of performance bias; (3) Table 2 seems to be imcomplete, no results for CIDNet and the proposed method. As this method includes a RL process, I also suggest the authors to provide inference latency comparisons. \n\n6.

As mentioned in your contributions and Chapter 3, the use of RCA can suppress noise amplification during the cross-domain feature aggregation process. However, your paper does not provide evidence to support this claim. There are no experiments to demonstrate its denoising capability, and the visual ablation results presented do not clearly show its noise suppression effect. The discussion in the paper only proves that RCA is a flexible cross-domain information interaction module, but it cannot substantiate that it mitigates noise amplification.\n2. About the RDA module, the paper states: “In conventional frameworks, the posterior distribution parameters are directly predicted by the encoder and regularized to align with the prior. However, such static alignment is insufficient in low-light scenarios, where chrominance distributions exhibit large variations and noise amplification becomes severe.” However, the paper does not provide any evidence or discussion to support this claim, nor does it include ablation experiments showing the results under conventional frameworks. Therefore, the argument lacks sufficient persuasiveness. The RDA module combines clustering, VAE, and further introduces RL. Given such a complex structural design, you need to justify the necessity of incorporating RL.\n3.
