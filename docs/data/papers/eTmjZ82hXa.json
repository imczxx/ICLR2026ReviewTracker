However, existing decoding approaches largely remain constrained to single-task scenarios and individual subjects, limiting their broader applicability and generalizability. Efforts towards creating large-scale neurophysiological foundation models have shown promise, but continue to struggle with significant challenges due to pervasive data heterogeneity across subjects and decoding tasks. Simply increasing model parameters and dataset size without explicitly addressing this heterogeneity fails to replicate the scaling successes seen in natural language processing. Here, we introduce the Neural Mixture of Brain Regional Experts (Neuro-MoBRE), a general-purpose decoding framework explicitly designed to manage the ubiquitous data heterogeneity in neurophysiological modeling. Neuro-MoBRE incorporates a brain-regional-temporal embedding mechanism combined with a mixture-of-experts approach, assigning neural signals from distinct brain regions to specialized regional experts on a unified embedding basis, thus explicitly resolving both structural and functional heterogeneity. Additionally, our region-masked autoencoding pre-training strategy further enhances representational consistency among subjects, complemented by a task-disentangled information aggregation method tailored to effectively handle task-specific neural variations. Evaluations conducted on intracranial recordings from 11 subjects across five diverse tasks, including complex language decoding and epileptic seizure diagnosis, demonstrate that Neuro-MoBRE surpasses prior art and exhibits robust generalization for zero-shot decoding on unseen subjects.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["intracranial brain recording", "neural  decoding", "multi-subject", "multi-task", "data Heterogeneity"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5610d12ca91947f3e816072aad080fa06a6d1932.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose Neural Mixture of Brain Regional Experts (Neuro-MoBRE) as a general-purpose neurophysiological decoding framework, which uses intracranial data collected from 11 subjects across five distinct decoding tasks.

In the introduction, the authors identify low SNR in non-invasive neurophysiological recordings as one of the main challenges motivating this work (line 70). However, the paper states:\n***“To circumvent the limitations posed by low SNRs in non-invasive neurophysiological recordings, we rigorously evaluate Neuro-MoBRE using intracranial data collected from 11 subjects across five distinct decoding tasks.”*** If the primary goal is to enhance robustness to low-SNR conditions, evaluating exclusively on high-SNR intracranial data does not convincingly demonstrate such robustness or the model’s applicability to non-invasive modalities. While using intracranial data as a clean benchmark to establish an upper bound of performance is reasonable, the paper should make this rationale explicit and avoid implying that this setup “circumvents” the low-SNR limitation, as the current experiments do not address or validate performance under low-SNR conditions. The authors could either include experiments using low-SNR modalities (e.g., EEG or MEG) to empirically test robustness, or clearly reframe the motivation to indicate that the intracranial evaluation serves only as a controlled, high-SNR benchmark. Based on the current paper, I don't see the proposed architecture/framework addressing the low SNR issue.\n\n2. The paper claimed they achieve “zero-shot generalization\". Typically, zero-shot refers to scenarios involving unseen datasets probably with different demographics, acquisition setups, or task domains. For instance, directly testing the model on unseen data collected from a separate study. The scenario described in the paper appears to involve unseen subjects within the same dataset, which would be more accurately characterized as cross-subject generalization rather than zero-shot generalization?\n\n3. The model seems heavily tailored to the specific dataset (with specific tasks) used in the study, which raises questions about scalability. The use of subject-wise models for RMAE sessions may become computationally prohibitive as the dataset or population size increases. The term “generalization” should therefore be used with caution, especially since no external or cross-dataset experiments are provided.\n\n4. For the unseen subject decoding performance, the paper didn't compare with other baselines.\n\n\nMinor suggestions:\n- Some tables (e.g., Table 3 and 4) are missing standard deviation (std) values, while Tables 1 and 2 include them. Consistent reporting of mean ± std would improve clarity and comparability.\n- The description of the proposed method is sometimes unclear, and several components would benefit from improved clarity and organization."}, "questions": {"value": "1. If I understand correctly, each decoding task is said to have its own set of classification tokens within this multi-task model. How does the model handle new, unseen tasks during inference? Is there a mechanism for extending the task token space without retraining the entire model?\n2. When comparing against baselines such as PopT that are also trained on intracranial recordings, are these baselines fine-tuned from their pre-trained weights, or trained from scratch? \n3. Given that prior works such as PopT have already tackled the challenge of inter-subject electrode placement variability, what is the key novelty or improvement introduced by the proposed method in this aspect?\n4.

Limited Generalization Evidence: The model is evaluated solely on one private iEEG dataset. Its generalization capability remains unverified on any public iEEG benchmarks with varying experimental paradigms and recording parameters [1,2], raising questions about its robustness across broader data distributions.\n\n2. Brain Region Modeling: The current approach models neural activity at the level of entire brain regions, potentially overlooking the functional complexity and finer-grained functional sub-divisions or dynamic network interactions within these regions.\n\n3. Limited Applicability: While the framework is innovative, the absolute performance for language decoding remains low (e.g., ~29% top-1 accuracy for initial decoding in Table 3). This level of accuracy is far from sufficient for practical clinical applications in assistive communication, highlighting a significant gap towards immediate real-world impact.\n\n4. Lacks In-Depth Comparison with State-of-the-Art Baselines: Comparisons with recent foundational models for neural decoding [3,4] are relatively limited.
