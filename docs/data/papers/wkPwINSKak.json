Blackbox decision-makers (e.g. humans or real-time systems) often face challenges in processing all possible information at hand (e.g. due to cognitive biases or resource constraints), which can degrade decision efficacy. DISS addresses these challenges through a policy that dynamically select the most effective features and options to forward to the black-box decision-maker for prediction. We develop a scalable frequentist data acquisition strategy and a decision-maker mimicking technique for enhanced budget efficiency. We explore several impactful applications of DISS, including biased decision-maker support, expert assignment optimization, large language model decision support, and interpretability. Empirical validation of our proposed DISS methodology shows superior performance to state-of-the-art methods across various applications.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["information selection", "decision support", "blackbox reward maximization"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c554e8068288a48699762a0b46ad3ad6ec080a42.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/11121180839d00542f2b6024b1cc49de9f5ad38f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces Dynamic Information Sub-Selection (DISS), a framework designed to enhance the performance of a black-box decision maker (BDM) by learning an instance-specific policy. This policy dynamically determines which subset of features to present and which discrete 'option' (e.g., which expert to query, which prompt template to use) is optimal for the task at hand. The goal is to maximize the efficacy of the BDM's decision, measured by a reward signal, under a limited budget for querying the BDM during training.\nThe core technical contributions are twofold: (i) a Mimic-Structured Regressor, which insightfully decomposes the complex reward estimation task; and (ii) a scalable Frequentist Thompson Sampling strategy that uses bootstrapping to enable exploration and data acquisition. The framework is extensively evaluated across four distinct application domains and demonstrates significant gains."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "* **[S1] Novel and Well-Motivated Methodological Core:** The mimic-structured regression elegantly factorizes the learning problem, backed by clear theoretical intuition and proof.\n\n* **[S2] Impressive Generality and Unification:** A key strength is the successful unification of four distinct and important application areas under the single DISS framework. This demonstrates the flexibility and broad relevance of the proposed approach, framing it not as a niche solution but as a general-purpose recipe for optimizing human-AI and AI-AI interactions in resource-constrained settings.\n\n* **[S3] Empirical Rigor:**  Extensive experiments with ablations, full-model baselines, and sensitivity analyses lend high confidence in robustness. Inclusion of timing studies, compute constraints, and hyperparameter stability adds real-world credibility."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* **[W1] Gap Between Theory and Practice (Adaptivity):** The main theoretical weakness is the mismatch between the assumptions of the risk bound analysis and the practical implementation. The proof in Appendix A assumes that the observations used to train the mimic model $\\hat{M}$ are i.i.d. However, the FTS algorithm collects these observations *adaptively*, which breaks the i.i.d. assumption. While the empirical results are strong, bridging this theoretical gap (perhaps by discussing how the analysis might extend to the adaptive setting via martingale concentration arguments) would make the paper's formal claims more robust.\n\n* **[W2] Experimental Realism:** My primary concern remains the external validity of the experimental validation. While methodologically sound, the experiments are conducted almost exclusively on standard tabular UCI datasets with synthetic BDMs. The frequent motivation of *human decision support* is not fully substantiated without human-in-the-loop experiments, which are the gold standard for validating claims about improving human performance. While I understand such studies are resource-intensive, their absence means the paper's claims in this domain remain a compelling but unproven hypothesis.\n\n* **[W3] Practical Significance of Gains:** While statistically consistent, some improvements appear numerically small; clearer discussion of *practical significance* would help contextualize their impact."}, "questions": {"value": "The weaknesses section already incorporate most questions, but I was also concerned about compute requirements and scalability.
