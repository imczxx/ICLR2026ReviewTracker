Moreover the metrics they use are obscure. They should use manifold affinity preservation as in PHATE. \n\nThe embedding looks somewhat similar to tSNE from the one figure in the appendix. The reason for this is not surprising, tSNE also does a limited version of matching a diffusion process. Conceptually, matching diffusion processes via generator alignment may not guarantee geometric faithfulness. Because diffusion probabilities are locally normalized, embeddings that differ by large-scale rescaling or local contraction/expansion can produce equivalent diffusion behavior. Thus, the method can preserve relative diffusion dynamics while arbitrarily distorting the manifold geometry. \n\nThe paper omits direct comparison to methods like PHATE, multiscale PHATE and diffusion maps, despite positioning itself as a diffusion-based embedding method. This omission is surprising, as multiscale PHATE also models multiscale diffusion structure and is a clear conceptual predecessor. The authors should include both in the related work and the additional experimental comparisons. Another point of comparison would be the Heatgeo embedding [Huguet et al.

Important prior work like PHATE (and variations) and diffusion maps should be summarized in a background or related work section to clarify how DAE builds on or differs from existing diffusion-based methods.
