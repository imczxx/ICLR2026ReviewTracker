However, despite these advancements, generating customized story visualizations remains challenging. Current methods primarily address identity (ID) fidelity and consistency across frames but overlook the fine-grained control of character attributes, leading to suboptimal generation results. To tackle these limitations, we propose StoryCtrl, an innovative framework that not only preserves identity fidelity but also enables fine-grained control over specific character attributes in generated stories. The proposed framework consists of four key components. First, the CtrlGAN Encoder extracts ID information and inverts visual features to the W+ latent space. Second, the Story-aware Module (SaM) captures attribute changes within the narrative context and assists CtrlGAN in making adjustments during the image encoding stage, enabling fine-grained attribute control. Third, we introduce ID-Consistency Attention (ICA), which ensures consistency in generated story sequences. Finally, we incorporate Customized Guidance Fusion (CGF), which integrates reference image features and prompts to enhance customization. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce an expanded definition of story visualization and present a method for generating fine-grained character attributes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method delivers superior performance in customized story visualization.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diffusion Models"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2f3090c628659132ca0766952c0f80c66746eccb.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
