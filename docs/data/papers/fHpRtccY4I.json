Existing solutions often tackle these challenges in isolation, sacrificing accuracy or relying on costly cryptographic tools. We propose ERIS, a serverless FL framework that balances privacy and accuracy while eliminating the server bottleneck and significantly reducing communication overhead. ERIS combines a model partitioning strategy, distributing aggregation across multiple client-side aggregators, with a distributed shifted gradient compression mechanism. We theoretically prove that ERIS (i) converges at the same rate as FedAvg under standard assumptions, and (ii) bounds mutual information leakage inversely with the number of aggregators, enabling strong privacy guarantees with no accuracy degradation. Extensive experiments on image and text datasets—ranging from small networks to modern large language models—confirm our theory: compared to six baselines, ERIS consistently outperforms all privacy-enhancing methods and matches the accuracy of non-private FedAvg, while reducing model distribution time by up to $1000\\times$ and communication cost by over 94\\%, lowering membership inference attack success rate from $\\sim$83\\% to $\\sim$65\\%—close to the unattainable $\\sim$64\\% limit—and reducing data reconstruction to random-level quality.

Each client in ERIS uploads and downloads the same total amount of data (b' bits) as any compression-only method like SoteriaFL. The claimed \"communication efficiency\" actually refers to reduced distribution time through parallelization, not reduced per-client communication volume. Table 2 is particularly misleading—ERIS shows 1% vs SoteriaFL's 5% primarily due to more aggressive compression (different \\omega values), not the partitioning scheme. \nW2- The core techniques are from prior work: (a) distributed aggregation exists in Ako (2016), Shatter (2025), C-DFL (2022); (b) shifted compression is directly from Li et al. (2022d). The main contribution is combining these with a straightforward proof that partitioning with disjoint/complete masks preserves FedAvg convergence (Theorem B.1), which is relatively obvious since it merely reorders aggregation operations. \nW3- The privacy guarantees only hold against honest-but-curious aggregators who do not observe network traffic beyond their assigned shard. A realistic adversary monitoring network communications can reconstruct the full gradient by observing all client transmissions, reducing privacy to compression-only protection. Under collusion (Corollary D.2), privacy degrades linearly—if adversaries observe all A channels, privacy advantages vanish. The paper needs to discusses these limitations.\nW4- Despite aggregators being selected from clients (who \"may vary in computational resources and connection stability,\" Section 5.2), the paper does not provide analysis of aggregator dropout/failure during training rounds,  evaluation of model sensitivity to aggregator unavailability or discussion of aggregator selection strategies.\nW5- Figure 6 compares ERIS (A=50, with compression) against FedAvg (no compression), exaggerating gains. Fair comparisons should use identical compression ratios. \nW6- Theorem 3.6 shows convergence rate depends on ω (compression), matching SoteriaFL.

For an aggregator-specific shard, it’s more natural that the aggregator (or a coordinator) samples/defines $m_{(a)}^t$ and broadcasts them to all clients per round to guarantee consistent slicing across clients. As written, “dynamically sampled by each client” (line 202) invites inconsistent partitions unless there is a synchronization step. Please clarify the intended control flow (who samples? when? how are masks synchronized/broadcast?)\n- The main text analyzes an honest-but-curious non-colluding adversary who only sees a shard; Appendix D mentions an extension to colluding adversaries and §5.2 acknowledges that privacy benefits diminish with collusion, scaling with the number of colluding nodes (Corollary D.2). This is important enough to surface earlier: how much privacy remains if a small constant fraction of aggregators collude? What if an aggregator colludes with a subset of clients?\n- The experiments show performance degradation as $A$ grows (Figure 2) while Thm. 3.6 is agnostic to $𝐴$. An intuitive explanation is missing. Is this because increasing$A$ shrinks each shard’s dimensionality and, together with compression, increases effective variance and error-feedback lag on each shard’s reference vector?
