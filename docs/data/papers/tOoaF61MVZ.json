Our approach integrates the Holevo-Hayashi Information Bottleneck (HHIB) with single-qubit quantum autoencoders, achieving superior performance through geometric constraints, measurement-induced stochasticity, and information-theoretic compression. Unlike classical approaches requiring dropout or weight decay, our quantum regularization framework leverages quantum mechanical constraints alone. We develop a resource-efficient single-qubit autoencoder using SU(2) group convolutions, achieving significant parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. Experiments, conducted on both classical simulators and IBM's quantum hardware, demonstrate consistent advantages over classical and quantum baselines. Our HHIB integration provides robust performance, validating its effectiveness for practical, NISQ-era deployment. This work establishes quantum regularization as a fundamental advantage of quantum learning systems, offering a new paradigm for resource-constrained quantum machine learning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Quantum Machine Learning", "Quantum Neural Networks", "Quantum Generative Model", "Information Bottleneck", "NISQ"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/386e70d5dafc3fa2a2cc08dda2e866b5a95fdabf.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents an interesting and original idea, using quantum mechanics effects themselves as a form of implicit regularization, rather than relying on explicit regularization techniques.

From a high-level perspective, a single-qubit QML model may not provide any quantum advantage, as a result, how to extend the proposed method to multi-qubit cases is of significance.

The paper does not include VIB or $\\beta$-VAE baselines, which are classical models that also use information bottleneck regularization and including these models would make the comparison fair.\n\n2.

The experiments only discuss a single qubit setting which cannot lead to an advantage due to a lack of scaling, and this I find the most problematic point.\nThe tasks and processes could be more clearly described: for example I am missing a clear claim: what is the thing they propose a QC should be doing? Serving as an autoencoder at scale? I saw no evidence that this would be a good idea, as I cannot extrapolate from the n=1 setting, and moreover to have a chance of advantage, we would need to have some understanding/theory of what is supposed to happen when n is in the super-classical regime.\nI am also concerned about the fact that the authors seem to ignore the specific choice of encoding data in a single qubit, or the more general case, n-qubit system.\nIn particular any discussion of \"constraints\" can completely fail here as *quantum computers can simulate classical computers* and whatever we can do on a CC we can also mimic on a QC. This means the magic is not \"in the hilbert space\" it is als in the choices how they use it, and an analysis and clarification of their choices is missing.\nSome claims about QML are highly overstated.
