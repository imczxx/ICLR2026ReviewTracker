Existing methods primarily follow either the retrieve-then-reason paradigm, which relies on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or heuristic rules to extract static candidate paths, or dynamic path generation strategies that employ large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former lacks adaptability due to static path extraction and the absence of contextual refinement, while the latter suffers from high computational costs and limited evaluation accuracy because of their dependence on fixed scoring functions and repeated LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with adaptive path evaluation to enable efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR leverages MCTS as a backbone, where an LLM-based planner selects the top-$k$ semantically relevant relations at each expansion step to effectively reduce the search space. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, thereby capturing fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to mitigate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, enabling the scorer to continually adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Knowledge Graphs", "Question Answering", "LLMs"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ce333dfaa099aaa22bcd59e32acd2c9d55e466da.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "DAMR is an LLM-guided Monte-Carlo Tree Search framework for KGQA that decomposes reasoning into three coordinated parts: (i) an LLM planner used only for expansion, proposing the top-k relations at each node to aggressively prune the graph; (ii) a lightweight cross-attention path scorer that jointly encodes the question and the evolving relation sequence to estimate path plausibility; and (iii) an online pseudo-path refinement loop that converts high-value (partial) paths discovered during search into pairwise supervision, continually adapting the scorer to the search distribution. On WebQSP and CWQ, DAMR reports higher Hits@1/F1 than semantic-parsing, retrieval, and LLM+KG baselines while markedly reducing LLM calls and tokens. Comprehensive ablations (removing the scorer/refinement or replacing the scorer with a general LLM), sensitivity analyses (k and max hop L), and backbone swaps (Llama/Qwen/GPT-4.1) support the design. The approach emphasizes efficiency, path-level interpretability, and modularity (LLM for direction, small Transformer for judgment, MCTS for integration).

It is unclear under what distributional shifts the scorer avoids reinforcing suboptimal trajectories.

Scalability and practicality on large KGs not addressed. All experiments are conducted on localized subgraphs derived from WebQSP and CWQ. The scalability of DAMR for web-scale or multi-million entity KGs is not empirically or mathematically analyzed. How does the MCTS backbone behave when the entity degree is very high, or when context selection via LLMs requires thousands of candidates? Is the method robust under significant KG incompleteness or noise? Discussion is notably absent.\n\n3. Lack of feedback for LLM planner improvement. While DAMR incorporates dynamic refinement for the path evaluator, the LLM-based planner, which determines the search direction, receives no feedback signal from the search process. As a result, the planner cannot benefit from experience or adapt its relation selection strategy over time. \n\n4. Lack of variance and statistical significance reporting. The experimental results are reported only as single-point metrics, without variance or statistical significance analysis.
