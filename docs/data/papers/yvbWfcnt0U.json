In this work, we introduce the max-min Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (MSGW), a new variant that preserves the computational efficiency of SGW while ensuring essential isometric properties.

The authors rely on a closed-form expression for one-dimensional Gromov problems; however, recent work (acknowledged in [1]) shows that this closed form is incorrect — there is no general sorting algorithm that solves the 1-D Gromov problem. What the manuscript actually computes is therefore not the true GW distance but a related divergence that essentially evaluates the GW loss on either the identity or anti-identity permutation. Appendix B tells that these two permutations commonly appear in practice, but this empirical claim is not supported by a theoretical statement. The paper should explicitly acknowledge at the beginning that the computed quantity is a different divergence, and clarify its interest (see below).\n\nAnother concern relates to the novelty of the paper. Although the proposed formulation is interesting, it remains overall rather incremental compared to [1]. This issue is most apparent in the experimental section, which exactly reproduces the same setups and results as in [1], providing very little additional insight or validation.\nI believe that including a comparison with the sliced Wasserstein distance could significantly strengthen the experimental part. One could define an analogous metric by replacing GW with W in the formulation, which would help clarify the true added value of this approach. Positioning the proposed method relative to sliced Wasserstein would better highlight the practical and conceptual interest of building a “sliced” metric based on an approximation of GW (using the identity or anti-identity permutation).\n\nFinally a last concern is algorithmic and numerical: MSGW is formulated as a max–min problem, unlike RISGW. Max–min problems are notoriously difficult to optimize in practice, and the paper does not discuss optimization stability or convergence. Convergence curves, sensitivity to initialization, and practical runtime/iteration counts would be important to assess optimization behavior and the claimed benefits of avoiding the Stiefel manifold.\n\n[1] Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein, Titouan Vayer, Rémi Flamary, Romain Tavenard, Laetitia Chapel, Nicolas Courty, arxiv 2022."}, "questions": {"value": "Appart from the previous remarks I have technical concerns about the argument in Appendix C.2.1 that GW = 0 implies MSGW = 0. The proof appeals to the claim that a measure-preserving isometry is linear and bijective and thus represented by an orthogonal matrix. I believe that this seems to implicitly invoke results like the Mazur–Ulam theorem, which require hypotheses: in particular, one typically needs Euclidean metrics on both spaces for GW, and Mazur–Ulam gives that surjective isometries between normed vector spaces are affine not linear, so one must ensure the map sends 0 to 0 to conclude linearity.\nMore importantly, the argument should check issues about supports of the measures: I believe Mazur–Ulam works between spaces that are vector spaces. So in this case, in order to work, I believe the support of the measures should be the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^p$ (which is not the case for discrete measures). I suggest the authors (i) make the exact assumptions explicit, (ii) cite the appropriate functional-analytic result because I could not find (Berger, 2009, Theorem 9.1.3) (I belive it is like Mazur–Ulam) and state whether they require the map to be affine or linear, and (iii) discuss any needed assumptions on supports of the measures.\n\nMinor remark: stating “GW is $O(n^3)$” is misleading.

However, this statement is not theoretically valid in general. The assumption that sorting provides the exact optimizer holds only in very specific cases and lacks general proof. In fact, it has been shown that 1D GW does not admit a closed-form solution based solely on sorting. Counterexamples have been rigorously presented in “On Assignment Problems Related to Gromov–Wasserstein Distances on the Real Line”, demonstrating that the optimal permutation can differ from both the identity and reverse mappings. Moreover, even the original Sliced Gromov–Wasserstein paper (Vayer et al., 2019) — cited in this work — later acknowledged that its main theorem supporting this property was disproved.\n\nTherefore, the reliance on sorting or anti-sorting as an “exact” solver for 1D GW introduces a significant theoretical inconsistency. While it may work as a practical heuristic, presenting it as an exact and universally efficient solution undermines the rigor of the proposed complexity analysis and the claimed $O(n \\log n)$ efficiency. The paper would be stronger if it explicitly discussed this limitation and clarified whether MSGW’s theoretical properties still hold when the 1D subproblems are only approximately solved.\n\n- Lack of approximation error analysis. \nThe paper introduces a finite-direction approximation of MSGW but does not provide a clear analysis of how the approximation behaves as the number of sampled directions $L$ varies. In theory, MSGW replaces continuous optimization over the unit sphere with discrete sets of directions $(\\Theta, \\Phi)$, but the paper does not quantify the rate of convergence or the sensitivity of MSGW to the number of sampled directions. This is particularly relevant in high-dimensional settings, where the number of directions required for a stable estimate can grow rapidly, potentially offsetting the claimed computational benefits.\n\nEmpirically, no ablation studies are provided to show how the choice of $L$ affects accuracy, invariance quality, or runtime. Without such analysis, it is difficult to assess the robustness of MSGW under realistic computational constraints. A more systematic investigation of how direction sampling impacts performance would make the method’s practical reliability much clearer."}, "questions": {"value": "- How sensitive is MSGW to the number of sampled projection directions $L$ in practice?
