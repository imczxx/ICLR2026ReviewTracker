For large patches, dual-path information is simultaneously utilized: “Embedding resized to base dimensions + sub-patch embeddings aggregated via Conv,” fused through a zero-initialized MLP. Inference/training side: “Sequence packing + block-diagonal mask” accommodates variable sequence lengths, accelerated by FlashAttention. Experiments show: Full ImageNet and 1-epoch fine-tuning achieve 20%–90% throughput gains while maintaining accuracy, with accelerated performance on LLaVA's VQA, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation.

To use FlashAttention, some baselines were re-implemented with modifications like disabling weighted attention (§4.1). These changes may alter results, so runtime and throughput comparisons might not be fair without full implementation details or code release.\n\n3. The reconstruction method (§3.3) repeats large-patch features to form dense grids, which may create block artifacts and hurt small-object accuracy. The paper reports only overall mAP/mIoU and shows no failure examples, leaving fine-detail loss unverified.\n\n4. Table 6 shows that APT is slower than the baseline when no compression is applied, suggesting preprocessing overhead from entropy computation and token packing. The paper omits CPU/GPU timing breakdowns, and speed gains are smaller than FLOPs reductions, implying memory or pipeline bottlenecks.\n\n5.

Table 4 shows +14–30% throughput on detection with essentially unchanged mAP/AP50. This is positive, but the improvements are less decisive than in classification and would benefit from a Pareto plot analogous to Fig. 4 for these tasks.\n- Currently APT uses entropy to measure the variation of pixels in image regions. It would be beneficial to add ablations for different measures, such as standard deviation of the pixels and local frequency (e.g., DCT-band energy).\n- The writing of the experimental setup can be clearer, specifically on the difference between Full Fine-Tuning and Short Fine-Tuning (Section 4.2). Sometime it could be a bit confusing as to what is the pre-trained MAE; is it one only trained with masked autoencoding or one with both masked autoencoding and classification training?"}, "questions": {"value": "- For dynamic input size (seciton 3.3), you concatenate the tokens of a batch of images into a single sequence and use block attention. Why not padding the sequence of each image into the same length?\n- In the Input-level Merging Baselines, what do you mean by saying Resizing represents a stronger version of Quadformer? It seems that Resizing is a variant of APT by removing the zero initialized layer, and is not really related to Quadformer. Similar question for \"Random\". Clearer explantion is needed.\n- For the dense prediction tasks (section 4.3), you mentioned training only the newly added component.

This dependency might complicate achieving optimal efficiency across different downstream tasks, as the definition of \"salient information\" can vary significantly between tasks.\n\n3. In object detection tasks, does the use of entropy to determine patch size risk ignoring subtle object boundaries? Entropy measures pixel intensity distribution diversity, which may not perfectly align with semantically critical edges, especially when compared to gradient-based measures.\n\n4. For higher resolution images, which naturally result in a larger number of base patches, could the authors explore further patch fusion/aggregation operations after the initial adaptive patching step, particularly when several adjacent low-entropy patches exhibit similar entropy scores\n\n5. When patch size change, should entropy threshold change?
