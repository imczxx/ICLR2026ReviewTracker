This gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs. The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced AudioText Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current capabilities and limitations. The data and code will be made publicly available.", "tldr": "To effectively distinguish between vague and precise outputs from large audio-language models, we constructed the MECAT benchmark, which comprises a novel, fine-grained annotated dataset and its accompanying discriminative evaluation metric.", "keywords": ["Fine-Grained Audio Understanding", "Benchmark", "Large Audio-Language Models", "Discriminative Evaluation Metric", "Audio Caption", "Audio Question Answering"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e10c9d0622e0a030d052bc62a7b5d3bd9d137e88.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This submission proposes a novel benchmark, MECAT, for finegrained open-ended audio understanding evaluation.

Especially, there are sub-metrics with focus on different domains, lengths and cognitive categories, which could shed light on current audio language models and guides the community to develop better models accordingly. The AI expert annotations are also well-designed such that the community can easily reproduce such samples with an automated pipeline."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "For the data construction, since all steps are based on AI models and there is no human-in-the-loop, it is questionable whether the outputs are high-quality enough or have some hidden bias. Since none of the AI models are super reliable to my knowledge, I tend to believe such biases or inaccurate test samples exist. Therefore, this work should at least verify the quality of the testset via human inspection or tests. Furthermore, there is no solid evidence the proposed benchmark is siginificantly more useful than MMAU/MMAR, despite it being open-ended. \n\nFor the metric design part, while I agree that current captioning-based metrics (CIDEr, SPICE, FENSE, etc) are not good enough, I do not think the proposed DATE addresses the issues. First, the TF-IDF based $v_T$ computation does not capture the temporal information because it is a sum $\\sum_{t\\in T}$. It is therefore more similar to a bag-of-word sementic embedding, which is undesirable in captioning evaluation. The Setence-BERT embedding also does not consider the complex meaning of particular words given the context, as the specific use of some word can be very different from its \"averaged\" meaning as represented by $E(\\cdot)$. Moreover, the cross-sample discriminability considers the whole audio testset pool, making the metric not per-sample static and dependent on the entire testset. However, we expect the metric to be fixed for a given sample, regardless what the other samples are.\n\nFor the experimental design part, only very few baselines are evaluated. This is not acceptable for a benchmark-focused paper -- which should check all existing open models as a bottom line (see how many baselines MMAR reported). There is not much analysis on different audio language models given the scores. What do the scores imply besides simply ranking the models? Do the scores reveal any potential bias of existing models? Do the scores show noticeable hints that prior benchmarks (MMAU, MMAR) did not show? Are there PEFT or training-free methods to improve baseline models on the benchmark? These are some examples that can show the usefulness of the proposed benchmark."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the weakness section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "QjUYVxN1Sb", "forum": "oR3bm1AXOn", "replyto": "oR3bm1AXOn", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3087/Reviewer_jZBM"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3087/Reviewer_jZBM"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3087/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761893365362, "cdate": 1761893365362, "tmdate": 1762916545831, "mdate": 1762916545831, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes MECAT, a Multi-Expert Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks.

This staged design helps surface details that single labelers often miss and supports mixed clips that blend speech, music, and environmental sounds.\n\n3.

Audio Flamingo 2 appears in analysis during construction and also in evaluation. This can advantage that model family.
