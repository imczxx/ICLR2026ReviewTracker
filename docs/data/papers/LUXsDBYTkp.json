Yet, in everyday use and public demos, generated people often “look right but move wrong,” exhibiting artifacts like foot sliding, joint hyperextension, and desynchronized limbs. Such failures are not cosmetic: 1) unsafe motions can be copied by viewers, especially juveniles, raising injury risks; 2) in clinical and sports contexts, implausible kinematics corrupt analytics for angle, cadence, and phase, causing misdiagnosis and unsafe return-to-play; and 3) in simulation pipelines, non-physical motion distributions contaminate training and evaluation, degrading sim-to-real transfer. However, existing benchmarks remain inadequate: 1) they lack kinematics awareness, rewarding visual resemblance while joint trajectories violate physiological ranges; 2) they lack rhythm- and body-level temporal metrics, overlooking gait-cycle timing, symmetry, and inter-limb coordination; and 3) they fail to disentangle camera from body motion, letting pans and zooms mask biomechanical errors. To address these gaps, we present \\textbf{Movo}, the first kinematics-centric benchmark for T2V motion realism. Movo unifies three components: 1) a posture-focused dataset with camera-aware prompts that isolate representative upper- and lower-body actions; 2) skeletal-space metrics, Joint Angle Change (JAC), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and Motion Consistency Metric (MCM), that operationalize biomechanical plausibility across joints, rhythms, and constraints; and 3) human validation studies that calibrate thresholds and show strong correlation between skeletal scores and perceived realism. Evaluating 14 leading T2V models reveals persistent gaps: some excel in specific motions but struggle with cross-action consistency, and performance varies widely between open-source and proprietary systems. Movo provides a rigorous, interpretable foundation for improving human motion generation and for integrating biomechanical realism checks into model development, selection, and release workflows.

The authors convincingly argue that current state-of-the-art T2V models, despite their impressive visual fidelity, often produce human movements that are biomechanically implausible, leading to artifacts like foot-sliding and unnatural joint articulation. They posit that existing benchmarks are ill-equipped to detect these flaws as they primarily focus on pixel-level consistency, prompt fidelity, and overall aesthetics, while ignoring the underlying kinematics.\nMovo's main contributions are threefold:\nA curated, posture-focused dataset with camera-aware prompts designed to isolate specific human motions and minimize confounding factors from camera movement.\nA suite of three complementary, kinematics-centric metrics—Joint Angle Change (JAC), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and a Multi-modal LLM-based Motion Consistency Metric (MCM)—that evaluate motion from the perspectives of joint articulation, temporal rhythm, and semantic consistency, respectively.\nAn extensive human validation study that demonstrates a strong correlation between Movo's automated scores and human perception of motion realism, confirming the benchmark's efficacy.\nBy evaluating 14 leading T2V models, the paper provides a comprehensive snapshot of the current landscape, revealing systemic weaknesses in generating realistic human motion and highlighting the significance of their proposed evaluation paradigm."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "(1) Originality and Significance: The paper's primary strength lies in its originality and high significance. It is, to my knowledge, the first work to propose a comprehensive, kinematics-centric benchmark for human motion realism in T2V. It fundamentally shifts the evaluation paradigm from \"does it look good?\" to \"does it move correctly?\". As T2V models are increasingly used to simulate reality, this work addresses a critical bottleneck for applications requiring physical and biological plausibility (e.g., synthetic data for robotics, sports analysis, AR/VR). Movo has the potential to become a standard benchmark in the field.\n\n(2) Quality and Rigor: The quality of the research is outstanding. The benchmark is thoughtfully designed, from the careful taxonomy of the dataset to the multi-faceted metric suite. The execution of the experiments, involving 14 prominent models (including giants like Sora and Veo 3), is comprehensive and provides an invaluable service to the community. The strong human-in-the-loop validation solidifies the benchmark's credibility.\n\n(3) Clarity: The paper is written with exceptional clarity. The authors articulate a complex problem and their sophisticated solution in a manner that is accessible yet detailed. The motivation is compelling, and the link between the identified problems and the proposed solutions is crystal clear.\n\n(4) Actionable Insights: The results are not just a leaderboard; they provide actionable insights. For instance, the finding that models struggle with fine-grained lower-limb coordination or that DTW can expose rhythm drift even in visually smooth videos gives concrete directions for future model development."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "(1) Dependency on Pose Estimator: The entire evaluation pipeline is contingent on the performance of the underlying pose estimator (RTMPose). T2V models can generate artifacts (e.g., blurred limbs, extra limbs) that might cause pose estimators to fail or produce noisy outputs. The paper does not discuss the potential impact of pose estimation errors on the final evaluation scores. A brief discussion on the robustness of RTMPose on generated content or an analysis of failure cases would strengthen the paper's claims of reliability.\n\n(2) Lack of Analysis on Individual Metric Contribution: The paper shows a high correlation between the average of the three metrics and human scores. However, it does not provide an analysis of how each metric (JAC, DTW, MCM) individually correlates with human judgment. Such an analysis could reveal, for example, whether humans are more sensitive to incorrect joint angles (JAC) or poor rhythm (DTW), providing deeper insights into human perception of motion.\n\n(3) The benchmark's core methodology is fundamentally limited by its reliance on a ground-truth reference video for its primary metrics (JAC and DTW). This introduces several critical flaws:\n    (a) Reduces Evaluation to Similarity Matching: It relegates the evaluation from a true assessment of generation plausibility to a task of similarity matching. Consequently, Movo cannot evaluate the realism of novel prompts (e.g., \"an astronaut doing a backflip on the moon\") for which no reference video exists, thereby restricting its scope to a predefined set of common actions.\n    (b)Creates a Single-Reference Bias: The approach penalizes plausible motion variations (e.g., differences in speed, style, or execution) simply because they deviate from the one chosen exemplar. This conflates stylistic difference with a lack of realism, potentially punishing valid and creative outputs.\n\n(4) Details of the MCM \"Judge\": The Motion Consistency Metric (MCM) relies on a multi-modal LLM. The reliability and potential biases of this \"judge\" are important factors, such as photorealism or artistic style, rather than the pure kinematics of the motion. This creates a risk that the metric rewards aesthetic alignment over biomechanical correctness.\n\n(5) From \"Standard Exercises\" to \"Everyday Motion\": The benchmark is constructed around 10 specific fitness exercises. These are highly structured, often periodic activities with well-defined kinematic patterns. However, the paper’s title and conclusions aspire to a much grander goal. There is a substantial chasm between the biomechanics of a gym squat and the complex, unpredictable motions encountered in the real world. For example, motions such as a person slipping on a wet surface, a toddler learning to walk with unsteady steps, or two people navigating a crowded street are characterized by non-periodic, reactive, and interactive movements. These chaotic, emergent scenarios represent the true challenge for T2V models aiming to simulate reality, and the conclusions drawn from Movo's controlled environment may not generalize to these far more complex situations."}, "questions": {"value": "(1) On Pose Estimator Robustness: How did you handle cases where the RTMPose estimator might have failed or produced unreliable keypoints due to artifacts in the generated videos? Did you filter out such cases, and if so, how might this affect the overall model rankings? Could you comment on the sensitivity of your metrics to noise in the keypoint data?\n(2) On Individual Metric Correlation: Could you provide a breakdown of the correlation with human scores for each of your three metrics (JAC, DTW, MCM) individually? This would be very insightful for understanding which aspects of motion realism are most salient to human observers and would further validate the contribution of each component of your metric suite.\n(3) On Extending Movo: The current dataset focuses on well-defined, single-person fitness motions. Do you have plans or thoughts on how the Movo framework could be extended to evaluate more complex, less structured, or interactive motions, such as dancing or team sports, where realism is equally crucial but harder to define?\n(4) On the MCM Metric: Could you provide a brief summary in the main text of the MLLM used for MCM and the core of its prompt? Given that different MLLMs can have different biases and capabilities, how did you ensure the consistency and reliability of this metric?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "1PTz8wKSZD", "forum": "LUXsDBYTkp", "replyto": "LUXsDBYTkp", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22799/Reviewer_UjsW"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22799/Reviewer_UjsW"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22799/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760882043367, "cdate": 1760882043367, "tmdate": 1762942392646, "mdate": 1762942392646, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MOVO, a kinematics-centric benchmark for evaluating human motion realism in text-to-video (T2V) models.

Methodologically, the benchmark is body-centric and interpretable. JAC targets joint-angle trajectories. DTW measures temporal phase/rhythm alignment in pose space. And MCM checks high-level motion consistency, making the evaluation actionable for diagnosing foot-slide, contact violations, or off-phase coordination. The authors run human validation and report strong correlations between Movo scores and pairwise human preferences across multiple actions (e.g., Walking ρ≈0.99), lending credence to the metrics.

By design, Movo focuses on skeletal kinematics and rhythm, leading to a narrow scope relative to general-purpose suites (e.g., VBench).  In this case, the evaluation metrics and test set should be as comprehensive as possible for human videos. However, the proposed three metrics operate on detected skeletons, so systematic pose-estimation errors (occlusion, clothing, unusual viewpoints) propagate directly into scores.  Besides, MCM is a binary MLLM judgment (“similar”/“not similar”), which the authors acknowledge can mask subtle fidelity gaps. Such discretization reduces sensitivity and may be unstable across prompts/models. Moreover, dataset coverage is limited and may not represent “human motion” broadly. The evaluation set consists of ten exercise-style actions (deadlift, squat, walking, etc.), a consciously simplified taxonomy the authors justify, but which excludes many everyday or multi-agent motions (sitting/standing transitions, dancing with turns, interactions, sports with equipment), raising questions about representativeness. Camera-aware prompts further restrict camera dynamics that many T2V systems must handle. \n\n2. Comparisons across models are uneven. Sora was evaluated on only 10 prompts per category (access-limited), and Veo was accessed only via its hosted API defaults, making some leaderboard conclusions preliminary and harder to compare apples-to-apples.\n\n3.
