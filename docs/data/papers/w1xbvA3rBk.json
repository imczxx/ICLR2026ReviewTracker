The paper is generally well-structured and clearly presented."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  **Overclaim and Lack of Novelty.** The most significant weakness lies in the limited novelty compared to prior works [1][2]. The claim in L097 — “a first step toward closing the visual sim-to-real gap” — appears overstated, as previous research [2][3] has already demonstrated that visual RL policy training in simulation can help bridge this gap. Furthermore, the proposed “splat-integrated simulator for evaluating locomotion policies” concept is closely related to [2], which already explored real-to-sim-to-real frameworks for visual locomotion and navigation. \n\n2. **Limited Technical Contribution.** The proposed framework primarily integrates reconstructed 3DGS)scenes from diverse sources into a simulator, achieving 4,096 FPS at 640×480 resolution on a single RTX 4090 GPU. However, the high rendering speed advantage stems directly from the Gsplat renderer’s inherent parallelization, rather than from novel system design. Additionally, the overall visual policy training pipeline follows a design highly similar to [2], limiting the perceived technical innovation.\n\n3. **Lack of Comparion for Visual Locomotion**.  Although the paper presents ablation studies demonstrating the benefits of the voxel grid head and DINO encoder, it lacks direct quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art depth- or geometry-based locomotion policies (e.g., ANymal Parkour, Miki et al.). Metrics such as success rate or velocity tracking error on common benchmark terrains (e.g., stair climbing) are missing. The main quantitative table (Table 2) focuses solely on internal ablations and a “blind” baseline, without showing performance against geometric SOTA methods. Moreover, there are no comparisons to prior visual locomotion baselines [2][3], further weakening the experimental validation.\n\n4. **Questionable Experimental Design for Visual Locomotion and Navigation.** The visual locomotion experiments, such as the stair climbing task, do not convincingly justify the need for an RGB-based policy, since depth-based parkour policies are also capable of handling similar tasks. While the authors claim that RGB-based policies capture semantic cues, the goal-tracking navigation task does not effectively demonstrate this advantage. To substantiate the argument, the paper should include higher-level semantic tasks (e.g., obstacle-type recognition or affordance-based navigation) that genuinely highlight the semantic reasoning benefits of RGB perception.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Xie, Ziyang, et al. \"Vid2sim: Realistic and interactive simulation from video for urban navigation.\" Proceedings of the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference. 2025.\n\n[2] Zhu, Shaoting, et al. \"Vr-robo: A real-to-sim-to-real framework for visual robot navigation and locomotion.\" IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (2025).\n\n[3] Yu, Alan, et al. \"Learning visual parkour from generated images.\" 8th Annual Conference on Robot Learning. 2024."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Can the authors show results on a common benchmark, perhaps something similar to EmbodiedSplat [2] where it is clear what the training data distribution is and if there are any gains from training a large policy on all the real2sim collected data on unseen enviornments i.e. whether the approach is able to quickly finetune etc.?\n\n3.
