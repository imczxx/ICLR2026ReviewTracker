To address this challenge, we propose Periodic Quantum Networks (PQ-Net), a quantum--classical hybrid forecasting architecture that integrates a learnable temporal query mechanism for cycle alignment and a channel aggregation module for modeling inter-channel correlations. PQ-Net preserves permutation equivariance across variables while jointly representing frequency-domain and cross-channel information in a principled manner. At the core of PQ-Net lies the Data Re-uploading Quantum Circuit (DRQC), whose representational capacity we theoretically analyze. We show that DRQC are mathematically equivalent to truncated Fourier series, enabling natural encoding of periodic patterns, while quantum entanglement provides a means to capture inter-variable dependencies. This interpretation establishes DRQC as a rigorous and interpretable foundation for periodic modeling within PQ-Net. Extensive experiments on twelve real-world datasets demonstrate that PQ-Net consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy over strong classical and quantum baselines, and preliminary hardware results further validate its practicality on real quantum devices.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Quantum Machine Learning", "Multivariate Time Series Forecasting", "Data Re-uploading Quantum Circuits", "Periodic Quantum Networks"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f5e08744da4174635d19ae73012ba08ca8b817d0.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/44d4c232b457b6b49647e6ef652d4ce2560d3a9d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a multivariate time series forecasting algorithm that can perform interactive modeling based on both time and channel dimensions."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "PQ-Net effectively integrates periodic structure modeling and multivariate dependency learning through a theoretically grounded quantum-Fourier formulation, providing interpretable and compact periodic representations."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.

Many important claims in the Introduction lack the necessary, strong citations or experimental evidence. For example, the statements “They lack a unified mechanism that can simultaneously represent periodic structure while capturing rich cross-variable interactions” and “yet their heavy reliance on self-attention makes them vulnerable to noise” are presented without adequate support.  \n2. The paper’s motivation is unclear. The authors argue that existing approaches lack a unified mechanism that can simultaneously represent periodic structure while capturing rich cross-variable interactions, yet they cite only CycleNet. In fact, there is a substantial body of work on time–frequency–based periodic modeling (e.g., Peri-MidFormer [1], DEPTS [2]), and numerous methods already address cross-variable interactions (e.g., FourierGNN [3]). Consequently, the necessity and novelty of “simultaneously” modeling periodic structure and cross-variable interactions are insufficiently justified. Additionally, the advantages of introducing Quantum Networks are not clearly articulated.  \n3. It is recommended to include a relevant time series pattern modeling baseline such as TimeMixer++ [4] to enable a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n[1] Peri-midFormer: Periodic Pyramid Transformer for Time Series Analysis.
