Current generative methods often fall short in performing sequence–structure co-design, particularly in treating the functionally critical protein-protein interface as a first-class target. To bridge this gap, we present InterfaceDiff, a graph-based diffusion framework for interface-aware co-design of protein complexes. The complex is encoded by intra-chain graphs coupled through an explicit bipartite interface graph, concentrating modeling capacity on physically interacting residues. InterfaceDiff learns a joint distribution over discrete amino acid sequences and continuous local rigid frames (rotations and translations) by a simultaneous denoising process. To achieve this efficiently, we develop a novel graph neural network denoiser inspired by Invariant Point Attention, which performs message passing on the sparse graph representation while avoiding the computational overhead of fully SE(3)-equivariant networks. We evaluate InterfaceDiff across multiple design tasks, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse, high-quality, and physically plausible all-atom complexes.

The authors argue that existing methods often fail to treat the functionally critical protein-protein interface as a primary design target. The core novelty is its representation: it encodes the complex using intra-chain graphs coupled by an explicit bipartite interface graph. This graph connects interacting residues across chains and is enriched with geometric and chemical features. The model learns a joint distribution over discrete amino acid sequences and continuous local rigid frames (rotations $SO(3)$ and translations $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$) via a simultaneous denoising process. This is powered by a computationally efficient, IPA-inspired graph neural network denoiser that operates on sparse graphs and local frames. The framework is evaluated on co-design, fixed-backbone design, and binder design tasks7"}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper correctly identifies the main challenge in PPC design: treating the interface as a \"first-class target\". Its core representation, an explicit bipartite interface graph, directly addresses this by concentrating modeling capacity on physically interacting residues. This explicit interface graph is a significant novelty and is enriched with specific \"interaction semantics\" (like hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobics), providing chemically-aware control levers that are missing from implicit, all-to-all attention models.\n\n2. The paper makes smart design choices by using an IPA-inspired denoiser operating on sparse graphs and residue-local frames. This captures essential 3D cues and handles rotations on SO(3) in a standard, well-specified way while avoiding the high computational overhead of fully SE(3)-equivariant networks, thus improving scalability.\n\n3. The model demonstrates top-tier results on the primary sequence-structure co-design task (Table 1). It achieves the highest sequence recovery (53.08%) and best perplexity (4.87) among baselines, all while simultaneously producing the best structural metrics (TM-score 0.88) and the most physically plausible interfaces (lowest ΔG, highest Success Rate). It also excels at the practical task of binder design (Table 2), outperforming all baselines across sequence, structure, and interface quality.\n\n4. The paper's structural claims are well-supported by a comprehensive evaluation pipeline. It doesn't just stop at backbone metrics but reconstructs full all-atom models, which are then validated using standard biophysical tools like MolProbity and Rosetta energy scoring.\n\n5. Finally, the ablation experiments (Table 3) provide exceptionally strong, causal support for the paper's design. Removing either the explicit interface graph or the IPA-based geometric module causes a dramatic and measurable collapse in performance, directly proving that each new component is essential to the model's success."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "While the method is promising, the paper has several significant weaknesses that should be addressed before acceptance.\n\nFirst, the primary interface metric, \"Success Rate\" (SR), is poorly defined and potentially misleading. The paper defines success as any design with more heavy-atom contacts than the native structure ($C^{(k)} > C_{nat}$). This metric risks \"reward hacking,\" as it would positively score overly \"sticky\" or non-specific designs while penalizing a high-fidelity design that might be sparser but correct. A more robust metric, such as a contact-map F1-score relative to the native interface or an interface-specific lDDT score, would be far more informative.\n\nSecond, the experimental comparison to baselines is not \"apples-to-apples.\" For sequence-based baselines (e.g., ProteinMPNN), structures are generated by feeding the designed sequences into an external predictor (Chai-1). InterfaceDiff, however, generates its own structures. This makes it impossible to disentangle whether InterfaceDiff is a better sequence generator or simply a better structure generator. A fair comparison would require either adding co-design structural baselines (like RFdiffusion) or running a symmetric pipeline where InterfaceDiff's sequences are also folded by Chai-1.\n\nThird, the paper completely lacks computational transparency, which undermines claims of scalability and efficiency. Key details required for reproducibility are missing, including: model parameter counts, the total number of diffusion steps ($T$), training steps/epochs, batch sizes, and the hardware used (GPU type, VRAM, and wall-clock training time).\n\nFourth, several key methodological details are vague. The model's core component—the interface graph—is built using a \"threshold 7\" (presumably a typo for $\\tau$), but the exact value is not specified in the methods. It is unclear if it is the same $\\tau=6~A$ used for the SR metric. The model's performance could be highly sensitive to this choice, yet no robustness analysis is provided. Similarly, the paper claims an advantage by using an invariant IPA-inspired block, but the trade-offs versus a full equivariant network are under-analyzed. A simple test on randomly-oriented complexes would be needed to validate this design choice.\n\nFinally, the paper's claims about scope are broader than what the evidence supports. The training data was \"exclusively on heterodimers\", so any applicability to homodimers, larger stoichiometries, or symmetric systems is purely speculative. Furthermore, the abstract and contributions list \"antibody design\" as an application, but no specific CDR design benchmarks are presented, only a general binder design task. This claim should be substantiated with relevant experiments or softened."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could you provide the missing computational details required for reproducibility, including the model's parameter count, the total number of diffusion steps ($T$), the training hardware (GPU type, VRAM), and the total training time and batch size?\n\n2. Can you justify the \"Success Rate\" (SR) metric, which rewards any contact count higher than native ($C^{(k)} > C_{nat}$), and provide results using a more standard metric like native contact F1-score or interface-lDDT to validate interface quality?\n\n3. Sequence-only baselines are folded with Chai-1, while your method generates structures directly. Please (a) add structure-generation baselines for complexes or (b) also fold your designed sequences with the same folder (Chai-1) and compare on the same metrics, so the pipeline is symmetric.\n\n4. What was the specific distance threshold ($\\tau$) used for constructing the interface graph during training, and can you provide a sensitivity analysis on how this critical hyperparameter affects performance?\n\n5. Given that the experiments only show a general binder design task, can you provide specific CDR loop design benchmarks to support the paper's claim of being applicable to \"antibody design,\" or would you be willing to soften this claim?\n\n6.
