We propose a differentiable, stochastic optimization framework that applies the Lovász extension to embed the discrete objective into the unit hypercube. The resulting continuous problem is solved efficiently with stochastic gradient descent and converted back to a near-optimal discrete assortment via a rounding scheme. Our method is scalable, model-agnostic, offers theoretical guarantees, and naturally extends to cardinality-constrained settings.", "tldr": "We develop a new differentiable stochastic optimization framework for assortment optimization based on Lovasz extension and randomized rounding with provable guarantees.", "keywords": ["Assortment optimization", "Lovasz extension", "Choice model"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/651d06b5975e65c7bbcf20073cb2002fdb0750ab.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
