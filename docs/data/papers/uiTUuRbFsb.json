A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE‑based CF and show it is governed by \\emph{latent proximity}: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE‑based CF primarily exploits \\emph{local} collaboration between input‑similar users and under‑utilizes \\emph{global} collaboration between far‑but‑related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \\emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade‑offs: \\ding{172} $\\beta$‑KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; \\ding{173} input masking induces stochastic \\emph{geometric} contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift.\nTo preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items. Our analyses are validated on the Netflix, MovieLens-20M, and Million Song datasets. We also successfully deployed our proposed algorithm on an Amazon streaming platform following a successful online experiment.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["VAE-based collaborative filtering"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3e83c9c1103c79dc15c41f5809e53c00d83fadd7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, the authors theoretically analyzed two existing mechanisms, $\\beta$-KL regularization and input masking, on their effect of trade-off between local and global collaboration.
