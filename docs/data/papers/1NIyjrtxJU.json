However, its objective often leads to reward hacking, where the model suppresses the probabilities of both preferred responses ($y_w$) and dispreferred responses ($y_l$). In such cases, the model fails to capture the underlying preference signal, effectively treating both outcomes as undesirable. Subsequent methods, while addressing this issue, introduce their own shortcomings. Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO; \\citet{ethayarajh2024kto}) overly pursues imitation of preferred examples at the expense of learning the true preference margin. Meanwhile, the symmetric squared loss in Identity Policy Optimization (IPO; \\citet{azar2023general}) fails to distinguish between a large positive log-probability difference (indicating a correctly learned preference) and a large negative one (indicating a pathologically inverted preference), penalizing both extremes equally.To address this cascade of challenges, we propose Stable Preference Optimization (SPO). At its core is a novel loss function designed to: 1) prevent reward hacking by establishing a stable, finite optimization target; 2) focus on the preference margin rather than pure imitation, balancing learning across responses; and 3) corrects IPO's loss imbalance with an asymmetric design by using the function $f(z) = -z e^{-z}$. For this loss, when the positive log-probability difference is higher than an initial point, the loss is lower than at the initial point; when the positive log-probability difference is lower than the initial point, the loss is higher than at the initial point, while simultaneously being a convex function that possesses a unique minimum.Our method provides a unified solution to the core drawbacks of DPO, KTO, and IPO. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment performance and training stability.", "tldr": "leanring preference is importanter than imitation", "keywords": ["Alignment", "DPO", "RLHF", "IPO"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5daaae122b957636c8275431eaa4acb488073017.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/fb01854a740ddbfbf12785e6d74b954fe8f6f65c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work introduces **Stable Preference Optimization (SPO)**, a preference-learning objective that replaces DPO’s unbounded enlargement of the preferred–dispreferred log-odds gap with a **finite, theoretically grounded target** derived from RLHF optimality.
