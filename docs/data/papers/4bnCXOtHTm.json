This discrepancy prevents the application of causal discovery in critical domains such as industrial process control, where understanding how causal effects change is essential. We address this gap by proposing a new paradigm that moves beyond static graphs to learn functional causal representations. We introduce a framework that models each causal link not as a static weight but as a function of measurable system parameters. By representing these functions using Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE), we develop a tractable method to learn the complete parametric causal structure from observational data. We provide theoretical proofs for the identifiability of these functional models and introduce a novel, provably convergent learning algorithm. On a large-scale chemical reactor dataset, our method learns the dynamic causal structure with a 90.9% F1-score, nearly doubling the performance of state-of-the-art baselines and providing an interpretable model of how causal mechanisms evolve.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Causal Discovery", "Polynomial Chaos Expansion", "Parametric Uncertainty", "Functional Causal Models", "Uncertainty Quantification"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e402a7c7fcf763b672dc57af509ef406e092ff2d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a novel and elegant method for learning dynamic causal graphs, where the causal relationships change as a function of system parameters.

Clarity and Methodological Precision:**\n\n*   **Missing Details and Citations:** Several sections are very dense and would benefit from additional detail and citations to support the claims made. This is particularly true for:\n    *   Line 161 onwards: A citation is needed for the statement made here.\n    *   Line 205: Please explicitly name the specific optimization algorithm used in your work.\n    *   Line 223: The origin or justification for this property is unclear. Please elaborate.\n    *   Section 220 onwards: This section is difficult to follow. Please expand on the concepts presented and provide citations for established results to improve comprehensibility.\n    *   The index `α'` appears to be used without a formal definition in the main text.\n\n*   **Ambiguity of Temporal Dimension:** There seems to be a discrepancy in the problem formulation. Equation (1) presents a static formulation without a time dimension. However, Equation (5) and later references to time-series causal discovery algorithms imply that the data `X` has a temporal component. Please clarify whether the proposed method is designed for time-series data, i.i.d. samples, or both. This is a crucial detail for understanding the method's scope and applicability.\n\n*   **Acyclicity Constraint:** Score-based causal discovery algorithms typically deploy an explicit acyclicity constraint in addition to a sparsity regularizer. The objective function only appears to include a sparsity penalty ($\\lambda \\Vert (E, \\Theta) \\Vert_0$). Could you clarify if an acyclicity constraint is used, and if so, how it is enforced? If not, please explain how the acyclicity of the learned graph is guaranteed.\n\n**2. Experimental Evaluation and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Baseline Performance Analysis:** In the experiments, the static baseline algorithms perform surprisingly poorly, even though the causal parameters in the dataset have a strictly positive range. In such a case, one might expect a static method to converge to average coefficients, which, however, should still represent the proper causal connections.  Could the authors comment on why the baselines fail so decisively? Is this potentially due to hyperparameter choices? A more in-depth discussion would improve the reliability of the empirical results.\n\n*   **Value of Synthetic Experiments:** While the chosen real-world benchmark is interesting, the paper would be strengthened by including synthetic experiments. This would allow for a more controlled, fine-grained analysis to:\n    *   Demonstrate precisely under which conditions (e.g., speed of parameter change, noise levels, sample size) the proposed method outperforms static baselines.\n    *   Identify the limitations and potential failure modes of the algorithm.\n\n*   **Additional Datasets:** The empirical evaluation currently relies on a single ground truth graph. To demonstrate broader applicability and robustness, the authors should consider evaluating on additional benchmarks. There are several well-established datasets that could be suitable, such as:\n    *   Time-series benchmarks: [4], [5]\n    *   I.I.D. sample benchmarks with varying contexts: [6], [7]\n\n*   **Missing Related Work:** The discussion of prior work could be expanded. While the field is new, there are some relevant works that should be cited and discussed, such as [2] and [3].\n\n### **Minor Weaknesses**\n\n*   **Terminology:** As suggested by [1], the authors might consider using \"Structural Causal Model\" (SCM) instead of \"Structural Equation Model\" (SEM) to avoid confusion with the different usage of the term in the social sciences.\n*   **Cross-Referencing:** Please add backlinks to algorithm listings (e.g., on lines 196, 234) and to proofs in the appendix to improve readability and navigation."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The introduction asserts that existing score-based methods “provide only point estimates without uncertainty quantification,” and that constraint-based methods relying on independence tests are insufficient in practice. These are too narrow and partially incorrect. There is a long line of Bayesian and bootstrap approaches for DAG posteriors and uncertainty over graphs and parameters; many constraint-based methods are paired with robust CI procedures and stability devices. The paper needs careful scoping and citations when criticizing “traditional” methods.\n\n2. The text (line 185) suggests that “traditional CI tests… are insufficient,” then replaces them with a bespoke PCT-CI definition without an empirical comparison against strong CI tests matched to data characteristics. The use of  PCT-CI is not justified methodologically. The argument reads as assertion rather than evidence. Provide comparisons to well-tuned kernel-based CI, partial correlation with robust estimation, or recent conditional mutual information estimators, on synthetic and real settings.\n\n3. Key background on parameter-varying or context-specific causal discovery, time-varying DAGs, covariate-dependent SEMs, and distribution shift causal structure is largely missing. The PCE/QoI citations cluster in early classics (Wiener 1938; Xiu & Karniadakis 2002) and very recent 2024–2025 engineering pieces, leaving a gap spanning two decades. This pattern suggests coverage of a few base methods plus several very recent items rather than a thorough survey. Expand the related work to include context-specific independence, conditional DAGs, regime-switching causal models, and Bayesian DAG posteriors with uncertainty. \n\n4. All results come from one proprietary refinery dataset with 9 variables and 11 asserted ground-truth edges. This is neither diverse nor standard. The head-to-head table mixes methods with very different assumptions and tuning needs, without transparent hyperparameter search, preprocessing, or split protocol. Strong directed baselines might perform well on such process-control data if tuned with domain knowledge; a single domain does not support claims of general superiority. Use public benchmarks (synthetic with controlled parametric variation, cause-me style datasets, time-varying DAG suites), release code, and report robust model selection.\n\n5. The comparison list includes methods that assume static graphs and others that model nonlinearity, but the paper then generalizes conclusions about “traditional methods.” If the claim is about advantages under parametric variation, show controlled synthetic experiments where the ground-truth edge functions vary with ξ, sweep PCE order and noise types, and compare to alternatives explicitly designed for nonstationary or context-specific structure. Current evidence is insufficient to support broad claims.\n\nMinor issues:\n- Typographical placeholders (“Algorithm ??”) and inconsistent section cross-references. \n\n- Ambiguity about whether ξ’s joint law is known a priori or estimated, and how misspecification impacts tests and scores. \n\n- The statement that score-based methods “provide only point estimates” ignores common uncertainty add-ons; rephrase and cite carefully."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
