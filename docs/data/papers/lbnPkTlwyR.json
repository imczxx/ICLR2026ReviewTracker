As the magnitude of available biological data continues to increase, computational methods have become vital for extracting meaningful insights and identifying candidates for repurposing. Although large language model (LLM)-driven agentic workflows show potential, their computational cost and latency often make them impractical. We present a novel, efficient platform that addresses this challenge by grounding LLM reasoning in a biomedical knowledge graph (PrimeKG). This uses known relationships between biological entities to deduce relevant drug repurposing information. Our method first identifies multiple diverse paths between a given drug-disease pair from a natural language query. A Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT)-inspired module then constrains the LLM to reason over these structured paths and synthesize the information into a coherent biological hypothesis. Our platform presents key novelties such as Graph-of-Thoughts-inspired reasoning and diverse KG path-finding that seek to ground reasoning in biological knowledge and mitigate hallucinations. Our evaluation demonstrates that this constrained approach performs comparably in accuracy to unconstrained agentic workflows. Our platform achieves this with significantly fewer LLM calls, 55.3% lower token consumption, and 40.4% less time. This GoT-inspired framework, grounded on knowledge graph data, presents an efficient and powerful system for LLM-driven drug repurposing, effectively balancing reasoning with computational efficiency.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Drug", "Repurposing", "Reasoning", "LLM", "Graph", "Grounding", "Discovery", "Prompt", "Reasoning", "Theraputic", "Biological", "Biomedical"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b33911d11e5877b0e5fe20407d6410f051d904ea.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT)-inspired reasoning framework for LLM-driven drug repurposing.\nIt grounds LLM reasoning in a biomedical knowledge graph (PrimeKG), aiming to improve accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency compared to unconstrained agentic systems like Biomni.\nThe system extracts diverse mechanistic paths between drug–disease pairs via LLM-generated Cypher queries, converts them into natural-language context, and performs iterative reasoning and self-evaluation using a GoT-style reasoning graph.\nResults on both a custom dataset and PharmaDB show comparable accuracy to Biomni but 55% fewer tokens and 40% less inference time.

Could the authors clarify where this efficiency gain primarily comes from — is it due to shorter or fewer reasoning paths in the Graph-of-Thoughts process, or because the system performs single-step constrained reasoning rather than multi-agent iterative search as in Biomni?\n+ For drug–disease pairs where the system cannot find any connecting path in PrimeKG (the paper mentions 11 / 93 cases were dropped): how are these handled in practice? Are they treated as “no evidence, cannot conclude”, or implicitly as negatives? Do they affect precision/recall calculation (e.g., are they excluded from both TP/FN), and if so, does that bias evaluation toward pairs that are already well-studied in the KG? More broadly, how should we interpret such pairs biologically — “likely unrelated”, or “KG incomplete”?\n\nWhile the paper presents a clear application of Graph-of-Thoughts reasoning to drug repurposing, it lacks convincing experimental evidence demonstrating that the proposed GoT framework brings substantial advantages over existing KG-based or reasoning-driven approaches.\nThe evaluation mainly compares with a single agentic baseline (Biomni) without isolating the contribution of GoT reasoning itself, and no ablation or quantitative analysis supports its claimed benefits.\nMoreover, the method does not address how to generalize beyond incomplete knowledge graphs, a key limitation for real-world biomedical reasoning.\nUnless the authors can provide stronger experimental validation and clearer superiority over KG methods during rebuttal, I would recommend rejection."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "WoHtOe0k5x", "forum": "lbnPkTlwyR", "replyto": "lbnPkTlwyR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20991/Reviewer_RTFQ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20991/Reviewer_RTFQ"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20991/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761388881468, "cdate": 1761388881468, "tmdate": 1762999984729, "mdate": 1762999984729, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This is an interesting paper with a creative approach to computational drug repurposing.
