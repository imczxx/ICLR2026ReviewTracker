However, its empirical behavior is highly inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability–plasticity principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study, finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases. This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset and the pretrained policy.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "offline-to-online RL", "online fine-tuning", "stability and plasticity"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/74060f4d6c443ffee85396a060e92d6db266182f.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/750729ae25072c322caffce079b133d207e43579.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper conducts an empirical study over 21 D4RL tasks to analyze how the performance of offline pre-trained policies influence the performances of fine-tuning algorithms.

The authors also define some notions of prior knowledge, stability and plasticity to explain the trend. In particular, the authors propose the stability-plasticity principle which suggests that (1) for tasks where the pre-trained policy has poor performance, the fine-tuning algorithms need to have sufficient plasticity, and (2) for tasks where the pre-trained policy has good performance, the fine-tuning algorithms need to have sufficient stability. $\\mathcal{D}$-centric methods and $\\pi_0$-centric methods prioritize plasticity and stability respectively, explaning the empirical synergies with tasks with different pre-training performance."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The empirical study is thorough and provides convincing evidence that the performance of the pre-training policy can be used as a relatively robust predictor on (43 of 63 cases on D4RL tasks) which class of algorithms ($\\pi_0$-centric vs. $\\mathcal{D}$-centric) would work the best for online fine-tuning. \n\n\n- The selected $\\pi_0$-centric and $\\mathcal{D}$-centric algorithms are strong algorithms in the literature, making the empirical study fair and reasonable, which is valuable to the community."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "My main concerns about the paper are two-fold. \n\n\n*(1) Regime classification for the tasks (Superior vs. Comparable vs. Inferior) is conceptually flawed and may be subtly incorrect in many scenarios.*\n\n\nThe authors propose to classify the tasks based on the return of the pre-trained policy $J(\\pi_0)$ and the return of the behavior policy $J(\\pi_\\mathcal{D})$ and then argue that poor performing policy needs data centric algorithms with high plasticity (and often trades off stability). While this may work well for many cases empirically, it is based on a key assumption that the performance of the policy is indicative of its usefulness in generating data for online fine-tuning. For example, this assumption can break down in many long-horizon, sparse reward tasks where it is difficult to pre-train a policy to achieve non-trivial success rate directly, but the policy can progress in the task far enough to provide good exploratory data. This is where stability should be preferred over plasticity, but can be overlooked if only the returns are being examined. \n\n\nWhile it is true that finding a very principled classification can be quite challenging, relying the classification entirely on the expected returns is a bit too simplistic/crude of an approximation that is expected to not be very future proof (e.g., especially as we begin to study more challenging and complex tasks).  \n\n\n*(2) The authors attempt to formalize the principle of plasticity and stability, the main intuition and explanation behind the performance predictions of online fine-tuning algorithms, with mathematical definitions, but these quantities are not being evaluated in the empirical study.*\n\n\nThe paper makes three formal definitions: (1) prior knowledge, (2) stability, and (3) plasticity: Prior knowledge is the larger of the pre-trained policy’s return and the behavior policy’s return; stability and plasticity measure the how much the performance of the policy fluctuate over the course of training. In particular, the stability metric takes a minimum over the returns of $N$ policies over the course of online fine-tuning (at an unknown interval). This metric conceptually can be very sensitive to the choice of $N$ because it can be seen as taking the minimum of $N$ random variables (same for plasticity), which can make it hard to quantify to what degree the online fine-tuning algorithms exhibit stability vs. plasticity. Furthermore, I could not find any empirical value of these metrics from the paper to justify these definitions. \n\n\nOverall, without a more rigorous discussion of these definitions or empirical evidence that they correspond to the intuitions, these definitions in their current form add little value to the paper."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

However, as far as I can tell, these definitions were never used or referenced in the subsequent text (which only used J(pi_0) and J(pi_D) to define the three regimes). Why define these concepts here? How are they useful? Why are they defined this way and not other forms? With no discussion, their definition seems a bit random.\n- This paper mainly focuses on off policy RL algorithms for offline-to-online RL, yet, it misses any discussion of one critical part of off policy RL – learning a Q/value function. How does the quality of the Q function change in the three different regimes? And how does the quality of the Q function impact fine-tuning performance? Without discussion of the Q function, the paper drew conclusions only on policy performance (J(pi_0) and J(pi_D)), but this is not a full picture to characterize the three regimes. For example, in the “Inferior regime”, is the reason we need to retain the dataset because of a bad policy initialization, or because the pre-trained Q function is bad (and needed a parameter reset). For example, Fig 4 shows that BC-initialization is really bad unless the dataset is kept: this is probably due to the fact that there was no pre-trained Q function. This is the most unsatisfying part of the paper for me. The paper cites WSRL [1], which offers some discussion on how the quality of the pre-trained Q function impacts fine-tuning performance, and I would love to see more discussion of that in this paper.\n- There is a missed opportunity to discuss more on how the different pre-training methods influence fine-tuning results in the three different regimes.\n\n[1] Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Need Not Retain Offline Data"}, "questions": {"value": "- In the superior regime, why does plasticity not matter?

If my understanding is correct, the same method used for the offline phase is used during the online phase for offline RL regularization. So for example, in figures 3, 4, 5, if CalQL was used for pretraining, then the same CalQL coefficient will be used for online fine-tuning. Why do the authors interpret CalQL as providing stability with respect to the pretrained policy $\\pi_0$? It does not keep a frozen copy of this policy at all. I would actually argue it provides stability relative to the offline dataset $D$, since it increases the Q-values of state-action tuples in the dataset, and decreases for on-policy and random action samples. For BC-pretrained policies, does offline RL mean TD3+BC in this paper? If so, the same argument applies - this does not provide stability w.r.t. the pretrained policy. With correct labeling of methods, conclusions in the paper might change significantly.\n\n\n**Clarity / other concerns:**\n- Line 216 Minimal baseline is introduced, but it is not explained? It is then mentioned again in line 268, but it’s still unclear (“minimal baseline corresponds to maximum plasticity with no explicit stability mechanism”, so SAC?)\n- Line 258: I don’t think this perspective on RLPD is meaningful, since there is no pre-training at all. This should be rephrased to make this clear (right now might read as “some networks are kept, while others are reset for plasticity”).\n- Results on figure 3: offline RL + offline data should be equivalent to CalQL right? Why is performance significantly worse than the reported numbers in the CalQL paper? E.g. halfcheetah-medium-v2, from a CalQL init (top middle plot), the green line plateaus at 60%, but CalQL reports 93% after fine-tuning. Likewise with hopper-random-v2, and to a lesser extent antmaze-large-diverse-v2.\n- Line 356:  “This aggregate outcome strongly supports our principle that, in the superior regime, …” I don’t see strong support from figure 3. The green method is a method that tries to stick close to dataset behaviors, and it is the best performing-method on the top left figure. The top right figure shows large overlapping confidence intervals. Same with walker2d-medium-replay-v2, BC.\n- The methods compared are not explained properly. E.g. on figure 3 for “walker2d-medium-replay-v2, BC”, it is clear that you pre-train the policy with BC. However, how do you apply offline RL? Do you pre-train a critic, or start the critic from scratch for the online phase? If so, then the orange line (offline RL without offline data) is not meaningful. What type of offline RL regularization do you apply for the orange and green lines?\n- In figure 5, it doesn’t look like $\\pi_0 \\approx D$. The green line, which is a method that tries to stay close to the support of the dataset (i.e. a stability relative to the offline dataset approach) seems to perform better than other methods."}, "questions": {"value": "Eqn 4: shouldn’t it be J_off^* instead of min J(pi_j)?
