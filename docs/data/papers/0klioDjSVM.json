Existing approaches typically generate full future occupancy states from VAE-style latent encodings. In contrast, we propose Delta-Triplane Transformers (DTT), a novel 4D OWM for autonomous driving. DTT adopts temporal triplane as the occupancy representation, and focuses on modeling changes in occupancy rather than dealing with full states. The core insight is that changes in the compact 3D latent space are naturally sparser and easier to model, enabling higher accuracy with a lighter-weight architecture. We first pretrain a triplane representation model that encodes 3D occupancy compactly, and then extract multi-scale motion features from historical data and iteratively predict future triplane deltas. These deltas are combined with past states to decode future occupancy and ego-motion trajectories. Extensive experiments show that DTT achieves a state-of-the-art mean IoU of 30.85, reduces mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meter, and runs in real time at 26 FPS on an RTX 4090.

It's intuitive but if we compare the results in Table 1 and Table 3's w/o triplane changes, we can see the mIoU is inferior than DOME. So maybe the slower error accumulation achieved in Table 1, compared with DOME, mainly comes from the triplane representation, rather than the delta estimation?\n2.

The achievement of real-time inference on an RTX 4090 makes DTT more relevant to real-world deployment than slower baselines.\n4. **Compelling Experimental Results:** The experiments clearly demonstrate that DTT improves both computational efficiency and core performance metrics, avoiding the common trade-off between speed and accuracy."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Insufficient Theoretical Analysis of Methodology:** The paper primarily uses experimental results to validate its design choices—for example, pretraining the triplane model first and then fixing the encoder to train DTT and the decoder. While Table 4 shows that omitting pretraining degrades performance, the authors lack an intuitive theoretical analysis to explain why this is the case. For instance, Why does end-to-end training (without separating pretraining and fine-tuning) not yield better results? Or is end-to-end training too challenging (e.g., due to high dimensionality or unstable gradients) and prone to local convergence?\n2. **Incomplete Analysis of Cross-Input Performance:** From Table 1, DTT achieves significant performance gains when the input is 3D occupancy ground truth (3D-Occ). However, when the input is replaced with camera-derived data (Camera), the improvement margin shrinks substantially—for example, DOME-F outperforms DTT-F significantly at 0s and 1s. The authors need to provide a detailed explanation for this discrepancy (e.g., whether camera-based 3D occupancy predictions introduce noise that disproportionately affects DTT’s delta-based modeling).\n3. **Cumulative Error Risks:** DTT adopts an autoregressive framework that predicts the next frame using historical information. This raises a critical question: Does DTT still suffer from cumulative error over time? If the model is tasked with predicting longer occupancy sequences (e.g., beyond 3 seconds), will severe prediction drift occur? The current experiments only evaluate up to 3 seconds, and no analysis of long-horizon stability is provided.\n4. **Motion Planning Performance Trends:** In terms of collision rate (Table 2), DTT-O performs significantly worse than OccLLaMA-O at 1s and 2s but outperforms it at 3s. The authors need to explain this counterintuitive trend. For example, is DTT less effective at short-term (near-future) frame prediction, and if so, what causes this delay in performance improvement?"}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the \"Weaknesses\" section for detailed questions and suggestions."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "FGUt514b4e", "forum": "0klioDjSVM", "replyto": "0klioDjSVM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12583/Reviewer_S1ww"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12583/Reviewer_S1ww"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12583/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762002892097, "cdate": 1762002892097, "tmdate": 1762923431951, "mdate": 1762923431951, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
