LMMs encode visual and textual inputs into tokens, which are then fed into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the large number of visual tokens poses a major bottleneck for inference efficiency and memory usage. Reducing visual tokens is a promising training-free solution, but existing methods remain limited: importance-based approaches often yield redundant selections, diversity-based ones overlook differences among tokens themselves. Two-stage hybrid methods inherit shortcomings form importance-based selection and result in suboptimal choices. To address this, we formulate token reduction as an optimal subset selection problem and identify two key criteria for a good subset: informativeness and coverage, to guide the selection that best preserves LLM output fidelity. Based on these principles, we propose a token selection framework that jointly optimizes both. CoIn integrates visual saliency, cross-modal relevance, and representational novelty into a unified scoring function, enabling the selection of a compact yet expressive token subset. It is efficient, model-agnostic, and compatible with modern inference accelerators. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CoIn substantially reduces computation and memory cost while maintaining strong task performance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Multimodal Model", "Inference Acceleration", "Token Reduction"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e0fc73bfe8d1ed5170ece3d29799d6249cf65ef0.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the challenges of low inference efficiency and high memory consumption in large multimodal models (LMMs) caused by the excessive number of visual tokens.

Moreover, while the method formulates token pruning as a subset selection problem, the adopted greedy strategy does not seem to fully exploit its potential. It would be interesting to explore heuristic search algorithms or adaptive pruning mechanisms that can dynamically determine when to stop pruning based on the relationship between the selected and remaining subsets—thereby achieving an optimal trade-off between performance and efficiency, rather than pruning by a fixed percentage.\n2.\tThe model appears to be overly sensitive to hyperparameters. As shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3, the values of α and β vary across model sizes, architectures, and pruning ratios, suggesting that careful tuning is required for each benchmark. Furthermore, Section 4.5 shows that α and β are also dataset-sensitive, implying that it may be difficult to find a universally effective set of hyperparameters in real-world applications.\n3.\tSeveral descriptions lack clarity. For instance, in Section 3.2, the statement “we visualize token scores when using only intrinsic saliency or only text relevance” is ambiguous—are intrinsic saliency and text relevance derived from prior methods? In addition, the font size in Figure 2(c) is too small and should be enlarged for readability.
