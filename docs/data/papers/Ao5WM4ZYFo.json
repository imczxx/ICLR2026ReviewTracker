However, this suffers from two limitations:  \n(1) employing encoders based on global attention mechanisms, particularly on uniformly tokenized inputs, hinders the rapid extraction of fine-grained local features;\n(2) high computational cost arising from stacking multiple encoding layers during semantic feature extraction.\nThus, we propose EG3AD, an Efficient Geometry-aware encoding framework for reconstruction-based multi-class 3D point cloud Anomaly Detection. \nTo investigate how to obtain effective geometric representations under token and parameter constraints, we begin by introducing the Curvature-Aware Sampling module, which mitigates the distortions caused by uniform sampling in regions of high curvature.\nThen, leveraging geometry prior bias of point cloud data, we design the Point Cluster Graph Convolution, which enables compact and effect local geometric aggregation through only limited lightweight layers.\nFinally, to obtain anomaly-invariant semantic features without relying on deep encoding layers, we introduce the Feature Purification Module inspired by optimal transport theory. This module compresses features into a set of cluster centroids that preserve fundamental geometric patterns, thereby yielding representations robust to subtle anomalies.\nExtensive experiments show that simply replacing the vanilla point transformer encoder with our proposed EG3AD yields state-of-the-art results on all PCAD benchmarks.\nOur code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.", "tldr": "We propose an efficient geometry-aware encoding framework for reconstruction-based multi-class point cloud anomaly detection.", "keywords": ["Point Cloud; Anomaly Detection; Reconstrction Model"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/abcdcdb17264eb4a4b8a1e1802b03aecead2e68e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focuses on multi-class point cloud anomaly detection.

It is reasonable to address the computational cost for 3D anomaly detection, as the number of 3D points can be very large for high-resolution point clouds of a large object.\n\n2) The proposed method demonstrates SOTA performance on leading benchmarks for 3D anomaly detection."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1) While the paper aims for 'efficient' 3D anomaly detection, its claims regarding memory and computational cost are not fully substantiated due to a lack of comparison with previous methods. The analysis of computational cost is incomplete; although a figure shows that the KNN-based PCGC module has an O(N) cost, this analysis omits the decoder and anomaly calculation modules, which add overhead during inference. To validate the claim of efficiency, it is crucial to provide a holistic comparison of the entire model's computational, memory, and time costs against other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n2) The proposed curvature-based sampling strategy is a heuristic method reliant on pre-defined hyperparameters. According to the ablation study, performance is highly sensitive to these hyperparameters, which must be tuned for different datasets. This raises concerns about the module's effectiveness and generalization capability. The dependence on 'cherry-picked' hyperparameters may lead to overfitting on benchmarks and limit the method's applicability to unseen, real-world scenarios.\n\n3) The paper contains several typos, errors, and unclear statements that need to be addressed:\n\n- Figure 2a: Appears to be incomplete, with data points clipped from view.\n\n- Line 93: The term 'cross-class metric' is undefined. If this means training on one class and inferring on others, this experimental setup is not presented in the paper. Please clarify.\n\n- Lines 157-158: The definitions of m and m' seem inconsistent with their usage in Figure 3. Please check and correct these notations.\n\n- Line 157: The citation for PointNet appears to be incorrect.\n\n- Equation 14: The notation e is used without being defined.\n\n- Line 320: The hyperparameter γ (gamma) is not defined, and its sensitivity on performance is not discussed.\n\n- Tables: The formatting convention of bolding both the best and second-best results simultaneously is confusing. A clearer distinction is recommended.\n\n4) According to the implementation details, the model is pre-trained on ShapeNet55. Since the Anomaly-ShapeNet test set contains objects from the ShapeNet dataset, this raises a concern about potential data leakage. Please clarify whether any overlap exists and how this issue was handled.\n\n5) Regarding the ablation study on the drop ratio settings for CAS, the baseline performance is missing. What is the model's performance when no points are dropped (i.e., a drop ratio of 0)?

For instance, “Boosting global-local feature matching via anomaly synthesis for multi-class point cloud anomaly detection” also addresses a similar multi-class anomaly detection setting and should be discussed for completeness.\n\nThe novelty of the proposed method remains questionable. The CAS module appears highly similar to curvature-based downsampling, and it is unclear what the essential differences are. Likewise, the distinction between PCGC and PointNet++ is not clearly justified.\n\nAlthough the paper claims to reduce the high computational cost of Point Transformer, the proposed architecture still employs multiple Transformer decoders, and the PCGC module contains numerous fully connected layers. These components introduce considerable computational overhead, and it is doubtful whether the method is indeed more efficient in practice.\n\nThe visualization in Fig. 4 also seems problematic. The curvature maps show a smooth radial transition from the center outward, which is unlikely to be realistic. For example, the regions between the arms of a starfish should exhibit noticeable curvature changes, yet they are visualized as uniformly blue.\n\nIn addition, the relationship between curvature estimation and anomaly detection performance is not clearly analyzed or discussed.\n\nIt is also recommended to provide more qualitative comparisons with other methods to more convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.\n\nFinally, since the method is evaluated under a multi-class setting, it is unclear how the results for other methods were obtained.
