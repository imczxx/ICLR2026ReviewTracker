We demonstrate and discuss the pitfalls of commonly used intermediate representations - voxels and pointclouds - and propose a novel class of loss functions based on moments that can be calculated natively on meshes. The losses can be defined over both surfaces and volumes, and we investigate the vectorizability of computing moment losses and provide fully vectorized efficient implementations. We also expose their salient features which include differentiability, rigorous error bounds, and numerical stability.

However, this advanced variant is not actually explored due to the practical challenges mentioned in Lines 196–210.\n2. Since the proposed metric targets surface reconstruction and its evaluation, it would be more convincing to demonstrate its benefits on standard reconstruction benchmarks and compare it against the widely adopted Chamfer distance. At present, the experiments remain limited to theoretical numerical analyses, which are too primitive to illustrate practical applicability. \n3. The detailed calculus and derivations could be moved to the supplementary material to improve readability.\n4.

The detailed scaling analysis (Figs 2, 3, 4) of the proposed vectorized forward and backward passes on modern GPUs is a solid piece of engineering work.\n\nValuable Direction: The motivation to find a geometry-aware, invariant-rich loss function for meshes is highly relevant, especially for applications like 3D reconstruction and scientific machine learning (e.g., PINNs), where current metrics fall short."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Lack of Novelty: The primary contribution appears to be an engineering one. The proposed loss function is based on the calculation of geometric moments, which itself is not new. The main \"novelty\" is the application of modern GPU vectorization and the implementation of a differentiable backward pass. While a useful engineering effort, this feels more like an implementation of a known technique rather than a fundamental research contribution for a top-tier conference.\n2. Critical Lack of Application Experiments: This is the most significant flaw in the paper. The authors propose a loss function for optimization but provide zero experiments that actually use it for optimization. The paper presents a tool but never shows it being used for its intended purpose.\nThere are no 3D reconstruction, generation, or even simple fitting tasks.\nA minimal \"hello world\" experiment would have been to take a source mesh and use the MeshMoment loss to optimize its vertices to match a target mesh. Without this, it's impossible to assess if the loss is actually useful in practice.\nAll claims about the loss's properties (e.g., consistency, geometry-awareness from Table 1) remain theoretical and unproven in an actual learning setup.\n3. Unconvincing Application Prospects & Internal Contradictions: The paper fails to make a convincing case for its own contribution. The authors themselves explicitly state in the conclusion that geometric moments (GMs)—the very thing the entire paper is based on—\"are not orthogonal, and therefore not suitable for optimization e.g. as a loss function.\"\nThis statement fundamentally undermines the paper's entire premise. The authors are, in effect, arguing against their own method.\nThey suggest that orthogonal moments (like Zernike moments, ZMs) would be better, but relegate this to \"future work.\" This makes the current submission feel incomplete and premature.
