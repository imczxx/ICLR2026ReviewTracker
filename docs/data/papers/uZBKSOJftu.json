While existing methods have explored structure-to-sequence mappings, they focus solely on RNA structures and overlook the role of complex-level information, which is crucial for effective RNA design. To address this limitation, we propose the Complex-Aware tertiary structure-based RNA Design model, CARD, that integrates complex-level information to enhance tertiary structure-based RNA sequence design. To be specific, our method incorporates protein features extracted by protein language model (e.g., ESM-2), enabling the design model to generate more accurate and complex relevant sequences. Considering the biological complexity of protein-RNA interactions, we introduce a distance-aware filtering for local features from protein representation. Furthermore, we design a high-affinity design framework that combines our CARD with an affinity evaluation model. In this framework, candidate RNA sequences are generated and rigorously screened based on affinity and structural alignment to produce high-affinity RNA sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with an improvement of 7.3% compared with base model without our complex-aware feature integration. A concrete case study for 2LBS further validates the superiority of our CARD.", "tldr": "In this paper, we propose the Complex-Aware tertiary structure-based RNA Design model, CARD, that integrates complex-level information to enhance tertiary structure-based RNA sequence design.", "keywords": ["tertiary structure-based RNA design", "complex-aware attention", "distance-aware filtering"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1311265962bf62ac42b8631ae2843f053cd95b5b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/60c6994afb367bf56ef2a7dfcbb14cb58ecea449.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces CARD (Complex-Aware tertiary structure-based RNA Design), a deep learning model for the RNA inverse folding problem.

Valid Problem Formulation: The paper's core premise is strong and addresses a well-known limitation in computational biology. Modeling RNA design in the context of its binding partners is a logical and necessary next step for the field, moving beyond the isolated \"RNA-only\" inverse folding problem.\n2. Practical Framework: The proposed high-affinity design framework, which combines the generative model (CARD) with evaluative models (affinity predictor, structure folder), represents a practical, fully in silico workflow for optimizing functional RNA sequences."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Omission of Protein Structural Information: The model uses the 3D structure of the RNA (via GVP) and 3D distance information for its filtering mechanism, but it puzzlingly discards the 3D structure of the protein. Instead, it relies only on 1D sequence embeddings from a PLM (ESM-2). Given that protein-RNA interaction is fundamentally a 3D structural problem, this seems like a significant missed opportunity to provide the model with richer, more relevant features. The authors acknowledge this as a limitation but do not justify the initial design choice.\n2. Focus on Sequence-Based Metrics: The evaluation relies heavily on sequence recovery rate and Macro F1-score. While the case studies show RMSD for specific examples, the paper would be more convincing if it included a comprehensive structural evaluation (e.g., average RMSD of folded designed sequences) across the entire test set. This would provide a clearer picture of whether the model's complex-aware approach also yields better structural preservation.\n3. Purely In Silico Case Study: The high-affinity design case studies for 2LBS and 2HGH are entirely computational. The framework generates sequences with CARD and then \"validates\" them using AlphaFold3 for structure and a custom-trained ensemble model for affinity. This iterative loop optimizes for the predictors' biases, not for true in vitro binding affinity or structural stability. Without any experimental validation, this section only proves that the model can generate sequences that other computational models score highly, which is a form of circular logic.\n4. Weak Justification for Core Novelty (Filtering): The main architectural novelty is the Distance-Aware Filtering module, specifically the \"stratification-based distance-aware\" approach (\"H.Dist.\"). However, the ablation study in Table 3 does not provide a clear-cut case for its superiority.\n  1. The simpler \"G.Dist.\" (greedy distance filtering) achieves an overall recovery rate of 63.98%\n  2. The proposed \"H.Dist.\" achieves an overall recovery rate of 63.42%.\n  3. The proposed method is outperformed by a simpler baseline in the main 'All' metric. The authors' explanation—that \"H.Dist.\" is \"more beneficial for longer RNA sequences\"—feels like a post-hoc justification, especially when it underperforms on both \"short\" and \"overall\" recovery.\n5. Poor Figure Quality: The figures throughout the paper (e.g., Figures 1, 2, 5, etc.) are simplistic and lack professional polish. They are not aesthetically pleasing. This detracts from the overall presentation quality of the manuscript and makes it harder to interpret the proposed architecture and results."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Given that the simpler \"G.Dist.\" filtering baseline outperforms your proposed \"H.Dist.\" filtering in overall recovery rate (Table 3), can you provide a more robust justification for using the more complex, stratification-based method?\n2. What was the rationale for discarding explicit protein 3D structural features and relying only on PLM sequence embeddings, especially when the RNA is represented structurally and your filtering mechanism is based on 3D distances?\n3. In your high-affinity case study (Sec 3.3, Appendix D), you use an affinity predictor trained on the PRA201 dataset. Your case studies (2LBS, 2HGH) are also from PRA201. Was the affinity predictor trained on the entire PRA201 dataset, including 2LBS and 2HGH? If so, this seems to be a data leakage issue, where you are optimizing sequences for a predictor that has already been trained on the ground-truth affinity of the target complex."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "PGHFnHzuWj", "forum": "uZBKSOJftu", "replyto": "uZBKSOJftu", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1844/Reviewer_tD58"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1844/Reviewer_tD58"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1844/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761792539638, "cdate": 1761792539638, "tmdate": 1762915909619, "mdate": 1762915909619, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "I have reviewed this paper before. The paper tackles tertiary-structure-conditioned RNA inverse folding and argues that protein context matters. It encodes protein residues with a protein PLM (e.g., ESM-2), filters them by distance-aware selection, and (in the new version) aggregates them via concentric shells in addition to the usual top-K and a global token. These protein features are fused with RNA representations in a Complex-Aware Transformer (CAFormer). Beyond sequence recovery/F1 on PRI30K and PRA201, the paper adds an iterative high-affinity design loop using an affinity predictor and validates candidates by predicted complex structures(AF3 / RFNA) with RMSD checks. Overall, compared to the prior version, the method is more biologically motivated (multi-scale shells) and the narrative is cleaner.

This prevents a clean answer to: Does protein context improve the structural realizability of designed sequences at scale, not just in a handful of candidates?  Maybe, for a representative test split (or a sizable subset), report distributions of RMSD and/or TM-score for (i) RNA-only variant vs. (ii) protein-aware model, under the same AF3/RFNA inference settings. Include success-rate curves under varying RMSD/TM thresholds, and provide per-length (short/medium/long) breakdowns. \n\n\n- The shells are distance-based pooling. There is still no explicit orientation / local frame/torsion angle encoding from the protein backbone, and no direct use of atomic coordinates beyond distances. If possible, consider adding a small ablation that augments the shell features with a lightweight geometric descriptor (e.g., local backbone frames, principal-axis orientation, dihedrals) at the selected residues. Show a couple of percent improvements or, if it doesn’t help, document the negative result transparently. I do think sole relying on PLMs is not a convincing way to support the authors' arguments.\n\n\n\n- Minor: \nThe pipeline still depends on a learned affinity predictor trained on relatively small data.
