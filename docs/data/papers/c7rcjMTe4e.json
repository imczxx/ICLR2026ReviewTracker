The authors claim substantial gains in robust accuracy across CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet, often when combining EDL with adversarial training baselines (PGD-AT, TRADES, AWP, HAT, PORT). They present mitigation of robust overfitting (Table 3), strong AutoAttack numbers (Tables 4-6), multidataset/backbone ablations (Tables 8-10), certified robustness via randomized smoothing (Fig. 6), and simple checks intended to rule out gradient obfuscation (transfer attacks, a zero-order gradient match in Table 12)."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1- Clear diagnosis + constructive fix. The paper empirically shows Vanilla DL (SDNet) ails under PGD even when good against random noise (Table 1, p. 3) and then designs EDL to trade off $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_1$ fidelity (Alg. $1+$ Eq. (6), p. 5).\n\n2- Simple, modular layer that plugs into ResNets. Fig. 1 (p. 4) and Fig. 12 (p. 15) clearly show the drop-in EDL layer and the end-to-end training pipeline (Fig. 11, p. 14). This architectural modularity is attractive for adoption.\n\n3- Broad empirical sweep. Results cover three datasets and four backbones, multiple norms (ℓ∞/ℓ2/ℓ1), and combinations with diverse AT baselines. In particular, Table 4 (p. 7) shows sizable AutoAttack gains when adding EDL to PGD-AT/TRADES/HAT/PORT; Tables 5–6 (p. 7) compare to RobustBench-style leaderboards at multiple budgets.\n\n4- Overfitting mitigation. Table 3 (p. 6) and Fig. 2 (p. 7) show that EDL reduces the BEST–FINAL gap and lifts final robust accuracy compared with popular regularizers and data augments.\n\n5- Interpretability signals. The paper provides embedding-difference profiles (Fig. 5, p. 8) and detailed hidden-state visualizations (Figs. 19–20, pp. 27–28), which suggest attacks affect EDL representations less.\n\n6- Some robustness hygiene. The authors include transfer-attack comparisons (Fig. 7, p. 8) and a zero-order vs autograd gradient agreement (Table 12, p. 26), and they plot RISTA convergence of the unrolled layer (Fig. 8, p. 9).\n\n7- Runtime disclosure. Table 7 (p. 9) reports inference costs as EDL layers are stacked; overhead is 1–3× vs plain ResNets and only modest vs Vanilla DL."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1- Evaluation transparency gaps (AA settings, AT details).\nAutoAttack. While AA results are reported (Tables 4–6), the exact AA configuration (version, components enabled, checks for catastrophic overstatement) is not fully specified in the main text. Precise ε-schedules, per-attack budgets, and restarters for PGD are scattered; PGD settings for the leaderboard comparison are summarized but could still allow optimistic numbers if not standardized.\n\n2- Potential confounding from training protocol. The key robustness curves switch from Vanilla DL pretraining to EDL fine-tuning at epoch 150 (Fig. 2 and Fig. 14, pp. 7, 21). It is unclear whether the gains come from the structural prior itself or from regularization effects of unrolling, reset-like dynamics, or extra optimization steps. A controlled study that trains EDL from scratch under the same schedule as baselines is missing.\n\n3- Theory is promising but incomplete.\nConvergence/conditioning. The RISTA update depends on weights $w=1 /(2 \\mid x- \\left.A^*(z) \\mid\\right)$. There is no regularization floor to prevent blow-up when the residual is near zero, and step-size/Lipschitz conditions for global convergence of the nonsmooth, reweighted problem are not provided. Lemma 4.1 (p. 4) gives a local quadratic upper bound but end-to-end convergence guarantees (with learned $A, \\beta$ ) are absent.\n\n4- Obfuscation checks are not exhaustive. The zero-order match (Table 12, p. 26) shows local gradient agreement, and transfer attacks are included (Fig. 7), but EOT for any stochasticity, black-box query-budget tests, step-size sensitivity, and multi-restart PGD sweeps are not systematically presented. Given the large reported gains, a fuller obfuscation checklist is warranted.\n\n5- Accounting for capacity \\& parameters. Replacing convolutions with EDL (unrolled iterations, extra tensors $w$, learnable $\\beta$ ) likely changes parameter counts and memory footprint. Only runtime is quantified (Table 7); parameter and activation memory overheads, training wall-time, and throughput are not. Fairness of comparisons-especially to SOTA AT-needs these numbers.\n\n6- Certified robustness methodology is under-specified. Fig. 6 (p. 8) shows better certified accuracy with randomized smoothing, but the noise level 𝜎, base classifier, sample counts, and confidence computation are not detailed, making it hard to assess comparability to standard smoothing reports.\n\n7- Generality beyond small images. All results are on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet; no ImageNet-1k training, detection/segmentation, or non-vision tasks. The approach might scale, but evidence is missing. (A few ImageNet visualization examples appear in Fig. 22, p. 30, but not full training.)\n\n8- Ablations on $\\beta$ and unrolling depth. The layer-wise learnable $\\beta$ is central, yet there is no distributional analysis of learned $\\beta$ across depth, no freezing vs learning ablation, and limited study of T (number of ISTA steps), step-sizes $t$, or the shrinkage schedule $\\lambda_t$.\n\n9- Reconstruction claims need stronger quantification. The recovered-noise analysis (Table 13, p. 29; Figs. 21–24) is interesting but uses aggregate norms vs “adaptive noise.” It does not show per-example causal links between better noise recovery and AA success/failure, nor how this behaves under distribution shift."}, "questions": {"value": "Please resolve the aforementioned weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "DfZs8b74Gp", "forum": "c7rcjMTe4e", "replyto": "c7rcjMTe4e", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14223/Reviewer_9QCz"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14223/Reviewer_9QCz"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14223/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761996943069, "cdate": 1761996943069, "tmdate": 1762924678056, "mdate": 1762924678056, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Dictionary Learning (DL) to improve model performance and robustness.
