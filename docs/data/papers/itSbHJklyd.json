Despite its appeal, it is often too costly to compute. This has motivated approximation methods like entropy-regularized optimal transport, downsampling, and subsampling, which trade accuracy for computational efficiency.  In this paper, we consider the challenge of computing efficient approximations to the Wasserstein metric that also serve as strict upper or lower bounds, as these are essential components of branch-and-bound, A$^*$ path finding, and heuristic search techniques in tasks such as trajectory inference, alignment, and clustering.  Focusing on discrete measures on regular grids, our approach involves formulating and exactly solving a Kantorovich problem on a coarse grid using a quantized measure with a tailored cost matrix, followed by an upscaling and correction stage.  This is done either in the primal or dual space to obtain valid upper and lower bounds on the Wasserstein metric of the full-resolution inputs.  We evaluate our methods on the DOTmark optimal transport images benchmark as well as alignment tasks on volumetric dataset of macromolecules, demonstrating a 10×–100× speedup compared to entropy-regularized OT while keeping the approximation error well below 5\\% at 2D, and 30\\% width bounding regions at 3D.", "tldr": "Fast methods to bound Wasserstein metrics in 2D and 3D", "keywords": ["optimal transport", "earth mover’s distance", "bilevel", "cryo-electron microscopy"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3cd1f7a693101c5c8cfec382b90c29064f81bba9.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b889c3a11d50d08bc0e9b0cdfdc6f3231a427a88.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper concerns discrete probability measures on uniform grids. The authors develop efficient algorithms for bounding Wasserstein distance $\\mathcal{W}_p$ (e.g., earth mover's distance) between such measures. The search for methods that compute exact upper and lower bounds (rather than just approximations) is motivated by the fact that such bounds enable the use of branch-and-bound, A* path finding and other search techniques for optimization problems involving $\\mathcal{W}_p$. The proposed methods work as follows. First, a coarser grid is defined, and measures are downscaled. Second, a special cost matrix for the coarse grid is constructed (possibly depending on original measures), and the downscaled Kantorovich problem is solved exactly. Finally, the solution is upscaled and adjusted to obtain a valid bound. In numerical experiments, bounds based on the Sinkhorn algorithm are used as a baseline.

The upper bounds are obtained by coarsening the input distributions onto a regular grid and solving an exact optimal transport problem using block-averaged costs or coarse-grid couplings that are then upscaled to the original resolution, with marginal mismatches corrected via weighted total variation. The constructions are designed to ensure that the resulting estimates always overestimate the true transport cost. The lower bounds are derived either from nearest-neighbor mappings, either by coarse OT with blockwise minimal costs or by interpolating duals refined by a c-transform to enforce dual feasibility.\n\nThe authors do not establish any approximation ratio or error bound quantifying how close their upper and lower bounds are to the exact value as a function of the grid resolution, dimension, or scaling factor $\\kappa$. Consequently, the framework ensures correctness but offers no provable tightness guarantees, relying instead on empirical evidence to demonstrate that the bounds are often reasonably close in practice.\n\nFurthermore, several existing methods already provide provable upper and lower bounds on the Wasserstein distance. For instance, quad-tree or hierarchical constructions yield an $O(\\log ⁡n)$-approximation upper bound for $W_1$(see, e.g., Indyk & Thaper 2003; Backurs et al. 2022), while the nearest-neighbor mapping, also known as the Chamfer distance, serves as a simple and widely used lower bound.
