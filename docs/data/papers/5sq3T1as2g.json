Using a targeted pipeline that unlearns the seven Harry Potter novels while retaining related web content, we find that standard unlearning metrics improve (explicit references drop with minimal utility loss) yet unintended memorization risks worsen: the unlearned model more often regurgitates training snippets containing PII, and this effect amplifies when red-teaming. The result exposes a failure mode where steering away from the removed source shifts the model toward memorized remnants in adjacent data. We argue evaluations of unlearning should include PII-regurgitation stress tests, and that safeguards must prioritize upstream data hygiene, especially for open-source releases. Our findings underscore that an alignment mechanism like unlearning may have unintended side-effects and that there is a need for more rigorous AI safety evaluations.", "tldr": "Partial unlearning on LLaMA 3.2 1B suppresses the targeted Harry Potter content but increases PII regurgitation under related prompts, revealing a new safety risk that calls for PII-focused evaluations and stronger upstream data hygiene.", "keywords": ["LLM Unlearning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c126a4af6dabfd95b5b0e2dc65afd253cd3c13cb.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper investigates the unintended safety risks of partial unlearning in LLMs with a case study on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct in the Who's Harry Potter [1] setting.

Section 4.2.1 appears to show two types of leakage: (1). public topic-related content (the Harry Potter fan blog example), and (2). genuinely unrelated PII (the university student example), which constitutes the true safety concern. I don't see evidence directly connecting (2). and partial unlearning from the study, and it remains plausible that similar leakage could occur even with comprehensive unlearning to a full forget set. \n   - Questions: \n      1. Can you provide additional evidence or analysis supporting that PII leakage specifically results from partial unlearning? Have you tested whether similar leakage occurs under complete unlearning?\n      2. Can you quantify or categorize the leaked content to distinguish between benign and genuinely harmful PII leakage?\n\n\n2. **Limited generality:** the experiments are limited to a single model, a single unlearning domain, and a single unlearning method, which constrains the generalizability of the conclusions. While the compute constraints are understandable, other methods such as RMU [1] and SatImp [2] can be implemented within the stated single A100 budget. \n   - Questions: \n      1. Can you clarify why Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct was chosen over other models, and whether you expect the same behaviors at larger scales?\n      2. Is it feasible to conduct even a lightweight ablation on a different domain/unlearning method to verify whether the phenomenon generalizes beyond the speific setup in the paper?\n\n\nSome other weaknesses that are less important:\n\n\n3. **Insufficient analysis:** The decision to withhold red teaming prompts and model weights is defensible for safety, but it limits reproducibility and may hinder a full understanding or verification of the proposed findings. \n   - Questions: \n      1. Can you provide more qualitative and quantitative evaluations for section 4.2.1 and 4.2.2?\n\n\nIn conclusion, I think the empirical scope and the provided anlysis of the paper do not yet support the strength of its main conclusion.

In fact, it seems clear that this PII leakage happens in Harry Potter because of the amount of fanfiction on the web, and the fact that fanfiction tends to mention PII such as information about the fanfiction author. However, in other domains this would be less likely. So the principle is not that unlearning leads to PII leakage, but just that unlearning leads to the model outputting content from the most related data that was not unlearned.\n\nThe only datasets used for evaluation are one dataset with 10 examples and a second dataset with 19 examples.
