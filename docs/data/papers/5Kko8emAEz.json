Our empirical study reveals that adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content.\nExtensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of MANI-Pure.

In the main experiment, the iterative adaptive attacks (e.g., PGD+EOT) are only evaluated under a limited number of iterations. Prior work has shown that increasing the number of iterations is critical for assessing the robustness of newly proposed DBP methods under full gradient computations [1][2]. While computational resources may be constrained, I suggest evaluating at least $N = 100$ or $N = 200$ iterations for all adaptive attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\n2. Since DBP methods introduce additional randomness into the defense gradient [1], the robustness across varying numbers of EOT samples should be investigated as an ablation study to confirm stability. Appendix E.4 mentions following DiffPure’s settings, but recent works [1] have further discussed the EOT issue. Given that Figure 6 shows little variation across attack iterations, the authors should also clarify the gradient computation details in their framework.\n\n3. Could the authors elaborate on the differences in empirical analysis between MANI-Pure and prior works (e.g., Freq-Pure [3])?\n\n4. In Figure 1, the distribution of the magnitude spectrum appears skewed, suggesting significant disparity in $M_i$ values between early and later frequency bands. I suggest including a quantitative example of the band-wise weights $w_i$ to illustrate the distribution of magnitude importance.\n\n5. The paper mentions that magnitude is averaged within each band. Does each band cover the same frequency range or contain an equal number of $(u, v)$ pairs? Since low-frequency regions tend to be more robust to adversarial perturbations, a more adaptive allocation of band-wise weights based on $M_i$ might improve performance. As Equation (9) appears somewhat heuristic (e.g., using an inverse correlation), I suggest discussing potential improvements in the weight assignment strategy.\n\n\n[1] \"Robust Classification via a Single Diffusion Model\", ICML 2024.\n\n[2] \"Diffusion Models are Certifiably Robust Classifiers\", NeurIPS 2024.\n\n[3] \"Diffusion-based Adversarial Purification from the Perspective of the Frequency Domain\", ICML 2025."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "V6biUEeh4a", "forum": "5Kko8emAEz", "replyto": "5Kko8emAEz", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission798/Reviewer_svyq"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission798/Reviewer_svyq"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission798/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761123660685, "cdate": 1761123660685, "tmdate": 1762915606923, "mdate": 1762915606923, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper observes that adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed.

As mentioned in the related work, the observation that adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed is not new, and many studies have made efforts in addressing this issue. This makes the motivation of the paper weak.\n2. Although the experiments include many baselines, it is notable that some very relevant recent methods from the literature are absent or only indirectly compared. For example, the authors mentioned [1] and [2] in the related work, but did not compare them with the proposed MANI-Pure in the experiments. It’s unclear if these approaches were unavailable, not easily integrable, or if the authors considered them similar enough to omit. Excluding them makes it harder to fully assess MANI-Pure’s novelty and advantage. If these methods offer comparable adaptive noise injection, the lack of direct comparison is a weakness\n3. FreqPure is not the original idea of this paper, removing it will significantly decrease the performance. Meanwhile, the added benefit from MANI’s adaptive noising is relatively modest. The improvements from MANI can be seen as incremental tweaks rather than a breakthrough, especially considering that FreqPure is a well-established idea.\n4. The paper does include adaptive attacks like BPDA+EOT and PGD+EOT, which is good, but it’s not explicitly shown how MANI-Pure handles an attack that violates its core assumption (e.g. an adversary intentionally injecting low-frequency distortions).\n5. All classifiers tested are CLIP-based zero-shot models; it would be nice to see results on a standard trained classifier as well, to ensure the gains are not somehow specific to CLIP’s features. The focus on CLIP makes sense for plug-and-play usage, but evaluating on a typical model (e.g. a ResNet trained on CIFAR-10) could further demonstrate generality.\n6. PGD+EOT is widely acknowledged as a stronger attack than BPDA+EOT for DBP methods [3], but the proposed method performs better on PGD+EOT than BPDA+EOT, which does not make sense to me. The iteration numbers for PGD, BPDA and EOT might be too low, resulting in ineffective attacks.\n\n[1] Sample-specific noise injection for diffusion-based adversarial purification, ICML 2025.\n\n[2] Diffcap: Diffusion-based cumulative adversarial purification for vision language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2506.03933, 2025.\n\n[3] Robust evaluation of diffusion-based adversarial purification.
