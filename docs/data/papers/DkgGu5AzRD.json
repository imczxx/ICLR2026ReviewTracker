Some detailed comments are provided below.\n\n- Although multi-affine quadratic constraints are generally challenging, the problem becomes affine when all but one variable block is fixed. ADMM can naturally exploit this structure, which appears to have a negligible effect on the analysis framework of classic ADMM. The convergence rate (Theorem 3.1) also basically follow the convergence analysis in [1] and the KL framework in [2]. (Here the PL property is a special case of KL).\n- Several extensions of the main results appear incomplete:\n  - Although the main motivation is robotic applications, Corollaries 4.1 and 4.2 only guarantee convergence when certain assumptions about the functions are met. This means that, although problem (6) can be reformulated as (1), theoretical convergence is not fully assured, thereby limiting its practical application.\n  - The analysis of the approximated-ADMM (Algorithm 2) does not explicitly address the effect of approximation errors on convergence. Furthermore, in Theorem D.3, conditions P2 and P3 are assumed rather than proven, which weakens the theoretical support.\n- Although each ADMM subproblem is strongly convex and smooth, a sufficiently large penlty parameter $\\rho$ causes the term $\\frac{\\rho}{2}\\|A(x)+Qz\\|^2$ in the augmented Lagrange function to dominate. This increases the condition number of the Hessian of the subproblem, which can slow convergence or require high-precision solvers.\n- The experimental evaluation lacks rigour and comprehensive baseline comparisons. Comparisons with existing methods (PADMM and IPDS-ADMM are designed for non-convex objectives) are limited to a few scenarios and omit standard benchmarks. Furthermore, since Algorithm 1 is only a classical ADMM, it should also be compared with ADMM methods designed for convex objectives [3,4].\n- The paper provides incomplete practical guidance on parameter selection. While a 'sufficiently large $\\rho$' is theoretically required, the paper provides no sensitivity analysis or practical tuning strategies, which hinders reproducibility.\n- Some of the expressions are inaccurate. For example, on page 3, the description of [5] incorrectly states that $\\phi$ is not smooth, and the objective in [6] does not match the original reference.\n- It seems that the author is missing some key references, including [7,8], which also address nonconvex optimization with nonlinear equality constraints using ADMM. Since the constraints studied here are a special case of nonlinear equalities, it would be good to contextualize the work the authors have done with these important papers.\n- The writing suffers from typographical and organizational issues:\n  - The cross-ref to expressions are inconsistent (for example, 'Equation (13)' on page 24, line 1244 vs. 'equation 34' on line 1260).\n  - The table on page 3 lacks a caption.\n  - On page 3, line 155, 'Assumption' should be pluralized as 'Assumptions'.\n\n# References\n\n[1] Gao, W., Goldfarb, D., & Curtis, F.
