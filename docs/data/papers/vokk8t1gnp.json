When such systems approach the limit of infinite number of degrees of freedom, their dynamics tend to simplify. This paper investigates gradient descent-based learning algorithms that exhibit linearization in their parameters. We establish that this apparent linearity, arises from weak correlations between the first, and higher-order derivatives of the hypothesis function with respect to the parameters, at initialization. Our findings indicate that these weak correlations fundamentally underpin the observed linearization phenomenon of wide neural networks. Leveraging this connection, we derive bounds on the deviation from linearity during stochastic gradient descent training. To support our analysis, we introduce a novel technique for characterizing the asymptotic behavior of random tensors. We validate our theoretical insights through empirical studies, comparing the linearized dynamics to the observed correlations.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Neural Tangent Kernel", "Linearization", "Wide Neural Networks", "Correlations", "NTK", "Weak Correlations"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c366cda21cb94632df988189cd50966a5968c460.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a criterion, that of having weak correlations between the first derivative of the model. and the higher derivatives, and shows that it is equivalent to the model being in a linear/NTK regime where one can take a Taylor approximation around initialization.

The paper puts forward weak derivative correlations, small correlations at initialisation between the first and higher‑order parameter derivatives, as the underlying mechanism for NTK‑style linearization, with precise definitions $(C_{D,d}$ and two equivalence theorems (Theorems 3.1 and 3.2) tying correlation decay to linearised dynamics and learning‑rate scaling. This gives a compact, testable lens on “lazy training.”\n- Technical framework. Section 2 builds a random‑tensor asymptotics calculus (subordinate tensor norm + stochastic big‑O, uniform bounds), and proves existence/uniqueness of a tight upper bound.\n- Deviation‑over‑time statement. Corollary 4.1 bounds the SGD deviation $F- F_{\\text{lin}}$ by $O(1/m(n))$ over (finite) time under an exponential NTK‑phase contraction assumption, making the linearisation guarantee feel more operational.\n- Attempt at architectural breadth. By leaning on tensor‑programs, the authors argue many wide architectures satisfy weak correlations (with rates tied to activation derivatives, Equation 22), offering a route to reason about how architectural choices and learning‑rate reparametrization $\\eta \\mapsto r(n)\\eta$ push systems toward or away from linearisation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- All experiments use tiny subsets of MNIST, CIFAR‑10, and Fashion‑MNIST; fully connected nets; MSE loss; and NTK‑normalised learning rate with long training (1,000 epochs).

Thus, showing that the relative discrepancy $|f - f_{\\text{lin}}|$ shrinks with width (Figure 1) and that estimated 2nd/3rd‑order correlation proxies decrease (Figure 2-3) does not validate the central predictive claim in regimes where feature learning matters. That is - nowhere do we empirically validate that networks that are known to feature learn do not also have weak correlations between the first and higher order derivatives.
