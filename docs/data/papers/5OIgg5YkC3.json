However, an overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary $\\textit{unpaired}$ multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a $\\textit{target}$ modality? We introduce $\\textbf{UML}$: $\\textbf{U}$npaired $\\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\\textbf{L}$earner, a modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can yield representations strictly more informative about the world than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that incorporating unpaired data from auxiliary modalities—such as text, audio, or images—consistently improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image and audio.", "tldr": "We show that incorporating auxiliary unpaired multimodal data can significantly improve performance on an individual modality.", "keywords": ["Unpaired Multimodal Representation Learning", "Cross-modal Learning; Multimodal Learning from Unpaired Data"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c5d2898ff7a1067625e9b2dab04d20f6368ff948.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose the Unpaired Multimodal Learner (UML), which leverages auxiliary unpaired multimodal data to enhance representation learning in a target modality.

The authors provide valuable intuition for UML by presenting theorems (Sec. 3.1) derived under a linear data-generating process.\nNonetheless, this represents a significant simplification of the highly non-linear dynamics of the large Transformer-based models (e.g., DINOv2, OpenLLaMA) used in the experiments. While the idea that shared weights act as a practical analogue of *Fisher information linear combination* is intriguing, it remains more of an intuitive analogy than a formal justification.\nIn my view, this creates a potential gap between theory and practice. The empirical results are undeniably strong and well-presented, yet they seem to be motivated by the theoretical framework rather than explained by it.\n\n**Minor**\n\n- Although the theoretical motivation is clearly written, the derivations of the theorems are somewhat verbose and occasionally redundant, which reduces readability. A more concise and streamlined presentation could enhance the clarity of the theoretical section.\n- While the experimental validation is extensive, its presentation in Section 4 and the Appendix seem overly dense. For example, much of the dataset and model information is relegated to the Appendix and only briefly mentioned in Section 4.1, where it hinders readability. Additionally, the color scheme used in Table 1 and Table 2 (blue and pink) is identical, even though the categories differ (Table 1: datasets; Table 2: settings).\nAs a suggestion (not a requirement), reorganizing the experimental sections might improve clarity. (e.g., focusing on the supervised setting in Section 4.1 and moving the self-supervised setting to Section 4.2, and removing the color scheme from Tables 1 and 2 to avoid confusion)"}, "questions": {"value": "- What is the main difference from prior works, and what constitutes the key novelty of this paper? In my view, as the authors mention in Section 3 and Appendix A.1, UML might seem slightly incremental, as it combines concepts from previous studies, such as shared model parameters (e.g., [1]), and the use of unpaired datasets (e.g.,[2]).\n- What happens if the text or data (modality $\\text{Y}$) are randomly generated? For instance, what if the text description is entirely unrelated to the image (e.g., the image depicts a dog, but the text describes playing sports)? Would such mismatched modalities disrupt the increase in Fisher Information?\n- Yet the authors note in the limitations section that most experiments are conducted on classification tasks, I still raise a concern regarding the applicability of the proposed method to other tasks, such as image–text retrieval.\n\n\n[1]  Chada, et al. \"Momo: A shared encoder model for text, image and multi-modal representations.\" arXiv preprint 2023\\\n[2] Lee, Jae-Jun, and Sung Whan Yoon. \"Can One Modality Model Synergize Training of Other Modality Models?.\" ICLR 2025\n\n=======================================================\n\n**Note**: I acknowledge that I may have partially misunderstood certain aspects of the paper.

The idea that data from multiple modalities can be used for unified pretraining without any special consideration for the nature of the modalities being integrated is a fundamentally flawed premise. It is well known in literature that modalities can often have conflicting information, and even multimodal models, which often operate on explicitly paired data and are trained with the objective of aligning the modalities, struggle with this integration. There are plenty of works dedicated to addressing specifically this problem [a, b]. At the low level, for instance, modalities can often have different convergence rates [c] and provide conflicting gradients to the model [d], none of which can be thought of as being helpful from a training perspective without special treatment [d]. In fact, [c] specifically established the general impossibility of what the authors propose in this work.\n\n2. Although the experiments show performance some improvements, the generality with which the paper is presented is misleading. Attempting to perform joint multimodal training using the proposed approach in the settings and datasets used in [a, b, c, d], is likely to falsify the findings reported, since special adjustments to cope with the challenges of integrating multiple modalities is needed to deal with those settings.\n\n3. No ablation or analytical studies have been reported for the proposed approach, which makes it difficult to evaluate the contribution of the various design choices, for instance, the proposed UML objectives, the contribution of unpaired samples from a different modality, convergence in the uni-modal vs multi-modal setting, etc.\n\n4. Finally, neither the idea of sharing model weights, nor doing pretraining with data from multiple modalities can be regarded as novel, since they have been around in the multimodal learning community for a long time [e, f, g]. In fact, this is also the problem that works on domain generalization attempt to solve, albeit framed in a different manner [h].\n\nMinor:\\\nLine 449: \"Further results on\" -> \"For further results on\"\n\nReferences:\\\n[a] Zhang et al., \"Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict\", ICML 2025.\\\n[b] Ma et al., \"Improving Multimodal Learning Balance and Sufficiency through Data Remixing\", ICML 2025.\\\n[c] Wang et al., \"What makes training multi-modal classification networks hard?\", CVPR 2020.\\\n[d] Javaloy et al., \"Mitigating Modality Collapse in Multimodal VAEs via Impartial Optimization\", ICML 2022.\\\n[e] Ngiam et al., \"Multimodal Deep Learning\", ICML 2011.\\\n[f] Hu et al., \"Towards Unsupervised Sketch-based Image Retrieval\", BMVC 2022.\\\n[g] Rastegar et al., \"MDL-CW: A Multimodal Deep Learning Framework with Cross Weights\", CVPR 2016.\\\n[h] Gulrajani et al., \"In Search of Lost Domain Generalization\", ICLR 2021."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the Weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Ry1t6am6MR", "forum": "5OIgg5YkC3", "replyto": "5OIgg5YkC3", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14635/Reviewer_8Sv3"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14635/Reviewer_8Sv3"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14635/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761956965492, "cdate": 1761956965492, "tmdate": 1762925010904, "mdate": 1762925010904, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
