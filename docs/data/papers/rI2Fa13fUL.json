The two loss functions derived in Section 3 both have corresponding counterparts in CTM [1], so the main contribution of the paper is essentially the application of CTM to the offline RL setting. Although the authors claim two innovations, the second one, using the advantage as a weighting factor for sample supervision, is a relatively straightforward and well-established idea that has been widely adopted in AWR [2] and later studies. In my view, the main novelty lies in replacing multi-step intermediate samples with a one-step surrogate term, but it remains questionable whether this alone can convincingly demonstrate the paper's novelty.\n\n2. According to Table 4, the authors tune several hyperparameters across different tasks, including the learning rate, $\\eta$, maximum Q backup, and gradient norm. However, they do not conduct a dedicated hyperparameter study, leaving the method’s sensitivity to these parameters unclear.\n\n3. The performance gain of GTP in offline RL tasks compared to that in BC is relatively modest, which may indicate that the proposed value-driven guidance is not quite effective.\n\n[1] Kim, Dongjun, et al. \"Consistency Trajectory Models: Learning Probability Flow ODE Trajectory of Diffusion.\" *The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations*\n\n[2] Peng, Xue Bin, et al. \"Advantage-weighted regression: Simple and scalable off-policy reinforcement learning.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.00177* (2019)."}, "questions": {"value": "How does the advantage-weighted policy optimization used in this paper compare with the classifier-free guidance approach in terms of effectiveness?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "s9t2Gr9LUC", "forum": "rI2Fa13fUL", "replyto": "rI2Fa13fUL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16030/Reviewer_dRVt"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16030/Reviewer_dRVt"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16030/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761967211168, "cdate": 1761967211168, "tmdate": 1762926232243, "mdate": 1762926232243, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a novel policy class for offline reinforcement learning, GTP, which addresses the trade-off between slow, high-performance diffusion models and fast, lower-quality consistency models.

Theorem 1 presents an effective method to replace expensive ODE solvers, which appears to be a novel and impactful contribution. The paper's important claims are stated formally and supported with rigorous proofs.\n\n2. Effective performance over behavioral cloning baselines\n\nThe empirical results for behavior cloning are impressive. As demonstrated in Table 1, GTP-BC outperforms both standard offline RL baselines and existing diffusion-based behavior cloning methods. This is a strong result that suggests GTP may indeed be a more effective and expressive policy class compared to other generative model-based approaches."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited novelty of value-driven guidance\n\nThe novelty of the proposed value-driven guidance appears limited. The paper's core policy improvement technique, advantage weighted regression, is a well-established baseline in offline reinforcement learning [1]. Furthermore, the insight that an advantage-weighted generative loss corresponds to a KL-regularized policy optimization problem is already well-known in the field [2].\n\n2. Are diffusion-based offline RL baselines really slow?\n\nThe motivation for introducing GTP, which is predicated on the computational burden of diffusion policies, appears to be contradicted by the authors' own empirical results. The introduction claims diffusion-based baselines are seriously slow, yet Table 5 shows the diffusion policy generates actions in just 0.00116 seconds. This aligns with my own experience in training diffusion policies for offline RL, where I have similarly observed that action generation is not a significant bottleneck. The 862Hz control frequency is fast enough and weakens the paper's core motivation.\n\n3. Efficiency concern: modest practical speed-up\n\nThe claim that GTP is effective could be strengthened with further clarification on two points. First, regarding efficiency, the practical significance of the speed-up appears modest. While Table 5 shows a 23% relative gain (0.94ms vs 1.16ms), the absolute difference is only 0.22ms. It is unclear if this small time-unit saving translates to a meaningful benefit in a practical setting, which relates back to the question of whether the baseline's speed was a significant bottleneck.\n\n4. Comparability concern about the SOTA claim\n\nI noted in Table 4 that GTP's hyperparameter search included \"gradient norm\", a parameter not reported in the original DQL paper [3]. To make the comparison more direct and robust, it would be beneficial to either include a sensitivity analysis on this parameter's effect or, ideally, to evaluate all baselines under the same, unified hyperparameter search space.\n\n5. Limited baselines and experimental scope\n\nThe experimental evaluation could be significantly strengthened by expanding the set of baselines. We noted the omission of FQL [4], a method that appears to share a similar motivation to this work. Consequently, its related methods, such as FAWAC and Flow-based Behavior Cloning policies, were also missing. Including these comparisons would be highly valuable. In particular, a direct comparison against FAWAC seems critical, as the primary difference appears to be the choice of generative backbone (Flow Matching vs. GTP). This would help isolate the specific benefits of the GTP architecture. Finally, to substantiate the claims of GTP's generality, we recommend evaluating the method on a larger-scale benchmark, such as OGBench [5].\n\n[1] Nair, Ashvin, et al. \"Awac: Accelerating online reinforcement learning with offline datasets.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.09359 (2020).\n\n[2] Kang, Bingyi, et al. \"Efficient diffusion policies for offline reinforcement learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2023): 67195-67212.\n\n[3] Wang, Zhendong, Jonathan J.
