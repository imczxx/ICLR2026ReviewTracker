While various TIG models have been proposed for representation learning, they face two critical gaps in their \"pre-train, predict\" training paradigm: a temporal gap limiting timely predictions and a semantic gap reducing adaptability to diverse downstream tasks. \nA potential solution is applying the ``pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, yet existing static graph prompting methods fail to address the time-sensitive dynamics of TIGs and have a deficiency in expressive power. \nTo tackle these issues, we propose **Temporal Interaction Graph Prompting (TIGPrompt)**, a versatile framework that bridges the temporal and semantic gaps by integrating with existing TIG models. Specifically, we propose a \"pre-train, prompt\" training paradigm for TIGs, with a temporal prompt generator to offer temporally-aware prompts for different tasks. To cater to varying computational resource demands, we propose an extended \"pre-train, prompt-based fine-tune\" paradigm, offering greater flexibility. \nThrough extensive experiments involving multiple benchmarks, representative TIG models, and downstream tasks, our TIGPrompt demonstrates the SOTA performance and remarkable efficiency advantages.

The authors show that the TIGPrompt can improve baseline performances across a variety of TGNNs on both link and node tasks."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I believe the current work has the following weakness:\n- **limited evaluation metrics**: the link prediction experiments rely primarily on Average Precision (AP), whereas more robust ranking-based metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) have been extensively adapted in prior work such as TGB[1] and ROLAND[2]\nwould provide a fairer and more direct reflection of the improvement of TIGPrompt which leads me to the next weakness. \n\n- **performance saturation**: the main problem of the AP / binary classification evaluation lies in its over-inflated performances. \nThis saturation makes it difficult to assess whether TIGPrompt provides substantial practical improvements or merely marginal gains within an already near-perfect range. For example,  on Wikipedia, DyGformer improvement in baseline is 99.03 and the improvement Projection TProG is 99.80, this is hardly convincing as the evaluation is simply too easy and the task with this evaluation is already solved. This is even worse when considering Table 2 where only 20% of data is used for training and most models can solve the tasks with > 95% AP on two out of the four datasets. \n\n- **unclear dataset transferability**: the main appeal of prompt learning is its ability to adapt to new datasets. From the provided results, it seems TIGPrompt mainly focus on improving task transferability on the same dataset yet it is still required that the model is trained and tested on the same dataset. It is unclear how TIGPrompt might be used to facilitate transfer to new datasets, for example, pre-train on Wikipedia and then transfer to Reddit.  \n\nSuggestion: my main suggestion for the author is to provide new results with MRR or other ranking metrics that at least require the model to rank across many potential negative destinations. This will enable the demonstration of potentially more significant empirical gain of TIGPrompt and strengthen its significance. The near perfect performance of AP is not a good indicator for good performance as the task is too easy. \n\n[1] Huang S, Poursafaei F, Danovitch J, Fey M, Hu W, Rossi E, Leskovec J, Bronstein M, Rabusseau G, Rabbany R.

Given that the community has already built upon and compared against this method (e.g., DygPrompt, ICLR 2025), in my opinion the contribution is no longer timely for ICLR 2026, despite being well executed. This would not be so much of an issue, if the experiment and related work section was updated, and compared to the works that have been introduced since then.\n\n## 2. missing discussion and comparison to related work\n* Since the arXiv release of Prompt Learning on Temporal Interaction Graphs (March 2024), other research has already extended this work: The most important one is Node-Time Conditional Prompt Learning in Dynamic Graphs (DygPrompt, ICLR 2025). \n* DygPrompt explicitly positions itself as an improvement over TIGPrompt, arguing that \n>While [TIGPrompt] employs time-aware prompts, it lacks fine-grained node-time characterization and is thus unable to capture\ncomplex node-time patterns, where nodes and time mutually influence each other.  DygPrompt explicitly conditions prompts on both node identity and temporal context.\n\n* In their paper and review discussions, the DygPrompt authors benchmarked their model against TIGPrompt. Because TIGPrompt’s code was not publicly available at the time, they reimplemented it and evaluated both methods on the same datasets. Their results show consistent improvements for DygPrompt, and they also introduced a more challenging low-resource evaluation protocol (see below).\n* Given that DygPrompt explicitly positions itself as an improvement over TIGPrompt and has been publicly peer-reviewed at ICLR 2025, it now represents the de-facto state of the art in prompt learning for temporal graphs. \n* The present submission does not mention DygPrompt, reproduce its evaluation setup, or provide any updated comparison, which substantially weakens its novelty and relevance for ICLR 2026.\n\n## 3. potentially outdated evaluation\n* The authors in DygPrompt state in their ICLR 2025 rebuttal the following:\n>TIGPrompt [4] uses \"50% of the data for pre-training and 20% for prompt tuning or fine-tuning, with the remaining 30% equally divided for validation and testing.\" (see Section 4.2 of TIGPrompt). Note that pre-training data do not require any labeled examples, while prompt-tuning/fine-tuning data require labels for node classification. Hence, TIGPrompt requires 20% labeled data for node classification. In our experiments, we use 80% of the data for pre-training (which does not contain any labels for node classification), but only 1% of the data serves as the training pool for prompt tuning, with each task leveraging only 30 events (about 0.01% of the entire dataset) for prompt tuning (where only the starting nodes in these events are labeled for node classification). Therefore, our setting focuses on the more challenging low-resource scenario with very few labeled data, as labeled data are generally difficult or costly to obtain in real-world applications [1,3,5]. Hence, our setting is more practical and challenging than TIGPrompt's.```\n* I agree with this critique. Using only 1% of labeled data for prompt tuning is indeed a more realistic and demanding setting than TIGPrompt’s 20%.\n* Therefore, I believe TIGPrompt’s current evaluation protocol is outdated.\n* It would be valuable to hear the authors’ thoughts on whether they have tested TIGPrompt under such low-data conditions, and what their opinion on this setup is.\n\n## Overall \nOverall, the paper is well structured and clearly written, but it is mostly identical to its 2024 arxiv version without incorporating developments that have occurred since then. \nBecause the authors have not updated or engaged with newer work, especially DygPrompt, the contribution feels dated and this leads to limited relevance for ICLR 2026.

The paper claims to be the \"first attempt\" at prompting for TIGs, but without direct empirical comparison to the concurrent DyGPrompt (whose code is unavailable), the claim of \"first\" is hard to verify, and the method's positioning relative to related work remains somewhat unclear. In addition, there are existing studies on snapshot-based dynamic graphs [1], which should be discussed more thoroughly.\n2. The main novelty of this paper is applying prompting to TIGs to address temporal gaps in distant inference data and semantic gaps in multi-task learning. However, in real-world applications, it is worth questioning whether the extra effort of using prompting is truly more efficient than retraining or incrementally updating the model with new data. Prompting offers an incremental gain, while regular and necessary model updates may lead to more substantial improvements.\n3. The proposed TProG framework relies on standard components such as learnable vectors, Transformers, and MLPs, which limits its algorithmic novelty and makes the contribution mostly incremental. Moreover, beyond empirical results, there is no theoretical explanation for why prompt fusion helps reduce the gaps, which somewhat weakens the depth of the analysis.\n4. Although Section 3.2 explains the experimental setup, the difference in total training data used (50%+20% in this work vs 70% in prior related work) still raises concerns about potential unfairness in the comparison.\n5. As noted in Appendix J, \"we may need to conduct additional experiments to determine which TProG variant works better.\" It would be helpful if the authors could provide clearer guidance on how to choose among TProG variants for new datasets or models, along with more analysis of the tradeoffs between computational cost and performance across the variants.\n\nReference\n\n[1] ProST: Prompt Future Snapshot on Dynamic Graphs for Spatio-Temporal Prediction https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3690624.3709273"}, "questions": {"value": "Please see weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "8ElrMQpslr", "forum": "bJetbxYtRM", "replyto": "bJetbxYtRM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5531/Reviewer_sucX"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5531/Reviewer_sucX"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5531/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761570700248, "cdate": 1761570700248, "tmdate": 1762918113552, "mdate": 1762918113552, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a novel paradigm for temporal graph learning, namely the \"pre-train, prompt\" framework, to systematically address two challenges of existing temporal graph models: temporal graph gap, where model performance degrades on temporally distant inference data; and semantic gap, where the model performs worse on a downstream task that is different from the task used in training.
