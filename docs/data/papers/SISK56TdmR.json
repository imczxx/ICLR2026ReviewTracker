While open-set detection methods aim to address this by identifying such instances as *Unknown*, this is often insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an *Unknown Animal* (requiring an urgent stop) versus *Unknown Debris* (requiring a safe lane change) is far more useful than just *Unknown* in autonomous driving. To bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to 29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive performance in both unknown recall and known mAP.

Unlike conventional OWOD methods that label all novel objects as a single “Unknown” class, TARO leverages a semantic hierarchy to assign unknown objects to meaningful coarse-grained parent categories (e.g., “Unknown Vehicle” or “Unknown Animal”). Built upon Deformable DETR, TARO introduces three key components: (1) a sparsemax-based objectness head to model competition and sparsity among object queries; (2) a hierarchy-aware classification activation that enforces parent–child consistency via learnable coupling parameters; and (3) a hierarchy-guided relabeling strategy that uses non-leaf node confidences to provide auxiliary supervision for objectness. Experiments show that TARO achieves high unknown recall (U-R), low absolute open-set error (AOSE), and reports a new metric, hierarchy accuracy (HAcc), reaching up to 29.9% on the OWOD split."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "The main strength of this work lies in its redefinition of the OWOD task: instead of treating all unknowns uniformly, TARO enables semantically meaningful categorization of novel objects into coarse parent classes, which is highly valuable in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. The proposed components, sparsemax-based objectness modeling, adaptive hierarchical coupling, and hierarchy-guided relabeling, are well-motivated and collectively address key challenges in semantic generalization under open-world settings."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Limited generalization due to semantic coverage in training: The reported HAcc drops dramatically to ~5% on the OW-DETR split (referred to in the manuscript as a more challenging benchmark), compared to 29.9% on the OWOD split. This is because the OW-DETR split groups semantically similar classes (e.g., all animals) into the same task, preventing the model from ever observing certain parent categories (e.g., “Food”) during training. Consequently, TARO cannot meaningfully categorize unknowns from unseen branches of the hierarchy, revealing a strong dependence on the specific task partitioning and limited true open-world generalization.\n- Disproportionate complexity versus performance gain: TARO introduces multiple novel components (sparsemax objectness head, hierarchical activation, relabeling mechanism), yet its known-class mAP consistently lags behind strong baselines such as RandBox and ALLOW-DETR across multiple tasks. While it improves U-R and reduces AOSE, this trade-off—sacrificing known detection accuracy for better unknown recall—may not be acceptable in real-world systems where both capabilities are critical. The marginal gains do not sufficiently justify the added architectural complexity.\n- Evaluation bias in HAcc: HAcc is computed only over detected unknown objects, ignoring the large number of missed detections (i.e., low U-R). When U-R is low, HAcc is evaluated on a highly selective subset of “easy” unknowns, potentially inflating the perceived hierarchical reasoning ability. Moreover, the stark discrepancy in HAcc between benchmarks (29.9% vs. 5%) undermines the reliability and comparability of this metric, weakening the paper’s main claim.\n- Lack of comparison with recent OWOD and foundation-model-based approaches: The paper does not compare against recent methods that leverage large vision-language models (e.g., CLIP, SAM) or other open-vocabulary detectors[1, 2, 3]. Given the rapid progress in this area, it is essential to position TARO relative to both traditional OWOD methods and modern foundation-model-based alternatives. Without such comparisons, the claimed advantages of TARO remain unsubstantiated.\n\n[1] ktcn: enhancing open-world object detection with knowledge transfer and class-awareness neutralization\n\n[2] Recalling Unknowns Without Losing Precision: An Effective Solution to Large Model-Guided Open World Object Detection\n\n[3] Exploring Orthogonality in Open World Object Detection"}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "j2S42MF28Z", "forum": "SISK56TdmR", "replyto": "SISK56TdmR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16712/Reviewer_Ec8L"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16712/Reviewer_Ec8L"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16712/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761569953960, "cdate": 1761569953960, "tmdate": 1762926764292, "mdate": 1762926764292, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes TARO, a framework for open-world object detection that introduces a hierarchical, semantically aware treatment of unknown categories.

TARO not only identifies novel objects but also groups them into meaningful coarse-grained categories. This capability is highly practical for real-world settings like autonomous driving and aligns more closely with how humans handle novel items.\n- **A Well-Integrated Architecture:** The architecture cleverly synthesizes three key components : a sparsemax-based objectness head to manage query competition ; a hierarchy-aware activation (with a learnable strength parameter) to enforce parent-child consistency ; and a hierarchy-guided relabeling strategy to provide auxiliary supervision.\n- **Thorough Empirical Evaluation:** The experimental section is robust, comparing TARO against strong baselines based on both DETR and Faster R-CNN .

While the integration of sparsemax, hierarchical awareness, and relabeling is well-motivated , these individual components are already known in the field. The contribution is more about a careful and effective combination rather than a new algorithmic discovery.\n2. **Hierarchy and Dataset Limitations:** The model is constrained by its fixed, hand-defined taxonomy. The hierarchy used is based on COCO/VOC and is only moderately sized. This is a poor fit for real-world applications like autonomous driving, which need to handle much larger or more fluid taxonomies. The paper acknowledges this  but doesn't offer a practical way to scale the method or adapt it to evolving hierarchies.\n3. **Incomplete Justification for Sparsemax:** The reasoning for using sparsemax feels incomplete. While the ideas of competition and sparsity make sense , the ablation study (Table 3) doesn't show a massive performance win. The paper only compares it to a standard softmax, which is arguably a weak baseline. Other obvious alternatives, like focal loss or top-k activations, aren't discussed, making it hard to be sure if sparsemax is truly the best choice.\n4. **Limited Qualitative Results and Scalability:** The qualitative results are limited and don't address scalability. The figures (Fig. 3 & 4) show only a few selected examples. This makes it hard to judge how robust the categorization really is, especially for ambiguous objects.

Could you add them, and do you expect TARO’s hierarchical approach to outperform such models for coarse-level categorization?\n3. **Robustness Analysis:** How sensitive is TARO to (a) the taxonomy structure (e.g., deeper trees or more overlapping parent nodes), (b) thresholding choices in relabeling, and (c) the initial value/range for $\\alpha_c$?
