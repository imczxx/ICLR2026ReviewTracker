The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy across a majority of environments and parameter settings.", "tldr": "Enhancement to state-of-the art abstraction MCTS-based abstraction algorithms but using intra-abstraction policies", "keywords": ["Artificial intelligence", "Sequential decision-making", "Abstractions", "MCTS"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d12e924af19a45db09396cb8aa2ca96c8c9b0d5b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a MCTS variant algorithm where state-action space is employed to help the MCTS run more efficiently.

The paper contains very little theoretical analysis and relies on its empirical arguments to convince the reader.

To be specific are we referring to the optimal real action leading to the real state, or the optimal abstraction of the root action.\n\n- To follow up on Theorem 1, would this apply to all nodes, or only specifically the root node? And is there any intuition behind this.\n\n- Consider Eq. 5 as the state-action abstraction criteria. Could we not say that if \\epsilon becomes big enough, all states and actions can be grouped together. We would then consider this a bandit problem then correct? What is the trade-off here? Intuitively I would assume that as we start group state-action pairs together, we lose expressiveness of the policy, which could lead to higher variance in the final reward trajectory or variance in policy, is this considered in the paper's ablation study or theoretical analysis?\n\n- w.r.t. to the environments, is there any information about how big the state action space is, and how the abstraction reduced the search space (and the corresponding trade-offs)?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ehERLB57YP", "forum": "6oD0DEFa4g", "replyto": "6oD0DEFa4g", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19081/Reviewer_BJ4r"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19081/Reviewer_BJ4r"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19081/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761924787172, "cdate": 1761924787172, "tmdate": 1762931105019, "mdate": 1762931105019, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses an issue in those Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods that use abstraction algorithms to reduce the search space, such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA).

Based on this framework, the authors propose and empirically evaluate seven alternative \"intra-abstraction policies\", demonstrating that this tiebreaking scenario is a frequent occurrence and not an edge case.

This is not a novel contribution. Their frameworks appears to be simply restating bisimilarity and bisumlation metrics. Furthermore, they do not actually use their framework for anything --- they describe it but then don't show how it's useful, or what insights can be gleaned using it, nor do they use it for the rest of paper.\n    - The second half of the paper is about how actions can be selected from within an abstracted action. That is, when a number of actions are abstracted away, and that abstracted action is selected, how does one selected one of the constituent actions. The paper looks at several selection methods to do so. This is also not a significant contribution. The authors do not propose any new selection policy. The authors conclude that UCT is a better selection method than random, greedy, or least visits. However, the results do not support this claim (see further).\n\n- The results do not support the conclusions made by the author. Figure 2 lacks any confidence intervals over the expected results. The performance of the different policies are close enough that without any confidence intervals, I cannot tell if any of the differences are significant. The authors also claim that Figure 3 shows that UCT performs better than random. This is completely false. In all the environments, over all the iterations, UCT is significantly better than random on only two points. Otherwise, there is no difference in performance.\n\n- The paper is poorly written.
