Because real-world data are often imperfect, non-additive frameworks, such as evidential clustering, grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory, explicitly handle uncertainty and imprecision. These frameworks are particularly well suited to high-stakes decisions, which tend to require both interpretability and cautiousness. However, while decision-tree surrogates have enabled transparent explanations for hard clustering, explainability for evidential clustering remains largely unexplored. We address this gap by formalizing representativeness, a utility-based criterion that captures decision-makers' preferences over explanation misassignments, and introducing evidential mistakeness, a loss function tailored to credal partitions. Building on these foundations, we propose the Iterative Evidential Mistakeness Minimization (IEMM) algorithm, which learns decision-tree explainers for evidential clustering by optimizing representativeness under uncertainty and imprecision. We provide theoretical conditions for effective explanations in both hard and evidential settings and show how utility parameters can be set to reflect different decision attitudes. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IEMM improves the performance of existing methods by producing representative and preference-aligned explanations of evidential clusterings, supporting cautious, transparent analysis in the presence of imperfect data.", "tldr": "We developed a framework for understanding cautious explanations and their desirable properties; We proposed an interpretable and cautious algorithm for explaining evidential clustering.", "keywords": ["Explainability", "Cautiousness", "Unsupervised Classification", "Evidential Clustering", "Decision Trees", "Interpretable AI", "XAI"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/06d7085e16f33bf1b9da44b4fe3057d639cd0de3.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4e5ccf7da4a59c64df20b16ca483bdbaae4a5df2.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces Explainable Evidential Clustering, a framework that extends decision-tree–based explanations to clustering models that account for uncertainty.

The DSClustering paper (Hovhannisyan, 2025) recently proposed a system that also leverages Dempster–Shafer theory to generate interpretable, rule-based cluster descriptions and to communicate uncertainty to end users. Given this development, the authors of the current submission risk slightly overstating the claim that “no one has addressed interpretability in evidential clustering.” While their approach remains distinct, the paper should avoid implying exclusivity in combining Dempster–Shafer reasoning with interpretability. Instead, the authors should explicitly acknowledge DSClustering as a concurrent but methodologically different effort, emphasizing that their work addresses the post-hoc explanation of existing evidential clusterings.\n\n2. The experiments rely only on small, low-dimensional tabular datasets (Iris, Wine, Diabetes). The absence of high-dimensional, noisy, or real-world examples (e.g., medical or industrial data) limits the demonstration of scalability and generality. Similarly, the baseline (IMM with collapsed labels) cannot express ambiguous metaclusters, making IEMM’s superiority somewhat tautological under the chosen utility. Including stronger baselines, such as CART-style trees trained to maximize expected utility directly, or rule-based interpretable evidential clustering methods, would provide a more compelling comparison.\n\n3. The introduction of a stakeholder-specific utility function U(A,B) is conceptually strong and central to the paper’s stakeholder-aligned framing. However, the paper does not specify how this utility is to be elicited, parameterized, or grounded in user preferences. In practice, different stakeholders, such as clinicians, regulators, or engineers, may have distinct preferences and tolerance levels for ambiguity or misclassification.\n\n4. The exposition in Sections 3–4 is dense and symbol-heavy, which obscures the paper’s otherwise logically theoretical structure. Definitions of representativeness and evidential mistakeness are presented abstractly before any motivating examples, forcing readers to decode complex notation (mass functions, focal sets, utilities) without an intuitive grounding. This could be improved by introducing a running toy example early in the section, visually showing how cautious explanations evolve with different parameters before formal derivations.

The setup is the following: Given a dataset and its (hard) cluster assignments, can we find an axis-aligned partition of the data that has competitive performance to the original clustering. This line work started with the IMM algorithm (Moshkovitz et al, 2020), and there has been multiple extensions of the problem setting and methods, but the main focus of this line of work has been on the theoretical guarantees (the so-called price of explainability, and its variations).\n\nThe present paper generalises the problem and IMM algorithms to the setting of evidential clustering. In evidential clustering, each data instance is mapped to a probability mass function over the power set of all clusters. This generalises hard clustering, Bayesian clustering (where only singleton clusters have non-zero probabilities), and categorical clustering (where each data is mapped to a single subset of clusters), as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nIn explainable evidential clustering (as posed in the present work), one is given a data set and corresponding mass functions and the goal is to find axis-aligned decision tree based partition of the data such that each data is mapped to a subset of clusters. The authors propose a generalised notion of mistakes, using the mass functions, and extend the IMM algorithm of Moshkovitz et al to obtain an IEMM algorithm, which they empirically evaluate on Gaussian mixtures and few small UCI datasets."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The evidential clustering framework is quite interesting, which I believe already provides more interpretability than hard clustering (since the mass function encodes relevant uncertainty in the clusters). The problem of fitting axis-aligned decision trees provides an additional layer of explainability to the problem. \n\nThe problem of explainable evidential clustering is also mathematically interesting (at least to those working on explainable clustering) because the criteria from clustering changes from k-means/k-median cost to a more complex setting, where the uncertainty information/mass functions are available."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The main drawback of the paper is that the problem is not well-formulated. A few important missing pieces are noted below\n- The paper proposes IEMM as an approach for explainable evidential clustering without precisely stating the problem (that is, what do we want to minimise while ensuring explainability). One can contrast this with IMM and the corresponding line of work, where the explainable k-means clustering is posed as a problem of achieving low k-means cost while ensuring explainability. As a result IEMM is a heuristic that does not precisely minimise a well-defined loss. This is of the same flavour as hierarchical clustering heuristics, which did not have any sound theoretical basis until Dasgupta's seminal works in 2010s.\n- A natural consequence of above is that there are no theoretical guarantees for the proposed IEMM algorithm, which is in contrast to all existing works on explainable clustering that I am aware of. The appendix includes some theoretical results on representativeness, but they do not provide any formal guarantees on the performance of IEMM.\n- More fundamentally, the IEMM takes mass functions as input for each data point, but returns only a subset of clusters and not a mass function. Hence, there is loss of information after one approximates the evidential clusters for decision trees (in other words, this method does not seem relevant for explainable Bayesian clustering).\n- The experiments are too limited and focus only on simple data, where explainability does not have any consequence. I would be fine with limited experiments if there was strong theoretical contribution. In particular, the explainable clustering literature has been primarily of theoretical interest (with limited use in practice). However, without a strong theory, the paper needs to demonstrate the practical impact of such an approach, where explaining clusters with axis-aligned trees would matter.\n- The overall presentation is quite poor, and not written for a general machine learning audience. A large number of concepts are introduced, but not used much in the paper. This makes the paper quite hard to read. I believe the presentation can be significantly simplified by making it more direct. For example, I feel the notion of representativeness is presented in a quite complicated way, making it too formal to even understand how it is useful. The same can be said about the setup, where one can get a better idea only after reading the appendix."}, "questions": {"value": "There are no specific questions.
