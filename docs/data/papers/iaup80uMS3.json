Existing  systems typically use Hierarchical Manager-Worker (HMW) structures or Router-based Message Passing (RMP) as their communication protocol to coordinate work. However, they can be restricted due to communication ineffectiveness, since agents cannot directly consult specific colleagues or operate beyond assigned subtasks, and misrouted messages can propagate errors.  \nInspired by bus communication systems in computer systems, we propose BusMA, a bus communication MA framework that allows any agent to address specific peers. Our framework comprises a Chair agent, Worker agents, and a communication bus. Worker agents perform multi-step reason–act–call interactions, enabling targeted requests for help or critique, with the Chair agent synthesizing insights from all agents' communications while adding its own reasoning to produce coherent solutions. The communication bus routes addressable messages and executes requests. Across two frontier LLMs and benchmarks spanning diverse domains, including image understanding, mathematics, and knowledge-based tasks, as well as GAIA with tasks of varied complexity, BusMA consistently achieves the best results, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-agent communication approaches (HMW and RMP-based methods). \nAnonymous code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Bus-MA-370E.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["LLM Agent", "Multi Agents"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6cb1461f86df0c37de881a959a77acc651239c9f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a multi-agent framework BusMA inspired by the bus communication in computer systems.

While the central metaphor of a \"bus communication system\" from computer architecture is an intriguing framing, its implementation within the proposed framework appears simplistic: worker agents engage in peer-to-peer communication through a communication bus, and a central chair agent synthesizes the final output. Moreover, it doesn't fully escape the centralized MA design it aims to critique. The heavy reliance on the \"chair agent\" for both initial task distribution to worker agents and final information synthesis firmly establishes it as a central coordinator.\n- The second claimed contribution, the multi-level insight generation (low, mid, high), seems limited. This hierarchy appears to be more of a descriptive framework that relabels inherent reasoning processes within a multi-agent workflow, rather than a substantive new mechanism. Specifically, the insights from low to high only correspond to the reasoning of different agents and actions, whose contribution to the framework's overall performance feels overstated.\n- The experimental validation for the framework's superiority could be strengthened. While BusMA outperforms the selected baselines, its overall GAIA score of 48.5 remains modest compared to other state-of-the-art works such as Youtu-Agent, AWorld, etc. Moreover, this paper lacks ablation studies to isolate the source of performance gains.

The “bus” mechanism does not fundamentally change the communication topology—it is effectively a centralized message dispatcher. Therefore, BusMA inherits the same scalability and single-point failure issues as prior centralized coordination frameworks (e.g., AutoGen, AgentVerse), without providing new coordination semantics or efficiency guarantees.\n2. The framework lacks a formal communication protocol or optimization objective. Message scheduling and content selection are fully prompt-driven, without any learnable or rule-based coordination mechanism. This limits BusMA’s theoretical grounding and scalability to complex multi-agent interactions.\n3. The framework assumes a shared global state but does not specify consistency guarantees or synchronization mechanisms. In concurrent update scenarios, BusMA may suffer from non-deterministic state overwriting, undermining the reproducibility of multi-agent interactions.\n4. The interaction quality and final task success are highly sensitive to the design of individual agent prompts. However, the paper neither unifies nor ablates prompt templates across baselines, making it unclear whether BusMA’s gains originate from the architecture or improved prompt engineering.\n5. Although the authors claim that the bus improves scalability, no empirical or analytical study is provided on communication latency or bandwidth usage. In fact, the bus architecture introduces a centralized broadcast mechanism with O(N) message complexity, which may limit scalability when the number of agents increases.\n6. The bus is treated as a passive communication layer rather than an active reasoning component. Without any aggregation, attention, or reasoning objective tied to bus interactions, it remains unclear how the bus itself contributes to reasoning quality beyond facilitating message passing."}, "questions": {"value": "-"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "liRUN7CDmN", "forum": "iaup80uMS3", "replyto": "iaup80uMS3", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19070/Reviewer_HXvG"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19070/Reviewer_HXvG"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19070/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761921026974, "cdate": 1761921026974, "tmdate": 1762931096250, "mdate": 1762931096250, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces BusMA, a novel multi-agent communication framework inspired by the \"bus\" concept in computer architecture.

While the \"bus\" metaphor is engaging, the implementation appears more akin to a shared memory or a message queue that supports addressable communication. The framework does not seem to incorporate more fundamental mechanisms of bus architecture, such as arbitration, congestion control, or priority scheduling. Furthermore, the supported point-to-point communication types (e.g., discussions, challenges) could, in theory, be emulated by enhancing a single agent's reflection or chain-of-thought capabilities. Consequently, this work feels more like a sophisticated engineering implementation with a compelling narrative rather than a fundamental conceptual breakthrough.\n2) Potential for Unfair Experimental Comparisons:\n- The experiments were conducted using only two models (DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-2.5-Flash), which raises questions about the generalizability of the findings to other models, particularly those of varying sizes.\n- I have noted that in other publicly available reports (e.g., the Tongyi DeepResearch Technical Report), some baseline models (such as OpendeepResearch) have achieved significantly higher scores on the GAIA benchmark than those reported in this paper. This discrepancy raises concerns about the specific details and reproducibility of the experimental setup.\n3) Superficial Analysis: The paper effectively demonstrates that BusMA performs well but falls short of explaining why. The absence of necessary ablation studies makes it difficult to ascertain the individual contributions of each component, such as the three-tiered insight mechanism and the four distinct communication types. It remains unclear whether the performance gains stem from more efficient collaboration or simply from the increased number of LLM calls and implicit opportunities for reflection that communication entails.\n4) Overlooking Core Limitations: In the discussion section, the paper acknowledges the risk that \"Workers may provide incorrect information, thus misleading the Chair.\" However, this is a critical vulnerability in such communication systems. The authors have not proposed any mechanisms to mitigate this issue, such as confidence scoring, voting, or information verification. This omission significantly undermines the robustness of the framework."}, "questions": {"value": "1) Innovation: Beyond address-based routing, in what other ways does BusMA genuinely borrow from and implement the core principles of traditional bus architectures (e.g., arbitration, congestion control)? How would you counter the argument that \"simulating critical discussions among multiple agents could be achieved by enhancing the reflective capabilities of a single agent,\" and what are the fundamental advantages of BusMA in comparison to such an approach?\n2) Experimental Fairness: Could you provide a more equitable experimental setup where all methods are compared under the same total number of LLM calls or inference tokens? This would help to demonstrate that the performance improvements are a direct result of communication efficiency rather than a computational advantage. How do you account for the significant discrepancies between the baseline results reported in your paper and those available in other public reports?\n3) Analytical Depth: Do you plan to conduct ablation experiments to quantify the specific contributions of the different communication types and the three-level insight mechanism to the final performance? In your view, what is the single most critical factor contributing to BusMA's success?\n4) Robustness: Have you considered or designed any specific mechanisms to defend against the risk of misinformation propagation that you identified?
