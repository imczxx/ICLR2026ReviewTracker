Our contributions are threefold: (1) We theoretically characterize the fundamental exploration-execution trade-off. We prove that CoT's discrete, symbolic nature forces it into a high-certainty regime, guaranteeing computational fidelity but causing premature commitment that cripples exploration. Conversely, we show that Latent CoT's continuous representation enables robust exploration but is also the direct cause of its failure on computational tasks by amplifying noise. (2) We introduce the Symbolic Index—a measure of a model's decisional certainty—as the core mechanism governing this trade-off. Our unified framework proves that this single, quantifiable metric causally explains the contrasting behaviors of both paradigms, offering a principled way to analyze and design reasoning systems. (3) We prove that curriculum learning is a theoretically grounded and necessary method for training Latent CoT models. We show that without it, training is guaranteed to fail due to a fundamental distributional mismatch, confirming that the staged approach is essential for convergence. This work provides concrete design principles for next-generation reasoning architectures, suggesting a shift from a binary choice between architectures to designing adaptive systems that can dynamically regulate their decisional certainty.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["latent reasoning", "chain of thoughts", "continuous chain of thoughts", "information bottleneck", "interpretability"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6d6b1a887d2b368e34382304e474c2500d519358.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper offers a theoretical framework to explain the performance discrepancy between explicit CoT reasoning and latent CoT reasoning.

The interesting point, in my view, lies in Section 4.4, where the authors leverage the symbolic index to unify the exploration–execution trade-off; however, the work lacks crucial experiments to verify that employing this index can effectively lead to a well-trained model.\n\n3. The authors have placed all three main contributions into Section 4, which makes the section feel overcrowded and compact, and the overall logic is not very smooth.

To understand this better, I would suggest that an additional analysis of the symbolic index against the performance drop may provide more clear insights. Also a direct comparison analysis of ProsQA on CoT vs Latent CoT would help to draw more robust conclusions.\n    - Overall, Section 4 and Section 5 would benefit from improved alignment, i.e. targeted experiments that support the theoretical analyses on practically relevant examples.\n- The paper lacks a critical and transparent discussion of the methodology alongside limitations of their theoretical and empirical analyses."}, "questions": {"value": "- The authors write that the Coconat approach “effectively provides supervised samples of latent thoughts that are grounded in correct reasoning steps.” (l. 385-386).
