However, non-human antibodies can provoke anti-antibody immune responses, prompting the development of humanization strategies to reduce immunogenicity. Most existing approaches focus primarily on improving humanness scores from a sequence perspective,  often overlooking the structural stability of humanized antibodies, which is essential for preserving complementarity-determining region (CDR) conformations. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hu-MCTs, a two-stage framework comprising (1) a pretraining phase that learns latent representations of human antibody sequences, and (2) a humanization phase that optimizes murine sequences toward human-like sequences using a novel black-box optimization algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. This algorithm jointly considers humanness and structural integrity,  particularly minimizing disruption to CDR conformations. Experimental results demonstrate that Hu-MCTs outperforms baseline methods by achieving higher humanness scores while better preserving CDR structural stability. Moreover, the generated sequences exhibit the highest biological plausibility scores, closely resembling natural antibodies. These results suggest that Hu-MCTs is an effective solution for humanizing antibodies while preserving key structural features for functionality.", "tldr": "In this work, we humanize antibodies using a novel black-box optimization algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search.", "keywords": ["humanization", "antibody design"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/58ea651d05f1d82e451e855942a13feb53453968.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a pipeline that combines PLM-guided initialization, CVAE-based generation, MCTS global search, and CMA-ES local optimization for antibody humanization.

Lack of true functional validation: While structural preservation (RMSD) is measured, there is no assessment of antigen-binding affinity or neutralization activity—the ultimate functional criterion. Without this, claims about “preserving functionality” remain speculative. Even CUMAb uses Rosetta energy minimization as a proxy; Hu-MCTs relies solely on geometric similarity.\n\n2. Questionable reward formulation: The reward is defined as Reward(z)=α⋅Shuman−β⋅Sstab . However, the paper does not justify the choice of linear combination or hyperparameters α,β . This risks arbitrary trade-offs—e.g., the ablation shows humanness increases when structural terms are removed, suggesting the current weighting may be suboptimal or masking a fundamental tension.\n\n3. Computational cost vs. practical utility: At ~50 minutes per antibody (vs. seconds for Sapiens/Humatch), Hu-MCTs is unlikely to scale to high-throughput settings. The paper does not discuss whether the marginal gains in humanness/structure justify this cost, especially since wet-lab validation would still be required.\n\n4. Overstated novelty: MCTS for black-box molecular optimization has been used before (e.g., Yang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022, cited by the authors). The application to antibody humanization is new, but the core algorithmic components are repurposed rather than fundamentally reimagined.\n\n5.

Could the method support user-defined trade-offs (e.g., prioritize structure over humanness for difficult targets)?\n\n3.

Could faster structure proxies (e.g., geometric constraints, distance maps) reduce cost without sacrificing fidelity?\n\n4. Coudl you add the comparison with HuDiff?\n\n5. Failure cases: Are there examples where Hu-MCTs fails to preserve CDR structure despite high humanness? Understanding failure modes would clarify limitations.\n\n6.
