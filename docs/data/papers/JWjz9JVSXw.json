Mixed-precision search is a prominent bit allocation method based on neural architecture search (NAS) that has been shown to significantly reduce the DNN footprint while preserving the accuracy of the model by allocating bits to each layers based on their quantization sensitivity. However, mixed-precision search is often defined as a dual optimization problem handled with a single heuristic objective function, which does not provide strong guarantees of the resulting compression rate. We propose a post-training reformulation of mixed precision search as an explicit constrained optimization problem, solved using interior-point methods within a framework based on NAS. Our method requires minimal calibration data, as few as 128 samples, in a post-training setting. We corroborate this approach with experiments that span multiple transformer architectures with up to 4 billion parameters, using the MXFP family of data formats. We show that this constrained formulation provides users with higher resolution over compression rates, and we show that explicitly satisfying hardware budgets while optimizing for accuracy can outperform uniform allocation methods, improving performance by up to several standard deviations over the uniform baselines.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Neural Networks", "Quantization", "Mixed Precision", "Post Training", "Transformers", "LLMs", "Large Language Models", "Hardware", "GPU", "Data Formats", "Bit Allocation", "FP32", "MXFP", "BFP", "MXINT", "GPU", "TPU", "AI Accelerators"], "primary_area": "infrastructure, software libraries, hardware, systems, etc.", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/28ecc67b798990027f8e4054096efa94e2e86c22.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a differenciable NAS algorithm for data format allocation in a network.

The authors didn't provide any quantization details, including the uniform quantization baselines. In the llm quantization literature, many high performance PTQ methods are proposed. What's the performance advantages over these methods? How the proposed CMPS can be combined with these techniques? Moreover, the authors only compared with uniform quantization baselines, the comparison with previous mixed-precision methods are missing.\n4. In several places, it says \"hardware-constrained bit allocation\", however, only \"total model size in bits\" is modeled during the optimization. Moreover, only two bit levels are explored in the bit allocation (MXFP4 and MXPF8).\n5. In the experiments part, previous methods commonly use wiki2 for calibration in addition to C4. For zero-shot scenario, only one task of LAMBADA is evaluated, which is clearly not enough. The largest model used is 3B, experiments on larger models or architectures like MoEs are also needed.\n6. In the limitations, regarding the statement \"the memory required to hold activations or gradients for multiple low-bit options might still be comparable to, or less than, holding a single higher-precision (e.g., FP16 or BF16) baseline tensor\", more careful and precise expression should be used. Many PTQ methods do not need to store all activations, and the gradients are not needed. However, in CMPS, full-precision activations of all layers and gradients are needed, which expands the memory usage. If these tensors (activations and gradients) can be stored in low-bit, then the authors should verify it use controlled experiments."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the Weaknesses for further questions."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "MnytU0GO6J", "forum": "JWjz9JVSXw", "replyto": "JWjz9JVSXw", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9349/Reviewer_oKC4"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9349/Reviewer_oKC4"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9349/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761616341174, "cdate": 1761616341174, "tmdate": 1762920975880, "mdate": 1762920975880, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work proposes a new constrained mixed precision search for post training quantization.
