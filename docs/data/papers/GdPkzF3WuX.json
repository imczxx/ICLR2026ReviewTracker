However, their convergence to a minimum has not been theoretically proven. This difficulty mainly arises from the fact that, while traditional convergence analysis prescribes to monotonically decreasing (or constant) learning rates, schedulers opt for rates that often increase and decrease through the training epochs. We aim to bridge this gap by proposing a probabilistic learning rate scheduler (PLRS) that does not conform to the monotonically decreasing condition, while achieving provable convergence guarantees. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate it on deep neural networks across both vision and language tasks, showing competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art learning rate schedulers. Specifically, our experiments include (a) image classification on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K using ResNet, WRN, VGG, and DenseNet architectures, and (b) language model fine-tuning on the SQuAD v1.1 dataset with pretrained BERT.

Typical approaches to address this are learning rate schedules that alternate between large and small values for eta. Past methods are deterministic.

This is reminiscent to simulated annealing in many ways. While simulated annealing attempts to find global optima and this is to provide convergence guarantees to local optima, they are otherwise similar. This should be discussed and relevant results brought to bear.\n2. Why sample eta from a uniform distribution? It would seem to me that, generally, to guarantee convergence, you want an eta at the low end of the distribution. You only need it rarely at the high end to avoid stationary points that are not local minima. So why not sample from a long tailed monotonically decreasing distribution, such as an exponential? That would seem to me to be sufficient to guarantee convergence and may be more general and faster. An interesting question would be what kind of distribution is necessary to guarantee convergence and what the relationship would be between that distribution and speed of convergence.\n3. All optimization methods have some hyperparameters. This one too. For any method (this one too), convergence is guaranteed (and in fact only happens) only for certain hyperparameter values. So, from a practical perspective, no advantage is demonstrated of this method over any other. What one needs to show is some empirical evidence of the following form: it is easier or less error prone to select the hyperparameters for this approach than any others. If a nonexpert user arbitrarily selects l and h are they more likely to just stumble upon ones that lead to (fast) convergence. Are there easy rules of thumb that one can use to select l and h that lead to (fast) convergence.\n4. The empirical experiments don't add much to the paper without (3).\n5. In the black art of deep learning, convergence is not necessarily important or even desirable.

As far as I was able to check, the results reported for the \"smaller\" benchmarks like CIFAR-X are close to actual SOTA for the architectures (for ImageNet, I am not sure, see below).\nThe paper also makes some effort to provide theoretical justifications for convergence guarantees (in particular, concerning avoidance of saddle points).\nThe method also seems to have some merits from an intuitive point of view: Noisy gradients can help with generalization in multiple ways (batch noise creates drift away from non-generalizing local minima, gradient noise can affect margins), so, at least when looked at it from the surface, randomizing step sizes could help in some way."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I should first say that I have not actively worked on convergence analysis for any such numerical scheme; so my opinion is not an expert one. That said, I found the theoretical part less convincing than the practical results. \nFirst of all, a number of strong assumptions have to be made, many of which are not met in the practical examples (ReLU networks employed in VGG or ResNet-Variants are only continuous but do not have any higher-order smoothness properties, and up to the classification layers, rectifier networks are not bounded)\nIt is also my understanding that practical networks are not strongly convex in the stated sense for typical training data but contain degnerate \"valleys\" of constant, locally optimal training loss (which seems to be somewhat related to why they generalize so well). I would assume that stronger assumptions are just a common modeling tool used in related literature; so this might still be a useful modeling assumption even if not fully realistic. In that case, it would be nice to position this pronouncedly as such.\nThen, in the proof sketches (I have not tried to verify the actual proofs in the appendix), it seems to me that these assumptions play a critical role; in particular, in my (maybe superficial understanding) saddle points are escaped because if there is one direction left with an escape gradient, smoothness transfers this into the neighborhood of other points and directions (otherwise, the Hessian-level smoothness would not hold). However, this mechanism could and would not work at all in a non-smooth network with ReLUs; so the model seems to be insufficient to explain the practical success of the method. I was also not able to see where the main idea - randomization - actually brings in its benefits; wouldn't the same arguments also hold for a deterministic scheme with a small but fixed LR?\n\nI would not be surprised that my understaning ist rather incomplete due to limited prior knowledge on these kind of issues, but it would be very helpful to end Section 3 (Theory) with one or two paragraphs tying the theoretical models more closely to effects that one would expect to see and help in a practical scenario.\n\nFinally, concerning the theory part, I had also some issues with the formulation of some of the definitions. It seems to me that some of those only make sense with some implicit assumptions added that are not stated in the text:\n\nDefinition 4 seems to define a saddle point as a point with a negative eigenvalue in the Hessian (due to the constants being arbitrary, no other restrictions would apply for a twice-differentiable function). I would guess that the existence of positive eigenvalues is implied, and constants will later be looked at and judged.\n\nDefinition 6: f posses the strict saddle property at all x if x fullfills... Probably that should be f? But then, how can x be close to a local minimum when we are talking about the whole function? I could not find an interpretation of the text that seemed useful to me.\n\nIn the practical part, I found the results encouraging, but I was a bit surprised about the ImageNet 1-K performance: The original 2016 ResNet Paper by He reports 5.25% top-5 and 20.74% top-1 error, clearly better than Knee and PLRS. While the 2016 paper might have used more epochs, it is still worth discussing SOTA for ImageNet (I consider this benchmark important as it is more realistic; obviously, computational costs might be prohibitive for parameter tuning so that a lower-level baseline is all one can get, but this should be discussed/explained).\n\nOverall, there seems to be some potential, and the parts I am critical of are in an area where I am not very experienced; due to open questions on my side I would for now maintain a slightly skeptical rating at rather low confidence."}, "questions": {"value": "I had some questions about the theoretical part (see above).

The paper states that although cyclic LRs lack theory, they were “shown to be a valid hypothesis owing to the presence of many saddle points (Dauphin et al., 2014).” but as far as I can tell Dauphin et al. identify saddle‑point pathology but they do not validate the cyclic‑LR hypothesis.\n2. The paper claims to be “the first to theoretically prove convergence of SGD with a LR scheduler that does not conform to constant or monotonically decreasing rates” (Sec. 1.2). However, non‑monotone step‑size policies do have some prior theory! For example, the Distance over Gradients (DoG) algorithm of (Ivgi et al., 2023) both increases and decreases the learning rate.\n3. Multiplicative-noise SGD has also been analyzed in existing work (Chen et al., 2025; Jofré & Thompson, 2019, Faw et al., 2023). Beyond establishing saddle point escape, I'm not really sure what's particularly difficult in extending prior analysis here. \n4. The manuscript refers to “cosine‑based cyclic LR scheduler”. But the standard cosine schedule (even with warm restarts) is a decay one and not really cyclic.. Warm restarts change the phase and amplitude, so successive “cycles” do not repeat at the same magnitude (Loshchilov & Hutter 2017).\n5. There is a big difference between \"flactuating\" learning rates in practice (triangular, or cyclical) and the i.i.d. learning rates drawn from a uniform distribution here. The paper mentions \"trustworthy AI\" as a motivation and to not treat optimizers as black boxes, but I am not exactly sure how learning rates drawn uniformly from a certain range help do that, especially when we *do* have analysis for why some learning rate schedules work well already and a theoretically-motivated adaptive learning rate scheme that can increase the lr (Defazio et al., 2023).\n\nRefs:\nDauphin, Y.
