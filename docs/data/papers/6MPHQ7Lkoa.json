However, most existing works primarily focus on static graph construction, ignoring the performance gains and noise reduction benefits of dynamic structure refinement. Meanwhile, generative models such as Energy-based Models (EBMs) are generally unsuitable for discriminative tasks and struggle with large-scale images. Our goal is to introduce a unified generative-discriminative paradigm for dynamically modeling relationships between visual patches, aiming to produce higher-quality representations for improving downstream tasks. Specifically, we propose **D**ecoupled **E**nergy **L**earning (DEL) that defines a joint distribution of sample pairs to approximate the target distribution. It decouples EBMs into energy matching and contrastive learning as a global loss function, which pulls similar pairs closer and pushes dissimilar pairs further apart in the representation space. For implementation, we develop an end-to-end framework, termed **D**ecoupled **EN**ergy learning guided **S**tructure r**E**finement for improving **ViG** (DenseViG). Structure refinement is deployed within ViG architectures in a plug-and-play manner, dynamically adding or pruning edges based on similarity metrics with a relaxation strategy. Theoretical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of DenseViG in processing large datasets through graph operations. Empirical evaluations confirm that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three major benchmarks, achieving 84.3\\% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, 46.4\\% mAP on MS COCO, and 50.9\\% mIoU on ADE20K.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Decoupled Energy‑based Models; Graph Structure Refinement; Vision Graph Neural Networks"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/25deb9b4d58038bc631f97ab07ba56d629b11e94.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents DenseViG (Decoupled ENergy learning guided Structure rEfinement for improving ViG), a method for graph structure refinement within Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs). The work is motivated by the fact that existing ViGs rely on static strategies for graph construction (such as k-nearest neighbors), which lack learnable parameters and prevent end-to-end gradient updates for the graph structure. DenseViG addresses this by introducing a refinement module integrated into each ViG stage, which dynamically modifies the graph structure (adding or removing edges) based on node similarity. This refinement is guided by a Decoupled Energy Learning (DEL) loss function, which draws inspiration from prior work on Energy-based Contrastive Learning for GNNs (Zeng et al., AAAI’25). The DEL paradigm approximates a target distribution by splitting the optimization into two losses: (a) an Energy-Based Model (EBM) loss, a generative approach designed to encourage similar visual patches to cluster together (by minimizing their \"energy\"); and (b) An InfoNCE loss, a contrastive learning component.
