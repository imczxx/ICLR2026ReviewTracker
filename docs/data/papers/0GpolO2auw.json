Such an oracle is an algorithm that, given query access to the adjacency list of a graph $G$, first constructs a compact data structure $\\mathcal{D}$ that captures the clustering structure of $G$. Once built, $\\mathcal{D}$ enables sublinear time responses to \\textsc{WhichCluster}$(G,x)$ queries for any vertex $x$. A major limitation of existing oracles is that constructing $\\mathcal{D}$ requires $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, which becomes a bottleneck for massive graphs and memory-limited settings. In this paper, we break this barrier and establish a memory-time trade-off for sublinear spectral clustering oracles. Specifically, for well-clusterable graphs, we present oracles that construct $\\mathcal{D}$ using much smaller than $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory (e.g., $O(n^{0.01})$) while still answering membership queries in sublinear time. We also characterize the trade-off frontier between memory usage $S$ and query time $T$, showing, for example, that $S\\cdot T=\\widetilde{O}(n)$ for clusterable graphs with a logarithmic conductance gap, and we show that this trade-off is nearly optimal (up to logarithmic factors) for a natural class of approaches. Finally, to complement our theory, we validate the performance of our oracles through experiments on synthetic networks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph Clustering", "Spectral Clustering", "Memory-Efficient Algorithms", "Sublinear Algorithms", "Space-Time Trade-offs"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/16c54ec8b3c8fd02e67e16d05874f80566e17f23.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper considers the task of community detection in well-clusterable graphs with sublinear space. The goal is to design a data structure D that fits in sublinear memory, and that enables one to query the cluster assignment for each node in sublinear time. Previous approaches all require $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ space for such a datastructure D, but this paper overcomes that. In particular, it is able to design a data structure with a much smaller memory requirement that still allow for sublinear time which-cluster queries. The paper also provides new insights into the time-space tradeoff for this problem, by designing oracles there memory usage S and query time $T$ satisfy $S\\cdot T \\approx \\tilde{O}(n)$. Again, this holds for a class of graphs with good clustering structure. The paper also proves that this is optimal up to logarithmic factors for a certain class of techniques.\n\nThe notion of well-clusterable graphs corresponds (roughly) to graphs that have a k partition where clusters are roughly balanced in size and have small conductance (and large inner conductance, which measures internal connectivity of clusters).\n\nThe paper also proves new results (sublinear algorithms and lower bounds) for the 1-cluster/2-cluster problem, which seeks to tell the difference between graphs that are expenders on n nodes or that are disjoint unions of two identical expanders on n/2 nodes. \n\nFor the clustering results, the key technical advance is to provide a new way to estimate the dot product between the spectral embedding of two nodes in sublinear space and time (the spectral embedding for a node comes from the node's entries in the first few eigenvectors of the normalized Laplacian). This primitive is combined with a previously observation that if two nodes are from the same cluster (under the well-clusterability assumptions), then the dot product of their embeddings with be large, and otherwise the dot product will be zero."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "* This paper provides good motivation and justification for sublinear time and space algorithms, and tackles and interesting problem in graph analysis. \n* The main theoretical result is interesting and represents a substantial improvement over previous techniques for sublinear space clustering oracles.

The presentation is very, very good. \n* I really appreciate that the authors have even provided an implementation of the algorithm and accompanied their theory with numerical experiments. Even if it's only on synthetic data, it is impressive to have an implementation of any kind for an algorithm that is so detailed and complicated."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The main downsides of this paper, when considering it for publication at ICLR specifically are: (1) the algorithm is extremely complicated and detailed, and (2) the algorithm is very impractical for real-world clustering problems. I don't this at all disqualifies the article from being accepted and published somewhere. The contribution here seems very impressive. I do wonder though whether ICLR is the right venue for this work, and instead of a core theory conference. For example, the main work this improves upon (Peng 2020; Gluche et al 2021) are both SODA papers.\n\nExpounding more on the two weaknesses above:\n\n(1) Although the writing does an impressive job making the pieces of the algorithm make sense at a high level, there is still no way around how intricate the statements of the results are. Many many different functions and parameters need to be defined---all with complicated dependencies on each other---even just to present the statement of the results, without even considering what it takes to prove the results. \n\n(2) The theory assumes d-regular graphs with a very specific clustering structure that is not going to be satisfied by pretty much any real world graph. Expanding this to d-bounded graphs doesn't make it much more practical. Even if a graph does satisfy the well-clusterability assumptions for certain choices of $k, \\varepsilon, \\varphi$, we wouldn't know these a priori, and the algorithm make strong assumptions about these parameter (just one among many examples: the specific need in Theorem 3.1 for $\\varepsilon /\\varphi \\leq 1/10^5$). \n\nThis makes it all the more impressive that the paper includes an experimental result of any kind, but in order for this to work (even in a very carefully controlled synthetic setting), one needs to try out many different parameters for the algorithms. \n\nI'm still overall in favor of seeing this paper accepted, given the significance of its core technical contribution and its many other strengths. Graph clustering in general seems well within scope at the conference, and the fact that there are at least some numerical experiments is a plus."}, "questions": {"value": "Is there hope for something like this to be practical for real world graph clustering?

The problem has recently attracted a flurry of work due to its applications in sublinear clustering algorithms. Here, we are given a graph that could be partitioned into $k$ clusters where the conductance between the clusters are high and the conductance inside the clusters are low. As such, we could label the vertices to generate a ‘ground truth’ clustering. The goal for the algorithm is to compute a data structure such that upon querying a vertex $x$, the algorithm can answer the cluster label of $x$ with high efficiency. The metrics for good algorithms in this application include:\n- Pre-processing time: the time to construct the data structure\n- Querying time: the time complexity needed to return the answer for each cluster\n- Accuracy: The answer for most of the vertex queries should be correct\n- Memory efficiency: the memory used by the data structure should be small\n\nThe last aspect was the main contribution of this paper. The paper discussed that all previous algorithms require $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ space for such applications; in contrast, this algorithm is able to design an algorithm with only $n^{O(\\varepsilon/\\phi^2)}$ space, where $\\varepsilon$ and $\\phi$ are parameters that characterize the clusterability of the graph. The query time will be affected, which is now $n^{1+O(\\varepsilon/\\phi^2)}$ time. In fact, the trade-off could be made general with $n^{O(\\varepsilon/\\phi^2)}M$ space and $n^{1+O(\\varepsilon/\\phi^2)}/M$ time.\n\n**Main techniques.** The main techniques of the paper follow from the construction in Shen and Peng [NeurIPS’23]. In a nutshell, this line of techniques reduces the algorithm for the spectral clustering oracle to the approximation of the dot products of vertex embeddings. The previous space lower bound is due to the computation of the approximation dot product using random walks, and this paper adopted the simple idea to conduct the walk in batches to trade time efficiency for space efficiency."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "I’m generally supportive of the paper.

Since I do not know the techniques in those papers, it is harder for me to evaluate the technical novelty.\n\nOverall, I think it’s a solid paper with a good set of results.
