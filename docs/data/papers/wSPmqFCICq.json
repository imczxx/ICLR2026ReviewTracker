Detecting tampering is difficult under a strict black-box setting, where the encoder is hidden within unknown pipelines and only application outputs are observable. Existing fingerprinting methods fail under these conditions as they require model predictions or task-specific information.\n\nWe present a novel fingerprinting framework for black-box encoder verification, \\emph{grounded in a theoretical insight that larger embedding divergence increases the likelihood of downstream output differences}. Building on this principle, we construct \\emph{fingerprint twins}—paired inputs that produce nearly identical embeddings on an intact encoder but diverge sharply after tampering. We simulate realistic changes using \\emph{importance-aware perturbations} and optimize twins to maximize KL divergence while constraining perturbations within an $\\epsilon$-ball for natural appearance.
