As the responses generated by such models often include complex reasoning, intermediate steps, and self-reflection, existing evaluation methods and reward models are often inadequate. They struggle to determine whether the LLM output is truly equivalent to the reference answer, and also have difficulty identifying and extracting the final answer from long, complex responses. To address this issue, we propose xVerify, an efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations. xVerify demonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to effectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are equivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions. To train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets, leveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed specifically for reasoning model assessment. A multi-round annotation process is employed to ensure label accuracy. Based on the VAR dataset, we train multiple xVerify models of different scales. In evaluation experiments conducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models achieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95%. Notably, the smallest variant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o, while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance. Furthermore, we conduct RL experiments with xVerify as the reward model. Compared with direct generation, it shows an improvement of 22.9% for Qwen2.5-7B. which is greater than when Math Verify is used as the reward function. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of xVerify.

Several baselines are considered for comparison showing how xVerify models are better than many other approaches. It is also laudable that they do RL training using their proposed judge since the ultimate application of measurement (evaluation) is to provide signal for learning which the authors demonstrate. The results are strong with x-Verify models having >= 95% F1/acc scores.\n\n\nThe paper does not tackle a totally new problem but takes a data-focused approach to improve LLM-judges. The VAR dataset could also be a very useful resource for the open-source community (assuming it will be released publicly if accepted). The paper is dense and comprehensive with all the details in the Appendix but is mostly easy to follow."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Main Concerns:\n\n1. I don't fully agree with the premise of the paper that reasoning models pose extra challenges for evaluation as all the extra thinking steps is often enclosed inside <think> tags which can be stripped away from final evaluation. For example, I find the claims in L45-L47 unjustified. The claims are not backed by any proper evidence -- the only paper cited is Chang et al. came out in 2023 well before the release of any reasoning models (o1 came out in Sept'24). \n\n2. Inter-Annotator Agreement: Almost all the technical details are deferred to appendix like dataset composition, how annotation was done, what exactly was asked to the annotator (judge/human). Neither inter-annotator agreement rate between humans nor GPT4o-annotator agreement with humans is reported thus questioning the credibility of GPT-4o.\n\n3. Response Generation: It is well-known that models are asked to \"Provide final answer in \\\\boxed{} format\" for math/MCQ evaluations and also trained via such prompts. Thus, this should be used in when generating responses (when constructing the dataset) otherwise it would lead to unfair comparison between evaluation frameworks downstream. This way of prompting is well-established and works well in practice as also used in frontier evals like Humanity Last Exam [4]. \n\n    It is not possible to assess the actual benefit of xVerify models when the response being evaluated is not properly sought at the first place (i.e., the test/generalization split of VAR dataset since it does not reflect \"exactly\" how LLMs are prompted in LM-eval-harness or LightEval frameworks). I would recommend the authors to re-run response generation in well established template as followed by LightEval (with CoT prompting). \n\n    Classification can be viewed as special case of MCQ essentially. Thus, all formats (MCQ, math, classification) except short answer can be handled via \\\\boxed format which is well established in the community. For short text answer, the prompt can be to \"Provide final answer in \\<answer\\> \\</answer\\> tags.\" This has been done in recent work like training DeepSeek-R1 [1]. \n\n4. In Section 5.2, what was the training dataset for RL? How is the evaluation actually performed? It does not make sense to \"compare\" with direct generation as direction generation as per my understanding is without any training. The fair comparison is only with math-verify and the improvement there is less than 1% so there hardly seems to be any benefit of using xVerify over math-verify. Further, xVerify would require loading a judge model in memory compared to math-verify which would also require more GPU memory/time (although loading a 0.5B model should not be an issue). \n\n5. Continuing on RL training, in the referenced Fig. 22, why is the reward between xVerify and math-verify so different at step 0 (which is before training began)? All methods should start from the same starting point assuming the underly evaluation is consistent across all. \n\n6. If math-verify can almost match x-verify (based on the results of RL-training), then the large gain in accuracy reported in Table 1 seems confusing? I would appreciate if the authors can clarify how exactly is the evaluation being performed for the final results table/figure. \n\n7. More baseline: While many LLM-as-a-judges have been compared, all of them are quite old (For example, while JudgeLLM got published in ICLR'25, it came out on Arxiv in 2023 and is based on models released > 1.5 year ago). I would also like to see whether other recent models (both reasoning/non-reasoning eg: Qwen3-4B) can act off-the-shelf as good judges as shown in a recent study [3] which also focuses on using judges for objective answer assessment. \n\n8. Important Related Work: No comparison is made with existing general-verifier model used in recent work [2] where the authors also fine-tune small 1.5B judge for their tasks (also leading to high accuracy downstream with RL) and judge model is shown to have high agreement with Gemini 2 Flash. [2] is highly similar with this paper and deserved to be compared. \n\n\nTypos:\n\nL-070: \"We fine-tune xVerify on a variety of base models\" -> \"We finetune a variety of base models on xVerify\"\n\nIn Fig.1, LLM-response second box corresponding answer should be (B) instead of (A)?\n\nL311-L312: Spacing is weird.
