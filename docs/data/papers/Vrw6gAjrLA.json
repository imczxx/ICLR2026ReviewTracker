Structural pruning has emerged as an effective method for reducing model size and improving inference efficiency, yet existing approaches need a recovery finetuning due to the sensitivity of image generation to missing parameters. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages dynamic pruning to identify and extract sparse experts within dense AR image models, enabling their transformation into Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. Our method efficiently converts pretrained dense models into MoEs, significantly reducing active parameters per inference step while preserving performance without the need for finetuning. By applying top-1 expert routing to MLP layers, we establish a direct link between differentiable dynamic pruning and MoE conversion. Our approach consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques by maintaining high-generation quality without the need for costly recovery fine-tuning. Experimental comparisons demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method against static pruning and uncompressed models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Mixture of Experts", "Dynamic Pruning", "Autoregressive Image Generation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/466c7d432e1e09af10197aef73f8e732a5571104.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a method to dynamically prune the Auto-Regressive (AR) image generation models with the idea of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE).

The technical components such as MoE layers, Gumbel-Sigmoid, and  Gumbel-Softmax are commonly adopted in MoE or pruning works. The technical contribution may be limited. \n\nIt claims that it does not need finetuning in the title and paper. But it still needs to train additional networks including the router, hypernetwork, and projection parameters. At the end of training, each MLP layer is replaced with N experts sharing weights. In actual, the model architecture is changed and part of the model is still finetuned. It may be be accurate to claim without finetuning. \n\nThe comparison may not be fair. The proposed method needs retraining. The baselines typically needs to finetune the model with some text data. But for image generation, how to finetune the baselines from text language domain with what kind of data, it is still an open question. The paper does not provide much details about how the baselines are finetuned. It may not be fair to compare to baselines without any finetuning while the proposed method goes through finetuning. It is better to provide more details. \n\nThe paper focus on image generation. But all baselines are from text language domain. It addresses decoder-only Transformer architectures like typical LLMs. The proposed method can be seamlessly applied to LLMs. It is better to report and compare with the baselins for typical LLM models. It would be a bit strange if all methods and baselines are for LLMs, but the experimental results are for image generation only.\n\nFrom the ablation study in table 5, the most simple version with only HN + Union Loss, can achieve 140 IS, 18 FID, 0.729 Prec, which is already better than all baselines in  Table 2. It seems that the baselines are not properly configured or finetuned with enough data, so that their performance are so weak, worse than the proposed method even without distillation loss or language modeling loss. The most simple version with only HN + Union Loss, does not seem to incorporate any loss related to the generation performance. It is mainly related with parameters since the union loss encourages the union of active parameters from all experts to cover the complete set of neurons.
