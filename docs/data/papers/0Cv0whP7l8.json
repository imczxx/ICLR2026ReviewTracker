We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality Competency Problem—the model’s inability to fairly evaluate all modalities. This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks—such as image classification or pure text question answering—where models are expected to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem, and we further design a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to finetune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations, and a consistency regularization strategy applying on model outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy and multimodal tasks) and multiple model families with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multimodal Large Language Models", "Modality Interference", "Causal Intervention"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7a652a4137746f54b609bc9a256c5f5c918f2c97.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/0c5cfb17d948f2eba0a86516a122f3174a871ac7.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a framework to diagnose and mitigate modality interference in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)—a phenomenon where irrelevant or misleading modality signals degrade model performance.
