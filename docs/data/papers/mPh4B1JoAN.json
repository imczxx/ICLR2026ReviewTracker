We introduce **Tiered Agentic Oversight (TAO)**, a hierarchical multi-agent system that enhances AI safety through layered, automated supervision. Inspired by clinical hierarchies (e.g., nurse-physician-specialist) in hospital, TAO routes tasks to specialized agents based on complexity, creating a robust safety framework through automated inter- and intra-tier communication and role-playing. Crucially, this hierarchical structure functions as an effective error-correction mechanism, absorbing up to 24\\% of individual agent erros before they can compound. Our experiments reveal TAO outperforms single-agent and other multi-agent systems on 4 out of 5 healthcare safety benchmarks, with up to an 8.2\\% improvement. Ablation studies confirm key design principles of the system: (i) its adaptive architecture is over 3\\% safer than static, single-tier configurations, and (ii) its lower tiers are indispensable, as their removal causes the most significant degradation in overall safety. Finally, we validated the system's synergy with human doctors in a user study where a physician, acting as the highest tier agent, provided corrective feedback that improved medical triage accuracy from 40\\% to 60\\%.

The paper claims agent specialization through prompt engineering. However, there is no deep quantification or qualitative analysis on whether these system prompts actually induce meaningful differences in domain reasoning, especially since all agents run atop general-purpose LLMs without explicit medical fine-tuning.\n2. The Agent Router plays a pivotal role in tier assignment, but its design and robustness to ambiguous or novel input is underdiscussed. There is little detail on the training, algorithmic choices, or empirical stress testing for error tolerance in case complexity inference.\n3. On MedSafetyBench, the gains over LLM-DEBATE and other competitive baselines are minimal. TAO's improved safety score translates to small absolute differences in some regimes, particularly when considering much higher cost. The system's superior safety may not always justify the resource overhead, especially as medical settings often operate under hard resource constraints.\n4.

For example, if the Router intentionally makes suboptimal decisions, such as assigning an evidently complex case only to Tier 1, or recruiting irrelevant experts to what extent would the overall safety performance of the system decrease?

As shown in Table 2, TAO results with the highest cost, sometimes nearly double the previous state-of-the-art. Since paper presents a more application-oriented solution with MAS rather than a theoretical or algorithmic improvements, cost is a critical concern. Thus, this raises two questions: (1) is the slight accuracy gain of up to ~4% (sometimes 0.04%, 0.7%, etc.) meaningful enough to justify doubling the cost in downstream task? (2) Could we implement a multi-agent setup using second-top models from each benchmark with routing, which would be far cheaper while achieving accuracy much closer to TAO; if so, why should one choose TAO?\n- Secondly, the experimental setup is narrow, where authors only evaluate large closed-source models like Gemini and o3. This makes it difficult to assess TAO's effectiveness with open-source LLMs, also in varying scales. How would Table 2 change using Qwen or Llama-based models in both large and small scales?\n- Minor comment: While reading the paper, especially the introduction, repeated words (also present in the rest of the paper) are noticed, along with unnecessary comma usage with very long sentences.
