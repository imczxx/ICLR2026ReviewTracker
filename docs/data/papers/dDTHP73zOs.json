What is the behaviour in the worst-case (assuming $C_i$ is unitary but highly structured)?\n-  Relation to Huang et al 2023a: that this algorithm is valid for an arbitrary CTPT map without any specified structure is not sufficiently described.

I strongly urge the authors to change the title, abstract and introduction to accurately reflect the scope of their results.

The method in fact only works for a process defined by (4), the noise is not just local but single qubit and the circuits have to sampled at random from a 2-qubit ensemble. The results here will not work even if the noise locally correlates nearest neighbor qubits.  \n\nEven in other parts of the paper this distinction is not clear: For instance in Problem 1, the authors state the error in learning a quantum state prepared by the circuit $\\mathcal{C}$ as defined in (4). But (4) is a randomly sampled, noisy circuit. So is the error in Problem 1 defined for all possible circuits that can be sample from (4) or is it an average statement?\n\nThe noise model is referred to as ``local'' in many places. It should be called ``single-qubit\".\n\nSimilarly, later Lemmas and theorems have to be stated more precisely to make sure that the readers understand that the the circuit $\\mathcal{C}$ is chosen randomly from a family and if the results in these statements are expected results or high probablity results w.r.t to this randomness."}, "questions": {"value": "0. Do the tomography algorithms explained in the paper require prior knowledge of the noise strength $\\gamma$?

In theorem 1, could the authors explain why the post-processing complexity does not seem to depend on n? Naively, one would think that there should at least be a linear dependence on $n$ as the algorithm has to parse measurement outcomes of length $n$ for an $n$ qubit system?\n\n2. How the decrease of error with the system size the experiment in Fig 2 consistent with the findings of Theorem 1? Since there is no $n$ dependence in the sample complexity, shouldn't the error stay flat with the system size increase?\n\n3.

These can introduce undesirable $n-$dependence back into sample complexity.\n\n6. The benchmarks use Trotterized Ising circuits (fixed, structured gates), not random 2‑qubit 2‑design layers. Can you comment on why the method still works there, and which parts of the theory you expect to survive without per‑layer randomness?\n7.
