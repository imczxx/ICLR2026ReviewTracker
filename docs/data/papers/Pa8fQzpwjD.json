This work introduces an uncertainty-routed curation paradigm that explicitly disentangles aleatoric (data ambiguity) and epistemic uncertainty (model disagreement), enabling distinct treatments for each rather than collapsing them into a single undifferentiated scalar. The approach features a creative and pragmatic two-lane supervision framework: human annotators address cases of aleatoric uncertainty, while an instruction-tuned LLM with self-consistency mechanisms handles instances of epistemic uncertainty. This design effectively leverages the complementary strengths of human judgment and LLM reasoning to enhance dataset quality and model reliability.\n2. Comprehensive diagnostic analyses—including risk–coverage curves, per-round evaluations, corpus-level uncertainty shifts, and ∆MI collapse on curated subsets—support the claim that URC2 genuinely resolves disagreement rather than merely smoothing it. Careful evaluation on ANLI, using both calibration metrics (ECE) and accuracy before and after temperature scaling, demonstrates a ~30% reduction in ECE without any loss in accuracy."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Multiple threshold values (e.g., r≥0.35 in line 221 and w=0.3 in line 237) are introduced without sufficient justification or explanation of their selection criteria.\n2. While the focus on ANLI is reasonable, the claims would be stronger with evaluations beyond ANLI (e.g., [1]). In addition, several hyperparameters appear to be tuned on the ANLI dev split that is also used for reporting, which risks overfitting and makes the conclusions less definitive. Typically, adversarial benchmarks are held out solely for evaluation; we rarely assume access to an adversarial training set for hyperparameter selection. I recommend adding results on additional datasets (e.g., [1]) and using a strictly held-out test set or cross-dataset validation; if tuning on ANLI dev is unavoidable, include a sensitivity analysis and pre-freeze thresholds before final evaluation.\n3. The paper does not report the standalone performance of the LLM used in the adjudication lane (e.g., accuracy and ECE on ANLI), which is necessary to estimate the reliability of this component. 2) The workflow relies on a single LLM for confident model disagreement; please include ablations with stronger or alternative LLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Qwen-3, Claude) and/or multi-LLM arbitration to assess whether the conclusions are strengthened or challenged under different adjudicators. 3) The paper mentions a quantized LLM; quantization can alter calibration and increase vulnerability to adversarial attacks [2].\n4.

The authors should evaluate whether this trust is actually sensible by comparing it against human labels on selected samples. At the same time, this defeats the purpose of having humans to handle relabeling in Lane H, since a capable-enough LLM would be able to do it as well, since the authors assume that LLMs can make successful judgments on ANLI. I understand that humans relabel ambiguous cases, which is intuitively more challenging than epistemic-heavy cases, but the paper does not provide actual evidence for this claim. Given that I do not understand why Lane L and H are handled separately, the proposed URC2 pipeline essentially reads like a \"fixing ANLI annotation error\" work, and I do not see how it would be valuable to future research. At the same time, the authors should compare against a very simple baseline, which essentially uses an LLM to relabel every instance in the ANLI dataset."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the weakness section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "yqCg4UVQyp", "forum": "Pa8fQzpwjD", "replyto": "Pa8fQzpwjD", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15355/Reviewer_wahp"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15355/Reviewer_wahp"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15355/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761685319136, "cdate": 1761685319136, "tmdate": 1762925641197, "mdate": 1762925641197, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces URC2 (Uncertainty-Routed Curation & Calibration), a three-stage pipeline for improving model calibration and dataset quality on the Adversarial NLI (ANLI) benchmark.
