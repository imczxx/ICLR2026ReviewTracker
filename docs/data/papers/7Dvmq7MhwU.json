However, it remains a challenging and underexplored problem due to the chaotic nature of the weather system. Recent data-driven studies have shown promising results, but their performance is limited by the inadequate incorporation of climate states and a model tendency to degrade, progressively losing fine-scale details and yielding over-smoothed forecasts. To overcome these limitations, we propose TianQuan-S2S, a global S2S forecasting model that integrates initial weather states with climatological means via incorporating climatology into patch embedding and enhancing variability capture through an uncertainty-augmented Transformer. Extensive experiments on the Earth Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) reanalysis dataset demonstrate that our model yields a significant improvement in both deterministic and ensemble forecasting over the climatology mean, traditional numerical methods, and data-driven models. Ablation studies empirically show the effectiveness of our model designs. Remarkably, our model outperforms skillful numerical ECMWF-S2S and advanced data-driven Fuxi-S2S in key meteorological variables.

The proposed approach largely builds upon existing concepts such as climatology conditioning and stochastic perturbation within Transformer architectures, rather than introducing a fundamentally new modeling paradigm or theoretical insight.\n\nThe method can be viewed as a clever and carefully engineered recombination of previously explored ideas, rather than a conceptual breakthrough. While the integration of climatological priors and noise injection is executed elegantly, the individual components are well-known in both numerical and data-driven forecasting literature.\n\nMoreover, the design choices—such as attention-based climatology fusion and Gaussian noise injection at each Transformer layer—feel somewhat heuristic (“tricky”), lacking a deeper theoretical justification for why this specific combination should outperform alternatives like simple concatenation or dropout-based regularization.\n\nNevertheless, the paper demonstrates clear empirical benefits and provides a well-structured and reproducible evaluation. The proposed model achieves strong, consistent improvements across multiple meteorological variables and lead times, effectively mitigating the long-horizon degradation problem that limits many prior S2S models.\n\nGiven that research in subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasting remains relatively sparse, and that the paper delivers a tangible step forward in practical performance and stability, this work deserves publication.

However, it remains unclear how this mechanism fundamentally differs from existing stochastic regularization techniques such as dropout, layer noise, or even standard input perturbation used in ensemble forecasting.\n\nSpecifically, how is the proposed per-layer Gaussian perturbation different from simply perturbing the input fields or initial conditions, as done in conventional ensemble methods like FuXi-S2S or stochastic parameterization in NWP systems? Input perturbations are known to encourage diversity and uncertainty propagation—so what unique advantage does injecting noise throughout the Transformer depth provide?\n\nMoreover, the paper would benefit from a direct experimental comparison between:\n\n- input-only perturbation (ensemble IC perturbations),\n\n- fixed or dropout-style layer noise, and\n\n- the proposed learnable state-dependent Gaussian noise.\n\nSuch a comparison could clarify whether the improvement stems from deeper uncertainty modeling or simply from added stochasticity.
