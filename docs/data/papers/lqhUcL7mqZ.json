While recent advances in architectures like Transformers and state space models (SSMs) have shown promise, they are often limited by either high computational costs or an inability to capture time-varying cross-variable interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a variable-invariant two-dimensional state space model that eliminates variable ordering dependence by leveraging a global, permutation-invariant descriptor to condition temporal dynamics. This design allows for the efficient processing of variable-axis updates through an effective pooling operation, which maintains global correlations and enables full parallelism. We further enhance this architecture with a multi-branch design that incorporates distinct pathways for long- and short-horizon temporal features and a dedicated frequency-domain pathway, all integrated via a lightweight gating mechanism. Through extensive experiments, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection tasks. Comprehensive analysis confirms our model’s efficiency, robustness, and ability to capture diverse temporal–spectral patterns.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Permutation Invariant", "2D State Space Model", "Time Series Modeling"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f94c645ec0583120ece11cb331632acbac1ca4bf.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Mamba Unchained, a variable-invariant two-dimensional state space model (2D SSM) designed for multivariate time series analysis.

The problem is clearly defined, and the design is simple yet effective.

The multi-domain modeling design is well-motivated. Long-/short-term temporal branches capture multi-scale dynamics via different discretization steps, while the frequency-domain branch models spectral structures. These are adaptively fused through gating, achieving strong expressiveness with low implementation cost."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Replacing variable-axis scanning with a global aggregation is the core of this work. In the paper, what specific forms of ϕ (e.g., mean pooling, gating, or set-attention) are actually used as the default setting? How do different choices of ϕ affect GPU throughput and peak memory usage? Has a systematic ablation study been conducted?\n2. The advantage is less evident in univariate or low-dimensional settings. On the M4 (single-channel) dataset, the method is suboptimal, and the authors acknowledge that the benefit of permutation invariance is limited in this case. It is suggested to more systematically characterize the performance transition as the number of variables C varies.\n3. The rationale for choosing the frequency-domain branch hyperparameter Δf is unclear. Table 4 shows that a smaller Δf yields better results, but no adaptive mechanism or theoretical justification is provided, despite the large variation in spectral distributions across datasets."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Does the permutation-invariant conditional independence assumption have any side effects?
