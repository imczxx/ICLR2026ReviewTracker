Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that *operationalizes* partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs *feature fission* to factorize its latent representation into *redundant*, *unique*, and *synergistic* slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level *partial alignment*: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines. Ablations on fusion operators and split ratios, together with qualitative visualizations, further demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed design.", "tldr": "PARSE enables server-free multimodal DFL via PID-guided feature fission and partial alignment of shareable knowledge, improving accuracy and stability across heterogeneous client mixes.", "keywords": ["decentralized federated learning", "multimodal", "partial alignment", "partial information decomposition", "feature fission"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/397381a0fbfa434efa772b998c18120f6011d5b7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6803a5d7f0677e3956717bafdf1087c0e93acbc0.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the PARSE framework for decentralized multimodal FL scenarios, aiming to address the challenge that unimodal and multimodal clients have inconsistent gradient directions when updating shared parameters.

The experimental section appears clear, including various datasets, modality heterogeneity settings, class heterogeneity settings, different topologies, ablation studies, etc."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. In my opinion, the biggest flaw of the proposed method is that it is impractical, in other words, no one would use this method to train models in the real world. The reason is that the method proposed in this paper modifies the model structure rather than being a pure FL algorithm. In contrast, almost all baselines compared in the paper are FL algorithms that are general to all models. This leads to the following consequences:\n    - It cannot be adapted to any currently popular models without modifying their architectures. For example, if I want to fine-tune GPT-5 while keeping its architecture unchanged, the proposed method is not applicable.\n\n    - More critically, even if I modify GPT-5 to add the three-slice structure, I cannot simply freeze the pretrained encoder and only train the classifiers. This is because the feature splitting (from the authors' code)\n      ```python\n      feat = self.encoders[i](x)\n      feat_m, feat_c, feat_s = torch.chunk(feat, 3, dim=1)\n      ```\n      is completely meaningless if the encoder is frozen. the pretrained encoder was never trained to semantically separate its output into redundant, unique, and synergistic components. Therefore, the method requires training the entire model (encoder + classifiers) from scratch with the special three-slice architecture.\n    \n    - It cannot be proved that models with the special design of redundant, unique, and synergistic slices are better than models without these special designs. \n   \n   - All experimental comparisons in the paper are: three-slice special architecture vs. standard architecture. This is not a fair comparison. FL algorithm vs. FL algorithm is acceptable, FL algorithm + special architecture vs. FL algorithm + special architecture is acceptable, but FL algorithm + special architecture vs. FL algorithm is not acceptable.\n\n2. I believe the proposed method does not truly contribute to the DFL field, for the following reasons:\n    - It does not solve the unique challenges in DFL, for example, asynchronous updates, dynamic topology, etc.\n   \n    - Many multimodal FL algorithms can be very easily adapted to DFL scenarios, such as the baselines in the paper: DSGD-Modality, DSGD-Task, and DSGD-Hybrid. I believe that at the code level, only about 20 lines of code need to be modified to adapt the CFL aggregation paradigm to the DFL neighbor averaging. Obviously, I would not call such modifications a contribution to the DFL field, and therefore the same logic applies to this paper.\n   \n    - I have to say that many experimental scenarios in the paper use the simplest and most basic ring topology. Although the paper also compares chordal ring and random gossip, these are all variants of the ring topology. This obviously cannot represent DFL. What about other topological structures, such as fully-connected structures? What about dynamically changing topologies? What about highly heterogeneous connectivity (some nodes have many connections, some have few)?\n   \n    - The paper's contributions emphasize server-free, but I do not know how to construct per-modality subgraphs in the real world without server coordination. How do clients know which neighbors have the same modality?\n   \n    - The paper's contributions emphasize topology-agnostic, but I do not know how the proposed method works under a fully-connected topology, i.e., a topology where all clients are connected regardless of modality?"}, "questions": {"value": "1. I suggest systematizing the experiments on modality heterogeneity, i.e., the agent ratios in the paper, by using a configurable parameter to represent, for example, the proportion of clients with all modalities. Additionally, why are the numbers of single-modality clients the same in all experiments? If the numbers of single-modality clients are different, for example, 5 audio clients and 20 video clients, how would the performance be, especially given that the paper constructs per-modality subgraphs?\n\n2. I suggest testing on more topological structures, especially in cases where clients have more connections, which may better represent real-world P2P networks.\n\n3. The paper mentions in its contributions that the proposed method is compatible with time-varying random graphs, but there are no experiments to prove this, especially in multimodal scenarios. Consider a scenario where some multimodal clients, for some reason, such as sensor damage or privacy policy changes, have some modalities no longer available. How should the proposed method handle this? Or consider, alternatively, single-modality clients who purchase new devices and collect new modality data.

The rationale for using multiple classifiers within a single modality should be clarified, along with an explanation of how this architecture improves performance.\n* Global collaboration: What is the difficulty of using DSGD with client design from federated multimodal learning ?
