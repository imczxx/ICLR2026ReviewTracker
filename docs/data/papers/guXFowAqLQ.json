However, in time-series they offer limited insights as semantically meaningful features are often found in other domains. We introduce Cross-domain Integrated Gradients, a generalization of Integrated Gradients. Our method enables feature attributions on any domain that can be formulated as an invertible, differentiable transformation of the time domain. Crucially, our derivation extends the original Integrated Gradients into the complex domain, enabling frequency-based attributions. We provide the necessary theoretical guarantees, namely, path independence and completeness. Our approach reveals interpretable, problem-specific attributions that time-domain methods cannot capture, on three real-world tasks: wearable sensor heart rate extraction, electroencephalography-based seizure detection, and zero-shot time-series forecasting. We release an open-source Tensorflow/PyTorch library to enable plug-and-play cross-domain explainability for time-series models. These results demonstrate the ability of cross-domain integrated gradients to provide semantically meaningful insights in time series models that are impossible with traditional time‑domain saliency.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Interpretability", "Time series models", "Saliency Map", "Integrated Gradients"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a2ee0d72e0df71bf6dfd9778b3dda739b99c6c6c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a4e6ae96cb355e28e9d4afded6262c5abaffa4c0.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work is focused on the explainability of black-box model in the context of time series models.

This is not in line with good research practice. It is unclear to the reader whether observations and statements are taken from the literature or are a novel contribution by the paper. Importantly, the observation that existing saliency maps fail in the \ntime-series domain and that other features, e.g., stemming from the frequency domain, are not novel and have been shown before in the literature (e.g., [1],[2],[3]). This renders Proposition 1, without proper citations, almost plagiarism. Section 3.2 is therefore unnecessary. I am not raising an ethics flag at the moment, but this aspect is, in my opinion, sufficient for rejecting the paper without further evaluation.\n- The paper does not discuss the many restrictions and limitations of IG and their equivalent part in the proposed method.\n- The paper states that the method is applicable to many domains. However, all argumentation and derivation (e.g., section 4.2) solely focus on the frequency domain. More explanation and examples are needed here to evaluate the usefulness of the method.\n- The method requires domain knowledge to specify the domain of interest. In practice, such knowledge might not exist, or if it does, might be limited. This can lead to dangerous misinterpretations of the explanations and wrong decision-making. It would be desirable that a novel explainability method can directly infer saliency across many (unspecified) domains to potentially uncover so far unknown important features, instead of suffering similar limitations to existing time series saliency methods on the time domain.\n- The paper does not discuss the experimental results or the limitations of the proposed method. Overall, the paper seems unfinished.\n- The experimental section only focuses on three examples with specific ML methods.
