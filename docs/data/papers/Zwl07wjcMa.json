Recent work has proposed syllables as promising speech tokens at low temporal resolution, but existing models are constrained to English and fail to capture sufficient acoustic detail. To address this, we present Sylber 2.0, a universal framework for coding speech at the syllable level, enabling efficient temporal compression and high-fidelity reconstruction across multiple languages and expressive styles. Building on the original Sylber, Sylber 2.0 improves both linguistic coverage and reconstruction quality by training on diverse multilingual speech and introducing a syllable-level acoustic encoder and vocoder. Sylber 2.0 achieves a very low token frequency around 5 Hz, while retaining both linguistic and acoustic detail. Experiments show that it performs on par with previous models operating on high-frequency baselines, and it outperforms the original Sylber by a significant margin. We further demonstrate the efficacy of Sylber 2.0 by training a text-to-speech model, which achieves comparable or better performance than current SOTA models using only 560 hours of data and 72M parameters. In sum, we establish an effective syllable-level abstraction for general spoken language.", "tldr": "Sylber 2.0 is a universal syllable embedding that compresses speech audio at ~5 Hz and reconstructs with high fidelity for any languages and styles.", "keywords": ["Self-supervised learning", "representational learning", "speech processing", "speech coding"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f777582009d3a5719d63fcf227bffc5b0cac5aee.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces Sylber 2.0, a universal framework designed to encode speech at the syllable level across multiple languages.

The syllable-guided acoustic encoder is a specific, new architecture designed to solve the well-known problem of acoustic information being \"marginalized out\" by self-supervised content encoders.

The gains are confounded by multiple variables: a new (multilingual) dataset, a new (and likely better) vocoder, and the removal of silent masking.

Only TTS results are shown, which is insufficient since TTS is relatively simple and can be trained effectively with Mel-Spectrogram + Vocoder without any tokenization. The paper needs to justify the benefits of the proposed embedding for more diverse downstream tasks and identify which tasks would actually benefit from syllable-level representations\n\n2. **Overclaimed TTS efficiency benefits**: The claim that the proposed embedding enables training smaller models with less data for TTS is overclaimed. It is well-established that good TTS models can be trained on small datasets like LJSpeech (40h) using Tacotron2 by overfitting to a single speaker, so requiring fewer parameters for smaller datasets is expected. The evaluation should be conducted on standard benchmarks like seed-tts-eval and include comparisons with recent baselines such as SparkTTS (https://github.com/SparkAudio/Spark-TTS) to show it can modeling diverse speaking style, speakers, languages, etc.\n\n3. **Unclear advantage over model-free representations**: For multilingual speech representation, mel-spectrograms provide lossless, model-free representations. The fundamental issue with model-based compressors is generalization. The paper does not adequately justify why syllable embeddings should be preferred over mel-spectrograms for TTS, especially when an I-STFT based vocoder (e.g., https://github.com/gemelo-ai/vocos) can transform mel-spectrograms back to audio without requiring learned compression"}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "k7QwJOp373", "forum": "Zwl07wjcMa", "replyto": "Zwl07wjcMa", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20999/Reviewer_QKpL"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20999/Reviewer_QKpL"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20999/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762221555409, "cdate": 1762221555409, "tmdate": 1762940016502, "mdate": 1762940016502, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
