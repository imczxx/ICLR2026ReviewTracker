The dataset scope is limited to high-school difficulty, and its overall size is relatively small.

In addition, MathViz-Bench is smaller than several widely used T2I or VQA benchmarks, which may potentially be less able to show true gaps and less comprehensive in scope.\n\n2. The evaluation employs a fixed blackboard presentation style without testing alternative layouts such as paper worksheets, whiteboards, slides, or textbook formatting, which may introduce style-induced bias.\n\n3. The evaluation relies on a VLM to assign scores without human validation, potentially introducing bias and errors that could affect model rankings and conclusions."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The evaluation is limited to a single image generation per problem for each model.

The motivation of this dataset is confusing. It is built on (i.e., sampling) the existing dataset MATH. Moreover, based on the description in Section 3, it looks like the inputs to VLMs include the math problem, complete step-by-step solution, and additional style constraints. Is this dataset only testing models' capability for solution visualization without solution generation?\n\n2. The studied dataset has limited scope with only 500 problems restricted to \"blackboard-style\" solution visualization. Moreover, the math problems are limited to algebraic questions without the critical mathematical visualization types such as geometric diagrams, graphs, plots, and visual proofs. \n\n3. The presentation is unclear and important details are missing. For example, Figure 1 is intended to illustrate the limitation of T2I models, but it didn't discuss what limitations are and why it is challenging. Moreover, the evaluation details are missing in Section 4: what does score 0-5 mean? Why are \"educational viability\" defined by \"all scores > 3\"? Is this based on pedagogical justification or empirical validation?\n\n4. The evaluation is based on LLM judge (Grok4), but it is unclear why it is selected as the judge model and how reliable the evaluation method is. Human evaluation is needed and it is important to report the agreement scores with human judge.\n\n5. The evaluation experiment is limited with only commercial T2I models tested. \n\n6.
