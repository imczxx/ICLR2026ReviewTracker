Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context. We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series forecasts. We compare our algorithm with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms and present the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets, highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark, we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the classes. With PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer practical questions on forecasts.", "tldr": "PAX-TS is a novel post-hoc explainability method for multi-granular explanations, designed for time series forecasting", "keywords": ["Time series forecasting", "explainability", "perturbation"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ae1d9a90b8f148f24a847af3fde9acc775e0872c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a model-agnostic perturbation-based framework for explaining time series forecasting models at multiple granularities."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

I think the style is more suited for a research journal or a thesis, as there is no quantitative comparisons with other methods. The method section also seems to be written in a more academic way, rather than a machine learning way.\n\nNevertheless, I have several questions and comments\n\n- Section 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 corresponds to perturbations of the original time series. Are they all being applied? I suppose all these adjustments are not commutative. Is there an order of applications?\n\n- Section 3.1, it is better to say fixing t, $w_{p, i}=...$, $w_{a, i}=...$, if I understand correctly.\n- Section 3.4, it is not clear what the interest function $\\pi$ represents. For example, if $\\pi=max$, what is that being \"maximum\" with respect to? Is it across all the d-th and h-th dimensions (i.e. all the features and all the time points in the forecasting window?)\n- Section 3.4. The change ratio $r_{\\pi\\alpha}$ is not clear. Is there a formula of this change ratio with respect to the original prediction $\\hat{y}$ and the perturbed prediction $\\hat{y}'$? Will there be a problem if the whole time series is just shifted vertically (thus the \"ratio\" would be different)?\n\n- Section 4.2 and Figure 2. This is an example I do not understand. The setting is h=20 and b=20. Thus the 20 time steps are from the input length? Without knowing what the forecasting value, how do we interpret Figure 2? Also, why is the first 19 time steps having a positive correlation with the maximum while the last timesteps having a negative correlation with the maximum? \n\n- Section 4.3, the definition of $\\pi_i = \\hat{y}_i'$ is not clear. I think normally, when $y$ is a vector, $y_i$ corresponds to its i-th component. But here, I think $\\hat{y}_i'$ corresponds to the perturbed output when the input at time $i$ is perturbed?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "na"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "rJ2ce7tTJK", "forum": "HIM0n8rsBZ", "replyto": "HIM0n8rsBZ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14164/Reviewer_RPSs"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14164/Reviewer_RPSs"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14164/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761599821079, "cdate": 1761599821079, "tmdate": 1762924626357, "mdate": 1762924626357, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces **PAX-TS**, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm that explains time series forecasting models through localized input perturbations, providing multi-granular insights.
