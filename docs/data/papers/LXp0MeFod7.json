To overcome this challenge, we therefore developed STAR, a novel deep learning framework designed for dynamic prediction of postoperative recurrence and survival. Specifically, the model's primary innovation is its ability to forecast long-term, year-by-year prognosis by analyzing the temporal evolution of postoperative CT scans in conjunction with key clinical data. Additionally, the framework can simultaneously generate personalized, annual recurrence risk heatmaps. These heatmaps offer an intuitive, visual guide to the probable location and timing of recurrence, thereby providing clinicians with interpretable, patient-specific insights to tailor dynamic surveillance strategies. When evaluated on the MSKCC CRLM dataset, our model demonstrated outstanding predictive performance, achieving 90% accuracy in assessing survival status for each of the 12 postoperative years (Temporal Adjacency Accuracy, TAA) with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.7500. This study consequently establishes a new paradigm for the postoperative management of CRLM, shifting the focus from static, single-point assessment to continuous, dynamic risk monitoring. Ultimately, by providing a tool for more precise and personalized follow-up, our framework helps advance the clinical goal from simple \"spatial resection\" to a more comprehensive \"spatiotemporal cure.\"", "tldr": "We developed a deep learning model called STAR that analyzes a patient's CT scans over time to dynamically predict when and where their colorectal cancer is most likely to return each year after surgery.", "keywords": ["Colorectal cancer liver metastasis", "Dynamic risk prediction", "Postoperative management", "Deep learning framework"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d135872cad8935d25d9ed14e004c8d96d8e5de40.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/54f8715eba76a1293ada4fef25910ffa36f54f21.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces STAR (Spatio-Temporal Attention-Guided Recurrence Prediction), a deep learning framework for dynamic prediction of postoperative recurrence and survival in colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) patients.

This focus directly addresses a crucial unmet need in personalized follow-up and surveillance planning, demonstrating high practical relevance and originality.\n### **Interesting model design**\nThe paper introduces a novel model architecture that aligns with the task of year-by-year recurrence prediction. The incorporation of 4D spatio-temporal attention, virtual timestamps, and a dual-loss multimodal fusion strategy collectively form an original and technically sound framework. These components are conceptually meaningful for integrating heterogeneous medical data and modeling complex disease progression patterns over time.\n### **Interpretability and clinical insight**\nThe use of SHAP-based interpretability analysis, along with correlation studies linking model explanations to prior clinical knowledge, enhances both transparency and credibility. The personalized, annual recurrence risk heatmaps provide intuitive visualization that can assist clinicians in understanding and validating the model’s predictions, thereby increasing the potential clinical impact of the work."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "### **Misalignment between the abstract and the actual implementation**\nThe abstract and introduction emphasize modeling the temporal evolution of postoperative CT scans, but the experimental data only include preoperative images. The postoperative images are synthetically generated using virtual timestamps, yet there is no real postoperative data to validate the quality or fidelity of these generated scans. This inconsistency undermines the credibility of the proposed framework.\n\n**Suggestion:** The authors should clarify this conceptual discrepancy and, ideally, provide validation of the generated postoperative images—either through a small-scale real postoperative dataset or expert evaluation—to substantiate the claim of modeling temporal evolution.\n\n### **Limited dataset size and lack of external validation**\nThe dataset used in the study contains fewer than 200 samples, with only 20 in the test set, and there is no external or cross-task validation. Such a small and homogeneous sample severely limits the model’s generalizability and robustness, especially for a clinical prediction task.\n\n**Suggestion:** The authors are encouraged to perform external validation on an independent dataset or at least apply cross-validation with stratified folds.\n\n### **Insufficient comparison with recent state-of-the-art 4D architectures**\nThe paper only compares the proposed model with a single 2021 baseline, neglecting recent 4D spatio-temporal architectures, especially transformer-based models such as 4D Swin-ViT or TimeSformer. Given that STAR relies heavily on 4D attention and temporal modeling, the absence of these comparisons raises concerns about the rigor and completeness of the experimental evaluation.\n\n**Suggestion:** Including comparisons with representative modern 4D attention-based models—or, at minimum, a detailed discussion justifying their exclusion—would significantly strengthen the technical evaluation.\n\n### **Lack of clarity and inconsistencies in presentation**\nThe paper suffers from clarity and organization issues that hinder reproducibility and comprehension. Specifically:\n1. The Related Work section lacks structured organization and fails to differentiate between temporal modeling, multimodal fusion, and interpretability research.\n2. The mathematical description of virtual timestamp embedding and the dual loss formulation is abstract and incomplete, lacking sufficient detail for replication.\n3. There are figure-text mismatches (e.g., line 253 refers to Figure 3 content that does not align with the figure).\n4. The “4D-ACFNet” mentioned in Section 4.2 does not appear in the methods section.\n\n**Suggestion:** The authors should revise for consistency, include complete mathematical definitions, and reorganize the related work into thematic subsections to improve readability and technical clarity.\n\n**Addressing these concerns would substantially strengthen the paper.

Could the authors clarify whether their proposed model is robust to such data irregularities? Specifically, how would the model perform if the time intervals between follow-ups are non-uniform or if certain temporal data are missing?\n- It would be helpful to discuss whether the model incorporates any temporal alignment, imputation, or interpolation strategies, or if it relies on uniform time sampling during training and inference.\n- If the current approach assumes complete or regularly spaced data, the authors might consider discussing possible extensions or adaptations (e.g., continuous-time modeling, neural ODEs, or masked temporal attention) that could make the model more applicable to real-world longitudinal datasets.\n\n**Interpretation of Postoperative Microenvironmental Dynamics**\n\nThe paper suggests that the model captures postoperative microenvironmental changes or disease progression patterns over time. Could the authors elaborate on what specific patterns or regularities were observed?\n- For instance, does the model reveal consistent temporal trajectories or phenotypic shifts associated with recovery or recurrence?\n- Are there any biologically interpretable trends emerging from the learned representations (e.g., clustering of similar progression profiles, correlations with clinical outcomes)?\nProviding such interpretability or biological insight would strengthen the paper’s contribution, as it would demonstrate that the model not only achieves predictive performance but also yields clinically meaningful understanding of disease evolution."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "gMaxIZfx2W", "forum": "LXp0MeFod7", "replyto": "LXp0MeFod7", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11502/Reviewer_fRRw"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11502/Reviewer_fRRw"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11502/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761042080197, "cdate": 1761042080197, "tmdate": 1762922604218, "mdate": 1762922604218, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes STAR (Spatio‑Temporal Attention‑Guided Recurrence Prediction), a deep‑learning framework for the long‑term postoperative management of colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM)."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "1.The clinical task (cancer recurrence) has great significance in health care.\n\n2.

For instance, the roles of the Conv3D block, h_recon, and the gating variables (gate_0, gate_1) are not well explained, and the purpose of the L_align loss (enforcing dissimilarity between reconstructed and original CTs) appears counterintuitive. These gaps make it difficult to assess the soundness and interpretability of the model design.\n\n[W3] Incomplete and potentially unreliable quantitative evaluation:\nTable 1 omits MSE and MAE results, and the small test size (20 samples) raises concerns about the robustness of the results. The lack of confidence intervals, statistical significance testing, or bootstrapping analysis makes it hard to judge whether STAR’s reported superiority is statistically meaningful.\n\n[W4] Limited experimental scope and missing baselines:\nThe comparison set excludes several relevant and recent spatio-temporal or CRLM-related architectures (e.g., STG, Temporal Attention Unit).

Also, is there a reconstruction loss associated with STAR? If not, can the deconvolved outputs in Figure 2(d) still be considered CT reconstructions?\n\n[Q3] Clarification for the gating and alignment mechanisms:\nThe process for obtaining gate_0 and gate_1 in Algorithm 1 is not described. Please specify how these gating signals are computed and their roles in the learning dynamics. Also, in Algorithm 1, enforcing reconstructed CTs to be “dissimilar” from the originals by L_align seems counterintuitive.
