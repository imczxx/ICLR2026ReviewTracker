The *structural causal bandit* framework provides a graphical characterization for identifying actions that are unable to maximize rewards by leveraging prior knowledge of the underlying causal structure. While such knowledge enables an agent to estimate the expected rewards of certain actions based on others in online interactions, there has been little guidance on how to transfer information inferred from arbitrary combinations of datasets collected under different conditions---observational or experimental---and from heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we investigate the structural causal bandit with *transportability*, where priors from the source environments are fused to enhance learning in the deployment setting. We demonstrate that it is possible to exploit invariances across environments to consistently improve learning. The resulting bandit algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound with an explicit dependence on informativeness of prior data, and it may outperform standard bandit approaches that rely solely on online learning.", "tldr": "We study a structural causal bandit framework that leverages prior data while accounting for structural discrepancies across environments", "keywords": ["causal inference", "identification", "transportability", "structural causal bandits", "causal decision making"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4909e5c9b02c520e24c8e399f8fd951de8d36afc.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces the structural causal bandit framework with transportability, enabling the fusion of priors from heterogeneous source environments to enhance learning in a target environment.

It has been studied before under the same notion of regret (e.g. in Bellot, et al., 2023).\n\nSecond, it is hard to judge the size of the contribution. The paper combines existing ideas on existing problems, and from what I can see, the theorems and regret bounds follow naturally from the assumptions and trivial probabilities. The authors never combine the two main ideas (using bounds and using a hierarchy).\n\nThe algorithm avoids the most interesting aspect of the problem; the interaction between actions played and information gain. We could have scenarios where it is better to play certain actions that are suboptimal because they can reveal a lot about the optimal action (such as in the partial monitoring literature).\n\nThe presentation is overwhelming and reads like a survey of the causal bandit literature more than text which is specifically written to explain an algorithm. Giving the reader some hierarchy of concepts could help parse all the notation, which will be difficult to understand for anyone without a background in the literature. For example, the notion that your technique for bounding revolves around finding and bounding C-factor should be described early so the reader knows what techniques are important. Instead, it is first referred to on page 6 after the reader has slogged through 5 pages of notation, examples, and definitions. \n\nSome definitions are confusing. For example, in the definition of identifiable, it is not clear that the definition of identifiability of C means that there exists a C’ with certain properties.
