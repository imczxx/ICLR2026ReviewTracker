Leveraging the Cartan-Hadamard theorem, we introduce Exponential-Wrapped Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms that achieve $\\epsilon$-DP, $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP, Gaussian DP (GDP), and Rényi DP (RDP) without relying on computationally intensive MCMC sampling. Our methods operate entirely within the intrinsic geometry of the manifold, ensuring both theoretical soundness and practical scalability. We derive utility bounds for privatized Fréchet means and demonstrate superior utility and runtime performances on both synthetic data and real-world data in the space of symmetric positive definite matrices (SPDM) equipped with three different metrics. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first unified extension of multiple DP notions to general Hadamard manifolds with practical and scalable implementations.", "tldr": "e propose fast, general mechanisms for differential privacy on Hadamard manifolds using exponential wrapping, achieving DP, ADP, GDP, and RDP without MCMC.", "keywords": ["Differential Privacy", "Riemannian Manifold", "Hadamard manifolds", "Fréchet mean", "SPDM space"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/51180b97d5034977db613a61e22f2b4645ce7b22.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/22b6726bb02701d41a6e671aa8382bc35e166bbe.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces \"Exponential-Wrapped\" mechanisms for achieving differential privacy on curved geometric spaces (Hadamard manifolds) like hyperbolic space and symmetric positive definite matrices used in medical imaging.
