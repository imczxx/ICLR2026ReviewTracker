Current LLM-based health analysis methods typically rely on manually curated context, which becomes impractical with increasing data volume and sensor diversity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{Wearable As Graph (WAG)}, a novel framework that automates context retrieval for LLMs using personalized knowledge graphs. WAG constructs knowledge graphs mapping relationships between wearable modalities and incorporates user-specific data. We develop a data-driven retrieval pipeline that leverages both global (long-term) and local (short-term) relationships within metrics to identify the most relevant nodes for user queries. We evaluate WAG on a benchmark of over 10k data-associated queries created from multiple wearable datasets. Both LLM- and human-based evaluations show that WAG substantially improves response quality, achieving a $\\sim$70\\% win rate over baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the complementary value of global modeling (implemented via Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling to integrate general knowledge, population trends, and individual variation) and local modeling (adapted based on anomalies and query openness).

While the idea of personalized knowledge graph and graph-based retrieval is conceptually interesting, it is hard to understand fundamentally why we need to create this structure. There are 52 metrics that we need to determine are relevant for a query and it seems WAG does not use the actual metric data (just metric description and web search results) to construct this graph. If its just 52 metric names and description could a good LLM not determine what the most relevant metrics are by just prompting it with all 52 metrics? At the very least this should be a very reasonable baseline. The lack of detail in the existing baselines also make it difficult to assess the validity of WAG (W3).\n\nW2. Aspects of the framework lack either validity and/or motivation why a certain design choice was made. For example, if the goal is to have data that is representative and diverse (line 131), why only focus on those with high data completeness (which may not be representative of real-world wearable data)? What were the reasons behind openness categories? When asking LLMs to define openness, were these aligned with what humans would have given? What makes a LLM defined edge weight valid? How were the relationship scoring categories defined?\n\nW3. Overall, the presentation of the paper and details for reproducibility could be improved. The three baselines are introduced in line 409 with very minor detail. Even looking at the qualitative examples in Appendix J and prompts in Appendix K, it is unclear how the baselines exactly work. What is the prompt for the RAG condition? What is the retriever? How are items indexed? Why does the baseline context include the metric data but the others do not in Appendix J? \n\nIt would be helpful to have an end-to-end example for each. Likewise, details such as the llm used (DeepSeek-V3) is deep in the appendix and we don't know details such as the temperature being used.
