On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks", "abstract": "The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform \"low-level\" tasks before \"high-level\" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.", "tldr": "We show that low-level processing can benefit even strong classifiers.", "keywords": ["Classification", "denoising", "dimensionality reduction", "Bayes optimal classifier"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7071b70c3a26ac3df7bc9dc2ced37b4e4d672001.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates when and why low-level data preprocessing can be beneficial for a strong classifier (e.g., one that converges to the optimal Bayes classifier).

This mismatch weakens the claimed alignment between the theoretical framework and modern deep learning models.\n\n2. Eq. (3) assumes a Gaussian Mixture Model where data 𝑥 is generated conditional on label y. This assumption is conceptually inverted from real-world classification, where 𝑥 precedes 𝑦.\n\n3. The theory defines 𝐴 as a linear transformation matrix, while experiments use nonlinear modules (DnCNN, Lu et al., 2025). The inconsistency makes it unclear whether the empirical findings genuinely validate the theory.\n\n4. Although 𝐴 is constructively derived, the paper lacks intuitive explanation of how 𝐴 preserves or amplifies discriminative information. Visualizing its action in feature space or relating it to known transformations would strengthen the conceptual link between theory and practice.\n\n5. The preprocessing step 𝐴𝑥 resembles data augmentation. If its primary function is to improve robustness via representation smoothing, the novelty may be overstated. Clarification is needed on whether the proposed framework represents a fundamentally new mechanism.\n\n6. The experiments inject noise into data and then apply denoising, creating a circular setup that demonstrates improvement. This does not convincingly validate the theoretical claims or show robustness in realistic settings.\n\n7. CIFAR-10 uses denoising (DnCNN), while miniImageNet uses encoding (Lu et al., 2025). Why not keep the processing method consistent, and how is the appropriate process determined for different datasets? The theory treats the processing step \n𝐴 as a general transformation matrix and is not dataset-specific.\n\nMinor: \n\n1. The experiments on small datasets such as CIFAR-10 and miniImageNet, and ResNet only, are not enough to convincingly support the theoretical claims. Evaluating on larger-scale datasets and other architectures, such as ViT, is encouraged. Though the paper emphasizes theoretical contributions, demonstrating practical benefits is still necessary to substantiate its real-world relevance.\n\n2.
