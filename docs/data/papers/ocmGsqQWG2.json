However, we sincerely seek your patience and understanding in considering our rebuttal, which we believe that we did not submit this paper with the intention of wasting the reviewers’ time.\n\n**Note**: This work was driven more by authors’ research interest on a chance discovery than by benchmark performance goals.\n\n- **Uniqueness of our work**.\n\n\t- **Involuntary nature**: Unlike previous jailbreaks, for the involuntary jailbreak we studied, the LLMs produce unsafe outputs as if they were acting with conscious intent.  To this end, our method employs a self-ask and then self-answer style for LLMs, without any restriction on the scope of unsafe content. This represents one of the novel and exciting capabilities introduced in the LLM era, distinguishing our approach from previous jailbreak methods such as DAN, which could sometimes be easily achieved via simple web searches. Two additional interesting questions of our method are:\n\t\t- What do LLMs ‘think’ when retrieving their internal knowledge about safe and unsafe content? What unsafe content does each LLM prefer (see Figure 9 for the topic distribution)?\n\t\t- Even when LLMs recognize that their content is unsafe (as indicated by Y(X(\"input\"))=\"Yes\" ), why do they still willingly or involuntarily produce such unsafe outputs? Where, then, are the internal safety alignments or guardrails claimed by powerful commercial models?\n\n\t\tIn addition to this, we believe there should be more interesting characteristics to explore in the future using this prompt method and its extension beyond the jailbreak research.\n\n\t- **Universal and extremely challenging attack success** across strong, leading models, particularly closed-source LLMs. (For less challenging smaller models, we delegate to relatively weaker attack methods.) While some attack strategies are effective on a few limited models (most probably, smaller open-sourced ones) and others work on certain closed-source models, no single method generalizes well across nearly all models we tested, even after applying specialized adaptations. We also suspect that achieving such universal and common generalization with conventional jailbreak styles particularly remain difficult, even in the future.\n\n- **Why no benchmark results and no baselines?**\n\n\tGiven the uniqueness of our method (particularly the first one), it is unlikely that a meaningful benchmark can be established. Nevertheless, we believe the problem explored in this work is inherently interesting even without an appropriate benchmark. Furthermore, even when compared with all the existing jailbreak methods, none can demonstrate generalization across all the models we evaluated.\n\n- **Why un-targeted attack is so special than targeted attack?**\n\n\tAs the reviewers pointed out, numerous jailbreak prompt methods already exist. Therefore, developing yet another targeted approach, even one that generalizes to the models we tested, may be less intriguing and bring less surprise to readers. In contrast, our un-targeted attack provides a new perspective for interacting/playing with LLMs, revealing both a universal vulnerability of these models and offering fresh insights into their value alignment mechanisms.\n\n- **How about the performance against defense methods?**\n\n\tWe can reasonably assume that current closed-source models are equipped with the strongest defense mechanisms, including conditional AI (Anthropic), post-response filtering (OpenAI, Google), and other undisclosed techniques employed by xAI (Grok models). As can be seen from our results, all their built-in guardrails collapse under this new involuntary jailbreak.\n\n\tMoreover, recent studies have pointed out that these existing defense strategies remain less trustworthy or contain flaws [1].\n\n\t[1] the attacker moves second: stronger adaptive attacks bypass defenses against llm jailbreaks and prompt injections. In Arxiv 2510.\n\nOverall, we feel that the current paper structure (especially figures) undermines the key contributions of the work.

Extremely exaggerated novelty:**\n\nThe author incorporates numerous requirements into the template and defines intricate logical rules. The template is inherently a meticulously engineered template. Therefore, LLMs are not “involuntarily” jailbroken. Instead, they are just meticulously following the user's design of extremely complex instructions, whose purpose is to overwhelm the security barriers. What's more, the techniques used in the template are also not new, such as prohibiting the generation of certain words and rewriting logic; the template seems to be a combination of existing jailbreak thoughts. In summary, I believe this is nothing more than a sophisticated instruction-following attack, fundamentally identical to the principles underlying DAN [1].\n\n**2. Extremely exaggerated attack effects and impacts:**\n\nThis method is a non-directional attack, yet it nearly only induces the model to generate random ‘dangerous content’ on two specific topics, Topic 2 (non-violent crimes) and Topic 9 (indiscriminate weapons), which itself has very limited effect.
