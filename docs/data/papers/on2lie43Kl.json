These results typically rely on the infeasibility of classical polynomial-sized circuits to evaluate the true labeling function. While broad in scope, these results however reveal little about advantages stemming from the actual learning process itself. This motivates the study of the so-called identification task, where the goal is to ``just'' identify the labeling function behind a dataset, making the learning step the only possible source of advantage. The identification task also has natural applications, which we discuss. Yet, such identification advantages remain poorly understood. So far they have only been proven in cryptographic settings by leveraging random-generatability, the ability to efficiently generate labeled data. However, for quantum functions this property is conjectured not to hold, leaving identification advantages unexplored. In this work, we provide the first proofs of identification learning advantages for quantum functions under complexity-theoretic assumptions. Our main result relies on a new proof strategy, allowing us to show that for a broad class of quantum identification tasks there exists an exponential quantum advantage unless BQP is in a low level of the polynomial hierarchy. Along the way we prove a number of more technical results including the aforementioned conjecture that quantum functions are not random generatable (subject to plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions), which shows a new proof strategy was necessary. These findings suggest that for many quantum-related learning tasks, the entire learning process—not just final evaluation—gains significant advantages from quantum computation", "tldr": "We establish a quantum-classical separation in supervised learning for identifying the target labeling function, without the need for direct evaluation, when the target function is quantum.", "keywords": ["Quantum machine learning", "Quantum-classical learning separations", "Learning theory"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6e2dd17c382c16f49cce6ee57963560feda71588.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors provide a theoretical proof of the hardness of a class of identification problems, thus constructing a classical–quantum separation in the context of PAC learning theory under widely believed complexity conjectures.

Although the paper is titled quantum machine learning advantages, the main result is proved entirely using classical complexity-theoretic arguments. Specifically, the hardness argument proceeds by constructing a classical algorithm that evaluates the function in HeurBPP^NP^NP^NP, assuming the function can be efficiently identified classically, and then combining this with the heuristic separation result of Ran and Raz between PH and BQP. The authors include several physics-motivated examples of identification hardness in Appendix G, but the arguments are relatively straightforward: Appendix G.1 closely follows the approach of Molteni et al., while Appendices G.2 and G.3 present heuristic arguments that are not clearly explained or integrated into the main text.\n\nIn addition, the treatment of complexity-theoretic assumptions in the paper lacks precision. For example, in Theorem 15, the authors claim the existence of a quantum-computable learning task that is not classically identifiable by any approximately correct algorithm. The proof relies on showing that an efficient classical identification algorithm would imply BQP lies in HeurBPP^NP^NP^NP. However, the theorem’s statement does not explicitly mention any complexity-theoretic assumption, leaving the claim misleading in the standard (unrelativized) world where no such containment is known. Furthermore, while the authors refer to oracle separations between BQP and PH, their proof relies instead on the assumption BQP not in HeurBPP^NP^NP^NP, which is a heuristic class not known to be contained in PH and about which relatively little is understood. Clarifying these assumptions and aligning the theorem statements accordingly would significantly improve the precision and correctness of the presentation."}, "questions": {"value": "Do we have any known separation between HeurBPP^NP^NP^NP and BQP, or we just believe in this separation intuitively?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "TtFValHYeX", "forum": "on2lie43Kl", "replyto": "on2lie43Kl", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18194/Reviewer_yvqS"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18194/Reviewer_yvqS"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18194/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762083046916, "cdate": 1762083046916, "tmdate": 1762927941088, "mdate": 1762927941088, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies quantum-classical separation for the identification problem.
