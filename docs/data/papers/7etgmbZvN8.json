Understanding how these models generalize to rare combinations of concepts is thus an important robustness problem. In this paper, we investigate how the pairwise co-occurrence of concepts in the pretraining dataset impacts CLIP and large multimodal model (LMM) performance on uncommon concept pairs. We measure concept co-occurrence with pointwise mutual information (PMI), which corrects for the correlation between single and paired concept frequencies. We show a strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M ($r=0.97$ and 14\\% accuracy gap between images in the top and bottom 5\\% of PMI values), and demonstrate that a simple PMI-based image edit can induce an accuracy drop of up to 10\\% on images edited to contain low PMI pairs. We additionally find that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs built on top of CLIP ($r=0.70$ for TextVQA, $r=0.62$ for VQAv2). Finally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning CLIP with augmented data covering a broad range of PMI values is a promising strategy to improve robustness on rare concept pairs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["multimodal models", "robustness", "CLIP", "vision-language models", "distribution shifts"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a6a839da86678e49524bc9205c2027ac749482d0.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f6e15b855de4a5a6a927ad88ce7c8e9fe5116a28.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper conducts a series of empirical studies on how the co-occurrence of concepts affects the zero-shot performance of CLIP and LLaVA. It uses pointwise mutual information (PMI) to measure how likely two concepts are to be correlated in the pre-training datasets. Based on this, the authors create synthetic image datasets containing both high-PMI and low-PMI samples, and find an almost linear relationship between PMI values and zero-shot performance. This indicates that CLIP's predictions are not robust to the main concepts, but instead depend on this brittle relationship. The authors further use a low-PMI dataset to fine-tune CLIP, which increases zero-shot performance and transfers to other datasets. They propose that PMI-guided data curation can be used to improve robustness."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "This paper presents a systematic study on the effects of the pre-training dataset.

Is this linear relationship between PMI and zero-shot performance dependent on the data curation? I mean, in line 185, does the selection threshold of 10,000 on frequency cause the linear relationship?\n\n2. I am also confused about how Figures 2a and 2b are obtained. What does each dot represent? Do they correspond to a set of (c_accessory, c_ImageNet) concept pairs within a certain PMI range computed on LAION-400M, and then you test zero-shot performance on those concepts generated in GenPairs? Please provide a more detailed method explaining how the plots in your main results are produced.\n\n3. The presentation needs improvement. For example, when I reached line 233, I still had no clear idea what a “key concept” is. Similarly, what is a “non-key concept pair”? These terms are not introduced before being used, which makes it hard for readers to follow.\n\n4. Although I acknowledge that this paper provides a systematic study of the robustness of VLMs from a data perspective, the idea is not groundbreaking. Prior work on spurious correlations and fairness has similarly used counterfactual generation or disadvantaged-group data generation to improve robustness. The low-PMI-guided data construction shares a similar idea with these approaches."}, "questions": {"value": "1. In lines 184–185, the authors describe how they extract concepts from LAION-400M. How do they avoid including non-noun or non-adjective words such as “a”, “the”, and “be”?\n\n2. Since PMI between two concepts is symmetric, have you tried swapping the zero-shot prediction target to c_accessory? Would that produce a similar trend?\n\n3. Flux.1-dev is a generative model, which seems to be tackling a harder task than zero-shot classification. I am curious why Flux.1-dev is able to generate low-PMI pairs, while CLIP struggles with them even in the zero-shot classification setting. I understand this question is hard to answer. I am asking mainly to discuss your perspective. Any insights or hypotheses would be helpful.\n\n4. How does the fine-tuned model perform on concept pairs with high PMI? Does its performance decrease?

This is valuable for future research."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. \"While visual concepts can be difficult to define and extract from images\": [1] has done exactly that. The concept extraction pipeline involves extracting visual concepts using an object tagger and provides a similar but more thorough text concept extraction function than this work. Additionally, [1] releases the concepts and artefacts for LAION-400M which is what the authors use. They could have just taken this metadata to run experiments. Having multimodal concepts allows for more fine-grained analysis, for example by taking the intersection of concepts per sample which ensures the concept exists in both image and text.\n\n2. Here a concept is defined as single lemmatised words extracted from captions. This approach would not be able to distinguish polysemous words (\"bat\" the animal, \"bat\" the sports equipment). It also would not take into consideration multi-word concepts (\"peanut butter\"). \n\n3. Fine-grained PMI accuracy correlation experiments are essential but missing: it would be good to know how correlation varies when considering caption length, number of concepts in the caption, etc. Also one probe that would be interesting would be to correlate single frequency concept performance with pairwise performance (for example a high frequency concept paired with an extremely rare concept may outperform two low frequency concepts that are not that rare. A small ablation to show this could benefit the work).\n\n4. I believe Eq 2 and 3 are incorrect: while estimating the empirical probability of a concept or pair of concepts in a dataset, it must be normalised by the number of documents not concepts (|D| instead of |C| and $\\binom{|C|}{2}$). This affects the PMI calculation and also leads to asymmetric Laplace smoothing.\n\n5. \"models struggle to disentangle individual concepts and generalize to new combinations\": the paper does not adequately establish this causality. Captions being unrelated/nosiy, synthetic image distribution bias in GenPairs, per-class frequency in pretraining could be factors that lead to that, not necessarily the co-occurence statistic.\n\n6. Similar to point 5, the finding of LMMs being biased towards answering \"yes\" for high PMI inputs needs to be studied further. Specifically, does the bias come from the vision or text encoder? Recent works have shown that LMMs are over-reliant on the LLM component [2]. Suggested experiment: replace the image with noise and see if the answer is still \"yes\".\n\n[1] Udandarao et al.

This would remove long-tailed concepts, which would skew the study of compositional performance, thus biasing the study of brittleness to rare concept pairs. Is it possible to check the number of concept pairs removed when setting a threshold (for example get different numbers for different thresholds)\n\n2. Why have two different Laplace smoothing coefficients for single concept and multi-concept probabilities?\n\n3. Fine-tuning CLIP with concept pairs with a wide range of PMI values shows promising avenues for data curation.
