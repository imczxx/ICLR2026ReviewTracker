In this paper, we construct strong white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images significantly increases attack difficulty. \nThrough rigorous evaluation across multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be broken. \nOur analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather, realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural images seem to offer inherent robustness. \nThis work highlights a significant obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for comprehensive security evaluation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Compression", "adversarial purification", "realism in compression", "adversarial defense", "adversarial attacks"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/33227300ef007c79acfd3a8bf20daeacde8ce07c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6f5a63d35c85ef73a542fd2493cd822976ce12ae.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper investigates the relationship between realism in image compression and adversarial robustness.

Since multiple reviewers requested evidence beyond classification, we additionally evaluated our method on a pixel-sensitive task: instance segmentation. We used YOLO-v11 [1] and evaluated robustness on the COCO dataset [2] under 10-step PGD attacks. The perturbation budgets 4/255 and 8/255 correspond to standard $l$ infinity threat models commonly used in adversarial robustness evaluation. In the white-box (WB) setting, gradients flow through both the compressor and the detector; in the black-box (BB) setting, gradients flow only through the detector.

Although high-realism models exhibit stronger robustness, do such realism-enhanced defense models require higher computational cost compared to low-realism ones when deployed in practice?\n\n2.

As the paper mentions, compression models with higher realism produce reconstructions that are more consistent with the natural image distribution, which benefits the classifier’s decision-making. Another possible explanation is that high-realism models can effectively remove adversarial noise. Which of these two factors is the dominant cause?
