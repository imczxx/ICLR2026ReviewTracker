Existing methods are constrained by an inherent trade-off: using multiple short prompts fed sequentially into the model improves action fidelity but compromises temporal consistency, while a single complex prompt preserves consistency at the cost of prompt following capability. We attribute this problem to two primary causes: temporal misalignment between video content and the prompt, and conflicting attention coupling between motion-related visual objects and their associated text conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, training-free attention mechanism, Temporal-wise Separable Attention (TS-Attn), which dynamically rearranges attention distribution to ensure temporal awareness and global coherence in multi-event scenarios. TS-Attn can be seamlessly integrated into various pre-trained text-to-video models, boosting StoryEval-Bench scores by 33.5% and 16.4% on Wan2.1-T2V-14B and Wan2.2-T2V-A14B with only a 2% increase in inference time. It also supports plug-and-play usage across models for multi-event image-to-video generation.

This expanded attention layer  requires additional input of temporal segmentation information, which is generated using either an external API, human data, or a simpler segmentation method.\n\nFinally, the work does very complete experiments which (except for the caveats in the weaknesses section) appear to produce an important improvement to the provided baselines, while being a relatively simple to implement addition to the video generation systems."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper has substantial strengths:\n\n1) the problem is worth solving, and the root cause analysis is excellent\n2) the presented method is (to the extent of my knowledge) novel and interesting; event-aware attention modulation in particular seems like an interesting approach to me\n3) the benchmark is very complete and required the integration to 3 different models, which is impressive\n4) the benchmark results that are indicated in the paper are very strong, except for the points raised in the weaknesses section which will hopefully be easy to fix\n5) finally, the paper is well written, and the explanation is very clear"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "This work presents a very complete analysis of an original method.\n\nThe soundness and contribution scores of this paper are diminished by ambiguity on the impact of latency in the full system, as explained below.\n\nSpecifically, the work would benefit from a more detailed explanation of how the uniform segmentation method works. When explaining this method, the paper refers to a number of events in the prompt, but it's unclear how the events in the prompt are parsed themselves. To me this seems like a critical point because if the event segmentation in the prompt has to be provided by a model for example, the time to run such segmentation should be accounted for in the latency analysis.\n\nThis applies generally to claims about latency, for example in figure 1c, and in other tables in the paper. It's unclear to me which segmentation method was used for each figure and table, whether segmentation itself was included in the latency analysis or not, and whether TS-Attn required additional human input that other methods didn't require (e.g. if uniform segmentation required manual selection of prompt events).\n\nIn summary, the paper could benefit from:\n\n1) more clearly specifying how the uniform segmentation method works\n2) providing details on which segmentation method was used for each figure and table\n3) providing details on the impact of segmentation on latency\n\nMy understanding is that in most figures the LLM API approach is used, and it only adds about 2-3 seconds to latency (changing the +2% latency claim to 2.2% or 2.3% perhaps), but it would be good to be more explicit about this.\n\nMore minor points:\n\n4) including the prompts used in the segmentation methods in the appendix could be an interesting addition.\n5) that figure 2 makes use of 3 colors, 2 of which can be easily confused with each other."}, "questions": {"value": "My main questions are about the segmentation pipeline and full impact on latency, which are discussed in detail in the weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "yjrApPHnl0", "forum": "QixNhagZ9t", "replyto": "QixNhagZ9t", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1323/Reviewer_oX7g"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1323/Reviewer_oX7g"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1323/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760723771476, "cdate": 1760723771476, "tmdate": 1762915736160, "mdate": 1762915736160, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Temporal-wise Separable Attention, a training-free method to improve video generation with complex multi-event prompts.
