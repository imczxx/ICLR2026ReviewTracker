However, their application in the industrial domain remains underexplored and often yields suboptimal results, primarily due to stringent requirements for technological maturity, safety, and standardization. \nTo address this gap, we leverage key techniques instrumental to the success of LLMs—such as the decoder-only architecture and scaling laws—rather than using LLMs directly, to develop a foundational model for industrial scheduling. In contrast to prior methods that focus on specific types of scheduling problems, our model is designed as a general-purpose framework capable of handling diverse task operations, objectives, and constraints reflective of real-world industrial environments. \nThrough extensive experiments, our foundation models have demonstrated clear superiority over conventional scheduling methods and algorithms using LLMs directly. Notably, the foundation models for scheduling have exhibited scaling law, generalization ability, and adaptability analogous to those observed in LLMs. \nThese results indicate that the principles underpinning LLMs extend beyond natural language processing, showing strong potential for broader industrial and manufacturing applications. \nCode at \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Foundation-Models-for-Industrial-Scheduling-7BD4}", "tldr": "Leveraging the techniques from LLMs to develop foundation models to solve real-world industrial scheduling problems", "keywords": ["Industrial Scheduling", "LLMs", "reinformance learning", "Scaling law"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c0f54689d0f74d2df6cac34858122d37487aebf3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The Foundation Model for Industrial Scheduling is proposed to address the shortcomings of applying existing LLMs (both, general purpose and fine tuned for specific sched probs) directly to complex (mixed task types, multiobjective, contstraints) industrial scheduling problems, which often results in suboptimal, inefficient, or unreliable solutions due to the stringent requirements of real-world environments.\n\nThrough extensive experiments, the study demonstrates superior performance in solution quality and efficiency compared to conventional methods and algorithms that stiffly use LLMs for the tasks from the aerospace manufacturing field.\n\nThe evidence exhibits scaling law, generalization ability, and adaptability analogous to those observed in LLMs, may be providing the first empirical evidence that the scaling law also holds for industrial problems."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "The experiments are quite comprehensive, covering comparisons across multiple algorithm categories, problem scales, industrial scheduling variants, and real-world industrial cases. \n- Broad comparison against diverse algorithms (e.g., PDRs, RL, LLM based methods, metaheuristic algorithms)\n- Validation Across Diverse Problem Scales and Instances (e.g., Randomly generated instances, standard benchmarks)\n- FM scaling validation (e.g., various parameter sizes)\n- Testing generalization and adaptability to variants (e.g., time limited FJSP, energy-aware multi-objective FJSP)\n- Fine tuning techniques (e.g., the use of LoRA and concepts similar to ControlNet were validated to show how efficiently the FM could be adapted to these distinct objectives and constraints.\nAnd at the end,\n- Application to real world industrial cases from the aerospace manufacturing field"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The potential weakness is the limited number of downstream tasks, which could limit the demonstration of its generalizability to industrial scheduling problems.\nThe model's adaptability to constraints was tested via time limits and the unique constraints of the BAW and engine casing production.

The core idea—leveraging the **\"technology stack\" of LLMs** (e.g., Decoder-only architecture, Scaling Law) rather than directly applying LLMs themselves to solve industrial scheduling problems—is highly innovative. This methodological shift effectively bypasses challenges like reliability, data sparsity, and specialization encountered when deploying LLMs in industrial settings, offering a new pathway for AI implementation in the industry.\n2.  By modeling the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) as the core problem and utilizing LLM-inspired design principles, the model demonstrates the potential to handle a mix of task types, objectives, and constraints. Experimental results, especially across various scales of FJSP instances, constrained variants, and real-world industrial cases, strongly support FMIS's superiority in generality and generalization over traditional specialized methods.\n3.  **First Empirical Evidence of Scaling Law**: This paper provides the first empirical evidence of the **Scaling Law** for industrial scheduling problems (though limitations exist at extremely large scales). This not only offers theoretical guidance for future industrial AI model development but also broadens our understanding of the \"large model\" phenomenon, suggesting its underlying mechanisms may extend beyond Natural Language Processing."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.   While PPO is common in LLM alignment, the paper primarily relies on PPO for training, which differs from the \"Pre-training + RLHF\" paradigm of LLMs. The authors mention the \"inherent limitations of industrial datasets, hence primarily adopting RL.\" Does this imply that scheduling tasks inherently lacking large-scale pre-training data are better suited for RL, or is the pre-training capacity of LLMs hard to transfer to the discrete scheduling action space? This point requires further clarification. Furthermore, the explanation for the failure of GRPO (inaccurate intermediate state value function estimation) warrants deeper investigation.\n2. Although a Decoder-only and self-attention mechanism is used, the model does not directly process \"token sequences\" or \"natural language instructions\" like LLMs. The input encoding (Job State, Machine State, Operation) and output (probability matrix $P_{(n,l) \\times m}$) are highly structured. This makes its similarity to LLMs lie more in the underlying Transformer structure and the Scaling Law, rather than in language understanding or generation capabilities. While not necessarily a drawback, the authors should more clearly delineate its difference from traditional Transformer-based methods and the specific meaning of \"Foundation Model\" in the industrial scheduling context.\n3.   The paper defines \"Foundation Model\" as a general framework trained on FJSP to adapt to various scheduling problems. However, while FJSP is general, its task definition and data structure are relatively fixed. It remains unclear how effectively the model can be applied to optimization problems with completely different structures (e.g., resource allocation, routing problems), and what degree of fine-tuning or architectural adjustment would be necessary. This impacts the breadth that the term \"Foundation Model\" can truly encompass in the industrial domain."}, "questions": {"value": "1.   You mention that model performance plateaus after 500M parameters. Do you believe this is due to an inherent complexity limit of industrial scheduling problems, suggesting a performance ceiling for the optimal solution, or is it a limitation of the current model architecture or RL training paradigm? Is there potential to break this bottleneck by improving the architecture or training strategy in the future?\n2.  How is $F(S)$ in the formula $P_{(n,l) \\times m} = \\text{Softmax}(\\text{Linear}(x) - F(S) \\cdot \\infty)$ specifically constructed? For instance, how are dynamic and complex rules such as \"machine failure\" or \"task cancellation\" encoded into the $F(S)$ matrix? What is the impact of this rule integration method on the model's scalability and real-time performance?\n3.  You mention that GRPO failed to achieve satisfactory results, partly due to inaccurate value estimation, especially for long-horizon trajectories. This implies a challenge posed by the sequence length and complexity of industrial scheduling problems to RL algorithms. Have you considered other RL algorithms, such as tree-search-based RL methods (e.g., AlphaZero) or Offline RL, which might have advantages in handling long trajectories and leveraging limited data?\n4.  The paper highlights the limitations of industrial datasets. Although RL is used for training, the success of LLMs hinges on massive pre-training. Is there a possibility for a \"general scheduling corpus\" for large-scale pre-training in the industrial scheduling domain? Or does the \"Foundation\" of FMIS refer more to its structure rather than \"general knowledge\" acquired through vast data, as with LLMs?\n5.  In discussing limitations, you mention that the model has not yet been applied or validated in real industrial environments. Given the strict requirements of industrial settings, what are the main challenges you foresee in deploying FMIS from a laboratory setting to an actual factory? For example, how to handle real-time data streams, ensure decision interpretability, and integrate with existing Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "mbWwo2QQvq", "forum": "qRjLjYrvMi", "replyto": "qRjLjYrvMi", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4828/Reviewer_F3y3"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4828/Reviewer_F3y3"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4828/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761963436573, "cdate": 1761963436573, "tmdate": 1762917598948, "mdate": 1762917598948, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes foundation models for industrial scheduling by adapting LLM techniques (decoder-only architecture, scaling laws) to flexible job-shop scheduling problems (FJSP).
