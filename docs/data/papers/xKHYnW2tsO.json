Recent systems incorporate large language models (LLMs) but still use prompt-based, deterministic pipelines that under-utilize LLM reasoning. In this work, we introduce MemoPhishAgent, the first memory-augmented multi-modal LLM agent framework that dynamically orchestrates five specialized tools to gather the evidence needed for phishing detection. Central to our design is an episodic memory system that captures past reasoning trajectories and final judgments, supporting three retrieval modes: (1) majority-vote for instant, high-confidence decisions, (2) in-context exemplars for guided LLM prompting, and (3) full ReAct for novel threats. Crucially, we evaluate under realistic conditions on two public benchmark datasets. Experiment results show that MemoPhishAgent outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across four metrics, achieving significantly higher recall while keeping latency manageable. Analysis of memory design demonstrates that episodic memory boosts recall by over 20% while reducing computational overhead. An ablation study further validates the necessity of the agent-based approach by comparing MemoPhishAgent to two simplified variants. Together, our results show that combining multi-modal reasoning with episodic memory yields robust, adaptable phishing detection in realistic user-exposure settings.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Phishing detection; LLM agent; Multimodal; Cybersecurity"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/13844823c9476ad2fd64f93027a8df3e03ea65bd.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MemoPhishAgent, a novel memory-augmented, multi-modal LLM agent framework designed for phishing URL detection.

The authors’ data collection effort and their proposed new approach show promising potential."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "### 1. Lack of the novelty\nThe paper repeatedly claims to be the first memory-augmented multi-modal LLM agent, yet prior work on memory-enabled or multi-tool agents (also cited by the authors) already explored similar structures. The distinction from previous “deterministic” or “static” agents is described conceptually, not experimentally. No quantitative comparison to these baselines under identical conditions is provided.\n\n### 2. Limited and Potentially Biased Baselines\nOnly two LLM-based baselines (PhishLLM, MLLM) are compared. Strong traditional or hybrid methods (e.g., URLTran) are excluded on the basis of “inferior performance” or “unavailable code,” which undermines fairness.\n\n“Reference-based” knowledge systems are said to underperform and thus are omitted, even though MemoPhishAgent’s majority-voting memory is conceptually similar to such retrieval paradigms.\n\n### 3. Metric Reporting Bias\nEvaluation focuses on a single operating point optimized for recall/F1. For a balanced understanding, PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, and cost-sensitive recall curves should be reported.\n\n### 4. Inconsistency of LLM Agent Behavior\nA notable issue—unaddressed in the paper—is the inconsistency of the LLM agent’s reasoning and action selection across identical or semantically similar inputs.\nBecause the ReAct loop depends on stochastic LLM generations without deterministic control (e.g., temperature > 0), the same sample may produce different tool sequences and conflicting conclusions.\nThis inconsistency undermines reliability, especially in a security-critical application such as phishing detection. \n\nThe authors should: Quantify decision variance under repeated inference (e.g., 10 runs per sample).\nEvaluate robustness under prompt paraphrasing and equivalent representations.\nClarify if any sampling control or output normalization (e.g., function-call schema enforcement) was applied.\n\nWithout such measures, MemoPhishAgent cannot guarantee stable judgments, which is a key weakness in deployment contexts.\n\n**I suggest additional experiments for strong paper.**\n\n1.

It is unclear why the crawl content tool parses HTML into markdown before analysis. Since the goal is to analyze keywords, plain HTML could be sufficient. The manuscript does not provide experimental justification demonstrating that markdown processing is superior to directly using HTML. \n2. The overall implementation process described in the paper is non-transparent. For example, important details such as the specific design and operation of each tool, the formats of inputs and outputs, the versions of the LLMs used, and the accuracy or reliability of individual tools are all missing or unclear. This lack of transparency makes it very difficult to assess the reliability and reproducibility of the proposed approach.\n3. The authors do not publish the details of their own SocPhish dataset or provide access for reproducibility. Table 1 shows that MemoPhishAgent achieves much better results on the SocPhish dataset compared to baselines, but the advantage is far less on public datasets (TR-OP and DynaPD), and for some metrics, baselines even outperform the proposed method. This raises concerns about generalization and data representativeness. \n4. The reasons why the Monolithic LLM architecture performs worse than the deterministic workflow agent are not well analyzed or explained. Additionally, there are cases where the Monolithic LLM matches or surpasses the proposed method, but the authors do not discuss these results. \n5. It is not specified what engine or data source is used for intelligent search. If an external web search is applied, there is a risk that the search may directly retrieve the ground-truth answer (e.g., whether a URL is phishing), rather than relying solely on agent-based inference. This could affect the fairness and validity of the experimental evaluation. The paper does not discuss this risk or explain what steps were taken to avoid answer leakage during intelligent search.\n6. The episodic memory module continuously accumulates past cases and reuses them in majority voting, but there is no mechanism to ensure the accuracy or correctness of previously stored decisions. If erroneous verdicts enter the memory, the majority-vote scheme might amplify these errors, potentially leading to false positives or negatives in future detections.
