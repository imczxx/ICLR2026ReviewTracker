In this work, we demonstrate that gradient clipping, a technique widely used in machine learning to mitigate gradient explosion, can significantly accelerate the escape from saddle points and improve the speed of convergence to second-order stationary points in distributed optimization. More specifically, we propose an algorithm that exploits gradient clipping to achieve faster convergence in distributed nonconvex optimization. The result is significant in that gradient clipping is necessary and widely used anyway to avoid exploding gradients in deep learning, and hence, the extra benefit of faster saddle avoidance is achieved for free. In fact, we prove that our algorithm converges to a desired second-order stationary point faster than all existing saddle avoidance approaches for distributed optimization.

Lack of Dependence on Network Topology: The theoretical analysis does not explicitly characterize how the convergence rates depend on the spectral properties of the connected matrix W. For a decentralized learning paper, explicitly showing this dependence is crucial.\n\n2. Novelty of Convergence Rates: The claimed faster convergence rates do not appear to constitute a significant advancement. The same rates have already been established in the centralized setting. Furthermore, the rate provided for the deterministic setting is comparatively slow.\n\n3. Technical Contribution and Motivation: The extension of non-convex optimization analysis to the decentralized setting is not hard. Because one can treat it as a  linear-constrained problem. The paper would greatly benefit from a more detailed and compelling explanation of its core technical novelty and motivation.\n\n4.
