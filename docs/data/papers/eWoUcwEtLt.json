Existing methods have attempted to infer the intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive priors, making it difficult to align with actual intrinsic dynamics; the other models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level, we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where LLMs are prompted as a physics expert to generate and revise constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel scenarios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Gaussian Splatting", "Physics-Driven 4D Interaction", "Scientific Discovery"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f1e1f5fb1488f5f10af7d22b4d470eb4db1880cc.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c4addf925e9c8e7366b5147b0971bec365061c81.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes VisionLaw, a bilevel framework that uses LLM-driven search to generate/edit symbolic elastic and plastic constitutive laws (upper level) and a differentiable MPM+renderer loop to fit continuous material parameters from video supervision (lower level).

I don't think LLM can differentiate StVK, neo-Hookean, fixed-corotated when the object is pure elastic.\n    - What if the LLM outputs python code with bugs that can crush the program?\n    - Why does direct joint evolution not perform well? It appears that the difference lies primarily in prompting and the available information and feedbacks are the same. Ablation studies are needed to motivate decoupled evolution.\n\n\n- Although the high-level ideas are clear, some details are lacking for reproducibility:\n    - What (modalities) are included in the feedback from the lower-level optimization?\n    - How is the first batch of constitutive model candidates are initialized? Are they generated by LLM based solely on multiview videos?\n    - How are the initial physical parameters set when the predicted constitutive models change?"}, "questions": {"value": "- The plastic corrections are derived from plastic flows applied on a specific elastic model. That is, even with the same plastic flow, different elastic model can result in different discrete deformation corrections (called plastic return mappings). For example, the von-Mises plasticity and Drucker-Prager plasticity used in the paper assume stVK elasticity model. The combination of fixed-corotated elasticity and von-Mises plasticity in H.1 BOUNCYBALL is fundamentally wrong.\n\n- How many lower optimizations are expected to run? It seems that each upper-level optimization are followed with multiple independent lower optimizations. Considering the above combination constraints, there are not many available constraints, for example, fewer than 10. I think it is doable to run brute-force lower-level optimizations to find the most fit, i.e., PAC-NeRF + brute-force sweep.
