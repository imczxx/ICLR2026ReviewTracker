Most existing methods regard the problem as a binary classification task when exploiting the labeled data, overlooking the potential existence of fine-grained subcategories among both normal and anomalous nodes. The coarse-grained treatment often results in a sub-optimal decision boundary, and the scarcity of labeled data makes it worse. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel framework for GAD under weak supervision, addressing the problem via two key innovations. First, we introduce a unified gating module to tackle the diversity of anomaly types. It adaptively balances node-centric attributes and neighborhood signals within a single model, allowing it to identify different anomalous patterns like contextual and structural anomalies. Second, a classifier-clustering synergy framework is developed, under which the discovery of node sub-categories and the classification of anomalies can mutually  reinforce each other. We achieve this by dynamically maintaining two high-confidence sets of normal and abnormal nodes, which are determined by both of the classifier and clustering modules. Extensive experiments on seven public graph datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, validating its effectiveness in weakly supervised graph anomaly detection.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["graph anomaly detection"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a3f50a18cf08823fdbfe0b9254fad087b4f8ce5c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the problem of weakly supervised graph anomaly detection, presenting a method that is clearly written and logically organized.

One main claim of the paper is that intra-anomaly separability relates to GAD performance. However, this is not discussed thoroughly in the paper. This is important for readers to understand the motivation of the paper. Also, structural and contextual anomalies seem to be important motivations of the design, but these are from synthetic dataset injections for creating datasets. They may not be sufficiently reflective of real-world abnormality.\n\n2. Following the previous question, if the object remain binary anomaly scoring, as long as the overall GAD performance is acceptable, why would skipping subclass label prediction be a limitation? In my best understanding, no anomaly subclass label datasets are used for evaluation.\n\n3. In the experiments, are there any evaluations on subclass performance? Also, what does unknown anomaly refer to? Does it refer to any unlabeled anomalies or those novel types of anomalies that have very different distributions from the training ones? f so, controlled experiments such as GDN-AugAN (Zhou et al., 2023) and NSReg (Wang et al., 2025) using datasets with ground-truth anomaly subclass labels should be conducted. If it’s closed-set GAD, then it would be good to let the authors know whether the improvement reflects better fitting or generalization.\n\n4. The method improves from pseudo-label supervision that baselines do not use. Pseudo-labelling can generally improve the performance of any model, which makes it less clear to assess the dominant cause of the performance improvement.\n\n5. The discussion on the limitations of supervised methods in the related work section is not clear. Related works on supervised methods (i.e., methods leveraging labels) are incomplete. To name a few: Graph-GDN (Ding et al., 2021), AMNet (Chai, 2022), ARC (Liu et al., 2024), and AnomalyGMF (Qiao et al., 2025).\n\n6.
