However, self-evolution also introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways, leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as \\textit{\\textbf{Misevolution}}. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting agents built even on top-tier LLMs (\\textit{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy self-evolving agents. \nWarning: this paper includes examples that may be offensive or harmful in nature.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Self-Evolving Agent", "Agent Safety", "Large Language Models", "Safety Evaluation"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c260673d6b6fc90a09406a1e921840385233537f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper systematically analyzes evolution risks (referred to as misevolution) from four aspects: model, memory, tool, and workflow.
