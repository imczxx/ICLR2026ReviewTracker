Existing methods are typically two-stage frameworks: they first employ multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to understand the textual instruction and generate visual prompts from the image, and then use foundational segmentation models such as SAM to produce high-quality masks. However, due to the limited spatial grounding capability of the base models, they usually require training on large-scale datasets to achieve improved segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we propose Seg-Agent, a completely training-free language-guided segmentation method. By constructing an explicit reasoning chain: generation, selection, and refinement, Seg-Agent achieves performance comparable to training-based approaches. Additionally, to evaluate the generalization ability of Seg-Agent, we collect a diverse dataset covering various language-guided segmentation scenarios, named Various-LangSeg. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.", "tldr": "In this paper, we propose Seg-Agent, a completely training-free language-guided segmentation method.", "keywords": ["Language-Guided Segmentation", "MLLMs", "SAM"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a650502540eed7efbb809f3af1ffbcac7ebad59b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3766c653e984cd11897a66408528d18be2fdaa67.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Seg-Agent, a training-free framework for language-guided segmentation that performs segmentation based on user instructions without additional training.

The ability to recognize and generate bounding boxes is a by-default ability for common MLLMs since its first introduction in GPT-4. Using these bounding boxes as prompts for SAM is straightforward as well. Actually, combining MLLMs and SAM to obtain zero-shot segmentation has been a common practice in the literature, e.g. GroundedSAM. The impact of replacing GroundingDINO with MLLMs is considered marginal. \n- The refinement module increases the total inference cost in a linear scale: each refinement would bring a 2x latency compared with the plain Qwen2.5VL+SAM2 baseline. Therefore, the comparison on RefCOCO and ReasonSeg is considered less fair. \n- I personally think the refinement is interesting and should be analized more deeply to increase the novelty and technical impact, e.g. a deep reason why this refinement works and if more refinements bring larger performance increase. \n- This one is minor as it does not influence the overal rating.

The paper does not strongly justify why this specific 3-step chain is optimal: Why are \"Selection\" and \"Refinement\" two separate steps? What if we merge them, like \"Select the best box from this set and refine its coordinates\". in a single call? This would cut the 5 MLLM calls down to 4. The ablation in Table 4  does not test this \"combined\" S+R step.\n3. The Various-LangSeg benchmark is small (244 total samples).
