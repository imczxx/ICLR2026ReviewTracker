They are particularly challenging due to ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries. Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are accurate and robust but are computationally expensive, especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for regular domains or focus primarily on forward modeling.\nTo fill this gap, we introduce *GeoFunFlow*, a geometric diffusion framework for inverse problems on complex geometries. GeoFunflow combines a novel geometric functional autoencoder (GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and produces continuous reconstructions of solution fields, while the diffusion model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across  five standard benchmarks, GeoFunflow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion baselines.", "tldr": "A geometric diffusion framework that solves PDE inverse problems on complex geometries", "keywords": ["operator learning", "flow matching", "diffusion models", "partial differential equations", "inverse problems"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1ce331e222e45c5c7bbbf9cce13ee2cf1edde23a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a transformer-based autoencoder designed to reconstruct a continuous function from sparse point observations.

While the paper frequently refers to flow-based prediction, the main contribution and experimental analysis appear to focus primarily on the autoencoder. The role and benefit of the generative (flow matching) component are only briefly demonstrated and not emphasized in the introduction. \n- Uncertainty estimation reliability: In the appendix (Figures 7 and 10), the uncertainty maps show that the flow-matching model remains highly confident in regions where reconstruction errors are large, which suggests that the uncertainty estimation may not be reliable.  \n- Limited baseline comparison: Although the related work section (Section 2) cites several studies on continuous modeling of PDE solutions, the experimental comparison includes only two of them, along with mostly interpolated discretized baseline models. The rationale for excluding other relevant methods, e.g. those based on neural fields, is unclear. The authors should either better position their approach with respect to these omitted baselines or include a broader set of comparisons. \n- Figure-text correspondence: The relationship between Figure 2 and the method description in Section 5 is unclear.

The architecture is a combination of several existing modules. Moreover, similar architectures have been proposed. In particular, AROMA that is already mentioned by authors, that already uses Perceiver + Diffusion for handling irregular grid and forecasting PDEs. In my understanding, the main difference between these 2 models lies in the decoder: GeoFunFlow uses a cViT whereas AROMA uses INRs. The method is not compared to this baseline neither in terms of architecture design nor in terms of performances. \n- Experiments: The experimental setup considers 6 baseline models. Out of these 6 models,  only 2 are designed to handle irregular grids. Others make use of interpolation. This weakens the results as a lot of models have been proposed to manage irregular geometries, (as detailed in the related work section): CORAL, AROMA, GINO, PCNO (already cited in paper), RIGNO [1], UPT [2] and many other more recent work. Moreover, I think more recent baselines considering Diffusion/flow matching could be considered such as DiffusionPDE already mentioned in the manuscript (by removing the PDE loss?) or [3-4].\n\n[1] RIGNO: A Graph-based framework for robust and accurate operator learning for PDEs on arbitrary domains, Sepehr Mousavi, Shizheng Wen, Levi Lingsch, Maximilian Herde, Bogdan Raonić, Siddhartha Mishra, 2025.\n\n[2] Universal Physics Transformers: A Framework For Efficiently Scaling Neural Operators, Benedikt Alkin, Andreas Fürst, Simon Schmid, Lukas Gruber, Markus Holzleitner, Johannes Brandstetter, 2024\n\n[3] Scalable diffusion models with transformers, William Peebles and Saining Xie, 2022.\n\n[4] Generative latent neural pde solver using flow\nmatching, Zijie Li, Anthony Zhou, and Amir Barati Farimani, 2025."}, "questions": {"value": "-\tCould you explain the differences with respect to AROMA ?

With respect to other diffusion baselines? \n-\tCould you provide run time/inference time comparison ? Since the model makes use of a Diffusion process, that involved an iterative process, I think a comparison on this aspect is important. \n-\tHow does the method scales in terms of memory consumption ? Perceiver, and more generally attention bases technique have bad scaling behavior with respect to the trajectory length/number of points? \n- How are the latent queries size are chosen? \n- Unfortunately, I am not an expert in the proposed theoretical analysis that makes use of tools i am not well-aware of. However, line 358, it is stated that we can analytically compare a convergence rate. Is it possible to add the theoretical rate to the figure? This will help for clarity. Is this convergence rate really verified in practice on quasi-uniform grids (as stated lines 352-359) ? \n- Regarding the note on benchmark (line 967-971), Why couldn't GeoFunFlow be conditioned only on the geometry of the PDE? By training the model to regress static PDE data, the model could encode itself the dynamic and thus be able to reconstruct the solution based only of the geometry? \n- Regarding training time provided in appendices: Why is the training time of GeoFAE sometime higher than GeoFunFlow? In my understanding, GeoFunFlow include GeoFAE, thus include also the training time of GeoFAE? \n\n### Minor comments\n- Could you precise, what '-' are meaning in Table 1?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "m5LE4YLKfT", "forum": "uWJaN9V42N", "replyto": "uWJaN9V42N", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9358/Reviewer_HsZe"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9358/Reviewer_HsZe"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9358/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761750291289, "cdate": 1761750291289, "tmdate": 1762920979618, "mdate": 1762920979618, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses inverse problems governed by PDEs on complex geometries, where the goal is to reconstruct physical fields from sparse and noisy sensor measurements.
