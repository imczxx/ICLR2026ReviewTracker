It has been empirically observed in prior studies that when recovering $\\mathbf{\\Pi}^{\\natural}$, there exists a phase transition phenomenon: the error rate drops to zero rapidly once the parameters reach certain thresholds. In this study, we aim to precisely identify the locations of the phase transition points by leveraging techniques from (message passing) (MP). \n\n\nIn our analysis, we first transform the permutation recovery problem into a probabilistic graphical model. Then, we leverage the analytical tools rooted in the message passing (MP) algorithm and derive an equation to track the convergence of the MP algorithm. By linking this equation to the branching random walk process, we are able to characterize the impact of the \\emph{signal-to-noise-ratio} ($\\mathsf{snr}$) on the permutation recovery.  Depending on whether the signal is given or not, we separately investigate the oracle case and the non-oracle case. The bottleneck in identifying the phase transition regimes lies in deriving closed-form formulas for the corresponding critical points, but only in rare scenarios can one obtain such precise expressions. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Gaussian approximation method, which  allows us to obtain the closed-form formulas in almost all scenarios. \nIn the oracle case, our method can fairly accurately predict the phase transition $\\mathsf{snr}$. In the non-oracle case, our proposed algorithm can predict the maximum allowed number of permuted rows and uncover its dependency on the sample number.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["message passing", "combinatorial optimization"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dcc1e6cafa78773a8c1b41e7704cf9f4268bec96.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7941806ae9cdd947e95def9a77899ac5a9fb0f43.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies shuffled regression problem, the goal of which is to find permutation matrix and coefficient matrix.

Couldn’t it be written in closed form as $\\text{snr}{\\text{oracle}} = \\dots$?

Does “sharply drops to zero” mean that the error probability literally becomes zero after the threshold, or that it rapidly converges to zero as SNR increases?\n\nThere are too many places where explanations are missing, making it very difficult for this reviewer to understand the paper’s contribution. While domain experts may be able to follow the arguments quickly, for readers with partial background knowledge, the paper feels quite unfriendly. At minimum, the authors should provide Appendix references or guidance for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Overall, the writing feels quite rushed.\n\n3. The paper describes the phase transition only under settings where all variables grow linearly proportionally. However, there can be other asymptotic regimes where $n$ increases at a slower rate than the number of samples, e.g., $n \\propto \\sqrt{m}$, while still diverging. The current results appear limited to a restrictive setting where $m, n, p$ satisfy fixed linear ratios.\n\n\n4. Assumption 1 introduces an independence assumption that seems questionable. Even if the numerical results do not show issues, can such independence really be assumed freely? For instance, since the same $W_i$ contributes linearly to all $E_{ij}^{\\text{oracle}}$ with the same $i$, these random variables are almost certainly dependent.\n\n5. The non-oracle case appears much more interesting and practical than the oracle one, but Section 4 does not seem to provide any theoretical results for SNR. Only the mean and variance of $\\Xi$ are presented. Does Section 4 only describe how the error probability is measured? Are there no theoretical results regarding the SNR?\n\n**Minor Comments**\n\n1. In the abstract (lines 17–19), “message passing” is repeated too soon. It might be better to end line 17 with “identify the locations of the phase transition points” and mention message passing later when describing the analysis.\n- 1-1) Additionally, the abstract feels unusually long.\n\n2. The paper cites Lufkin et al., 2024 as “published this February,” but it is listed as a 2024 paper. Perhaps the timing is mixed up, or this line was copied from an earlier draft.\n\n3.
