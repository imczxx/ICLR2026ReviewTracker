We propose the Hindsight-Foresight Prompt (HiFo-Prompt), a novel framework for LLM-based AHD designed to overcome these limitations. This is achieved through two synergistic strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight acts as a high-level meta-controller, monitoring population dynamics(e.g., stagnation and diversity collapse) to switch the global search strategy between exploration and exploitation explicitly. Hindsight builds a persistent knowledge base by distilling successful design principles from past generations, making this knowledge reusable.  This dual mechanism ensures that the LLM is not just a passive operator but an active reasoner, guided by a global plan (Foresight) while continuously improving from its cumulative experience (Hindsight). Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt significantly outperforms a comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art AHD methods, discovering higher-quality heuristics with substantially improved convergence speed and query efficiency.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Evolutionary Computation", "Guided Prompt Synthesis", "Knowledge Accumulation", "Automated Algorithm Design"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/27e6f0d063f52178ef07930ac0b16ef34d38d5b1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces HiFo-Prompt, a new method for LLM-based AHD.

The Insight Pool’s novelty filtering relies on Jaccard similarity over token sets. While this removes near-duplicate sentences, such a pure text-based comparison cannot capture semantic overlap. For example, one insight might be expressed in different ways. Since this novelty threshold is crucial for ensuring diversity, I worry this design may harm the actual effectiveness of the diversity mechanism.  \n\n2. The combination of a usage penalty and a recency bonus in $U(k, t)$ aims to balance exploration and exploitation, but the dynamics between these opposing terms are not analyzed. This could be sensitive in practice, and it would be helpful to justify or empirically demonstrate that this interaction leads to stable selection rather than oscillatory behavior. In particular, $w_u$ is a hyperparameter without ablation or sensitivity analysis, and the calculation of $B_r$ is not clearly presented. This reduces the soundness and reproducibility of the method.  \n\n3. The mapping from normalized performance $\\tilde{\\rho}$ to the effective credit $g_{\\text{eff}}$ uses manually chosen piecewise constants (0.8, 0.6, 0.5, -0.3, etc.) with no theoretical justification or ablation. While the idea of tiered reward regimes is understandable, the specific scaling choices seem ad hoc and may not generalize across tasks. It would strengthen the work to at least provide hints or guidelines on how to select these values.  \n\n4. The definition of phenotypic diversity as the fraction of non-identical algorithm text strings feels coarse and potentially misleading. The measure is a bit lexical that two code snippets are treated as completely different even if they differ only by refactoring or variable renaming, ignoring actual semantic or functional similarity (similar with my commen in 2.). As a result, the system may overestimate diversity and trigger unnecessary exploration. Moreover, this approach scales as $O(|P|^2)$ comparisons per generation, which may become inefficient for larger populations and increase token consumption for LLM-based evaluations. The diversity threshold is also arbitrary and not justified or ablated. Overall, the lack of semantic grounding and unclear efficiency raises concerns about the robustness and practicality of the Navigator’s diversity control.  \n\n5. The experimental section raises several concerns about fairness, reproducibility, and efficiency. Although the paper states that all LLM-based baselines were evaluated under the same Qwen 2.5-Max model, implementation details and prompt adaptations are not provided, so fairness remains unclear (like baselines might use different LLMs, thus they can not be comparied directly). HiFo-Prompt’s runtime on small TSP instances (Table 1) is about an order of magnitude slower than competing methods, with no explanation, contradicting the claim of improved convergence speed. Token-usage statistics are summarized only coarsely (Appendix C.7) without breakdown or cost analysis, leaving uncertainty about true computational overhead. The brief multi-LLM comparison (Table 9) covers only two tasks and lacks analysis, providing little evidence of model generality. Finally, runtime behavior is inconsistent across tables (slower in TSP 10–50 but faster in TSP 100–500) with no explanation. Together, these issues make it difficult to assess the practical efficiency and generalizability of the proposed framework.  \n\n6. The code does not seem to be provided. Even though the authors share the core prompts, several computational details remain unclear, as mentioned in earlier points. This makes it hard to guarantee reproducibility and verify the soundness of the proposed method.  \n\n**Minors**\n\n1.
