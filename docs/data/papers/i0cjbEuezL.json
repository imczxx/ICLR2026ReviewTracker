The linear growth of the KV Cache with dialogue history imposes substantial computational costs, and existing eviction strategies often degrade performance by repeatedly compressing early conversational context, leading to information loss and context forgetting. This paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \\textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism} for KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression method without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation mechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns. Compression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs of the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of older context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our results demonstrate that FlowKV consistently and significantly outperforms baseline strategies in maintaining instruction-following accuracy and user preference retention from 10.90\\% to 75.40\\%, particularly in later conversational turns.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multi-Turn Conversation", "KV  Cache"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/004e1ea2dfc7f69217c401816c3ea149d43bf706.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents FlowKV, a training-free mechanism for managing KV caches in multi-turn conversational LLMs. Unlike standard eviction or compression strategies that repeatedly re-compress historical cache entries, FlowKV introduces a multi-turn isolation mechanism that preserves previously compressed states and only applies compression to the newly generated turn. The method is lightweight, compatible with any existing KV cache compressor, and aims to maintain contextual coherence and preference retention in long dialogues. Extensive experiments on Multi-IF and PrefEval benchmarks show consistent improvements, e.g., boosting instruction-following rates by 20–40% and preference retention from ~10% to ~75% compared to baselines like SnapKV or ExpectedAttention.

While the method is well-motivated, the theoretical section (Appendix D) remains descriptive rather than analytical. A more formal quantification of “information degradation under repeated compression” would strengthen the contribution.\n\n2. The study primarily focuses on instruction-following and preference tasks. Additional experiments on open-domain dialogue or reasoning datasets (e.g., LongBench, SCBench full set) would improve generalization claims. In particular, the latency analysis is conducted with only 8K tokens, which is insufficient to reflect the performance characteristics of modern long-context models.\n\n3. The core mechanism, isolating KV compression by excluding already-compressed states, is a relatively minor modification of prior methods such as ExpectedAttention. Essentially, it changes the compression scheduling from “compress the entire history each turn” to “compress only the new uncompressed portion,” which may be seen as an incremental rather than a conceptual advance.\n\n4. The experimental comparison omits several recent long-context optimization methods that are closely related, even if not multi-turn–specific, including PyramidKV, ArkVale, and PQCache. These techniques also address KV efficiency and contextual preservation and could provide a stronger and fairer baseline for FlowKV’s evaluation.\n\n5. The paper lacks ablations isolating each component of FlowKV (e.g., what if isolation occurs every n turns, or partial re-compression is allowed). Such analysis could clarify where most of the gains originate.\n\n6. Some mathematical equations could be refined (e.g., in Eq. 7-9, I cannot find the definition of F).

The claimed \"multi-turn isolation mechanism\" is essentially a straightforward and obvious engineering adaptation of existing frameworks such as `kvpress` to multi-turn settings. This is a natural and expected implementation choice when extending any prefilling compression method to multi-turn use. The paper does not introduce a new compression function or theoretical principle; instead, it modifies the scheduling of existing operations. Hence, the core novelty is minimal. A **deeper** exploration of how importance-based eviction schemes inherently handle (or fail to handle) the re-compression problem in multi-turn settings would strengthen the paper's positioning and clarify the novelty of the proposed turn-level isolation framework, especially given that FlowKV modifies the management process rather than the compression algorithm itself.\n\n2. The baselines are originally designed for prefilling. When directly reused in multi-turn settings without appropriate adaptation, they naturally suffer from repeated compression. Comparing FlowKV against such unadapted baselines inflates the relative gain and makes the comparison less fair.\n\n3. Only 3 runs with no error bars/significance. PrefEval relies solely on GPT-4o as judge, which may introduce subjectivity and bias. To strengthen the empirical evidence, the paper should include more objective and diagnostic benchmarks， such as \"Needle in a Haystack\" or long-context retrieval tasks.\n\n4. As depicted in Fig. 3, FlowKV only compresses the system prompt, while keeping the query and response KV uncompressed within that turn. The paper could benefit from a clearer more comprehensive discussion since many previous works compress all of them dynamically.\n\n5. Algorithmic specification is underspecified. No clear pseudocode or exact buffer layout to ensure “isolation” across turns; Eq. (12) contradicts the narrative by writing F(C1’) rather than selectively compressing only the latest uncompressed segment.  \n\n6. Ambiguity about how “prompt-related” segments are defined and tracked in the KV buffers turn-by-turn (token boundaries, role tags, streaming generation).
