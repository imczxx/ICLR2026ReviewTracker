Pioneering Cognitive Architecture (First GNWT Implementation)\nThe paper presents the first computational implementation of the Global Workspace Theory (GNWT) for generative agents. This is a significant theoretical breakthrough, providing LLM agents with a human-like \"consciousness\" mechanism (the global workspace broadcast) that integrates information from specialized sub-agents (e.g., emotion, memory), resulting in agents with high Psychological Fidelity.\n\n2. Achieves Authentic and Dynamic Personality Evolution\nCogniPair successfully overcomes the \"static\" nature of previous LLM agents. By utilizing the GNWT broadcast mechanism, the agents can dynamically update their internal states and preferences based on social experience. This leads to superior performance in modeling partner preference evolution, achieving 72.5% accuracy and showing that the agents can genuinely learn and adapt over time.\n\n3. High Social Realism and Practical Generalization\nThe agents demonstrate strong social simulation capabilities, achieving a 72% correlation with human attraction patterns in the speed dating scenario. Furthermore, the architecture proves its generalization capability by successfully transferring the model to different social decision contexts, such as job interviews (with 81% accuracy), highlighting its broad practical value for various social pairing applications.\n\n4. Strong Validation Through Human Studies\nThe model's psychological authenticity is validated through human trials. Participants rated the behavioral accuracy of their digital twins at 5.6/7.0 and agreed with their twins' choices 74% of the time. This high degree of human endorsement significantly boosts the credibility and real-world applicability of the CogniPair framework."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The title is not smooth.\n2.

I understand that building such a big system is difficult, but Theory of Mind is inevitable when talking about dating tasks. \n4. Missing Analysis: The paper lacks a detailed quantitative analysis of the latency and cost increase (e.g., in terms of API calls or tokens per decision) when moving from a baseline agent to the full GNWT-Agent.\n5. Missing SOTA Social Agents: The comparison largely focuses on Reflexion-Style Agents. The paper omits direct comparisons with other state-of-the-art architectures specifically designed for complex social interaction, such as those that explicitly model Theory of Mind (ToM).\n6. Missing GNWT Mechanism Baselines: To truly validate the design, the paper should include ablations comparing the implemented GNWT features against alternative designs, such as using local broadcasting (instead of global) or different attention/priority mechanisms in the global workspace.\n7.
