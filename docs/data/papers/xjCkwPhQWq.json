While existing methods generate part-level 3D objects, they often fail to organize these parts into distinct instances in open-world scenes. Through a debiased clustering probe, we reveal a critical insight: this failure stems from the lack of structural constraints within the model's internal assignment mechanism. Based on this finding, we reframe the task of structured 3D scene generation as a global correlation assignment problem. To solve this, SceneTransporter formulates and solves an entropic Optimal Transport (OT) objective within the denoising loop of the compositional DiT model. This formulation imposes two powerful structural constraints. First, the resulting transport plan gates cross-attention to enforce an exclusive, one-to-one routing of image patches to part-level 3D latents, preventing entanglement. Second, the competitive nature of the transport encourages the grouping of similar patches, a process that is further regularized by an edge-based cost, to form coherent objects and prevent fragmentation.  Extensive experiments show that SceneTransporter outperforms existing methods on open-world scene generation, significantly improving instance-level coherence and geometric fidelity.

Extending the end-to-end structured generation pipeline from the object level to the scene level is an interesting endeavor, which simplifies the common \"divide and conquer\" solution and provides bigger potential for scaling up. \n\n2.

This work builds upon PartPacker [Tang et al. 25]. By analyzing the latent structure of part-level generators, the authors observe that part tokens lack structure constraints, leading to mixed patch-to-part assignments in the DiT architecture. The authors thus propose to solve optimal transport (OT) problems to guide the assignment of image patches to part tokens in attention maps. In the OT formulation, the authors also consider the image edge map in the assignment cost to promote coherent structures grouping.

They find that the learned features implicitly encode part structures, but the networks do not establish part associations explicitly. This analysis motivates their method of enforcing explicit patch-to-part constraints in attention maps.\n- The authors propose to use entropy-regularized optimal transport to guide the assignment of image patches to part tokens in attention maps. To promote region-wise consistency and reduce information exchange across image regions, the authors incorporate image edge maps into the assignment cost of the OT problem, which I find interesting.\n- The authors compare their method with baselines including MIDI, PartCrafter, and PartPacker on structured 3D scene generation from a single image.

While these cartoon-style scene images show the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is unclear how well the method can generalize to real-world images with more complex structures.\n- While this explicit patch-to-part assignment approach improves the generation of coherent object-level parts, it seems that the method struggles to generate fine-grained details. For example, in Fig. 6 (Uni geo), the boats in the bottom part of the image are not well generated, whereas the standard cross-attention method correctly generates the five boat shapes. This makes me wonder if the proposed method may overconstrain the information exchange and thus reduce the context information from other image patches needed for generating fine details.\n- Several implementation details (like hyperparameters for the OT solver, training details) are missing. This makes it hard to reproduce the results. Quantitative ablation results are also not included."}, "questions": {"value": "- Have the authors trained and tested SceneTransporter, for example, on real-world indoor scene images? If so, how well does the method work on such images?\n- In the generated results, the proposed method struggles with fine detail generation, however, the evaluation metrics (Geometry Fidelity) do not seem to reflect this, which is concerning. \n- In the ablation study, only qualitative results are provided. It is unclear, for example, how much improvement the edge-regularized Assignment cost brings. Other ablations like the authors enable OT plan-gated attention in the first half of the DiT blocks, but it is unclear whether this is the optimal choice and how it affects the geometry fidelity to input images."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "b64x7FqZtb", "forum": "xjCkwPhQWq", "replyto": "xjCkwPhQWq", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4446/Reviewer_vKGo"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4446/Reviewer_vKGo"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4446/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761518849166, "cdate": 1761518849166, "tmdate": 1762917369896, "mdate": 1762917369896, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces SceneTransporter by reformulating the task of structured 3D scene generation as a global correlation assignment problem."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.
