Thus, we have very limited view of the performance of the proposed approach across networks of varying sizes both in terms of the number of agents and the size of the state space. Hence, the important aspect of scalability and robustness remains underexplored.\n\n\nThere are many assumptions that are part of the paper’s analysis (to be expected in a theoretically oriented paper). For example, Assumption 6. But, it is deferred to the appendix. It is better to make the main paper self-contained by summarizing or at least highlighting such essential assumptions within the main text. Similarly, many theorems and results are presented with minimal discussion of their intuition or motivation. Including brief insights/intuition into the meaning and implications of these results would significantly improve the paper’s readability. In general, some discussion on the need or motivation for assumptions is needed. \n\nSimilarly, some of the key definitions such as v^\\pi  and u^\\pi are currently given in the appendix, even though they are central quantities that are used throughout the paper. Bringing these definitions into the main text would enhance clarity and help readers follow the theoretical development more easily.\n\nThe polynomial-time convergence and approximation guarantees are built on regularity assumptions such as Lipschitz smoothness and bounded best-response mismatch coefficients. These conditions may not hold in many practical economic settings. A more detailed discussion of their limitations and how potential violations might impact convergence or solution quality would make the contribution more transparent and guide future research in this direction.\n\nFinally, while the authors claim polynomial-time convergence to approximate equilibria, the paper provides limited information on approximation bounds or exploitability levels achievable in practice. The paper needs a clarification or acknowledgment  regarding any possible trade-off between computational effort and the quality of equilibrium approximation proposed in the paper; this would strengthen the practical relevance and interpretability of the results.

Are there any known limitations or additional challenges that might arise in such scenarios? \n\nMost of the analysis rely on assumptions such as Lipschitz smoothness and bounded best-response mismatch coefficients. Also, the algo needs gradients of the rewards and transition probabilities. This seems to a strong requitement. Please clarify; if so, some discussion is needed. \n\n What would happen if these assumptions were violated. For instance, if these regularity conditions do not hold, which may often be the case in real-world infinite economic settings, how would that affect convergence, stability, or the overall validity of the theoretical guarantees?\n\nThe computational experiments currently focus on linear and Cobb-Douglas utility functions, which are standard but relatively well-behaved. \n\nThe plot of exploitability for the Cobb-Douglas seems to have not converged to zero during the reported horizon of the computation; some discussion is needed. \n\nOverall, to me it looks like the discussion about the computational results is very short and can be enhanced. \n\nCould the approach be extended to more general utility forms where these assumptions do not hold? Would such cases introduce potential stability challenges such as mode collapse or convergence failure, and if so, what mitigation strategies could be considered?\n\nThe computational architecture is generative-adversarial network (GANs) and they is known to be prone to issues like mode collapse; alternatives like W-GAN are prompted by such considerations.
