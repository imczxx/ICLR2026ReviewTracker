Still, some challenges remain unsolved when acquiring informative signal. An existing trade-off hinders the choice of which one to use: sequencing-based technologies provide high-throughput profiles, while imaging-based outperform regarding spatial resolution. On the sequencing-based side, the minimal spatial unit, called spot, comprises more than one cell, yielding slightly blurred expression profiles. To avoid inaccurate analysis and misinterpretation of spatial data, we believe that cells inside a single spot should be isolated and allocated into subspots. We propose a computational method based on graphs and attention learning, named Square, that leverages message passing for information sharing between neighbor spots. Even though this rearrangement of cells can be solely spatially approximated, a resolution enhancement is achieved. We show that the proposed approach is capable of deciphering the composition of ST spots, whilst imputing sparse profiles and amplifying the signal in them. Newly generated subspots have been empirically and biologically validated. The gap between both spatial transcriptomic modalities is then closed, generating high-throughput cellular-scale outputs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph", "spatial transcriptomics", "resolution", "attention", "distribution shift."], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c8079a5eb5a439d1af5f6ebd159e4bd41dc04a3b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a computational method named Square, which is based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT) and aims to enhance the spatial resolution of spatial transcriptomics data.\n Through self-supervised learning, the method decomposes each sequencing spot into multiple subspots, thereby achieving super-resolution reconstruction of spatial transcriptomic profiles without requiring additional single-cell RNA-seq reference data.\n The core contribution of the paper lies in integrating a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a graph attention mechanism, which leverages information from spatially neighboring spots via message passing and attention weighting to infer subspot-level gene expression profiles.\n The authors validate the method on synthetic data, simulated mouse olfactory bulb data, and real human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) datasets, demonstrating that Square can generate subspots with more homogeneous cell-type compositions and uncover biologically meaningful spatial structures that are otherwise obscured in low-resolution data."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "Combines the denoising and representation learning capabilities of the VAE with the spatial dependency modeling of the GAT, while introducing virtual nodes and a self-supervised training strategy.\n The paper is well organized and clearly presented."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.
