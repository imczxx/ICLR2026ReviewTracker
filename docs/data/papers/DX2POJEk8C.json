If users inappropriately apply these long-tail learning methods, it may result in worse accuracy than expected.\nHowever, there is no scientific guideline for these methods in the existing literature.\nIn this paper, we first collect the widely used methods of existing long-tail learning and then conduct extensive and systematic experiments to provide a guideline for the accurate use of these methods in fine-tuning foundation models.\nFurthermore, we observe that the current comparison protocol ignores the influence of training cost and hyperparameter selection, which may potentially lead to unfair comparisons and biased results.\nMotivated by our empirical studies, we propose a unified fine-tuning framework for long-tailed recognition.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods on multiple long-tailed datasets, including ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.", "tldr": "We provide a scientific guideline for the accurate use of long-tail learning methods in fine-tuning foundation models.", "keywords": ["long-tail learning", "class-imbalanced learning", "fine-tune"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/415d94b1d5539bca77af1caae8732e3e5ec6eefc.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6daba1e7030f9f0d9624df0fdb0c1b2789a958e4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper systematically studies how classic long-tailed learning methods perform when applied to fine-tuning foundation vision models.

Works such as [b] and [c] have also examined biases in foundation models under long-tailed distributions, and LPT [d] offers a deeper investigation as well. I recommend that the authors reconsider the positioning of their contribution and more precisely articulate the gap their work aims to fill, rather than relying on an overly broad claim.\n\n(2) The results on several benchmarks do not appear to surpass LIFT, which achieves competitive performance with only 10 training epochs and minimal additional techniques. From this standpoint, it is difficult to assess the practical significance and novelty of the proposed method.\n\n(3) Many of the examined techniques and strategies depend heavily on training hyperparameters such as the number of epochs, learning rate. More experiments are required to understand how sensitive the proposed tricks are to these hyperparameters and to more fully validate their robustness.\n\n[a]  Shi, Jiang-Xin, et al. \"Long-tail learning with foundation model: Heavy fine-tuning hurts.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.10019 (2023).
