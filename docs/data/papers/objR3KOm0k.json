In contrast to conventional greedy methods such as CART and C4.5, which construct trees via locally top-down splits, BONSAI formulates tree induction as an approximation optimization problem based on a new slot-node structure that can deal with both categorical and numerical features. To improve the performance and interpretability, BONSAI combines a compact optimization formulation with efficient search-space reduction techniques, thereby avoiding the combinatorial overhead of traditional mixed-integer programming (MIP) approaches.

Perhaps more important, it does not actually lead to more “optimal” trees as evident by the lower *training accuracy* compared to Quant-BnB and FIGS. Further, while the search-space reduction technique is presented as a way of speeding up combinatorial optimization, there is no analysis of trade-off between runtime and performance as we control the parameters that reduce the state-space.\n- As such, the success of the proposed methodology seems to be more related to the regularization provided by the minimal threshold distance and the sampling.\n- The proposed methodology has limited technical novelty: minimal threshold distances have been considered before as noted in the paper (including in optimal decision trees, e.g., in [8]) and threshold sampling was also used as noted in the paper. Further, similar techniques could easily be encoded into other existing optimal decision tree approaches and potentially provide useful regularization.\n\nExperiments:\n- I am not convinced the comparison between the models is fair: there seems to be a uniform depth constraint across all models of maximum depth of 3. However, given that the proposed approach utilize multiple branches while approaches like Quant-BnB are utilizing binary splits, the trees generated by the proposed approach can be significantly more complex. While comparing binary trees under a maximum depth makes sense, when considering multiway trees, I am concerned this does not lead to fair comparison and perhaps a comparing under maximum number of splits is more appropriate?\n- The paper misses many relevant baselines, especially considering the emphasis on multiple splits and regularization. These include stronger optimal baselines such as DPDT [1], Blossom [2], Top-K trees [3], TAO [4], modern multiple split approaches like Branches [5], and approaches that optimize complexity such as GOSDT [6] and SPLIT [7].\n- Given the emphasis on regularization, it is not clear: (1) which hyper parameters were tuned for each baseline and how were they selected? (2) whether simple techniques like cost complexity pruning were used to improve generalization of techniques like Quant-BnB.\n- No ablation and sensitivity analysis for the hyper-parameters of the proposed approach are provided.\n- No runtime analysis and comparison\n- No details on implementation (e.g., what solver is used) and the paper notes that one hyper parameter setting was used but it is not provided. In addition to the fact that the source code was not provided, this hurts the reproducibility of the results.\n\nAlso, the positioning of the work in the literature in Table 1 misses key relevant works: in particular, GOSDT (and SPLIT, and others) have considered complexity in their objective, and BRANCHES whose objective includes both accuracy and complexity and utilized multiple splits, and I believe it is not restricted to balanced trees.\n\n[1] Kohler, H., Akrour, R., & Preux, P.

The paper does not report any computational runtime, solver statistics, or scalability experiments, even though the core claim revolves around reducing MIP complexity through the slot-node approximation.\n2. The comparisons are based solely on point estimates of test accuracy, without reporting variability (mean ± std) or statistical significance across multiple runs. Moreover, comparing a non-optimal approximate method against globally optimal solvers only on test accuracy can be misleading; a fairer baseline would also analyze training accuracy vs. optimal training objective value to understand how far BONSAI deviates from optimality.\n3. It also appears that BONSAI employs multi-way splits, while most baselines (C4.5, CART, Quant-BnB, FIGS) are restricted to binary splits. This structural asymmetry makes the comparison potentially unfair, BONSAI has greater expressive capacity under the same depth constraint. The authors should justify whether the “optimal” trees from other models are re-optimized under comparable multi-way configurations.\n4. All datasets used are tiny (<= 4k samples) and low-dimensional, yet the paper claims efficiency and generality. With such small instances, even baseline MIP solvers can already reach the global optimum. Thus, BONSAI’s advantages on larger or high-dimensional data remain unverified.\n5. The paper omits relevant references in global optimization for decision trees, most notably \"A Scalable Deterministic Global Optimization Algorithm for Training Optimal Decision Trees\" (Kaixun Hua et al.), which directly addresses scalability and deterministic search.\n6. The paper does not specify which MIP solver or parameter settings were used (e.g., Gurobi, CPLEX, time limits, tolerance levels).\n\nOverall, While BONSAI presents a new problem formulation (slot-node structure and approximation optimization), the paper fails to substantiate its computational or theoretical advantages. Key omissions: runtime data, variance analysis, fairness of baselines, and missing related work prevent the reader from assessing whether the method genuinely advances the state of optimization-based decision tree learning."}, "questions": {"value": "Refer to the weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "wEIoA9ml0r", "forum": "objR3KOm0k", "replyto": "objR3KOm0k", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1369/Reviewer_5hAB"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1369/Reviewer_5hAB"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1369/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762041841934, "cdate": 1762041841934, "tmdate": 1762915749347, "mdate": 1762915749347, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents BONSAI, a depth-constrained decision-tree induction framework.

However, the paper does not establish conditions under which this pipeline is provably better (accuracy, or interpretability) than strong baselines, nor does it characterize the gap induced by candidate pruning (τ,ρ) relative to the unrestricted objective. Without theory (e.g., bounds, guarantees) or decisive empirical evidence (large-scale, time/space reporting), the claimed advantages remain assertions.\n\n- The core contribution hinges on Algorithm 1 (slot-wise orchestration) and Algorithm 2 (candidate generation/SEARCH_NODE). Yet the paper provides no big-O bounds (time and memory) as functions of (n,p,d,p_max,τ,ρ), nor worst-case vs. practical scaling. Because BONSAI culminates in a MIP whose size depends directly on the number of retained candidates, omitting these analyses makes feasibility and scalability impossible to judge.\n\n-  Experiments are primarily on small datasets, with no wall-clock training time. There is also no comparison against strong scalable optimal tree models. The proposed method BONSAI actually depends on the multi-way splits strategy, such strategy has been applied in optimal classification trees. For example, Subramanian, S., & Sun, W. (AAAI 2023), Scalable optimal multiway-split decision trees with constraints, which demonstrates strong performance at scale on multiway splits. The absence of such head-to-head comparisons weakens the significance of the contribution. Consequently, the paper does not demonstrate that BONSAI is either better or faster where it matters.\n\n- Fixing depth (d=3) biases comparisons when methods differ in effective capacity per node. The multi-way decision trees are more likely to achieve performance at shallow depths because they can generate more decision rules. For a fair test, control capacity (equal number of leaves/nodes or an explicit complexity budget/penalty), and use stratified k-fold cross-validation with matched hyperparameter tuning and statistical tests (CIs or paired tests). Without this, reported accuracy improvements can simply reflect larger capacity, not a better learning principle."}, "questions": {"value": "See the weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "VqFkpv4VM8", "forum": "objR3KOm0k", "replyto": "objR3KOm0k", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1369/Reviewer_eE8k"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1369/Reviewer_eE8k"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1369/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762232472207, "cdate": 1762232472207, "tmdate": 1762915749211, "mdate": 1762915749211, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
