As such, NAD is a critical task with several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the original features and structural features derived from random walks and degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

For example, in the algorithm, the authors tend to use the loss as the anomly score for each node, but during the training procedure, the minimization of loss will lead to a low score for all the nodes, which makes it difficult for the framework to learn useful signals. Furthermore, directly setting the coefficient of adjacency reconstruction to 0 during inference requires reasonable explanations. \n2. The compared baselines are not comprehensive enough. The authors mainly consider the old baselines in the unsupervised anomaly detection area. They should include novel baselines, such as [1-3]. \n3. The compared datasets are not representative enough. The included datasets can not show the effectiveness of the framework as there are sevearl real-world anomaly detection datasets in [4]. The authors should conduct further experiments on those datasets, especially the largest ones, to simulate the real deployment. \n4. The authors should provide hyperparameter analysis. Without hyperparameter analysis, it is hard to see the influence of different hyperparameters. \n5. The authors should explain how they chose hyperparameters. As shown in Table 4, they utilize a grid search technique for the training procedure. However, it is difficult for unsupervised learning to decide which hyperparameters should be chosen. Besides, they should also explain how they choose hyperparameters for new datasets. \n\n[1] Hezhe Qiao, Guansong Pang.

While the combination of Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces for anomaly detection is interesting, mixed-curvature and product-space ideas have already appeared in other contexts. The anomaly detection framework is also not new. The novelty here lies primarily in applying the mixed-curvature design to the existing node-level anomaly detection framework and is thus limited.\n2. Additional ablation can be done to check the contribution of each geometry, say considering Euclidean-only and hyperbolic-only variants of the model.\n3. The authors do not justify why hyperbolic space is appropriate for the chosen datasets. Evidence such as hierarchical graph structures, degree distributions, or hyperbolicity analysis could better motivate the use of non-Euclidean embeddings.\n4. Eq (12) is specifically for GCN, not a general GNN.\n5. This paper does not have sensitivity analysis for the key hyperparameters.\n6. The baseline methods seem weak for the chosen datasets. Several baseline methods yield ROC-AUC $< 0.5$ or $\\sim 0.5$, implying either inadequate tuning or that the methods are not suitable for the datasets.
