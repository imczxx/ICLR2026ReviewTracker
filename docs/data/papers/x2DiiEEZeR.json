Access to care is limited, which contributes to the challenge of recovery support. We present ChatThero, an innovative low-cost, multi-session, stressor-aware, and memory-persistent autonomous language agent designed to facilitate long-term behavior change and therapeutic support in addiction recovery. Unlike existing work that mostly finetuned large language models (LLMs) on patient-therapist conversation data, ChatThero was trained in a multi-agent simulated environment that mirrors real therapy. We created anonymized patient profiles from recovery communities (e.g., Reddit). We classify patients as easy, medium, and difficult, three scales representing their resistance to recovery. We created an external environment by introducing stressors (e.g., social determinants of health) to simulate real-world situations. We dynamically inject clinically-grounded therapeutic strategies (motivational interview and cognitive behavioral therapy). Our evaluation, conducted by both human (blinded clinicians) and LLM-as-Judge, shows that ChatThero is superior in empathy and clinical relevance. We show that stressor simulation improves robustness of ChatThero. Explicit stressors increase relapse-like setbacks, matching real-world patterns. We evaluate ChatThero with behavioral change metrics. On a 1--5 scale, ChatThero raises motivation by +1.71 points (from 2.39 to 4.10) and confidence by +1.67 points (from 1.52 to 3.19), substantially outperforming GPT-5.

First, the claimed efficiency advantage requires empirical substantiation. While the authors claim that ChatThero is an “innovative low-cost” solution, the multi-agent architecture is considerably more complex than a single LLM baseline. To support the efficiency claims, the authors should provide concrete metrics such as computational cost, inference time, or API call counts comparing ChatThero against single-LLM alternatives. \n\nSecond, the experimental design raises concerns about evaluation validity. The synthetic dataset, though initialized from Reddit, is constructed following the multi-agent simulation approach described in lines 296-297. This creates a potential circularity. ChatThero is essentially evaluated on data generated using principles embedded in its own architecture, which may inflate performance metrics. While the authors acknowledge the lack of suitable existing datasets and the necessity of synthetic data, this limitation necessitates more rigorous internal validation. Comprehensive ablation studies would strengthen the evaluation, for instance, by systematically removing components from each agent type or by evaluating on datasets constructed with alternative assumptions about patient profiles or therapeutic approaches."}, "questions": {"value": "- Which specific therapeutic strategies prove most beneficial, and which are less effective?
