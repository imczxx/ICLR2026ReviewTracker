By only adjusting related factors, such as the advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently limited and prone to failure.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce an entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely **S**tabilizing **T**oken-level **E**ntropy-chang**E** via **R**eweighting (**STEER**), that adaptively stabilizes entropy dynamics through fine-grained, token-level adjustments.

The description of the four distinct quadrants (lines 231–242) lacks clarity. According to Figure 3, if a token receives a high probability, its corresponding \\(\\Delta\\) indicator appears to be negative. If this interpretation is correct, please provide a clear and explicit explanation of this relationship, including any underlying assumptions or derivations.\n\n2. As illustrated in Figure 6, all interventions increase policy entropy compared to GRPO. However, it is unclear why the \"weaken Quadrant III\" option results in an unstable entropy increase. Could the authors elaborate on the underlying mechanism? Additional analysis or theoretical justification would greatly improve understanding here.\n\n3. The method section (Section 4) is overly concise and lacks sufficient detail. The discussed entropy change mechanism does not appear to be directly tied to the proposed method. The authors should more explicitly explain how insights from the entropy change analysis motivate or derive the proposed approach. Furthermore, it would be valuable to discuss whether more sophisticated or fine-grained techniques could be employed to refine the method.\n\n## Minor Issues and Other Questions\n\n1.

Although the paper proposes a quantitative analysis framework to study entropy change, it is based on some assumptions: each token's logit parameters are independent.

The paper mainly focuses on the entropy intervention issue in RLVR and validates the proposed method on mathematical reasoning tasks. The effectiveness and applicability of the method need more thorough validation. The authors could consider testing the new method in a wider range of scenarios to prove its universality.\n3.

STEER aims to directly control entropy by applying a reweighting scheme that suppresses updates for tokens with a large magnitude of estimated entropy change, thereby keep the training stability.

It is questionable whether a flat entropy curve is always desirable. Neither related literature nor existing experimental results conclusively demonstrate that stabilizing entropy at a constant level is inherently beneficial.\n\n- The paper's results lack credibility. The experiments are limited to a single model, Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Furthermore, the reported performance gain over the baseline is excessively large (an average of +4.9% over GRPO and +3.4% over the runner-up baseline, Clip-Cov). Based on my extensive experience with math RL training, an average improvement exceeding 2% across six math benchmarks *solely* from an algorithmic change is already substantial. The claimed improvement raises suspicions of cherry-picking. I recommend that the paper validate the generalizability of its method on at least three different training datasets or three different base models.\n\n- The entropy dynamics vary significantly across different models. For instance, popular open-source models like R1-Distill-Qwen, Qwen3, Qwen2.5, and the Llama series all exhibit different entropy curves during training. Given that the paper's main contribution revolves around the analysis of entropy *change*, I believe it is essential to include analyses on at least three models from different model families.\n\n- Some of the paper's analyses, such as the one in Figure 4 and Figure 7, is not original. The conclusions presented are already implicitly suggested in prior work like DAPO (Yu et al., 2025) and Cui et al. (2025b) . Unless the authors can provide more rigorous theoretical results, I find the contribution in this area to be insufficient.\n\n- Equation 9 is difficult to understand and lacks intuitive explanation .
