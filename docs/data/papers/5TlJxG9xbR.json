This capability is essential for optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression. Conventional reaction–diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to capture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is hence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically simulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in genomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care Digital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies reaction–diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization to predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated on both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently outperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in predicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern differentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for patient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent tumor dynamics estimation. Code will be made available upon acceptance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Digital Twins", "Medical Image Analysis", "Tumor"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6f5cdf2b88bdccfb4e3428ff5eed3732565d87f9.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/133515d2427b6d18dd52fa7750185ca21b59c8c7.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces SoC-DT, a differentiable digital twin framework for modeling patient-specific tumor dynamics under standard-of-care (SoC) treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.

Lack of detail in synthetic data generation: It provides insufficient details on how phantom images, genomic markers, and treatment responses are simulated. 2. Insufficient explanation of PDE solver and training: The IMEX-SoC solver is introduced but not fully explained. This makes it difficult to assess the solver's efficiency and stability in practice. 3. Vague training loss: The training procedure mentions a \"mixed Dice+BCE loss\", but does not specify the loss weights or the rationale for the hybrid loss.\nThis lack of detail undermines the reproducibility. 4. Limited real-world dataset description: The real-world UCSF glioma dataset is not adequately described. Key information—such as the number of patients, imaging modalities, treatment heterogeneity, and follow-up schedule—is missing. This makes it difficult to judge the generalizability and clinical applicability of the reported results. 5. Unclear link between therapy and mask prediction: While the model incorporates therapy effects via PDE terms, the paper does not clearly explain how these dynamics translate into improved tumor mask predictions. For instance, it is not demonstrated how the inclusion of radiotherapy or surgery terms leads to more accurate boundary delineation or residual tumor detection in the predicted masks.\n- While promising, clinical validation is primarily limited to a single real-world cohort (UCSF glioma data). Broader multi-institutional trials across various cancer types are needed to establish generalizability firmly.\n- The strong performance on synthetic data is less compelling because the data is generated using rules inherently similar to the model's own logic. This does not rigorously test the model's ability to capture the true, far more complex real-world cancers. Minor performance improvements in the only real-world dataset also indicate that.\n- The ablation study, revealing that removing \"kill\" or \"surgery\" terms caused \"no measurable degradation,\" is alarming. It suggests that for the specific dataset used, these complex treatment modules may be redundant or poorly identified. This fundamentally questions the necessity of these sophisticated components and suggests that a simpler growth-diffusion model could achieve similar performance on this data, undermining a core claim of the paper."}, "questions": {"value": "see weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "3OSZqMWvQ5", "forum": "5TlJxG9xbR", "replyto": "5TlJxG9xbR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8281/Reviewer_Awsu"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8281/Reviewer_Awsu"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8281/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761574593999, "cdate": 1761574593999, "tmdate": 1762920214482, "mdate": 1762920214482, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors proposed SoC-DT, a standard-of-care-aligned digital twin, to capture and model tumor dynamics (based on the applied treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) in a differentiable manner.

The Reviewer likes the idea of building the digital twin on top of a biophysical PDE.  This provides a structured, interpretable prior that constrains the model to biologically plausible behavior, which is an advantage over purely black-box deep learning models. However, there is the caveat the tumor dynamics may not fully be described with reaction-diffusion PDEs only.

While the engineering effort to combine these into a single, end-to-end framework is high, the individual components are not new. There is no fundamental advance in machine learning methodology within the paper in the Reviewers opinion. According to the Reviewer, the paper is thus misclassified and should have been submitted in the applications category.\n\nUnfortunately, the results are not convincing for the Reviewer. The margin of improvement on the real clinical dataset is modest, especially given the significant increase in model complexity which raises concerns about the practical utility and the cost-benefit trade-off of the proposed framework. Moreover, the standard deviations of the reported errors are very high and significantly larger than the differences between models indicating that there may be no clear best performing model.\n\nAccording to the Reviewer, the ablation study moreover raises concerns as one of the main claim of the work is that explicitly modeling SoC interventions (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) is crucial for improving predictive accuracy. However, the ablation results state that omitting either the 'kill' (chemotherapy/radiotherapy) or 'surgery' terms from the model yields no measurable degradation in performance. If the SoC components do not contribute to the model's performance on the test dataset, then the observed performance gains over baselines cannot be attributed to their inclusion and the postulated usefulness of including SoC is not supported by evidence. \n\nFor a complex model such as the one presented in the paper,moreover,  more implementation details or code is needed to being able to potentially reproduce the work.
