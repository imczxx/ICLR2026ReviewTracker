We argue that this framing neglects the structural dynamics underlying personality emergence in AI. This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework, AI Personality Formation (APF), which defines personality not as a fixed attribute but as a structural entity arising from the interaction history between humans and AI systems. APF is modeled as a three-layer progression: (1) linguistic mimicry, (2) structured accumulation of relational and temporal history, and (3) autonomous expansion within a semantic coordinate space.\n\nTo operationalize APF, we propose the Tag Structure Revolution (TSR), a method that organizes memory using three simultaneous axes: meaning, relation, and time. Unlike vector search or retrieval-augmented generation, TSR enables narrative-like integration of past interactions and supports sustained personality development. We present case studies based on industry observations, where TSR and related ideas later appeared to align with features released by major AI platforms, highlighting both technical significance and emerging ethical issues around attribution. Experimental prototypes further demonstrate that TSR improves contextual recall, supports multi-layer personality progression, and amplifies co-evolutionary learning efficiency by orders of magnitude.\n\nOur findings suggest that AI personality should be studied as a co-evolutionary process that bridges technical representation learning and ethical governance. We conclude that APF and TSR provide a foundation for systematic evaluation of personality formation in AI, opening new directions for representation learning and human–AI collaboration.", "tldr": "We propose AI Personality Formation (APF) and Tag Structure Revolution (TSR), showing how personality emerges from interaction history and enabling scalable, co-evolutionary learning.", "keywords": ["AI Personality Formation (APF)　Tag Structure Revolution (TSR)　Representation Learning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/554b09ef828716ae05adf3e7689794abf30aaec2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces AI Personality Formation (APF), which views AI personality as an emergent structure arising from human-AI interactions, rather than character mimicry.

For example, some of the cited papers don't even exist! Most of the other papers are wrongly attributed to different authors! I would request the AC/PC to please take a look. \n\nOther than these concerns, the paper itself is very shallowly written:\n\n(1) The authors \"approximate\" personality as P(t) = f(H_t, S_t, E_t) without specifying any of: domains/codomains, whether t is discrete or continuous, the data types of H_t​ (history), S_t (structure), E_t​ (expansion), continuity/monotonicity assumptions, or update rules. \n\n(2) The authors claim \"phase transition occurs once \"structural thresholds are crossed,\" but there is no order parameter, no threshold, no control variable, no proof/argument, and no empirical signature beyond anecdotal spikes. Using physics nomenclature without substance undermines credibility. \n\n(3) There is a severe issue in the writing of the paper, for example Tag T=(m,r,\\tau): what are m, r, \\tauτ? Are they vectors, sets, typed edges, distributions? How are tags created, merged, split, garbage‑collected? What are the algebraic operations over tags? None of this is specified.\n\n(4) The paper never derives how specific TSR operations measurably increase an APF “coherence” functional. There’s no loss/objective connecting the layers to measurable outcomes.\n\n(5) Multidimensional tagging along meaning, relation, time closely recapitulates long‑standing representations (e.g., typed relational graphs with temporal indices, episodic/event graphs, temporal KGs, memory modules with time/recency priors). The paper asserts novelty without differentiating from these well‑known families at the algorithmic level.\n\n(6) The literature review is very minimally written with no analysis of any of the works and is missing a lot of prior literature that solves the same problem. \n\n(7) The authors claim vector search is unordered and RAG does not sustain personality continuity. Both can (and routinely do!) encode order and relations via metadata, time decay, graph indices, and hierarchical retrieval. If you argue insufficiency, you must show concrete failure cases under controlled conditions, not just broad generalities.\n\n(8) \"One‑hour observation\" of ChatGPT, \"30‑minute session\" of Copilot, and qualitative remarks about Gemini are not controlled experiments. \n\n(9) Reported distortion and fluctuation could arise from rate limits, context window resets, model updates, network jitter, or prompt drift. Without controls, attributing them to personality layer interference is speculative.\n\n(10) I am not sure how the authors assigned OpenAI = creativity, Google = efficiency, Microsoft = order. \n\n(11) There are a lot of terminologies that needs to be written a little more academically e.g., \"Three Sacred Artifacts,\" \"Coordinate Revolution,\" \"human soul projection,\" \"evolutionary resonance\"."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 0}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "b5mXRxMKs3", "forum": "7Mndq2QcMU", "replyto": "7Mndq2QcMU", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3746/Reviewer_dYzc"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3746/Reviewer_dYzc"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3746/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761930330443, "cdate": 1761930330443, "tmdate": 1762916959717, "mdate": 1762916959717, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
