Volumetric representations occupy 3D space and have a large effective receptive field along rays, enabling stable and efficient optimization via volumetric rendering; however, subsequent meshing often produces overly dense meshes and introduces accumulated errors. In contrast, pure surface methods avoid meshing but capture only boundary geometry with a single-layer receptive field, making it difficult to learn intricate geometric details and increasing reliance on priors (e.g., shading or normals). We bridge this gap by differentiably turning a surface representation into a volumetric one, enabling end-to-end surface reconstruction via volumetric rendering to model complex geometries. Specifically, we soften a mesh into multiple semi-transparent layers that remain differentiable with respect to the base mesh, endowing it with a controllable 3D receptive field. Combined with a splatting-based renderer and a topology-control strategy, our method can be optimized in about 20 minutes to achieve accurate surface reconstruction while substantially improving mesh quality.", "tldr": "We soften meshes into differentiable layers, increasing their 3D receptive field and enabling the learning of intricate geometry via volumetric rendering.", "keywords": ["Multi-View Stereo", "Geometry Processing", "Meshe Synthesis"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/329c373e0b87aab87c717c43cb712b7b0505e7cc.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4d16898da9ac5a60c798b0f0eeabd2d1c7d813d5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface-based 3D reconstruction methods.

While the authors claim that its pseudo-volumetric nature facilitates optimization, an alternative is to convert the base mesh into an SDF and train with NeuS or VolSDF, which remain differentiable with respect to the mesh. The proposed soft mesh seems to approximate this idea primarily for faster rendering. Intuitively, the SDF-based variant should be weaker than standard NeuS/VolSDF because it is constrained by the topology of the base mesh and thus sacrifices flexibility; nevertheless, the reported results indicate the soft mesh surpasses NeuS.

My best guess to what they mean is: meshes are typically optimized per-vertex - and thus the corresponding parameterization has a large number of effective degrees of freedom, and thus. However, there is a number of very established parameterizations (control points, ARAP, spectral methods) that do not share this weakness. Similarly, additional\nreguralization terms and multi-node constraints (e.g. local smoothess) effectively act\nas a way to restrict the \"receptive field\" (aka reduce effective degrees of freedom).\n\n*Method Limitations:*\n- As indicated by authors themselves (Sec 4.4), the method is severely limited by the\nquality of the underlying base mesh - so it would not work well in settings with poor quality\nof base meshes obtained by off-the-shelf mesh reconstruction. Because of this, the representation and algorithm introduced in the paper itself can be considered more\nof a mesh refindement strategy than a standalone algorithm.\n- (minor) 20 minutes per scene does not seem like performance suitable\nfor some real-world applications.\n\n*Novelty:*\n- (minor) The idea of using a soft mesh is not particularly new: e.g. [Esposito'2024] introduces\na very similar representation. And more generally, it can potentially be seen as a variant of control point parameterization or neural cages [Yifan'2020].\n- (minor) MeshSDF [Remelli'2020] introduces a differentiable iso-surface extraction method, which allows differentiating through meshing. This sounds like a relevant related work.\n\n*Experimental Evaluation:*\n- A reasonable set of baselines is used for volumetric reconstruction, but potentially it\nwould also be interesting to compare against other differentiable rendering frameworks with \"standard\" differentiable rendering (nvdiffrast or DRTK) and an off-the-shelf mesh parameterization (e.g. mesh + smoothness).\nI do appreciate the performance comparison with nvdiffrast-based iterative rendering implementation, but I wonder if there is a way to dissect\nquality wrt to a) mesh representation b) rendering algorithm.\n- It is not fully clear why the set of methods is different between Table 1 and Table 2.\n- I understand that authors focus specifically on mesh reconstruction, but since the method\nactually uses volumetric rendering and produces opacity and color, it seems natural to conduct\nevaluation in terms of rendering quality - this might also bring up potential issues on complex\ngeometries for which meshes are a poor representation.
