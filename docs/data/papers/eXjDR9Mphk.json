We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of 1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8 creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness, factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward models—the standard architecture for RLHF—achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy, while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from 18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale, with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants. Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences, and that successful preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather than direct classification.

The \"subjective\" criteria primarily pertain to style and degree of creativity in a response, whereas \"objective\" cover attributes like grammatical correctness, coherency, and factual correctness. In the paper, the benchmark is used to assess 20 different LLMs falling into one of three categories: regression-head RMs, generative RMs, and LLM-as-a-Judge prompting. The LLMs are assessed both on English and Chinese preference pairs. The main findings are that the LLMs are bad at assigning preference labels based on \"subjective\" criteria, with generate RMs performing best. A performance discrepancy is observed between the English and Chinese samples, with better performance on the English samples, and across creative writing task macro-categories. The main conclusion of the paper is that current LLMs are brittle at the preference labelling task, and intermediary reasoning steps are beneficial."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- Although the conclusions about preference labelling with LLMs is highlighted in the paper, it presents a benchmark to assess preference labelling quality when quality factors such as grammatical and factual correctness and coherency are held constant between the responses in a given preference pair. This essentially removes the lower hanging fruit from the preference evaluation.\n- Humans were involved in all stages to create and curate the dataset. From the expert/annotator descriptions, it sounds like they should have had appropriate skills levels for that tasks they completed.\n- Many LLMs across three different categories of preference labelling strategy were evaluated.\n- Multiple creative writing domains were assessed.\n- The responses included in the benchmark come from multiple LLMs, not a single LLM.\n- The paper is well written and easy to read/follow."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The paper is framed to highlight the learnings from evaluating the 20 LLMs on the proposed benchmark. However, the main learnings either primarily replicate findings that have been previously established in the literature (e.g. reward models can be brittle -- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10760 and English vs. non-English RM quality -- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15522), are general understandings (e.g. specialized models perform better on the target task than generalist models and models perform worse in OOD settings), or do not appropriately address the impact distributional differences in training versus evaluation data by focusing on the need to improve training objectives without considering the issue may be related to training data issues (e.g. the performance of regression-head RMs, which have been trained on a specific preference objective that likely differ's from the benchmark's preference objective). I think it is completely appropriate to introduce a benchmark such that results one the benchmark replicate what has been previously demonstrated across multiple papers and studies, as this allows the benchmark to measure progress on these issues. However, the paper must be framed in this way instead of presenting these types of findings as new. Additionally, it is great to have a benchmark able to assess LLM performance on a task they are not typically explicitly trained to performed, however this should be recognized in the discussion/conclusion instead of pointing immediately to issues with training objectives. For example, most RMs on not trained on a lot of creative writing tasks (something the paper calls out) and most public annotator protocols do not instruct the annotators to prioritize creative responses.\n- With the details currently given, I could not replicate this paper (neither the benchmark nor the results).\n- The benchmark target \"subjective\" quality dimensions, which seems to mostly mean creative responses. The paper presents many results about how well LLMs are able to achieve this task. However, this is not all together surprising as subjective differences by their very nature are more difficult to replicate assessments of both with people and models. The data is annotated by only 3 annotators per sample and the paper describes what sounds like an intensive calibration process among annotators. This leaves open the question, how \"universal\" versus annotator-specific are these subjective preference labels? For example, if a different group of 3 annotators came in to the complete the task, how well would they replicate the labels of the original annotators?\n- LLM performance on this benchmark should be contextualized with both RewardBench performance and multi-lingual abilities (potentially  using https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15522).This will quantify how much of a RM performance drop occurs when assessing quality along dimensions relevant to creative writing.\n- The LLM prompts are not provided. This is important as the instructions the LLM receives will obviously have a large impact on preference labelling performance. For example, if provided instructions about the importance of creative writing attributes, does accuracy improve?\n- The introduction and conclusion make general claims about scale not impacting performance. These need to amended to be specific to the LLM judge results.\n- It looks like there is a mismatch in the numbers provided per macro-category in the text (i.e. lines 236/237) versus in Figure 3. \n- The connection between response length and the claim about \"...mediocrity converges toward formulaic patterns, creativity manifests across diverse scale[,]\" is not clear.\n- Generative RMs without reasoning before scoring are missing, which limits the strength of the take away that it is the reasoning change versus generative RM that leads to improved performance over the regression-head RMs. This is an especially important comparison given that reasoning steps were not found to be beneficial for the LLM judges."}, "questions": {"value": "- Was there any correlation between overall LLM judge prompt length and preference label correctness?

If the prompts were too long, it makes sense the performance of the LLM judges would be limited.\n- Please provide citations for the claim, \"...prevailing assumption that enhanced reasoning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought, naturally lead to better alignment with complex human values.\" Is it that LLM judges with advanced reasoning is thought to be better?
