Structural Causal Models (SCMs) provide a principled way to formalize the generative processes of observed data. However, learning generalized causal models for time series remains challenging due to the lack of detailed modeling and limited generalization ability. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{T-Caus}, a novel pretraining framework designed to improve the generalization of \\textbf{T}ime series \\textbf{Caus}al models across diverse downstream tasks. To capture complex temporal causal dependencies, T-Caus introduces a hierarchical instance-specific temporal causal discovery framework that employs a dual-scale iterative attention to enhance window-level causal relationships, and a Gaussian mixture with an instance-level routing mechanism to handle heterogeneous exogenous distributions. To further address distribution shifts across time series, T-Caus adopts generalizable causal learning with causal invariance, which explicitly leverages intervention-based learning and a causal mixup strategy to promote stable causal discovery and stronger generalization. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets demonstrate that T-Caus exhibits strong generalization, achieving superior performance in both causal discovery and root cause identification.

For instance, why the intervention-based pretext task can address the distribution shift challenge, which is a lack of theoretical proof.\n\n- The paper presents some theoretical claims, such as Theorem 1. However, the claim of the intervention is well-known, and it also did not explain why the intervention is needed, because using the back-door criterion can also eliminate the spurious associations using pure observational data.\n\n- Moreover, the proof of Theorem 1 only discusses the linear cases, which lack mathematical rigor for the general nonlinear scenario.\n\n- The empirical evaluation is performed on a few real-world datasets, making it hard to assess the method's generalizability. As suggested, the experiments would be significantly strengthened by including comprehensive tests on synthetic data. This would allow for a controlled analysis of performance on specific causal structures, such as disentangling accuracy on inter-window versus intra-window causal links.\n\n[1] D'Acunto, Gabriele, et al. \"Learning Multiscale Non-stationary Causal Structures.\" TRANSACTIONS ON MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH (2023).\n\n[2] Huang, Biwei, et al. \"Causal discovery from heterogeneous/nonstationary data.\" Journal of Machine Learning Research 21.89 (2020): 1-53."}, "questions": {"value": "See the weaknesses above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Y1E9vqNQ33", "forum": "ZZaIDVoWFA", "replyto": "ZZaIDVoWFA", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9195/Reviewer_Rnph"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9195/Reviewer_Rnph"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9195/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761790449217, "cdate": 1761790449217, "tmdate": 1762920864670, "mdate": 1762920864670, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces T-Caus, a pre-training-based approach to temporal causal discovery.

There are **several** incorrect claims and assertions throughout the paper. \n\n- The claim that existing models do not handle cascading temporal effects is *wrong* and needs more justification to clarify why the authors make this assertion. Methods like PCMCI already condition on all variables across lags up to a max lag, so by design, they test edges while controlling for multi-step pathways. If the authors think this modeling is *insufficient* empirically, then they should *explicitly show this* with experiments that demonstrate this behavior.\nSimilarly, \"Existing approaches (Han et al., 2025), which typically assume a fixed Gaussian prior, lack the\nflexibility to adapt to such diversity and cannot model exogenous factors across multiple series.\" is misleading since it ignores many different works (for example [1]) that explicitly model the exogenous factors.\n- The entire paragraph in the introduction related to \"Challenge 2\" is full of statements that do not follow from one another. First of all, why do the authors bring up Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) to justify the perceived poor OOD performance of these models? This is a moot question for many causal discovery algorithms that are *completely unsupervised*, hence the question of OOD doesn't even apply to them. The authors then say \"However, existing time series causal discovery methods fail to account for both the diversity of individual series and the variability of causal relationships across different series.\" This statement has *nothing* to do with the previous statement about VRM. Furthermore, this statement is disingenuous because it ignores the *variety* of existing work [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] that handle various degrees of variation in the individual series as well as variation across different series.\nThe authors also state: \"Unfortunately, existing deep learning methods lack effective constraints to identify and differentiate spurious correlation from causation.\" This is, once again, a poorly supported statement that ignores the **fundamental aim** of most causal discovery algorithms (i.e. distinguishing correlation from causation). \n- In the related work section, the authors claim: \"Granger causality-based approaches share a fundamental limitation: they do not explicitly model endogenous errors or exogenous noise\". Once again, this is **completely inaccurate**. In fact, one of the papers that the authors extensively cite [7] is a Granger causal model that explicitly models the exogeneous noise.\n\nOverall, the entire introduction needs to be rewritten to remove these unsupported claims.\n\n\n2. A lot of related work is missed out. In addition to the papers mentioned previously [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], the authors ignore the line of work on causal discovery from a mixture of DAGs [8, 9] which partially model the \"variability of causal relationships across different series\" (samples) albeit in the IID case instead of the time-series case. Most egregiously, the authors ignore the line of work on amortized causal graph inference [10, 11] which deal with a very similar setting (pretraining for causal discovery).\n\n3. The problem setting is unclear. The paper emphasizes multi-scale dependencies and evolving relations, but the method appears to output a single graph per instance. There is no explicit mechanism for regime switches or mixtures of graphs across windows/environments, despite the claims around non-stationarity.\n\n4. The time-series mix-up idea (Lines 310-322) is not principled. Mixing examples does not necessarily preserve the causal structure unless the SCM has linear relations.\n\n5. The theory result (Theorem 1) The statement \"intervention blocks spurious path\" is a direct restatement of the standard backdoor argument and not novel. Worse, the proof explicitly assumes a linear SCM in Appendix A.1, so it doesn’t support the general claims made in the main text.\n\n6. The causal discovery results rely on fine-tuning: \"Our model is fine-tuned on the Bavaria dataset and evaluated on the Eastern Germany river datasets\". This seems unfair to other models, which perform causal discovery in an unsupervised fashion on the target dataset. Moreover, in most practical applications, the ground-truth causal graph is unavailable, making this setup quite unrealistic. The authors should report the 0 shot performance of their model (after synthetic pretraining) to make it fair to the baselines.\n\n### References\n[1] Gong, Wenbo, et al. \"Rhino: Deep causal temporal relationship learning with history-dependent noise.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.14706 (2022).\n\n[2] Mameche et al., SPACETIME: Causal Discovery from Non-Stationary Time Series, AAAI 2025.\n\n[3] Varambally, Ma, Yu, Discovering mixtures of structural causal models from time series data, arXiv:2310.06312, 2023.\n\n[4] Huang et al., Causal discovery from heterogeneous/nonstationary data, JMLR 2020.\n\n[5] Gao et al., Causal discovery in semi-stationary time series, NeurIPS 2023.\n\n[6] Saggioro et al., Regime-dependent causal relationships from observational time series, Chaos 2020.\n\n[7] Han, Xiao, et al. \"Root Cause Analysis of Anomalies in Multivariate Time Series through Granger Causal Discovery.\" The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations. 2025.\n\n[8] Saeed et al., Causal structure discovery from distributions arising from mixtures of DAGs, ICML 2020.\n\n[9] Strobl, Causal discovery with a mixture of DAGs, ML 2023.\n\n[10] Ke et al., Learning to Induce Causal Structure, arXiv 2022.\n\n[11] Lorch et al., Amortized Inference for Causal Structure Learning, NeurIPS 2022."}, "questions": {"value": "Apart from the major weaknesses pointed out, I have the following comments/questions:\n\n1.
