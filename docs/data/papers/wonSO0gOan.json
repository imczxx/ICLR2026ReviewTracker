The proposed methods discover subgroups exhibiting maximal treatment-effect heterogeneity while enforcing covariate balance, thus directly controlling confounding without explicitly modeling treatment or outcome mechanisms. The framework accommodates flexible subgroup definitions, allowing additional constraints such as fairness criteria to be incorporated. We show that our approach admits flexible nonparametric estimators and enjoys finite-sample error guarantees. We also introduce a principled rule for subgroup assignment based on observed covariates.

A central methodological concern is that subgroup indicators and weights are optimized jointly from the data, which violates the iid assumptions required for standard asymptotic inference.

The authors could provide a discussion and an additional empirical analysis of settings where no parameters  satisfy all constraints, and discuss what can be done in this setting.
