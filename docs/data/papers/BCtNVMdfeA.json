The statement “tabular data includes complex and varied distributions” (lines 41-42) appears somewhat vague. Image and text datasets can also exhibit diverse and complex distributions due to varying sources and contexts. Could the authors clarify in what specific sense tabular data distributions are considered more complex or varied?\n\n2. The decomposition $p(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$ = $p(\\mathcal{E})p(\\mathcal{V}|\\mathcal{E})$ seems to be taken as a modeling assumption without sufficient justification. It is unclear why the generative process is assumed to first sample the relational structure and then the attributes. In practice, foreign-key relationships (edges) may be influenced by attribute distributions (e.g., business logic or temporal constraints), while attribute distributions can also be constrained by the structure (e.g., table hierarchy and connection density). Therefore, this factorization implicitly assumes a unidirectional dependency from structure generation to attribute generation, yet the paper provides neither theoretical justification nor empirical evidence to support this assumption.\n\n3. The proposed joint diffusion model seems not an innovative design. The use of diffusion models for generating heterogeneous tabular features (i.e., numerical and categorical) has been extensively studied in prior works such as TabDDPM [1], TABSYN [2], and TabDiff [3]. The authors are encouraged to clarify what makes their proposed hybrid generation method novel beyond existing tabular diffusion approaches and to provide stronger empirical evidence demonstrating its superior effectiveness.\n\n4. While quantitative metrics are provided, the quality of the generated tabular data should be further demonstrated through visualization to offer more intuitive and interpretable evidence of the model’s effectiveness.\n\n5. As shown in Table 10, the training cost of RelDiff is substantially higher than that of ClavaDDPM, raising concerns about the method’s scalability and practicality on large-scale datasets. Moreover, the paper does not report the memory cost across different datasets, which is important for assessing the overall efficiency and deployability of the proposed framework.\n\n[1] TabDDPM: Modeling tabular data with diffusion models.
