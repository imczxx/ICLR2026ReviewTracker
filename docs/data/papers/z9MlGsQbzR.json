Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose **E**volutionary **C**aching to **A**ccelerate **D**iffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x.

This paper presents a highly novel approach to the cache-based accelerated sampling problem in diffusion models by leveraging concepts from traditional machine learning. I find the most compelling contribution to be the elegant design of the cache schedule and, in particular, the use of an evolutionary algorithm to efficiently search for the optimal schedule. This represents a creative and effective way to frame and solve the problem. 💡\n\n2. The experimental validation in this work is exceptionally thorough and convincing.\n\n- Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors employ a suite of evaluation metrics, including FID, CLIP Score, and ImageReward, ensuring a multi-faceted assessment of generation quality. Their method is rigorously tested on a diverse range of powerful, state-of-the-art models like PixArt-α, PixArt-Σ, and FLUX-1.dev.\n\n- Insightful Ablations and Visualizations: The paper is further strengthened by thorough ablation studies and clear visualizations. The ablation on the number of evolutionary generations, for instance, provides a clear insight into the trade-off between quality (FID) and efficiency (acceleration ratio), showing how FID first decreases before increasing while the speedup consistently grows. Furthermore, the visualizations of the discovered cache schedules and the points on the Pareto frontiers provide strong, intuitive evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed search strategy.\n\nOverall, the rigorous and well-executed experiments strongly substantiate the claims made in the paper."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I find several points in the paper confusing, primarily as follows:\n\n1. On the Behavior of Optimization Objectives (ImageReward vs. MACs). I have a question regarding the behavior of the evaluation metrics during the evolutionary search. The paper's objectives are to maximize ImageReward (quality) and minimize MACs (computational cost). I understand how the NSGA-II algorithm operates to find a Pareto frontier for this multi-objective problem. However, the results show that as the number of generations increases, the MACs consistently decrease, while ImageReward does not exhibit a monotonic improvement; instead, it appears to fluctuate. Could the authors clarify this dynamic? My understanding is that while reducing MACs can be achieved by simply caching more, this aggressive caching might negatively impact image quality. Is the fluctuation in ImageReward a result of the algorithm exploring this trade-off, where some generations might sacrifice quality for significant computational savings before finding a better balance? A brief explanation of this trade-off during the search process would be beneficial.\n\n2. On the Representation of the Cache Schedule (S). I know $S \\in \\{0,1\\}^{N,B,C}$, but I don't seem to see $C$ in the visualization. I'd like to understand what role $C$ actually plays.\n\n3. I observe two implicit but critical constraints in the cache schedules: Initial Step Constraint: \n\n- The first inference step (n=0) must always be a full recomputation, as there is no prior cache to reuse. This is reflected in the visualizations. \n\n- Intra-Step Dependency: Within a single inference step n, if a block b is set to recompute, all subsequent blocks (b+1,b+2,…) in that same step must also recompute. A reuse decision for a later block would be illogical, as its input depends on the output of the recomputed block b, invalidating the stored cache.\n\nMy question is: how are these logical constraints enforced during the evolutionary search, specifically within the Crossover and Mutation operations? A random mutation or crossover could easily generate an invalid schedule that violates these rules. Do the authors employ constraint-aware genetic operators, or is there a \"repair\" function that corrects invalid schedules after they are generated? Detailing this mechanism would strengthen the paper's description of the algorithm."}, "questions": {"value": "No"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "9LKzoFmVvd", "forum": "z9MlGsQbzR", "replyto": "z9MlGsQbzR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12648/Reviewer_NeEf"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12648/Reviewer_NeEf"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12648/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760600638286, "cdate": 1760600638286, "tmdate": 1762923489614, "mdate": 1762923489614, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm-based framework designed to optimize caching schedules for diffusion models, significantly improving inference speed without compromising image quality.

Traditional caching methods reuse previously computed features during sequential inference steps to reduce redundant computation, but existing approaches rely heavily on rigid heuristics, hand-tuned hyperparameters, and limited trade-off flexibility. ECAD reframes feature caching as a multi-objective optimization problem over image quality and computational efficiency, solved via a genetic algorithm (specifically, NSGA-II). The algorithm evolves caching schedules—which specify what components (self-attention, cross-attention, feedforward outputs) to cache, and when—to form a Pareto frontier of quality–latency trade-offs. ECAD is model-agnostic, training-free, and learns these schedules using only a small set of “calibration prompts” and a quality metric (e.g., Image Reward). Experiments on three major diffusion models (PixArt-α, PixArt-Σ, FLUX-1.dev) show that ECAD provides higher-quality outputs at faster inference speeds compared to previous caching baselines such as FORA, ToCa, DuCa, and TaylorSeer.
