Vulnerabilities arise when contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph, extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool achieves an accuracy of 87.59\\% in detecting unchecked external call vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["decentralized application", "vulnerability detection", "external call"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7fcbc37ce65b708fff00d1391b6cdbb6c711aa4e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c00ec6a9eb57fc77745bea89f8b7ffa563b9bb3c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes UEChecker, a graph-based deep learning framework to detect Unchecked External Call vulnerabilities in decentralized applications.

The main novelty appears to lie in the edge prediction module, but the manuscript does not compare this component against relevant baselines, making it difficult to assess its effectiveness and actual contribution.\n\n2. **Baseline Selection:** \n\nThe experimental comparison is limited to traditional models such as LSTM, GAT, and GCN. The paper does not include comparisons with more recent or domain-specific approaches that use similar graph-based or program analysis techniques, which limits the persuasiveness of the evaluation.\n\n3. **Clustering Module Effectiveness:** \n\nThe effect of the clustering module is unclear. As shown in the ablation study, the performance actually decreases when the clustering module is added, raising questions about its necessity and justification in the overall framework.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Sui, Y., Cheng, X., Zhang, G., & Wang, H.
