DAMAS continuously estimates the probability of being in each state using only reward observations, allowing rapid adaptation to changing conditions without the need for explicit context features. Our evaluation of DAMAS included both synthetic environments and real-world web server workloads.

If I understand correctly, the theoretical analysis establishes regret bounds relative to a static optimal arm within each stationary phase (as in UCB), whereas the experiments compute regret against a dynamic oracle that knows the best arm for each environment at every time step. This inconsistency makes it difficult to interpret how the theoretical guarantees relate to the reported empirical improvements, and limits the clarity of what kind of optimality DAMAS actually achieves. The authors were also not very clear what is the benchmark they are comparing against. \n- Related to the point above, the main theoretical results (Theorems 4.1 & 4.2) essentially reduce to showing that DAMAS converges to UCB1-style behavior within stationary phases, yielding O(logT) static regret. This result relies on long dwell times and offers little advance over classical stationary-bandit analyses. I think for a non-stationary bandit setting, it'd be much more helpful to investigate the dynamic regret, to enable comparison with related works on non-stationary bandits.\n- I also still have concerns over the computational overhead of the current framework. The multi-agent Bayesian updates and Bayesian-optimization tuning is reported as roughly 39.3× slower than UCB. For real-world, large-scale or high-frequency decision systems, this can be too much to handle and further optimization might be required.\n- The paper mainly considers UCB/TS-based methods as its baselines, but it omits standard variation-budget and parameter-free non-stationary bandit methods such as RExp3."}, "questions": {"value": "- The framework requires pre-training each agent in a fixed environment to estimate, then uses Gaussian likelihoods to update environment posteriors online.

I have a hard time discerning the difference between this model and that of a non-stationary multi-armed bandit model captured by the restless bandit framework (espcially refering to lines 130-137). Even if there are (perhaps marginal) differences between the authors problem setting and the restless bandit setting, it seems like this should have been at least mentioned in the literature review.\n\n- I have a hard time understanding the multi-agent aspect of this work. It seems to me that the algorithm is finding the best agent for the context, and each agent accordingly takes the best action. How is this any different than regular MAB with nested action space? That is we consider the \"agent\" in this paper just another \"action\" - could we not also solve this using combinatorial bandit for example? If so then the authors should consider a larger array of baseline algorithms. \n\n- W.r.t. to the theory, the authors argue that their problem reduces to a UCB algorithm (if I'm not mistaken), and given that UCB has logarithmic regret, so does their algorithm. However, there is more to be desired here, and I encourage the authors to consider per se, whether the algorithm suffers from gap-dependent or gap-free regret, scaling w.r.t. the number of agents, and size of the action space etc. Overall w.r.t. to bandit theory, it is lacking some richness and depth here. It also ties back to my previous point regarding the multi-agent aspect, if this is just UCB with more arms and changing contexts - previous work has shown that in these cases, regret is logarathmic in T [1, 2].\n\n[1] Tekin, Cem, and Mingyan Liu. \"Online learning of rested and restless bandits.\" IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 58.8 (2012): 5588-5611.\n\n[2] Liu, Haoyang, Keqin Liu, and Qing Zhao. \"Logarithmic weak regret of non-bayesian restless multi-armed bandit.\" 2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP).

This is shown in line 301, where arm-means range in $[0.2,0.7], [0.02,0.09], [1.5,2.5]$ for $e_O, e_1, e_2$, respectively.
