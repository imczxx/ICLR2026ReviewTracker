Recent advances have integrated machine learning to predict partial solutions by exploiting structural patterns in MILP instances. However, existing methods often suffer from inaccurate and infeasible predictions, limiting their practical utility. In this work, we improve the Contrastive Predict-and-Search (ConPaS) framework by introducing a Hybrid Training Strategy with Adaptive Search Region Adjustment mechanism (HTS-Adapt). HTS selectively applies label-based learning and contrastive learning based on the structural properties of variables, improving prediction accuracy. Adapt dynamically adjusts the search space to mitigate infeasible predictions, thereby reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a notable performance enhancement by improving prediction accuracy and reducing the search space, proving its effectiveness in addressing real-world MILP challenges. Compared to the MILP solver SCIP, our method achieves an average reduction of more than 50\\% in the solution gap across four MILP datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Mixed Integer Linear Programming", "Machine Learning", "Predict-and-Search"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e7b65b0e54d79f48ef06dd98ea5836a90d657290.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f8c447e160ed37573cc0dc2b95f1b9d6bf1f2b09.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes HTS-Adapt, an approach that integrates two innovative techniques to enhance the predict-and-search pipeline.

The authors should consider a broader set of baselines, including learning-based branch-and-cut and learning-based LNS methods.\nNovelty: While the HTS component is well-designed, it essentially combines two existing techniques. The IIS component, on the other hand, appears more rooted in operations research than machine learning, and also seems an employment of existing approaches. Thus, the novelty of the paper may be limited.\nClarity on IIS: The description of the IIS procedure is somewhat unclear, and I do not fully understand. For example, in Line 4 of Algorithm 1, what does \"fix\" entail when $\\Delta\\neq 0$—hard fixing (as in LNS) or soft fixing (as in local branching)? Additionally, does the second constraint set $C_2$ contain at most one element (i.e., the trust region constraint)?"}, "questions": {"value": "1. There is an assumption that \"some variables consistently exhibit identical values across high-quality solution sets.\" This makes sense, but to be more critic, what is the underlying intuition for this phenomenon? Furthermore, what would it imply if this assumption does not hold—would the HTS method reduce to contrastive learning, thereby invalidating the first contribution?\n2. Algorithm 1 involves repeatedly solving MILPs within a 1000-second time limit. Since the total time limit in experiments is also set to 1000 seconds, does this imply that the repetition occurs only once?\n3. In Figure 2, for MIS and MVC instances, the blue curve (HTS-Adapt) is significantly lower than others from the beginning, suggesting better initial prediction. However, for CA and IP instances, all methods perform comparably in the first 200 seconds, after which HTS-Adapt gradually outperforms the rest. How can this difference be explained?
