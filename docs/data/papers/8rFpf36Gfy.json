Rather than modeling such systems directly in the time domain, chaotic time series are often reconstructed in higher-dimensional phase spaces, where latent structures such as attractors and fixed points emerge. However, forecasting within this context remains challenging, as conventional time series models are ill-suited to capture the complex interplay between spatial and temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose ChaoticFuzz, a novel framework that transforms univariate chaotic time series into graph-structured data by leveraging fuzzy clustering in phase space. Our framework encodes temporal trajectories and fuzzy membership degrees to construct weighted graphs, enabling the application of Graph Neural Networks for accurate long-term prediction. This graph-based representation preserves essential spatiotemporal patterns that are often lost in traditional approaches. Experiments on several benchmark chaotic systems demonstrate that ChaoticFuzz significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which reflect a model’s ability to follow complex dynamical behavior.", "tldr": "We propose ChaoticFuzz, a fuzzy-logic-based method that transforms chaotic time series into graphs for improved prediction using Graph Neural Networks.", "keywords": ["Time Series", "Chaos Theory", "Fuzzy Systems", "Graph Neural Network"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f335490827c5f59b10d999bc3add9adbfed25b4f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper investigates forecasting in chaotic dynamical systems, which are known for their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. \nIt motivates the need for models capable of capturing complex temporal dependencies that traditional approaches such as ARIMA and RNNs often fail to represent. \nTo address this, the authors propose a method that embeds time series data into a high-dimensional phase space and applies fuzzy clustering to uncover latent structures in the data.\n\nFrom the resulting membership matrix, which encodes the degree of association between data points and clusters, a graph representation is constructed. \nThis graph is then used as input to a Graph Neural Network to perform time series forecasting.\n\nThe paper reports that, somewhat surprisingly, recent models such as Chronos and TimesFM (2024) perform worse than an LSTM baseline. \nThe reported RMSE values are consistently higher than the baseline and are not clearly emphasized, \nwhich raises questions about the robustness of the experimental setup and the tuning of comparison models."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "the idea of using fuzzy clustering for time series is interesting\n\nresults for DTW seem in favour of the propose method."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "the RMSE results are negative"}, "questions": {"value": "what are the limitations / tradeoffs of your method?\n\nwhy chronos and timesFM (from 2024) perform worst than LSTM?\n\nis possible to compare with other methods for chaotic systems?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "O4bZRk3TWq", "forum": "8rFpf36Gfy", "replyto": "8rFpf36Gfy", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10049/Reviewer_3ymf"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10049/Reviewer_3ymf"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10049/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761576846582, "cdate": 1761576846582, "tmdate": 1762921448026, "mdate": 1762921448026, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose the ChaoticFuzz method for univariate chaotic time series, which transforms the input into weighted graphs via phase-space reconstruction, and based on the similarity of fuzzy membership degrees, which encodes proximity and uncertainty.

Methods include sparse graph structure learning and fully-connected graphs, with some approaches also applying to univariate time series. It is hard to position the paper in the time series spatiotemporal community since related methods and their limitations are not discussed.\n2. **[Positioning against works on dynamical systems]** The chaotic univariate time series and non-linear dynamical systems are interconnected. While there are several related works in machine learning for dynamical systems and spatiotemporal forecasting [Li et al, 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Kissas et al., 2022], those are not discussed or experimentally evaluated in the presented results.\n3. **[Scope of selected datasets]** The datasets selected for experiments do not represent a common benchmark in the time series forecasting field, while the baselines chosen have been proposed for standard time series datasets, multivariate in most cases, with some univariate examples as well (see datasets in Time-Series-Library: https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library, M4 is univariate). Similarly, for dynamical systems and spatiotemporal forecasting, there are additional datasets used [Herzen et al., 2022] (see also datasets used in papers in point 2). Therefore, the significance of the contribution is limited experimentally to very few, assumption-constrained datasets. \n4. **[Application scope]** It seems that the application scope of the proposed method is limited to univariate and chaotic time series, and it remains unclear how it can generalize to real-world time series that are noisy, have correlated variables, multiple covariates, distribution shifts, and lack stationarity.\n5. **[Significance of results and architectural design choice]** Performance improvements are, in several cases, incremental/missing compared to baselines. Additionally, no ablation studies are provided to justify the design choice/effect of basic modules of the proposed baselines, e.g., the graph structure module, the attention-based GNN, clustering loss, etc. \n\n- Yi, Kun, et al. \"FourierGNN: Rethinking multivariate time series forecasting from a pure graph perspective.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 36 (2023): 69638-69660.\n- Li, Zongyi, et al. \"Fourier neural operator for parametric partial differential equations.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.08895 (2020).\nWang, Rui, et al. \"Koopman neural forecaster for time series with temporal distribution shifts.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.03675 (2022).\n- Kissas, Georgios, et al. \"Learning operators with coupled attention.\" Journal of Machine Learning Research 23.215 (2022): 1-63.\n- Herzen, Julien, et al. \"Darts: User-friendly modern machine learning for time series.\" Journal of Machine Learning Research 23.124 (2022): 1-6."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Additionally, while the use of DTW is insightful, the authors’ claim that it better captures “true dynamics” than RMSE could be further validated by quantitative measures of attractor fidelity (e.g., Lyapunov exponents, correlation dimension).
