Existing data-driven forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short time interval, e.g., 6 hours, and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout for long-term forecastsing, e.g., 5 days. However, this paradigm suffers from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2) the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding  accurately encodes the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Deep Learning; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Weather Forecasting"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b82486b9282fb46896795d5fce1b7960aa96280f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ARROW, an Adaptive Rollout and Routing framework for global weather forecasting (GWF).\nThe authors address two long-standing issues in data-driven GWF:Insufficient modeling of multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies, as most methods independently train single-interval forecasting models (SIFMs).Rigid autoregressive rollout schemes, which use fixed or greedy intervals regardless of atmospheric dynamics.\nTo overcome these, ARROW integrates two key innovations:Multi-Interval Forecasting Model (MIFM) with a Shared–Private Mixture-of-Experts (S&P MoE) architecture and Ring Positional Encoding (RPE) for Earth’s spherical geometry.Adaptive Rollout Scheduler (AR Scheduler) trained via Deep Q-learning to dynamically select forecasting intervals conditioned on the current weather state."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "* The paper is well-written, with a clear problem statement and a well-organized structure.\n\n* The authors propose a Ring Positional Encoding (RPE) that is more suitable for global prediction tasks. Theoretically, in the 1D case, the encoding ensures that points closer on the circular domain remain close in the RPE space. The visualization further demonstrates that along the latitude, points near the boundaries are represented with shorter distances, capturing the circular nature of global coordinates.\n\n* The paper introduces a Shared-Private Mixture of Experts architecture, which enables a single model to produce predictions at multiple temporal resolutions within one iterative step.\n\n* The authors further propose an AR Scheduler Fine-tuning strategy that adaptively selects the number of rollout steps during inference. It employs a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to estimate the state–action value function, and an Adaptive Rollout Fine-tuning Algorithm is designed to jointly optimize the DQN and the environment."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* The experiments are conducted under a limited data setting — using a resolution of 128×256 and only six variables.

Its mechanism is only reflected in the RMSE values in Table 3, without showing the distribution of selected rollout lengths or how the scheduler adapts to different cases.\n\n* Similarly, the paper lacks sufficient analysis to demonstrate how the Shared & Private Mixture of Experts (S&P-MoE) functions. Although the ablation setting is described in Section 2, there is no analysis of the routing behavior or how experts are dynamically selected in different situations.\n\n* In the case study, the paper does not compare its predictions against other methods, making it difficult to assess whether the proposed approach provides improved capture of fine-grained atmospheric variations compared to existing models."}, "questions": {"value": "* In the AR Scheduler Fine-tuning strategy, what exactly does the term “environment” refer to? Could you please provide a more detailed explanation of its definition and role within the fine-tuning framework?\n\n* Regarding fine-tuning strategies, how does the proposed Adaptive Rollout compare with other approaches such as Pangu-Weather’s rollout scheme, Fengwu’s replay-buffer-based fine-tuning, Fuxi’s multi-timescale cascaded fine-tuning, and GraphCast’s multi-step fine-tuning?\n\n* How would the AR Scheduler Fine-tuning strategy perform when combined with the Pangu-Weather model?
