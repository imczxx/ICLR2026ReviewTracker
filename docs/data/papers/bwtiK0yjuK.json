Furthermore, we derive the limiting distributions of the refined estimators under both vanishing and non-vanishing jump regimes.

In the current draft, the primary difference seems to be a regime shift (online $\\rightarrow$ offline) while keeping the same modeling assumptions (multilayer RDPG/GRDPG) and the same screen–then–refine structure and target. As written, this reads more like an extension to the offline setting than a fully new methodological framework.\n\n\n2. $\\textbf{Narrow regime.}$ The methodology focuses on time-invariant latent positions with only changes in global layer weights. This means that the communities of nodes remain consistent over time; in this scenario, the change points appear to be narrowly defined, as they cannot disrupt the community structure of the networks. Many practical settings involve node-localized changes alongside shifts in community structure, where the latent positions $X(t)$ should also be able to vary (See [2] for an example). The current scope does not account for these regimes. \n\n\n3. $\\textbf{Spacing dependence.}$ The paper assumes a strong gap at the order $T$--with a gap at the order of $T$ and the number of change points is $O(1)$, spacing-free $\\ell_0$ approach can already achieve $\\textbf{exact selection}$ and the same $O(\\kappa^{-2})$ localization approach without a minimal spacing condition. In contrast, using binary segmentation requires setting up the minimal spacing window, which is not necessary and could be misleading. For example. The paper effectively must generate evenly spaced change points. If, instead, change times are drawn i.i.d.\\ from a distribution—e.g.,\n$\n\\eta_1,\\ldots,\\eta_K \\sim \\mathrm{Unif} \\{ 2,\\ldots,T \\},\n$\nthe minimal spacing\n$\n\\Delta_{\\min}:=\\min_{1\\le k\\le K+1}\\bigl(\\eta_k-\\eta_{k-1}\\bigr)\n$\ntypically collapses. This destroys the large-spacing assumption required by a CUSUM screen and makes any fixed spacing window ill-posed. By contrast, spacing-free $\\(\\ell_0\\)$ approaches remain optimal/consistent in this setting and do not require enforcing even spacing.\n\n\nFor the $\\ell_0$ approach to estimation of dynamic (possible multilayer) networks, I refer to [2], but I believe more literature can be found.\n\nFor comparison between CUSUM and $\\ell_0$ approach, I refer to [3]. See Section 4, 'However, compared to the $l_0$-penalization methods, WBS is computationally more expensive and involves more tuning parameters.''.\n\n4. Simulations use (nearly) evenly spaced changes, reinforcing the strong-spacing assumption; real-data experiments also use very small $n,T,L$, This leaves the reader with the impression that the method hinges on large spacing and may not scale or adapt to realistic, short-gap or node–localized scenarios.\n\n[1] Wang, Fan, et al. \"Multilayer random dot product graphs: Estimation and online change point detection.\" Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B: Statistical Methodology (2025): qkaf051.\n\n[2] Zhao, P., Bhattacharya, A., Pati, D., & Mallick, B.
