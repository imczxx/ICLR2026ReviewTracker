In this paper, we notice how the fast pace of progress around the topics of oversmoothing and oversquashing, the homophily-heterophily dichotomy, and long-range tasks, came with the consolidation of commonly accepted beliefs and assumptions that are not always true nor easy to distinguish from each other. We argue that this has led to ambiguities around the investigated problems, preventing researchers from focusing on and addressing precise research questions while causing a good amount of misunderstandings. Our contribution wants to make such common beliefs explicit and encourage critical thinking around these topics, supported by simple but noteworthy counterexamples. The hope is to clarify the distinction between the different issues and promote separate but intertwined research directions to address them.", "tldr": "This paper challenges some of the common beliefs and assumptions in the graph machine learning community.", "keywords": ["oversmoothing", "oversquashing", "heterophily", "long-range propagation", "graph neural networks", "graph machine learning"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/157d2da9c348151a7a2f6af963945f168f27c243.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9bfe550f1dc67fcfba23dc3708cd52d744df0ada.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper clarifies recent concepts in the graph machine learning community, such as oversmoothing and heterophily, and raises simple but noteworthy counterexamples."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The paper openly challenges sloppy community narratives about depth, heterophily, and “oversquashing,” and reminds readers that degradation in deep GNNs is not the same thing as classic oversmoothing, and that heterophily alone does not doom GNNs. \n2.

The primary claims of this paper overlap significantly with established findings in the GNN literature.\n* On Over-smoothing: The observation that removing feature transformations and non-linearities can boost performance in moderately deep GNNs has been demonstrated by prior work, such as SGC [1] and a KDD'22 paper [2]. These studies have already established that performance degradation in models of the depth used in this paper (e.g., 64 layers) is often attributable to feature transformation and non-linearity, rather than over-smoothing alone, which typically manifests in much deeper architectures.\n* On Heterophily: The challenges of heterophily have been extensively analyzed. A well-known paper [3] provides a comprehensive treatment of this topic. Unfortunately, the current work does not seem to offer new perspectives or insights beyond what was presented in [3].\n------\n2. Given that the paper addresses topics with a rich history of research, a deeper investigation from novel perspectives or a rigorous theoretical analysis would be expected. However, the current analysis lacks the necessary depth.\n* The investigation into over-smoothing is confined to a few simple settings on a single dataset (Cora). This limited experimental setup is not convincing enough to reveal generalizable patterns or provide robust evidence for the claims made.\n* The discussion on heterophily relies on reusing a toy example from [3] without introducing new conceptual or empirical contributions. A more compelling argument would require novel experiments or theoretical formulations.\n\n------\n3. About the statement ‘if different classes imply different feature distributions, why would one need a DGN rather than a simple MLP?’\n\nI also disagree with the way that’s phrased in the submission.\nEven if different classes have different feature distributions, classification boundaries may still be ambiguous (e.g., overlapping Gaussians, noisy features, etc.). A plain MLP on node features alone may misclassify nodes in that overlapping region.\nA message-passing layer can still add value by smoothing / denoising via neighbors: even if node i’s own features are ambiguous, aggregating its neighbors’ features can push it toward the correct side of the decision boundary. This is exactly the classic semi-supervised “feature smoothing” or “label propagation” intuition behind GCNs.\n\nSo “why would you ever need a GNN if features are already somewhat class-dependent?” is a false dichotomy. You still may want graph convolution to regularize local decision boundaries and reduce local noise — especially when each node alone is borderline but its neighborhood is consistent.\n\n----\n4. Difference between “computational bottleneck” and “topological bottleneck” is unclear. As a core concept to support your claims, it is not wise to put it to appendix.

Lack of justification for the representativeness of rebutted claims. The paper does not convincingly establish whether the criticized viewpoints truly represent mainstream consensus in the field.

To make the critique compelling, the authors should first demonstrate the prevalence and influence of these viewpoints in prior literature.\n\n2. Insufficient theoretical and empirical validation. The arguments rely heavily on qualitative reasoning and illustrative examples, with very limited mathematical formalism or empirical validation. I am not convinced. To strengthen credibility, the paper should incorporate formal theoretical derivations, quantitative experiments, or counterfactual analyses that can substantiate its claims.\n\n3. The manuscript attempts to address too many issues simultaneously, resulting in a lack of depth and weakened persuasiveness. I strongly recommend focusing on one or two truly dominant misconceptions and providing a rigorous, well-supported, and empirically validated analysis of these specific points. For example, the classic paper “Adversarial examples are not bugs, they are features” offers a good example: it concentrates on a single misconception and dismantles it thoroughly through both theoretical modeling and empirical evidence.\n\n4. Several arguments (e.g., regarding differences between homophilic and heterophilic graphs) have already been discussed—explicitly or implicitly—in prior works.
