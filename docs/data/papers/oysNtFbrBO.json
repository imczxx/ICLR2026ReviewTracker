The paper does not analyze how these simplifications affect the claimed guarantees or the empirical performance of the method.\n\nThere is no direct theoretical or empirical analysis of how close the rewired graph is to the original graph, or to what extent it preserves the original graph’s topology.\n\n**Regarding Theorem 4.1:**\n- Theorem 4.1 compares the Schreier–coset graph to the original graph. However, the final graph used in the method is not the Schreier–coset graph; it is a selective merge of edges from the Schreier–coset graph and the original graph. Even if the Schreier–coset graph were “similar” to the original graph, that does not imply that this selectively rewired graph is also similar.\n\n- Theorem 4.1 does not provide a meaningful quantitative guarantee. The constant $c$ is left unbounded, and the claim is essentially intuitive. Stating that node distances in the Schreier–coset graph are (in expectation) shorter than in the original graph is just restating a standard property of expander-like graphs and does not, on its own, establish the usefulness of the proposed rewiring.\n\n**Regarding experiments:**\n- The evaluation is limited to six graph classification benchmarks, which is not sufficient to support broad claims. The method should also be tested on node classification tasks,.\n\n- There is no empirical runtime or memory analysis. The paper claims near-linear complexity, but does not provide wall-clock time or scaling experiments. This raises concerns about practical computational cost.\n\n**Clarity and positioning:**\n- The paper is not fully self-contained. Several central concepts are only briefly described, and important background is omitted.

The manuscript is hard to follow in some sections due to its lack of readability and structure. \n  - For example, in the related work section, the sentence \"In Expander Graphs-Expanders provide favorable spectral gap and resistance\" is, first, not well-written and, second, seems vague because it lacks analytical depth. Also, \"In message-passing networks, the gradient flow between distant nodes is inversely proportional to their effective resistance,\" is not supported by citations, and *gradient flow* is neither defined nor mentioned again. I also found it strange to read \"By coupling these two graphs with strength,..\" in the abstract, where strength has not been introduced yet nor is it common terminology in the literature.\n  - The related work section provides an insufficient and unclear explanation of previous methods' limitations and how SCGR addresses them. \n  - Additionally, in the preliminaries, many concepts are introduced without sufficient explanation or connection, appearing as isolated elements. The readability is poor and can also be improved in sections 3.3 and 4. Overall, careful proofreading and restructuring would significantly enhance the document’s readability and clarity.\n  - The clarity in the methodological explanation could also be improved. For instance, the mapping ($\\phi: V_{\\text{in}}\\to V_\\Gamma$) is not defined in detail. I understand (iiuc) that the \"spectral mapping construction\" minimizes a distance objective with a closeness constraint to spectral embeddings, but the optimization problem is not fully formalized (objective, constraints, solver), and its complexity and approximation quality are unclear.\n  - Precisely define *how ER is computed (exact or approximation) and aggregated* (average over all pairs? over a sample? normalized by (n)?). The very large absolute ER values in Table 3 need units/normalization and a reproducible computation recipe. Are you talking about the total effective resistance (sum over all pairs) or the average effective resistance (average over all pairs)?\n  - There are no links or appendix tables for hyperparameters per dataset, and no ablations on $\\ell$ or $\\varepsilon$ and added-edge budgets, limiting the interpretability of the results.\n  \n- Recent work shows the community is using two distinct notions under the same term: (i) a computational bottleneck view (over-squashing as compressing exponentially growing messages through fixed-width vectors along long dependency paths), and (ii) a topological bottleneck view (over-squashing as poor connectivity / high effective resistance / small spectral gap). The paper implicitly adopts the topological lens (effective resistance, expansion), but never states this upfront. Please disambiguate early (Intro/Preliminaries) which definition you use, cite both lines of work, and acknowledge limitations / potential tensions: e.g., rewiring that adds edges can reduce effective resistance yet may widen message fan-in and thus increase the computational bottleneck, whereas deleting/sparsifying edges has the opposite trade-off.
