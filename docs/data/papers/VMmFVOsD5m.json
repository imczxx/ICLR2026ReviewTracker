We train a non-causal transformer on sequences of data-label-pairs and and unlabeled query sample, to directly predict the label of the query sample. This causes the transformer to learn an implicit learning algorithm, which enables it to learn new concepts at test time without fine-tuning. Empirically, TAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while generalizing to unseen domains and modalities. Unlike other meta-learning methods, it sustains strong performance on tasks with up to 20 times more classes than in training while providing orders of magnitude computational savings.

The reviewer could not agree with the definition of algorithm-explicit/implicit learning in section 2.3. The paper defines the distinction as if its training procedure is explicitly specified, and specify GD as explicitly specified while attention-based meta-learners are not.

While the authors have identified short comings from prior works (e.g. not being invariant in sample ordering, generalizing to different modalities or class cardinalities), the novelties are strictly within the detailed architectural designs (which the reviewer has recognized as the strength of the paper). Therefore, the novelty of the paper is severely limited.\n\nWithin Section 2, the paper sets up theoretical foundations for meta-learning and so called algorithm-implicit and algorithm-explicit learning systems. However, while it is nice to formulate the notions such as practical universality, for the proposed method, there is lack of connection between these theoretical discussions in Section 2 and the designed approaches. The algorithm-implicit nature of the approach is easily recognized for the model-based approaches as the authors have surveyed. The reviewer questions the necessity of the theoretical discussions in Section 2, as well as the overall theoretical contribution of the paper.\n\nSome parts of the write-ups need to be fixed or improved:\n1.
