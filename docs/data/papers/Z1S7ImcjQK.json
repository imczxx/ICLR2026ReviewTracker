While effective for obtaining clustered representations, this objective provides limited control over how data variations structure the feature space, hindering disentanglement. Recent methods improve feature space structure by imposing equivariant predictability on feature transformations induced by data augmentations. However, existing approaches suffer from two significant limitations: (i) the incorporation of invariance in their final objective interferes with the learning of neat equivariance; (ii) the imposition of uniform equivariance across all samples forces semantic clusters into a parallel arrangement, leading to reduced inter-cluster distances (for features on the hypersphere). To overcome these issues, we propose in this paper Cluster-Dependent Rotational Equivariance for Disentanglement (CD-RED), a framework that enables learning neat equivariance and uniformly distributed clusters, while further supporting perfect disentanglement. Notably, CD-RED explicitly encodes variations as rotations via a direct product of $SO(2)$ groups within orthogonal hyperspherical subspaces, providing a principled mechanism for precise equivariance. We theoretically and experimentally establish that CD-RED achieves perfectly disentangled representations, suggesting a promising new direction for self-supervised disentanglement.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Self Supervised Learning", "Representation Learning", "Rotational Equivariance", "Disentanglement"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bfd3c2ad6f404f5688e72dbf0cc76c7331747afe.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper aims to achieve self-supervised disentanglement of content and style factors in images without labels by enforcing geometric constraints on learned representations.

Augmentations change only the style but never content.\n    4. User essentially has access to the ground-truth data generating process, being able to intervene the styles of images through augmentations while knowing the exact magnitude of the intervention.\n\n- The strong disentanglement results rely on a hand-crafted post-processing stage. This leads to unfair comparisons with baselines, which do not leverage post-processing. For example, the post-processing includes concatenation of a one-hot content code, which can boosts completeness and disentanglement score.\n\n- Experiments are only on synthetic datasets such as Shapes3D, MPI3D, 3DIdent, where they use the ground-truth latent transformations as augmentations (with the exact parameter 𝑡). This is impractical for the real self-supervised regime in the wild, where estimating 𝑡 and $q_a(t)$ is difficult.
