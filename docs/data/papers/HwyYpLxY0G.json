A scoring rule is proper if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the expected score. With the development of language models, Wu & Hartline (2024) proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical (i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with human preference while maintaining properness.", "tldr": "We design a human-aligned scoring rule for text that preserves properness while better matching human preferences than prior methods.", "keywords": ["Scoring Rule", "Large Language Model", "Education"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3f2381361217bb5da6b6ffa6a591821735643947.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper builds on textual elicitation via LLM oracles and proposes an Aligned Scoring Rule (ASR): optimize (via convex programming) over proper scoring rules to minimize MSE against a reference score (instructor or LLM-judge), aiming to keep properness while improving human alignment. It relies on the ElicitationGPT reduction (summarization + QA oracle) and evaluates on peer-grading data.

For a mechanism-design paper making alignment claims, this omission is severe—readers are left without synthesized takeaways or scope boundaries.\n\n- Over-general claim vs. narrow evaluation\n\nThe paper positions ASR as a general textual scoring alignment method, yet experiments are confined to peer grading in two undergraduate algorithm classes (22 assignments, 6–8 submissions each). For such a broad claim, 1 domain / 1 application family is insufficient (no summarization, coding, reasoning competitions, multi-hop QA, etc.).\n\n- Mechanism rationale under-explained\n\nWhile ASR enforces properness and minimizes MSE to a reference, there is no theoretical argument (or stress test) explaining why MSE alignment to potentially noisy or biased references (instructor / LLM-judge) yields better truthful textual elicitation in the wild. E.g., no analysis of error propagation from oracles, sample complexity, or generalization beyond the training clusters.\n\n- Baselines and diagnostics are thin for the claim\n\nComparisons cover best-constant and non-aligned ElicitationGPT (AV/MV), plus correlations against instructor/LLM-judge. Missing are: (a) stronger parametric aligners (e.g., small finetuned judger trained on the same reference), (b) adversarial/strategic probes that the paper’s properness motivation emphasizes, and (c) deeper ablations on oracle quality and cluster granularity."}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 0}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Xy3WojSd2A", "forum": "HwyYpLxY0G", "replyto": "HwyYpLxY0G", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9131/Reviewer_DHrE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9131/Reviewer_DHrE"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9131/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761845194184, "cdate": 1761845194184, "tmdate": 1762923665293, "mdate": 1762923665293, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper violates the paper guidelines, and therefore i recommend rejection."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "I have not checked the paper, as the paper has formatting errors and violates the ICLR guidelines."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I have not checked the paper, as the paper has formatting errors and violates the ICLR guidelines."}, "questions": {"value": "Not applicable."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 0}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "QV6DwjimJk", "forum": "HwyYpLxY0G", "replyto": "HwyYpLxY0G", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9131/Reviewer_ddre"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9131/Reviewer_ddre"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9131/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762680190937, "cdate": 1762680190937, "tmdate": 1762920822663, "mdate": 1762920822663, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "I was told to write a placeholder review here, since this paper is getting desk rejected due to not following the template."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "I was told to write a placeholder review here, since this paper is getting desk rejected due to not following the template."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I was told to write a placeholder review here, since this paper is getting desk rejected due to not following the template."}, "questions": {"value": "I was told to write a placeholder review here, since this paper is getting desk rejected due to not following the template."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 0}, "confidence": {"value": 1}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "MgKR9F8aR5", "forum": "HwyYpLxY0G", "replyto": "HwyYpLxY0G", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9131/Reviewer_2wqj"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9131/Reviewer_2wqj"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9131/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762784458514, "cdate": 1762784458514, "tmdate": 1762920822416, "mdate": 1762920822416, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper has no \"Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026\" above each page.
