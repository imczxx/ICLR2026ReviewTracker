As the generation process is inherently sequential, the acceleration of sampling is of significant importance. In this work, we parallelize the mainstream $\\tau$-leaping algorithm for absorbing discrete diffusion in a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) framework. By leveraging the continuous-time stochastic integral form of the $\\tau$-leaping algorithm and the Picard iteration method, we achieve parallel-in-time sampling acceleration. We implement a predictor-corrector structure based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to control for additional errors and provide a proof of exponential convergence for our algorithm. We improve the overall time complexity of $\\tau$-leaping from $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{2})$ to at most $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2})$. In practice, our accelerated algorithm can achieve at most 5 to 8-fold sampling speedup over the traditional time-sequential $\\tau$-leaping with respect to wall-clock time on convex, non-convex, and high-dimensional discrete distributions. Our research broadens the scope of leveraging discrete diffusion models in various challenging areas like molecular structure generation and Large Language Models (LLMs).", "tldr": "Parallel-in-time sampling acceleration for tau-leaping algorithm in discrete diffusion models", "keywords": ["Generative Models", "Discrete Diffusion models", "Parallel Computing", "Sampling"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8cf53d5233736d730598147311da915eceda7b09.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c7d9eb730f9b92ea9657fbe551bb85819b9213f5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tackles slow, inherently sequential sampling in discrete diffusion by introducing a parallel-in-time $\\tau$-leaping scheme based on Picard iteraiont.

Moreover, it requires a higher memory going from O(d) to O(d^3/2 log^1/2(d)). Given these increased constraints, it is important the authors provide a more careful empirical study of how these parameters can affect performance. In particular, can authors run experiments on real hardware (real GPUs with additional bottlenecks) and show the real memory consumed as well as runtimes for different number of GPUs and different values of dimensionality d (and the parameters of the algorithm)? I think it is important to understand the limitations of the approach, since in practice we could sometimes be bottlenecked by memory.\n\n* The authors provide runtime comparison of their algorithm to its sequential counterpart,  but they do not, in fact, compare performance of their approach to methods listed in Table 1. I think it will be highly informative to see what is the performance of these baseline methods.
