Yet our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2) using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that, compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while significantly reducing no-think output length (from 1085 to 585 on MATH500) and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as \"wait\" (from 5917 to 522 on MATH500).

While numerous SFT data processing methods exist to enhance reasoning efficiency, the experimental validation of the proposed method is limited.

Therefore, the data ratio finding is not practically used to validate its effectiveness.\n\n2. The main advantage of the proposed training method is the more controlled and efficient no-think mode. There are no obvious improvements for the more time-consuming and important thinking mode. The controllability of no-think mode can be improved with better prompts. Therefore, this method should also be compared with other SFT and training-free methods in the perspective of efficiency and effectiveness trade-off.\n\n3.
