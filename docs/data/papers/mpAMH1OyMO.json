Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in this domain, most notably through the Learning to Run a Power Network competitions, but prior work has primarily focused on single-agent settings, neglecting the decentralized, multi-agent nature of grid control.\nWe fill this gap with MARL2Grid, the first benchmark for multi-agent RL (MARL) in power grid operations, developed in collaboration with transmission system operators. Built on RTE France’s high-fidelity simulation platform, MARL2Grid supports decentralized control across substations and generators, with configurable agent scopes, observability settings, expert-informed heuristics, and safety-critical constraints.\nThe benchmark includes a suite of realistic scenarios that expose key challenges, such as coordination under partial information, long-horizon objectives, and adherence to hard physical constraints.

The design, developed in collaboration with Transmission System Operators (TSOs), adds a layer of realism and credibility to the proposed problem setting.\n\n2, The benchmark is well-structured, offering a suite of tasks across various grid scales (bus14, bus36, bus118), two distinct and crucial control paradigms (discrete topology and continuous redispatch), configurable observability regimes, and explicit safety constraints such as load shedding and line overloads (Sections 3, 3.2). This provides a rich and challenging testbed for future MARL research.\n\n3, The empirical results effectively highlight the brittleness of current MARL algorithms when faced with a complex, realistic task. For instance, while MAPPO achieves a 79% survival rate on the bus14 topology task (Table 5), its performance collapses to near-zero on the more complex bus118 grid (Figure 7), starkly illustrating the benchmark's difficulty and motivating the need for novel algorithmic solutions."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1, The paper's central premise is that the decentralized nature of power grids necessitates a MARL approach (Lines 014-016). However, this claim is not substantiated with experimental evidence. A critical baseline is fatally absent: a strong, centralized single-agent RL controller (e.g., single-agent PPO) that has access to the full state and action space. Without this comparison, it is impossible to determine whether the proposed multi-agent decomposition (1) offers any performance benefit, (2) is truly necessary for scalability, or (3) merely introduces unnecessary complexity that hinders performance. This is a major flaw in validating the paper's core motivation.\n\n2, The paper successfully demonstrates that current algorithms fail, particularly on large-scale topology optimization (Figure 7). However, it stops at reporting the phenomenon (e.g., \"MAPPO failed\") without providing a deep diagnostic analysis of why they fail. The root cause—be it challenges in credit assignment under partial observability, inefficient exploration in a combinatorial action space, or poor coordination—remains unexplored. This lack of insight limits the benchmark's utility in guiding future"}, "questions": {"value": "1, The role and efficacy of the \"idle heuristic\" are unclear. Was this heuristic only applied in the bus118 continuous task, or was it also used for the bus14 topology task where MAPPO performed well? To isolate and validate its contribution, could you provide an ablation study (e.g., MAPPO with vs. without the heuristic on the bus14 task) to quantify its actual impact on performance?\n\n2, To experimentally validate the core motivation for a MARL approach, could you please provide a performance comparison against a centralized single-agent RL baseline (e.g., single-agent PPO) on the bus14 and bus118 topology optimization tasks? This result is crucial for justifying the choice of the MARL paradigm over a simpler, centralized one.\n\n3, Performance drops dramatically from bus14 to bus118. To better understand the scalability limits of current MARL methods, could you provide results for the intermediate-sized bus36 grid in the topology optimization task? This would help clarify whether the performance degradation is gradual or a sharp cliff-edge effect at a certain complexity threshold.\n\n4, The results show that algorithms fail on large-scale tasks (Figure 7). Can you provide a more in-depth diagnostic analysis of these failures? For instance, is the failure primarily due to a lack of coordination, inefficient exploration, or credit assignment challenges under partial observability? A statistical breakdown of which safety constraints are most frequently violated would provide valuable guidance for future research."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "9lNDTbmj37", "forum": "mpAMH1OyMO", "replyto": "mpAMH1OyMO", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11114/Reviewer_eRUd"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11114/Reviewer_eRUd"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11114/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761903217344, "cdate": 1761903217344, "tmdate": 1762922287033, "mdate": 1762922287033, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Modern power grids face increasing complexity due to renewable integration, requiring fast, decentralized control beyond traditional optimization.
