Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1% - 2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Unlearning", "Graph Unlearning", "Spatio-Temporal Graph Unlearning", "Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning", "Graph Neural Networks"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e9cdce7f6dcbb89215ecb2d55f9ec0fa90bd62f5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b806c0bef4abd1eb49a5b713b2715c164c499e4e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the requirement for the \"right to be forgotten\" in spatiotemporal graph data under privacy regulations by proposing the CallosumNet framework.

The authors mention privacy issues, but in reality, most spatio-temporal datasets are open-source and do not involve personal information. The statement, \"As a result, ensuring compliance with these privacy requirements often requires retraining the entire spatio-temporal graph model to preserve privacy for individual nodes, a process that, while essential, introduces additional computational demands,\" raises questions. Why is retraining needed? What are the specific necessity and application scenarios for individually protecting the privacy of a particular node?\n\n- The authors emphasize interpretability in the introduction, but the experimental section does not provide significant or clear demonstrations aligned with this claim.\n\n- The reasons why existing unlearning algorithms fail need further explanation.\n\n- Section 4.1 is suggested to be divided into subsections for better structure.\n\n- What is the principle for selecting baselines? More advanced models such as STID, D2STGNN, BIST, and BIGST should be included for comparison. Furthermore, the unlearning methods used as baselines require further justification and explanation.\n\n- The literature review is insufficient. With only 18 related works cited, it is difficult to convince reviewers that this adequately summarizes existing work. Consequently, I cannot clearly identify the specific shortcomings of existing technologies that this paper aims to address.\n\n- The authors should include an ablation study variant where the inputs (and edges, if necessary) for the removed nodes are set to zero. This scenario transforms the problem into a missing value imputation problem. Furthermore, I believe some powerful Transformer-based spatio-temporal graph neural networks might handle this effectively.\n\n- The formatting of equations and symbols seems odd. The template likely requires numbering like (1), not (3.1).\n\n- The problem definition is unclear. Are the two coefficients in Section 3.1 hyperparameters? Is the objective of unlearning to measure the parameter distance between two models? How is this objective reflected in the experiments? Also, what does 'I' represent?\n\n- How are the nodes selected for removal in the experiments? Was cross-validation performed to check the robustness of the method to different missing patterns?\n\n- The results are mostly presented in tables. It is recommended to include more figures for illustration and clarity.\n\n- The methodology section is difficult to understand. The authors do not provide sufficient background for each section, and many variables lack intuitive explanations, requiring significant effort to comprehend the proposed framework."}, "questions": {"value": "No additional questions."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ZyOEj8er85", "forum": "25MsStaezF", "replyto": "25MsStaezF", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23152/Reviewer_Mjfe"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23152/Reviewer_Mjfe"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23152/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761446648368, "cdate": 1761446648368, "tmdate": 1762942534389, "mdate": 1762942534389, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}, "comment": {"value": "We sincerely thank the area chair and reviewers for their valuable and insightful feedback.

The ESC and GGB modules are well-defined, and the algorithmic pipeline is clear and reproducible.\n\n- Clarity: Despite the complexity of the task, the paper is well-structured and clearly written.

CallosumNet offers a practical and scalable solution."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Limited Theoretical Analysis of Approximation Error: While the paper provides unlearning exactness, it lacks a fine-grained analysis of how approximations in ESC and GGB affect long-term prediction stability. For example, how does the meta-graph fusion affect error propagation over time? A perturbation analysis or error bound under cumulative unlearning would strengthen the contribution.\n\n- Scalability to Larger Graphs: Although the method is tested on graphs with up to 3,220 nodes, urban-scale graphs (e.g., 10K+ nodes) are not considered. The meta-graph construction and ganglion node selection may become bottlenecks in such cases. A complexity scaling analysis with respect to graph size, subgraph number M, and time steps T would be helpful.\n\n- Assumption of Frozen Subgraphs: The assumption that subgraphs can be frozen after initial training may not hold in non-stationary environments (e.g., concept drift in traffic or mobility). In such cases, subgraph retraining may be necessary, which could reduce the efficiency gain. A discussion or experiment on dynamic graphs would be valuable.\n\n- Limited Baseline Diversity: While the paper compares against 5 baselines, no comparison with recent unlearning methods from graph rewiring, influence cancellation, or gradient-based unlearning is provided. Also, no comparison with differential privacy or certified removal methods is made, which could help contextualize the exact unlearning claim.\n\n- Ethical and Societal Implications: Although the paper includes an ethics statement, it is brief and generic. Given the privacy-sensitive nature of the application, a deeper discussion on potential misuse (e.g., unlearning to hide malicious behavior) or failure modes (e.g., incomplete unlearning due to meta-graph leakage) would be appropriate."}, "questions": {"value": "- Approximation vs. Exactness Trade-off: How does CallosumNet behave under repeated unlearning requests? Does the meta-graph fusion introduce approximation drift over time?

Does freezing subgraphs still hold in such cases?\n\n- Scalability: What is the largest graph size (in nodes and edges) that CallosumNet can handle efficiently? How does the meta-graph complexity scale with M and N? Have you tested M > 16?\n\n- Comparison with Certified Removal: How does CallosumNet compare with certified unlearning methods (e.g., Newton-type updates, influence functions, gradient residual cancellation) in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and privacy guarantees?\n\n- Adversarial Robustness: Is CallosumNet robust to adversarial unlearning requests (e.g., an attacker trying to hide influence by strategically requesting unlearning)?
