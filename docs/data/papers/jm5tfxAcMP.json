With AnveshanaAI, learners are presented with a personalized dashboard featuring streaks, levels, badges, and structured navigation across domains such as data science, machine learning, deep learning, transformers, generative AI, large language models, and multimodal AI, with scope to expand in future. Our portal designs gamified tracking with points and achievements to enhance engagement and learning, while switching between Playground, Challenges, Simulator, Dashboard, and Community supports exploration and collaboration. Rather than relying on static question repositories like existing platforms, we ensure balanced progression through a 10k+ dataset grounded in Bloom’s taxonomy, with semantic similarity checks and explainable AI techniques improving transparency, reliability, and adaptivity through automated domain-aware assessment. Experiments depict broad dataset coverage and stable fine-tuning with reduced perplexity. These features illustrate how AnveshanaAI integrates adaptivity, gamification, interactivity, and explainability to support next-generation AI education.", "tldr": "AnveshanaAI is a gamified, adaptive platform for AI/ML education with automated question generation and explainable assessments.", "keywords": ["Adaptive Learning", "AI/ML Education", "Automated Question Generation", "Gamification", "Interactive Assessment", "Bloom’s Taxonomy", "Explainable AI", "Large Language Models", "Multimodal AI", "Educational Technology"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d252cb7991953b6c028828c0cbfb482482d6fd99.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work presents AnveshanaAI, an application-based learning platform for artificial intelligence.

The experimental evaluation focuses more on the dataset property itself, rather than a proposed model or algorithm. Thus, this paper may be more suitable for a dataset track paper.\n\n3. What does the results of fine-tuned Mistral 7B model mean? It is unclear what the advancement that the authors want to demonstrate, as no models or other datasets are compared. As such, the significance is unclear.\n\n4. The current experiments can't really answer the proposed three research questions, based on the limitations of the experiments, including the lack of novel model design, no model comparison, no ablation studies, and no human-factor studies with real learners. \n\n5. There is only one dataset from the authors for evaluation. No other public datasets are used, limiting the rigor and effectiveness of this work.\n\n6. F1-score = 0.427 does not seem to be a good performance. Moreover, there are no baseline models nor ablation studies.\n\n7.
