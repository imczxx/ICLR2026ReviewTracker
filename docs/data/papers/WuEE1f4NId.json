A promising strategy is to mirror the diagnostic process of clinicians, who rely on identifying specific pathological signs to make judgments. Concept-based models (CBMs) are well-suited for this, but their effectiveness often hinges on concept supervision, which is rarely available in medical imaging. To address this, we propose Knowledge Constrained Concept Learning (KCCL), a novel framework that achieves robust domain generalization through concept learning under knowledge constraints. We first curate DRL6k, a dataset of 6,000 fundus images with lesion annotations, and train a lesion detection model to provide concept supervision via knowledge distillation. However, directly using this supervision may introduce noise and inconsistencies. Therefore, KCCL employs a knowledge constraint mechanism: it leverages medical priors to correct implausible concept predictions and reduce the influence of those deviating from clinical expectations during distillation, while also directly penalizing the model for producing clinically inconsistent concept predictions. Extensive experiments on multiple unseen target datasets demonstrate that KCCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization and DR grading methods, achieving generalization by producing clinically coherent and interpretable predictions.", "tldr": "We propose KCCL, a framework that enables robust concept-based diabetic retinopathy grading, achieving superior domain generalization through refined concept layer knowledge distillation and regularization.", "keywords": ["medical imaging", "diabetic retinopathy", "generalization", "concept-based model"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/34e7df52c11997f43489c1fee74ceb3ecdaa37e2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the domain generalization problem in DR grading—a critical issue where models trained on one dataset fail to generalize across diverse clinical settings.

While DRL6k partially mitigates annotation scarcity, the overall performance still depends on the teacher model’s quality. The resting of the framework assumes access to a reasonably accurate lesion detector. Unfortunately, the curated DRL6k dataset appears to be quite small (~6,000 samples), which does not lead to a high accuracy of the lesion detection model (F1=83.3). The curation of the DRL6k dataset also relies on image-level labels. \n\n- Following my previous point, with the proposed settings, it seems that all the methods do not achieve a high accuracy in DR grading (with the highest F1=47.8). But training solely on e.g., Eyepacs and evaluating on APTOS can easily achieve an F1 score of 80. Then what is the point of applying the proposed framework ? \n\n- The use of only four lesion types in the curated dataset omits key proliferative indicators (e.g., neovascularization), potentially constraining the grading accuracy for advanced DR.\n\n- Currently, the lesion detection model is a standard ResNet50.

While the authors frame their method as introducing a “knowledge-constrained concept learning” approach, the underlying paradigm largely replicates well-established lines of work: for instance, Integrating Clinical Knowledge into Concept Bottleneck Models aligns CBMs with clinical knowledge for improved out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization [1]; several label-free or post-hoc CBM methods reduce reliance on concept annotations and perform concept distillation [2, 3].
