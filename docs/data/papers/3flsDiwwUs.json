In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that models language as a \\textbf{hybrid discrete-continuous system}, addressing both of these challenges. We introduce the \\textbf{Dynamic Interaction Field Transformer (DIFT)}, the first tokenizer-free transformer architecture that achieves word-level computational efficiency and competitive performance on standard benchmarks. DIFT operates directly on raw bytes, utilizing \\textbf{hierarchical aggregation} to learn word representations from scratch. To model context, DIFT replaces traditional self-attention with an interpretable \\textbf{continuous interaction field}, where concepts influence each other through proximity in a shared semantic space. We demonstrate that DIFT, when trained from scratch, achieves competitive performance with BERT-base on GLUE. Its tokenizer-free design also enhances robustness and enables superior zero-shot multilingual performance, effectively overcoming the core limitations of subword-based models.

From my point of view, the Transformer interaction modeling paradigm is more powerful. Yet it is even more remarkable and even surprising that this model shows similar modeling performance to parameters-matched BERT on the established GLUE benchmark.\n\n* The proposed tokenizer-free method of creating token embeddings seems to benefit performance on several tasks, such as XNLI."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Insufficient descriptions**\n\nDIFT algorithm is not fully specified. For example, neither lines 196-199, nor 668-670 establish a precise mathematical formula for $f_{\\phi}$. Likewise, there are no formulas for $\\alpha_i$ and $\\sigma_i$ params. It doesn’t help that there’s no model code listing in the Appendix or accompanying code archive in the submission.  \n\nThe paper positions DIFT against Transformer-based models, conceptually and empirically. But there is no objective comparison of the method with self-attention Transformer architecture that would highlight their similarities and differences. Ideally, the two architectures could be described side-by-side by their respective sets of equations, using compatible notation.\n\n\nThe exposition of the novel embeddings formation method and its distinctions from other methods is also rudimentary. In particular, lines 160-167 don’t offer a rigorous description of how word boundaries are formed from byte sequences and what are the differences from established methods like BPE or WordPiece. Moreover, the distinctions and advantages of the method in relation to other tokenization-free models, such as recent ByteLatentTransformer [6] and H-Net [7], are not clearly stated.\n\nEquation 1 doesn’t explain why the embedding method is called “hierarchical aggregation” – it just calculates mean over representations of individual bytes in a word. \nExperimentation.\n\nMany hyper-parameters are not specified. Specifically, sequence length, learning rate schedule, optimizer and its parameters, numerical precision, software frameworks used (e.g., PyTorch or JAX, HuggingFace, Lightning, DeepSpeed, etc.) and optimizations (custom CUDA or Triton kernels, CUDA Graphs, compilation, etc.). The lack of hyper-params reporting, especially sequence length or total number of tokens for pre-training, might cast doubts about the fairness of comparisons in Table 3, because the other models were pre-trained on about 100B tokens each.\n\n**Experimentation**\n\n\nDIFT combines two distinct architectural innovations – initial embedding creation and sequence-mixing mechanism. However, it is not clear to what extent each of them contributes individually to performance and efficiency of the model. Ablations where only embeddings and only self-attention are replaced in Transformer model by novel modules would help determine their individual effectiveness.\n\nThe scope of empirical validation is limited and could be expanded. Currently, the main result is pre-training of an encoder BERT-like model and its fine-tuning on GLUE. However, GLUE benchmark tests performance on short sequences only ($\\leq 256$ with majority of samples having length $\\leq 128$, [8]). Since DIFT has natural locality bias (line 235), it remains unclear whether the performance translates to longer sequences. At least results on perplexity on longer contexts could be provided and compared to other models.\n\nI'd recommend to validate the model on some of these additional modalities: autoregressive language modeling, image classification, speech recognition, long-range dependencies modeling and synthetic benchmarks. The appeal of byte-level tokenizer-free models lies in their ability to process heterogenous data (e.g., images and text simultaneously), but now all but text remains unexplored. \n\nGood examples of comprehensive experimentations with a limited compute budget are presented in papers [9-10], and FNet which is cited in the paper.\n\n**The claims about self-attention’s lack of theoretical foundation and interpretability are unfounded.**\n\nThe recurring claim throughout the paper is that different self-attention mechanisms are “opaque”, uninterpretable, and not theory-grounded. I beg to differ in the matters of standard attention’s interpretability and groundedness. \n\nThere is a vast literature on the interpretability of self-attention. I would recommend to review that literature before making such claims. A good starting point is papers [1-2], and you can proceed with subsequent papers which cite [1-2].\n\nI’d like to add that attention, either softmax or linear one, has a very simple interpretation – for any token (or “word” in the terminology of this work), attention scores show how much each other token in the sequence should influence the next-layer representation of that token. In other words, attention scores show *importances* of tokens, given the similarity of their representations in a high-dimensional space (dot product of **q** and **k**).\n\nRegarding theoretical foundation, one could argue that attention draws from psychology or the science of how the human brain works – see [4, 5] for example. \n\n“Unlike self-attention’s learned attention patterns, our field interactions are explicitly spatial and interpretable through field visualization,” (lines 201-202) – there’s no visualizations or any other corroboration of this claim present in the paper. On the contrary, attention mechanisms are easily visualised as heat maps (see, e.g. Figure 1 in [2]) or as graphs [3].\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Clark, Kevin et al. “What Does BERT Look at?

Need to ablate the two new components of DIFT. What happens when you apply DIFT's interaction field over BPE tokens? What happens when you do regular self-attention over DIFT's word embeddings? In other words, was it the choice of encoding and/or the interaction field replacement for attention that led to improved results?\n\n3. Even putting aside the question of whether UTF-8 is a tokenizer, the architecture still uses a deterministic tokenization method, namely an off-the-shelf word segmentation tool to group bytes into words.\n\n4. In the Table 1 comparison of architectures, I don't think any of the columns other than **Complexity** makes sense. **Universal** seems to just mean byte-level, but the architecture and choice of encoding are separate; any architecture *could* be applied over bytes. Then, the **Interpretable**, **Theory-Grounded**, and **Practical** columns seem completely subjective, not binary, and not justified well in the running text. I have the same issue with Table 2. How come self-attention is \"opaque\", but the interaction field is \"visualizable\"? Attention can be visualized, too. The comparisons being made basically seem made up.\n\n5. On L. 220 in the description of the architecture, it's written that verbs typically learn wide influence fields while determiners learn narrow fields based on the magnitude of $\\sigma_i$.
