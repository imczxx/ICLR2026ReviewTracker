These methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the Direction-based Bargaining Solution ($\\texttt{DiBS}$), yields Pareto stationary solutions immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of $\\texttt{DiBS}$ in nonconvex MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under standard assumptions, a subsequence of $\\texttt{DiBS}$ iterates converges to a Pareto stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose $\\texttt{DiBS-MTL}$, a computationally efficient adaptation of $\\texttt{DiBS}$ to the MTL setting. Finally, we validate $\\texttt{DiBS-MTL}$ empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior bargaining-inspired MTL methods.", "tldr": "We propose a multitask learning algorithm invariant to monotonic nonaffine transformations inspired from cooperative bargaining theory.", "keywords": ["Multitask Learning", "Cooperative Game Theory", "Centralized Bargaining Theory"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/75265871c09fce74b922d0b6a8104ca2659ee6d9.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b115d3db4a2a7f51f0d16135ee12526527ffe5c4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces DiBS-MTL, a new multitask learning (MTL) method based on the Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS).

However, I have three main issues:\n1. Approximation vs. theoretical derivation: The proposed single-step DiBS-MTL approximation appears too strong and far from the exact theoretical derivation of DiBS. It is unclear whether this approximation maintains the proven convergence properties. The paper provides no theoretical justification or formal link between the full Multi-step DiBS-MTL and its approximation, beyond an empirical comparison on a low-dimensional synthetic example. This illustrative example does not reflect realistic MTL behavior. As a result, it remains uncertain how the theoretical motivation and convergence guarantees carry over to the practical version actually used in experiments. Is it possible to provide a comparison on a larger-scale benchmark (even with a small number of DiBS steps)?\n1. Motivation for invariance to monotone transformations: The motivation for focusing on invariance to monotone non-affine transformations is interesting and well-articulated, but it should be better supported with real-world evidence. Currently, the usefulness of this property is demonstrated only on synthetic and engineered examples (modified MT10), rather than on natural or widely used benchmarks where such transformations occur in practice.\n1. Empirical evaluation is too limited and weak: At its current state, the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of DiBS-MTL is insufficient.\n    - The paper reports results on only two datasets (NYU-v2 and MT10). I suggest adding additional common MTL benchmarks, such as QM9, Cityscapes, or CelebA, to strengthen the empirical scope.\n    - The baseline coverage is limited. For NYU-v2, only NashMTL (2022) and FAMO (2023) are recent, strong baselines; others are relatively older and less strong. The authors should include more modern MTL approaches such as FairGrad, CAGrad, IMGrad, or DB-MTL. The MT10 evaluation is even more limited, with only a single recent strong baseline (which also achieves better performance compared to the proposed approach).\n    - Finally, the reported results show that DiBS-MTL performs comparably to existing methods but does not significantly improve over them on any benchmark. Combined with the limited experimental coverage and limited baselines, this makes the empirical evidence inconclusive regarding the claimed advantages and effectiveness of the approach."}, "questions": {"value": "- Could you provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of DiBS-MTL, especially its scaling with the number of tasks?

The main novel contribution of this paper, if I understand correctly, is the adaptation of DiBS to general MTL settings, namely DiBS-MTL.\n  - If I understand correctly, the shared update direction is found by summation over the normalized gradients. However, while it is invariant to scaling, it loses information about the magnitude, which can be important at different stages of the learning procedure. Furthermore, it is a special case of Nash-MTL in which one assumes that all the gradients are orthogonal to each other. Perhaps I am missing something here, and I will be happy if the authors can clarify that point.\n  - Related to the previous bullet, suppose we have two tasks with collinear gradients in opposite directions. The shared update direction will probably not be useful for any of them and may cause slow convergence. Taking inspiration from [1] where uncertainty was used, how does the authors suggest to handle that?\n* The experimental comparisons and grounding in the MTL literature are severely lacking:\n  - Missing references and *comparisons* to recent MTL studies, non-exhaustive list [1-4]. These papers should be addressed and compared to where appropriate. \n  - The method was also not compared to recent and leading methods on common MTL benchmarks, such as CityScapes, QM9, and UTKFace.\n  - Missing a proper comparison (on a non-syntactic benchmark) between Multi-step DiBS-MTL and DiBS-MTL to evaluate the strengths and limitations of each approach.\n  - The dynamics of the loss weights across training are not clear. A proper analysis (even an empirical one) is missing.\n  - Implementation details are missing. What are the hyperparameters of the method besides $\\epsilon$? How sensitive is the method to these hyperparameters? Is there a special schedule for the learning rate?\n* In my opinion, an algorithm of the method is missing to help better understand the update rule.\n\n[1] [1] Achituve, I., Diamant, I., Netzer, A., Chechik, G., & Fetaya, E.
