Novelty of Theorem 4.1 can still be debated.

Motivation benefits from more discussion. In much of the classical literature on the broader causal discovery problem, the structure within them is not discussed, as the latent confounder are often treated as root nodes affecting the observables. The work is indeed interesting in a theoretical sense, yet, I'd like to question the motivation for latent structure discover: Since these variables are not observed, it is hard to imagine interventions on them, so why is it of interest to practitioners to identify the structure of the latent variables?\n\n3. Assumptions and their implications. The identifiability results depend on assumptions about the Hawkes process and the structure of latent confounder. In which practical scenarios are these assumptions justifiable? On the other hand, in misspecified cases, how poorly is the latent structure discovered?

They further prove that the low-rank constraints on the cross-covariance matrices induced by the linear representation can be used to (1) detect the presence of latent confounder subprocesses, and (2) identify parent–cause sets and causal edges under explicit path-based conditions (Definitions 4.4, Propositions 4.3/4.5, Theorems 4.7/4.8).\n\nBased on this theoretical foundation, the paper proposes a novel two-phase iterative algorithm where Phase I identifies causal relationships among the currently known (observed and inferred) subprocesses and Phase I discovers new latent confounders via rank tests.

However, no guidance is provided on how to choose (\\Delta) in practice to ensure consistent results.\n\nThe identifiability results further rely on an additional assumption that the excitation functions take the form (a_{i,j}w(s)), for example, the exponential decay function a_{i,j}\\exp(-\\beta s). While this is a common assumption in the MHP literature, it is often extended to cases where the decay rate \\beta is also an unknown, node-specific parameter, i.e., (a_{i,j}\\exp(-\\beta_i s)).

As discussed above, its performance is also sensitive to the choice of \\Delta. Furthermore, the method relies on rank tests, which typically require large amounts of observational data.
