Classical influence functions break down for deep neural networks because their loss landscapes are highly singular and BIF addresses this by replacing Hessian based inverses with covariance estimates computed over a localized Bayesian posterior using stochastic gradient MCMC sampling. This approach defines influence as the negative covariance between a sample’s loss and an observable, capturing higher-order geometric effects in the loss landscape that classical IF miss.
