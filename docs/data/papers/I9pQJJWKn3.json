We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework that combines the granular control of a physics-based simulator with the photorealistic content output of large-scale, pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports the off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training.

The core contribution is limited to the condition design of LWA itself, which serves mainly as a formal interface. \n\n**Restricted validation domain.**\nAll main experiments center on autonomous-driving imagery and cross-domain demonstrations (robotics, indoor scenes) are qualitative only. The generalization claim of *universal hybrid world creation* lacks quantitative support.\n\n**Evaluation focus on visual fidelity and controllability.**\nExperiments show image quality and controllability metrics, but no metrics for physical consistency, temporal stability, or task-level realism are provided.
