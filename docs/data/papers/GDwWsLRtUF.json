When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding, detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74% absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable environments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["LLM planning", "Information Seeking", "POMDP", "uncertain dynamics"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3bc78ea540377fec28d093479c39ecbe19a8eb09.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/1d3c324e6d8ea0ca9891ff86be7da2d047d17dc4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Existing large language model (LLM)-based planners for agents in partially observable environments have limitations.

Perhaps, “effective” might be a better word for it, since “optimal” is a little strong given that in some experiments, the paper’s approach underperforms existing baselines. Claiming optimality might also call for establishing formal guarantees that no other approach outperforms the paper’s approach.

The claimed formal connection to POMDPs remains interpretive. There is no explicit specification of the belief representation, the backup operator the prompts approximate, or a principled value‑of‑information objective that the information‑seeking step maximizes.\n\n2.

For example, the text refers to internal dynamics, it is unclear what gets updated (offsets? action‑effect map? parameters), where it is stored (text memory? structured map?), and how it is consumed during planning. \n\n3. There is no clear trigger for when to seek information, no seek budget, and no rule for choosing diagnostic actions. It is very underspecified. \n\n4. 4.1 Talks about 5 tasks, and yet only 4 are explained (I suppose the last one is split into 2, but it does not make it a new task).

There is an inconsistent mixing of steps, attempts, and wall‑clock time across sections without normalization, weakening sample‑efficiency claims.\n\n6.

But, token/LLM‑call budgets and env‑step budgets are not jointly reported.\n\n7. Similarly, isn't a \"one‑minute\" cap API‑latency‑ and hardware‑dependent? It is not a stable cross‑paper comparator.\n\n8. It is unclear whether baselines had identical total interaction budgets (seek+plan vs plan‑only), identical temperature/top‑p, timeouts, and truncation policies.\n\n9.
