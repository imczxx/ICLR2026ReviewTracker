Open-world planning involves not only sequencing actions but also determining what information the agent needs to sense to enable those actions. Existing approaches using Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision-Language Models (VLM) cannot reliably plan over long horizons and complex goals, where they often hallucinate and fail to reason causally over agent-environment interactions. Alternatively, classical PDDL planners offer correct and principled reasoning, but fail in open-world settings: they presuppose complete models and depend on exhaustive grounding over all objects, states, and actions; they cannot address misalignment between goal specifications (e.g., “heat the bread”) and action specifications (e.g., “toast the bread”); and they do not generalize across modalities (e.g., text, vision). To address these core challenges: (i) we extend symbolic PDDL into a flexible natural language representation that we term NL-PDDL, improving accessibility for non-expert users as well as generalization over modalities; (ii) we generalize regression-style planning to NL-PDDL with commonsense entailment reasoning to determine what needs to be observed for goal achievement in partially-observed environments with potential goal–action specification misalignment; and (iii) we leverage the lifted specification of NL-PDDL to facilitate open-world planning that avoids exhaustive grounding and yields a time and space complexity independent of the number of ground objects, states, and actions. Our experiments in three diverse domains — classical Blocksworld and the embodied ALFWorld environment with both textual and visual states — show that NL-PDDL substantially outperforms existing baselines, is more robust to longer horizons and more complex goals, and generalizes across modalities.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Open-world Planning", "Lifted Regression", "Embodied Agents"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/60b2927bc3b886966a9d2e6af8b226cd9995f723.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6d90b04a3e65020764ed8ba4500c24cc71513334.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "To address the open-world embodied AI tasks with partial observability and incomplete knowledge, this paper proposes NL-PDDL, which combines the strictness of symbolic planning with the semantic flexibility of LLMs. NL-PDDL first extends PDDL into a natural language form for representation, enabling LLM-based commonsense entailment reasoning, and finally employs lifted regression planning.

LLM-Regress [1] already proposed combining lifted regression with LLM for open-world planning. What advantages does NL-PDDL offer over this approach? From both the methodology and experimental results, NL-PDDL's advantages are not prominent. LLM-Regress achieves higher success rates and lower token consumption on ALFWorld.\n\n2. Scalability and applicability limitations. NL-PDDL is not a general, scalable approach for open-world planning, as PDDL cannot fully model all problems in open-world settings. In addition, with increasing problem complexity, a sharp performance degradation of NL-PDDL (Figure 7) is observed. This instability may limit the method's practical applicability.\n\n3. Inability to learn. NL-PDDL lacks learning capability, relying entirely on predefined domain specifications and LLM commonsense without the ability to improve from experience or adapt to new domains automatically.\n\n[1] Liu X, Pesaranghader A, Li H, et al.

Given that NL-PDDL relies on natural language representations, could semantic ambiguity or variability in NL descriptions cause the LLM-based entailment reasoning to produce incorrect unifications?
