However, its distributed nature makes it highly susceptible to faulty or Byzantine behaviors. Existing Byzantine-resilient approaches are either restricted to simple single-level optimization problems or rely on sub-loop updates that introduce significant computational and communication overhead. To address these limitations, we propose a family of Byzantine-resilient federated bilevel algorithms, which (i) operate within a single-loop structure, (ii) achieve optimal Byzantine resilience, and (iii) ensure computational and communication efficiency. The core of the proposed method, BR-FedBi, leverages an auxiliary variable that facilitates efficient hypergradient estimation while simultaneously solving the lower- and upper-level problems. Building on BR-FedBi, we further integrate the algorithm with Polyak’s momentum and the probabilistic gradient estimator (PAGE) (Li et al., 2021), resulting in provable optimal Byzantine resilience and optimal sample complexity. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms.

The related works section lacks coverage of distributed stochastic bilevel optimization, particularly decentralized bilevel optimization, which has gained an increasing focus recently. Therefore, the author should include a review of relevant works on decentralized bilevel optimization in this section.\n3. Near‑critical $\\delta$ behavior & aggregator choice. Theory constrains $\\kappa$ vs. $\\delta$, but the paper lacks a systematic study when $\\delta$ approaches the breakdown. Provide $\\delta$ sweeps and compare $\\kappa$ across aggregators to probe the near‑bound regime.\n4. Assumption strength & measurability. Mean‑square smoothness and $(\\zeta,B)$‑heterogeneity are standard but not easily measurable in practice. Offer empirical estimates (from client gradient statistics) for $\\zeta_f,\\zeta_g,B_f,B_g$ to connect constants to practice.\n5. Baseline tuning fairness.
