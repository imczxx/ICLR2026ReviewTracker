Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation.  The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810× larger.  Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.", "tldr": "Lightweight uncertainty heads for step-level verification of LLM reasoning", "keywords": ["LLM", "Large Language Model", "Uncertainty Quantification", "Process Reward Models"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3156c61505c4b86e6dd84b4536586ac5ff4d3022.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/45cfd7cdd7b683da1f735c395859e721941da25a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the challenge of verifying intermediate reasoning step correctness in LLMs’ multi-step reasoning and proposes a lightweight Uncertainty Quantification Head (UHead) to replace computationally expensive Process Reward Models (PRMs)."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The proposed method is compared with comprehensive baselines.\n- Process reward is important for the development of Large reasoning models."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.

And UHead is also an existing work.\n2. The authors' definition of uncertainty lacks rigor. Generally speaking, a metric trained directly from accuracy should not be regarded as a measure of uncertainty. For example, when a model produces a particular wrong answer very frequently during random sampling, its uncertainty about this that answer should be very low.

The background section brings a section about UQ but does not follow up on it when describing the method in Section 3. The core technique in the paper is the UHead, but this is not formally described in the paper, making it not self-contained. There are no details on how uncertainty is estimated or how/whether the terms in the equation of Section 2.3 are computed, nor what is the nature of the uncertainty estimated (e.g., predictive, epistemic).\n\n- From the description provided in Section 3, the UHead seems to be a classification network on top of a base LLM hidden state, and the uncertainty here relates to the softmax entropy among Yes/No classes. If this understanding is correct, then there are a few points to consider:\n    - It would be important to compare against the predictive entropy from the LLM itself, i.e., consider the (re-normalized) Yes/No distribution conditioned on the reasoning step and compute its entropy as score; this baseline will validate if the classification training is indeed needed.\n    - The claims about “comparing” against models that are 150x, 810x times larger sounds misleading since the method still requires inference over a base LLM to extract features, so all the parameters of the base LLM are also activated in the process of generating verification. This should be counted as well if the goal is to compare model sizes.\n    - There are also strong claims about the UHeads being general, plug and play, and that they “generalize across tasks, languages and domains”. These claims are unclear and unjustified. From the paper description, these are classification models trained on top of self-supervision or even DeepSeek-R1 labels, so we need proper evidence to support these claims, otherwise I would expect them to behave similarly to other Adapter models in the literature.\n\n- The Related Work section is very superficial. It provides a little of contextualization and does not contrast with other similar works. There is also recent work in uncertainty-aware step-wise verification missed, e.g., [1, 2].\n\n- The paper does not report confidence intervals to assess statistical significance in the results. In fact, the paper does not mention how many experimental seeds were used (I assume it is a single one). Prior literature has raised how sensitive math reasoning benchmarking is for small changes [3], requiring a more statistical grounding to evaluate whether the reported takeaways are meaningful or just observation noise.\n    - As an illustrative example, Figure 3 (left) is used as evidence to claim scaling improvements for the proposed method. The reported gap in performance is less than 1% of accuracy (over Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-7B), which diminishes as N increases. There is no way to assess statistical significance here, yet the paper claims the “consistently better results”. The same lack of statistical rigor extends to all reported experiments, which makes it hard to evaluate scientific claims.\n\nOverall, I believe the paper requires a good rewriting in the methodological section to improve clarity on the proposed method. Some of the claims (as described above) needs to be calibrated, and the experiments should report performance across different seeds with proper confidence intervals. The related work section may also be polished to better contextualize with the literature and contrast with similar methods.\n\n\nReferences: \n\n[1] Cao et. al.
