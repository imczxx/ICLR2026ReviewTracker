Existing interpretable models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.

Specifically, the intended effect of the entropy regularization on promoting a few dominant prototypes is not immediately apparent.\n3.\t**Validation of Interpretability**: The assessment of interpretability relies on a questionnaire administered to 12 users. While this provides initial evidence, the small sample size and the potential for subjective responses may limit the generalizability of these findings."}, "questions": {"value": "**Main concern:** \n\n1. **Variable Interactions**: The paper states that the prototype-instance similarity is computed by \"incorporating a multi-channel embedding and bottleneck fusion mechanism\" to model interactions between input variables. However, the embedding described in Equation (2) appears to be a summation of individual variable embeddings prior to the bottleneck layer. Could the authors elaborate on how this specific architecture facilitates the modeling of interactions between variables?\n\n2. **Entropy Regularization**: In line 300, the stated goal of the entropy term in the loss function is to \"encourage a few main prototypes to cover most predictions.\" Given that negative Shannon entropy is minimized by a discrete uniform distribution, could the authors provide further intuition on how this term achieves the stated objective of encouraging a sparse set of dominant prototypes? Additionally, the inclusion of a tuning parameter (e.g., $\\lambda$) to balance the L1-norm and the regularization term seems warranted and would be a valuable addition.\n\n3. **Scope of Regularization**: The current regularization term appears to only consider the first level of the hierarchical structure. Have the authors considered extending this to other levels of the hierarchy, and what might be the potential impact of such a change?\n\n4. **Choice of L1-Norm**: Could the authors provide the rationale for selecting the L1-norm for the loss function over other metrics such as the L2-norm or domain-specific measures like Dynamic Time Warping?\n\n5. **Prototype Splitting Criteria**: The experiments include a sensitivity analysis on the number of prototypes. However, a more detailed discussion on the rules for splitting prototypes would be beneficial. Have the authors considered implementing a formal rule, such as a threshold-based criterion (e.g., $ f(Z|\\mu)>\\alpha $  or a metric like the Gini index, to guide the splitting process and maintain a robust balance between predictive accuracy and interpretability?\n6. **Simulation for Interpretability**: To further strengthen the claims regarding interpretability, have the authors considered conducting a simulation study? A simulation with a known ground truth for the underlying prototypes and hierarchical structure could provide a more objective evaluation of the model's ability to recover these causal relationships.\n\n**Minor concerns:** \n\n1.\tLine 29: The phrase \"their overall interpretability and their potential\" could be revised for clarity, as the second \"their\" is redundant.\n\n2.\tLine 76: \"input covariates\" is repetitive.

The mechanism by which a new time series sample is assigned to or reconstructed from prototypes is ambiguous.\n\n- The description also leaves uncertainty about whether there is a prototype per sample or whether prototypes are shared across samples in a latent cluster space.\n\n- Since the interactions occur in the latent space, it is unclear how one can meaningfully interpret what each prototype represents in the original time domain. A mapping or visualization process should be clarified.\n\n---\n\n### **Experiments**\n\n- The experimental scope is narrow. All evaluations are performed on a limited set of datasets; broader diversity in data domains (e.g., finance, energy, healthcare) and different lookback windows would make the results more generalizable.\n\n- There is almost no comparison with other ante-hoc or post-hoc XAI models. The paper mainly compares against interpretable models, but not against modern post-hoc explanation techniques that could provide competitive interpretability, while also achieving superior performance.\n\n- The paper should explicitly discuss the trade-off between interpretability and performance, perhaps through a 2D evaluation showing both forecast error and explanation quality.\n\n- It is unclear why models like TimeXer and ITrans are excluded from qualitative comparisons in Table 4.
