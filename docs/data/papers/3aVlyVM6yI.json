However, for deep research tasks that require the integration of massive information, existing agent frameworks not only generate substantial noise during search and context management, which affects the output of the final answer, but also suffer from the inherent limitations of relying solely on web browsing for information acquisition. To address the noise generated during the search process, we design a new web search filtering module that can isolate irrelevant webpages at an early stage. To mitigate the contextual noise that impacts the final answer, we introduce an isolation-based stepwise verification module, which reduces LLM contextual bias and ensures more neutral and reliable outputs. Moreover, to expand information acquisition and address the challenge of insufficient reasoning, we introduce a new agent that enables scalable information acquisition through APIs and programmatic automation, while also supporting efficient deep reasoning. Experimental results show that on the GAIA and WebWalkerQA benchmarks, IAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source deep research agents. Furthermore, IAgent reduces token cost by 38\\% compared to our baseline.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models; Deep Research; Isolation; Agent Systems"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/95267024552a2e537111557e24b2637b46d69537.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/1ec6c62ebc97ed12906752b8dd5d38e1a2ca68dc.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce IAgent, a novel multi-agent framework designed to address two critical challenges in existing systems: noise interference and monolithic information acquisition.

The primary analysis is Figure 6 and Figure 7, which show the agent usage / token breakdown of the main experiments, but it is unclear how to interpret the usefulness of each component separately.\n3. Many of the baselines in Table 1 do not seem fair – the choice of model is not consistent across each agent scaffold, making it difficult to compare. The authors also argue that “carefully selecting model combinations is crucial”, but the baselines were not tuned fairly with this in mind.\n4. There is little qualitative or quantitative analysis on where IAgent improves over existing, more task-specific scaffolds. smolagents is designed to be a general agentic scaffold, so the fact that IAgent can improve upon it is not very surprising.\n5.

Why were smolagents results on WebWalkerQA not included? The paper states “As smolagents provide results solely on GAIA, we restrict evaluation of this configuration to the same benchmark”, but since the analysis centers on IAgent vs. smolagent, why not run smolagents on this benchmark?\n3.

The authors should consider benchmarking on BrowseComp, which has been considered much more harder benchmark for deep research.\n3.
