However, incorporating long-range interactions beyond the nodes' immediate neighborhood in a $\\textit{scalable}$ manner remains an open challenge for graph machine learning models. Existing benchmarks for evaluating long-range capabilities either cannot $\\textit{guarantee}$ that their tasks actually depend on long-range information or are rather limited.\nTherefore, claims of long-range modeling improvements based on said performance remain questionable.\nWe introduce the Long-Range Ising Model Graph Benchmark, a physics-based benchmark utilizing the well-studied Ising model whose ground truth $\\textit{provably}$ depends on long-range dependencies. Our benchmark consists of ten datasets that scale from 256 to 65k nodes per graph, and provide controllable long-range dependencies through tunable parameters, allowing precise control over the hardness and ``long-rangedness\". We provide model-agnostic evidence that local information is insufficient, further validating the design choices of our benchmark. Via experiments on classical message-passing architectures and graph transformers, we show that both perform far from the optimum, especially those with scalable complexity. Our goal is that our benchmark will foster the development of scalable methodologies that effectively model long-range interactions in graphs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph Learning", "Long-Range", "Benchmark"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1f0cca0b57d2df1c739429a5b4b8370d66ef02bf.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper constructs a graph regression dataset based on the well-known ising model as a dataset for long-range dependencies.\nThey show that indeed long-range interactions are needed in order to solve the problem and that deeper networks tend to work a lot better than shallow ones.

Apart from that, the paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n- The graphs are extremely simple (just lattices, even simpler than the road networks from Liang et al). Thus the task is really an oversimplified edge case for graph learning.\n- There is not that much interaction going on, especially since on a regular lattice all $J_{ij}$ are the same. \n- I did not get convinced that the construction really tests interaction and not just global aggregation (see questions).\n- The provided lower bound states that there exists a solution thats \"very different\", but says nothing about the distribution of such solutions. In particular I believe its possible to \"cheat\" using global statistics.\n\nConcrete (small) things:\n- since LRIM uses lattice graphs, positional embeddings should make looking at the edges irrelevant. (e.g. using a PE that is made for images and is able to encode an x and y position)\n- The task is really about very exact computations which tends to be not the strongest suite of machine learning models. And at some point floating-point precision will start becoming problematic (probably way before -20 where the trivial accuracy boundary is). \n- in the experiments it looked to me that a lot larger MPGNNs would have been possible without exceeding the computational demands of the tested graph transformers. Is there a reason why only \"small\" models have been tested? How does a 50M GatedGCN model perform?\n- 422: Maybe I was misreading the plot, but the numbers of oracle and learned method are not far apart for up to 12 layers (Fig 4).
