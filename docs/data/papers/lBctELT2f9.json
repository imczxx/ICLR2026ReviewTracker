However, current SAEs suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features, reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.", "tldr": "We introduce Orthogonal Sparse Autoencoders (OrtSAE), a novel approach to train SAEs that enforces orthogonality between learned features, reducing feature absorption and composition while enhancing performance on downstream tasks.", "keywords": ["sparse autoencoder", "mechanistic interpretability", "language model", "representation learning", "feature disentanglement", "regularization"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2cadab0f50e8460b8a268c8cb14b994623a818bd.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3c74ea3a09073058067d3bc6df3284fb7109742a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a regularizer for sparse autoencoders.

I'm not sure how similar any of these works actually are, but I think the submission should include references to this and any other such works in any case, eg to reassure the reader if they are in fact quite different if that is in fact the case.  If they are substantively similar, I don't think it's a major problem for this work, it just needs to be noted.\n\n(moderate): I feel like Figure 5 (and Appendix I) are missing similar decomposition results for other methods, unless I misunderstand, there is no side-to-side comparison included at the moment.\n\n(moderate): The technique seems like a blunt tool.  I'm not sure how competitive such an approach will prove to be compared to alternatives that tackle the problems more head-on.  The paper doesn't explain how encouraging orthogonality is expected to change what the SAE ends up learning in any detail; a more thorough analysis would be welcome.  The submissions states: \"Feature absorption and composition lead to redundant representations where multiple latents capture overlapping concepts, which results in high cosine similarities between them. This suggests that enforcing orthogonality between SAE latents could provide a principled approach to mitigate these issues.\"  The first sentence of this quotation is unsupported, and the second sentence doesn't sound very principled -- the way it's described, this method is treating a symptom of the problem, rather than the problem itself.  I believe the submission could strengthen the motivation here.\n\n(minor): The statement ‘Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have gained significant traction for interpreting LLMs, addressing the challenge that LLMs often function as “black boxes”’ is vague and is suggestive of a higher level of effectiveness in addressing the “black box” issue that I think is warranted.\n\n(minor): I didn't find the descriptions of feature absorption very clear, and had to look at the referenced paper to understand this concept.  Relatedly, Section 3.2 felt repetitive with previous content.

Reconstruction versus sparsity does not garantee the right concept basis. The paper still optimizes explained variance plus sparsity and adds orthogonality, but none of these objectives ensure recovery of the correct semantic axes. I think SAEBench go in the right direction here, but I would also like to see simple synthetic data with planted factors, to test subspace recovery and concept identifiability.\n\nM2. Phenomenology of orthogonality is under motivated. Section 3 argues that absorption and composition correlate with high decoder cosine and therefore orthogonality should help, which is plausible, but there is a broader literature on representation geometry that could predict when orthogonality should or should not help. A short review and positioning would help justify the method theoretically, and it would also guide where to apply it in depth. \n\nM3. Global orthogonality versus conditional orthogonality at inference. The current loss pushes all decoder atoms apart. For downstream use, what we actually need is low mutual coherence among the subset of atoms that activate together on a given input. Please consider a conditional version that penalizes the Gram matrix of only the active atoms per batch, or an evaluation that measures conditional mutual coherence at inference. This could preserve reconstruction while targeting the failure mode more precisely.\n\nM4. To continue on this, you should use the Babel score [1]. Since the paper cares about sets of correlated atoms, Babel and cumulative coherence are natural complements to mean nearest neighbor cosine. Please report Babel on the whole dictionary and on active subsets during inference, and compare to BatchTopK and Matryoshka at matched sparsity. This will also clarify whether orthognality is achieved where it matters most.\n\n[1] Greed is good: algorithmic results for sparse approximation. Tropp & al\n\nM5. Missing baseline on MP-SAE. Matching pursuit and orthogonal matching pursuit induce a conditional orthogonality effect at selection time, which is directly relevant to absorption and composition. As such, MP-SAE [2] is extremely relevant here. Without it the geometric contribution is hard to isolate.\n\n[2] From Flat to Hierarchical : Extracting Sparse Representations with Matching Pursuit. Costa & al.\n\nM6. Connection to Grassmannian frames and linear representation hypotheses. If the intended target is a dictionary that minimizes mutual coherence for a given size, this is close to Grassmannian frames [3] or even equiangular tight frame objectives [4]. The paper could formalize this perspective, relate the proposed loss to a relaxation of Grassmannian frame construction, and test whether learned dictionaries move toward frame like spectra. A useful justification would be: if the linear representation hypothesis holds at the chosen layer, then an approximately Grassmannian decoder is preferred, hence the proposed loss is a practical surrogate. Empirically, the singular value spread of W_dec and the off diagonal structure of the Gram matrix could be tracked across training.\n\n[3] On the structures of Grassmannian frames, Haas & al.\n\n[4] On the existence of equiangular tight frames, Sustik & al\n\nM7. Explain why reduced cosine should yield better concepts rather than just different ones. Figure 3c shows much lower nearest neighbor cosine and Figure 4 shows better atomicity metrics, but a causal story is missing. Please add targeted interventions where you hold reconstruction constant and vary the orthogonality weight. This feel circular.\n\nM8. Scope of downstream improvements is modest. SAEBench shows a clear gain on spurious correlation removal but other tasks are similar to baselines or favor Matryoshka. I would not expect large universal gains from pure geometry, but the paper could better delineate which tasks benefit and why, possibly linking to the conditional orthogonality hypothesis above. See Figure 6.\n\nNow for the minor points:\n\nm1. Consider reporting conditional Gram statistics. For each batch, compute the Gram of active atoms and report the distribution of off diagonal entries. This directly measures the property the method aims to improve.\n\nm2. Clarify the chunk size choice. Section 3.3 sets K as ceiling of m over 8192. A short sensitivity table on chunk size versus reconstruction and atomicity could help but I agree would be bonus.\n\nm3. Add a short note on the slight explained variance drop. Figure 3a shows OrtSAE is a little below BatchTopK. A one paragraph discussion of when that trade is acceptable for users focused on interpretability would be helpful."}, "questions": {"value": "Cf Major point 1-8 and minor points 1-3."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "eMKi53GUZh", "forum": "lBctELT2f9", "replyto": "lBctELT2f9", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18226/Reviewer_9DwE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18226/Reviewer_9DwE"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18226/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762023339955, "cdate": 1762023339955, "tmdate": 1762927964638, "mdate": 1762927964638, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
