Imposing minimal physical principles (locality, permutation equivariance, orientation covariance, and energy balance/dissipation inequality), we prove a reduction theorem for mesh-based physics. Under these conditions, the physical dynamics admit a local factorization into a port–Hamiltonian form: the conservative interconnection is fixed uniquely by mesh topology, whereas metric effects enter only through constitutive relations and dissipation. This reduction clarifies what must be fixed and what should be learned, directly informing MeshFT-Net’s design.\nAcross evaluations on analytic and realistic datasets, physics-consistency tests, and out-of-distribution validation, MeshFT-Net achieves near-zero energy drift and strong physical fidelity—correct dispersion and momentum conservation—along with robust extrapolation and high data efficiency. By eliminating non-physical degrees of freedom and learning only metric-dependent structure, MeshFT provides a principled inductive bias for stable, faithful, and data-efficient physical simulation.", "tldr": "Mesh Field Theory disentangles mesh-based physics into a fixed topological wiring and learned metric operators, yielding stable long-horizon rollouts, high physical fidelity, strong data efficiency, and robust out-of-distribution performance.", "keywords": ["Mesh Field Theory", "Mesh-Based Physics", "Port–Hamiltonian Dynamics", "Structure-Preserving Simulation"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/085b776cd1fc0d1a99da5cc5eaa23e47b4af4cac.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e8695f4a30d3549a46fefe1578e58acef53f1720.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors present a discrete exterior calculus framework for fitting port-Hamiltonian dynamics to co-chain data on meshes. The work is sound and an important direction for the overall scientific machine learning community. These types of formalisms are important to approach meaningful fields. This paper is acceptable for publication assuming the authors address a few major concerns.\n\nMy primary feedback is that the authors seem to be unaware of an important body of work where others have already pursued a similar strategy. There are distinct contributions in this paper that merit publication, but the authors must properly contextualize their contribution. There are two primary technical components here that others have also considered: (1) separating the (learnable) metric from the topological exterior derivatives and (2) posing dynamics via a dissipative bracket (port-Hamiltonian in their case) to ensure learned dynamics are stable despite the fact that model form is a priori unknown. The bulk of the literature review is out of date and focuses on the early HNN and LagrangianNN work that looked at low dimensional dynamical systems, and there have been some significant contributions since then which I lay out in the weaknesses section.\n\nFrom my perspective, the identification of a class of a trainable port-Hamiltonian systems with topological connections is new. To my knowledge this has been done in other dissipative systems but not a port-Hamiltonian.  The authors stress 4 contributions (locally bounded receptive area, permutation symmetry, universality under orientation, and non-increasing energy). The first 3 are good but not particularly novel as they come \"for free\" working with message passing on graphs. The fourth is a primary contribution.\n\nThe benchmarks are of standard quality for ICLR or related AI focused conferences, but weak from the perspective of a serious numerical PDE community. They work through the acoustic scattering problem on the well, but this is simply the linear wave equation and should not be referred to in the title of 5.4 as \"real physics field data\". It would be much stronger if they attempted a more serious problem with nontrivial physics. At the core of this, there is a very strong assumption in lines 218-221 that J depend only on exterior derivatives independent of state. Very few systems admit J of this form (the wave equation and Maxwell are exceptions, which are coincidentally the cases the authors presented). Therefore it would be much more interesting for the authors to consider one of the significantly more nontrivial physics examples in the well. For example, shear flow could be swapped in with minimal effort and gives a good example of a simple dissipative system.\n\nIn the benchmarks, errors are presented in either one-step MSE or energy drift.

This would also help interpret the timing results reported in Table 9 and assess the model’s scalability.\n\n- **Behavior near discontinuities**: The proof relies on local smoothness.
