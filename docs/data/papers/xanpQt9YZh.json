The proposed TopoScan mechanism is a fresh formulation that replaces persistence diagrams with sequential topological tokens derived from overlapping filtration slices. This approach is conceptually novel because it allows topological information to be represented in a transformer compatible format, overcoming long standing barriers between topological data analysis and deep attention models. The use of interlevel filtrations and the demonstration that they capture multi scale graph structure are creative contributions that extend beyond incremental improvement.\n\nQuality:\nThe paper demonstrates high technical and experimental quality. The theoretical section provides a sound stability guarantee (the ℓ1\\ell_1ℓ1​ stability theorem) that ensures robustness to small perturbations, while the empirical results convincingly show strong and consistent performance across both graph classification and molecular property prediction tasks.

The approach has broad applicability beyond the tested datasets, offering a template for topology aware transformers in other relational domains such as biological networks, material science, and social graphs. By demonstrating that topological structure can be embedded as a sequence and effectively processed through self attention, the paper establishes a promising direction for future research in structure aware representation learning.\nOverall:\nA technically rigorous, clearly written, and conceptually innovative paper. It combines theoretical insight with practical relevance, resulting in a contribution that meaningfully advances the integration of topology and modern deep learning."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited theoretical depth beyond stability\nWhile the inclusion of an ℓ1 stability theorem demonstrates that TopoScan is robust to small perturbations, the theoretical analysis does not go far enough to explain why the proposed representation preserves meaningful topological invariants or how it compares in expressive power to standard persistent homology (PH) based methods. The paper would be stronger with a formal comparison of representational capacity, such as bounding the information loss between TopoScan token sequences and PH barcodes, or connecting the proposed construction to existing frameworks like Graph Filtration Learning (Hofer et al., NeurIPS 2020) or Stable Rank Vectors (Chazal et al., 2021). A clearer theoretical bridge between TopoScan and persistent homology would make the contribution more foundational rather than heuristic.\n\n2. Dependence on hand crafted filtration functions\nThe approach still relies on predefined filtrations (for example degree, curvature, or heat kernel). The choice of filtration has a notable influence on performance, as shown in the ablation studies, yet no adaptive mechanism is proposed. This limits generality and introduces dataset specific tuning. The authors could strengthen the work by introducing a learnable or task aware filtration module, or at least by exploring gradient based parameterisation of the filtration functions to allow end to end optimisation.\n\n3. Limited interpretability analysis\nAlthough the paper claims that TopoScan tokens are interpretable and capture multi scale structures, there is no concrete analysis showing what the model learns. For instance, visualising the transformer’s attention weights mapped back to graph substructures (for example motifs, cycles, or communities) would provide stronger evidence that the model captures meaningful topology. A few case studies or qualitative visualisations would greatly improve interpretability and help validate the topological claims.\n\n4. Incomplete generalisation evaluation\nThe experiments focus primarily on molecule and social graph benchmarks, which are standard but relatively homogeneous. Testing on non molecular heterogeneous graphs (for example citation networks or dynamic temporal graphs) would help confirm that the method generalises to other graph structures. Since TopoScan claims to be a general topological sequence generator, demonstrating this versatility would make the paper’s impact broader.\n\n5. Efficiency claims lack concrete quantitative support\nThe paper argues that TopoScan avoids the cubic computational complexity of persistent homology, yet runtime improvements are reported qualitatively rather than quantitatively. Providing explicit runtime tables or scaling plots, such as comparing training and inference times against PH based baselines like PersLay or TopoGCL, would substantiate the scalability advantage and enhance the practical credibility of the method."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Theoretical clarification on representation power\nCould the authors explain in more detail how the TopoScan representation compares in expressiveness to persistent homology? Specifically, does the sequential encoding preserve the same critical topological information that persistence diagrams capture, or does it approximate it? A small empirical or theoretical comparison could help clarify what kind of information may be lost or transformed in the conversion to token sequences.\n\n2. Learnable or adaptive filtrations\nHave the authors considered learning the filtration function directly rather than fixing it a priori? For example, one could parameterise the filtration with trainable weights that adapt during training, similar to Graph Filtration Learning (Hofer et al., 2020). If so, what are the main challenges in integrating such a module with TopoScan, and could it potentially improve generalisation across datasets?\n\n3. Sensitivity to TopoScan parameters\nThe results depend on the number of slices N and the window width 𝑚 used in TopoScan. Could the authors provide a sensitivity analysis or heuristic guideline for selecting these parameters? Understanding whether performance is robust to parameter variation would increase confidence in the stability of the framework.\n\n4. Attention interpretability and visualisation\nCan the authors show examples of which graph substructures the transformer attends to when processing the topological token sequences? For instance, does the attention mechanism focus on regions corresponding to high curvature, cycles, or clusters? Such visual evidence would strengthen the claim that TopoFormer is both interpretable and topology aware.\n\n5. Broader evaluation and generalisability\nWould the authors consider evaluating TopoFormer on non molecular heterogeneous datasets such as citation or temporal graphs? Since TopoScan is proposed as a general representation, results on more diverse graph types could demonstrate broader applicability and robustness.\n\n6. Quantitative runtime and scalability analysis\nThe paper claims that TopoScan avoids the heavy computational cost of persistent homology. Could the authors provide explicit runtime benchmarks comparing TopoFormer with PH based baselines like PersLay or TopoGCL on large datasets? This would substantiate the claim of improved efficiency.\n\n7. Relation to existing topological and transformer models\nHow does TopoFormer conceptually differ from recent hybrid approaches such as TopoGCL (Zhao et al., 2023) or Graphormer (Ying et al., 2021)? A more explicit discussion of what new design principle TopoFormer introduces beyond these works would help clarify its unique contribution to the literature.\n\n8. Empirical validation of the stability theorem\nCan the authors provide an experiment demonstrating the stability property empirically, for example by perturbing the graph structure or filtration and measuring the variation in output embeddings or predictions?

The core contribution (Topo-Scan) is a conceptually simple modification, but the experiments fail to provide statistically significant evidence that this modification offers a meaningful advantage over the standard methods it claims to improve upon.\n\n1.\tThe core idea is trivial and lacks justification: The paper's main technical contribution, Topo-Scan, replaces the standard cumulative sublevel filtration $V_i = \\{v: f(v) < a_{i}\\}$ with a slicing window $V_i = \\{v: a_{i} <f(v) < a_{i+m}\\}$. This is a conceptually simple modification.\n\n2.\tThough the authors justify the contribution of solving early saturation by showing the empirical Betti-0 comparison with increasing thresholds, the trends only differ at the very late stage (the last 10 steps on IMDB-B and only from the ~72nd to 82nd step on IMDB-M). The relation of this phenomenon with the eventual performance on property prediction tasks is unclear. Table 5 is the key experiment meant to provide justification, comparing TOPOFORMER (Topo-Scan + Transformer) directly against \"PH-TR\" (standard PH + Transformer). However, the paper's own data shows no statistically significant improvement.\nFor example, on IMDB-B, where Figure 3 implies that early saturation is addressed by Topo-Scan, the performance with HKS filtration function for PH-TR is (76.8, 3.97) and for TOPOFORMER is (77.9, 5.72). The second's CI almost overlaps with the first one, which gives no evidence to support that Topo-Scan is better than standard PH.\n\n3.\tThe comparison on molecular property prediction is misleading: The results on Table 4 are also based on an unfair comparison. The model used is “TOPOFORMER*”, which is a hybrid model fusing the ECFP fingerprints. However, not all the cited methods used this additional feature. Such comparison exaggerates the advantages. It would be natural to ask whether PH-TR + ECFP gives similar results, but this is not provided either.\n\n4.\tThe paper claims to be \"lightweight\" and \"efficient\".
