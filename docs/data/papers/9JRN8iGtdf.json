However, to perform effectively in uncertain environments using model-based controllers, these systems require dynamics models capable of responding to environmental variations, especially when direct access to environmental information is limited.\nTo enable such adaptivity and facilitate integration with model predictive control, we propose an adaptive dynamics model which bypasses the need for direct environmental knowledge by inferring operational environments from state-action history. The dynamics model is based on neural ordinary equations, and a two-phase training procedure is used to learn latent environment representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks on three robotic platforms of increasing complexity: a 2D differential wheeled robot with changing wheel contact conditions, a 3D quadrotor in variational wind fields, and the Sphero BOLT robot under two contact conditions for real-world deployment. Empirical results corroborate that our method can handle temporally and spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world systems.", "tldr": "This paper proposes a time-continuous dynamics model that can adapt to changing environments for effective planning of mobile robots.", "keywords": ["Dynamics Learning", "Adaptibility", "Model Predictive Control", "Mobile Robot"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/76ad8f973b182daef25dc9eb45a738497479c847.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In the paper, \"AD-NODE: Adaptive dynamics learning with neural ODEs for mobile robots control,\" the authors propose an approach to learning adaptive dynamics models parameterized by neural ODEs that can be used in model-based planners such as MPC. The 2-stage approach first learns a latent representation of the environment from priviliged information, and then trains an adaptive module that estimates the same latent vector from state histories. The adaptive module can then be used at runtime to estimate the latent representation vector to tune the dynamics model to the environment. \n\nOverall, I think this paper has potential, but I would like to see a stronger justification for the proposed approach and clearer contrasts with existing work.

The approach is interesting, and could certainly be useful for making robots that can adapt to different environments at runtime. I would like to see a little more about the practical robotics side, such as how much training data is needed to work effectively, how many different environments and parameter variations are needed to train a good latent representation, how quickly the model can adapt on on-board hardware, etc. \n\n- The experiments and baseline comparisons are comprehensive and (mostly) convincing. Barring my comments regarding the interpretability of some of the results, the experiments and baseline comparisons do a good job of evaluating the proposed approach for the task of adapting to different environments. \n\n- The theoretical contribution of the paper appears solid.\n\n- The paper is (mostly) well-written. There are a few areas where grammatical tools could help improve the readability or flow of the paper. For instance, even the title \"AD-NODE: Adaptive Dynamics Learning with Neural ODEs for Mobile Robots Control\" could be improved to \"AD-NODE: Adaptive Dynamics Learning with Neural ODEs for Mobile Robot Control\" (removing the plural on \"robots\" to sound more natural)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- My biggest comment is that the authors have not done enough to compare/contrast their work with RMA. RMA takes a very similar approach, but the learned object is a policy network instead of a neural ODE. The 2-stage training procedure and adaptation approach are otherwise virtually identical. What is novel about this work when compared to RMA in terms of architecture or approach? What benefit do we get aside from being model-based? Without such a comparison, the theoretical and algorithmic contribution appears minor.\n\n  For instance, one might argue that the closed-loop policy performance of RMA confers significant benefits over the proposed approach in this paper by not needing to simulate rollouts and optimize on the fly, which can be a significant online computational burden. \n\n  Why not compare the downstream performance of the proposed model-based method with the existing model-free RMA approach? This seems like the clearest baseline from existing work. What performance benefits are there versus the RL-based policy? \n\n- The contrasts with related work do not clearly spell out how the proposed approach overcomes the issues faced by existing methods. The contrasts point out some common criticism of other existing approaches, such as excessive training data or limited OOD generalization, but the authors do not clearly explain how their approach overcomes these issues. As it stands, this makes the paper feel less well-motivated. What gap or limitation is the proposed approach fixing? \n  \n  The authors contrast with existing work (Kumar 2021, Zhang 2023) by saying that these approaches require large amounts of interaction data and demonstrate low sample efficiency, but do not say how their approach overcomes this downside. Simply changing to a model-based method does not alleviate this issue, and may make things worse for MPC/MPPI if the resulting model has significant model mismatch. \n\n  The same holds true for the other related works. The authors say that meta-learning struggles with out-of-distribution generalization (this is a strong claim), but wouldn't the proposed method suffer from the same downside? It's not clear how (or if) the proposed approach handles new, unseen environments not encountered during training, whereas meta-learning approaches like MAML can theoretically handle truly novel tasks or environments since they fine-tune online. \n\n  Without a clear contrast that demonstrates the benefits of the proposed approach over existing work, it is difficult to see exactly what advantages this approach has over existing work. The paper would significantly benefit from a clearer justification and expanded discussion.\n\n  As a minor comment, the related work also neglects some work in robotics for adaptation to novel environments/terrains. Expanding on this could strengthen the paper to demonstrate a clearer need for the proposed approach. \n\n- The experimental section in the main paper could benefit greatly from a more qualitative description of the performance of the controller versus the baselines. As it stands, it is difficult to determine the relative performance of the controller in the different setups. \n\n  How do the final trajectories look for the different models? Is there a noticeable difference or does MPPI handle the mismatch? \n\n  How quickly do the dynamics adapt to the new terrain? Is it possible to clearly distinguish the dynamics on the different surfaces? This is currently lacking in the experimental section."}, "questions": {"value": "My questions are mostly related to the weaknesses above and are the biggest points I would like see addressed:\n\n1. How does the proposed approach compare with RMA? The two approaches appear very similar, except that RMA learns a policy network instead of a dynamics model for MPC.

Why not compare the downstream performance of the proposed method with RMA, or at least discuss the comparative differences between them?\n\n2.
