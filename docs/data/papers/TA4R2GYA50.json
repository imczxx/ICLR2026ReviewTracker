While self-supervised learning has advanced representation learning for tabular data, most methods assume the unrealistic IID setting. In practice, tabular data often exhibits distribution shifts, including both label and covariate shifts, rendering existing domain generalization or test-time adaptation techniques from computer vision ineffective. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective $\\textbf{O}$nline $\\textbf{T}$est-$\\textbf{T}$ime $\\textbf{A}$daptation approach for $\\textbf{T}$Abular data (OT3A). It leverages high-confidence and domain-consistent pseudo-labels to estimate and correct for target label distribution shifts. Subsequently, it employs self-training and entropy minimization, guided by these confident samples, to adapt the model to the out-of-distribution test data. Extensive experiments across diverse distribution shift scenarios demonstrate that OT3A significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting its efficacy and practicality for adapting to real-world tabular data.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["test time adaptation; transfer learning; representation learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/325029783fc91967a34d9706c1f4f6aad8a468f4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d72570db5c896fdb03545b94be0775149a1961a4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposed a Test-time adaptation method named OT3A.

Prior works such as TabLog [1], FTAT [2], AdapTable [3], and [4] have already investigated similar directions. The current paper fails to cite AdapTable despite its clear conceptual overlap, raising concerns about potential plagiarism.\n\n- Moreover, the proposed components—uncertainty estimation, label distribution correction, and entropy minimization—have all been explored in existing tabular TTA frameworks (e.g., AdapTable, FTAT, AdaTab). In particular, using entropy minimization for covariate shift and label-shift calibration for distribution correction is standard practice in many previous works, and thus provides no technical novelty here.\n\n- The paper also claims novelty in handling the co-existence of covariate and label shifts, but this is a well-known issue already discussed multiple times in the vision TTA literature. The contribution in this respect is incremental at best.\n\n---\n\n### **Methodology**\n\n- The proposed method overlaps heavily with AdapTable. The use of the maximum difference between the top two logits as an uncertainty measure is identical, and the label distribution correction in line 198 replicates the same mechanism. These similarities appear to go beyond inspiration and verge on textual or conceptual plagiarism.\n\n- Additionally, the use of Euclidean distance to measure differences between high-dimensional tabular features is inappropriate. Tabular data often mix heterogeneous feature types and scales, making Euclidean metrics mathematically and practically meaningless without normalization or feature weighting.\n\n---\n\n### **Experiments**\n\n- All experiments are performed only on binary classification datasets from TableShift. This setup is insufficient to validate the method’s effectiveness. Binary tasks make label-shift correction artificially easy, since biasing predictions toward the majority class can inflate accuracy. Evaluation on multi-class datasets is essential to demonstrate robustness.\n\n- The reported batch sizes (250–2000) are unrealistic for tabular adaptation experiments. Standard batch sizes rarely exceed 128 or 256. Using such large batches distorts learning dynamics and makes results incomparable to prior baselines.\n\n- The component-wise ablation is also weakly analyzed. Several ablations even outperform the full method, suggesting the model’s design lacks internal consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Writing**\n\n-  The notation of the Affinity Matrix (\\hat{s}_{ij}) contains a typo.\n- The ablation table misuses bold formatting, highlighting configurations that are not the best-performing.\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n- [1] Ren et al. \"Test-Time Adaptation for Tabular Data Using Logic Rules.\" ICML, 2025.\n- [2] Zhou et al. \"Fully Test-time Adaptation for Tabular Data.\" AAAI, 2025.\n- [3] Kim et al. \"AdapTable: Test-Time Adaptation for Tabular Data via Shift-Aware Uncertainty Calibrator and Label Distribution Handler.\" NeurIPS Workshop on Table Representation Learning, 2024.\n- [4] Zeng et al. \"LLM Embeddings Improve Test-time Adaptation to Tabular Y|X-Shifts.\" NeurIPS Workshop on Table Representation Learning, 2025."}, "questions": {"value": "* How exactly was Figure 1 computed?
