Current deterministic models often fail to capture climate uncertainty, while existing generative approaches oversimplify the system by neglecting key spatiotemporal dependencies and cross-scale interactions.

This would strengthen the paper.\nWhen referred to Climate Forecasting, it goes beyond monthly forecasts upto several years or decadal forecasts. The results are shown upto 10 months only which in my opinion doesn't justify the climate forecasting part.\nThe evaluation done against the data-driven models such as graphcast, pangu weather were inherently built for weather forecasting (from short-term to medium-range forecasting upto 10-15 days, not climate forecasting.\nAlso, the RMSE results show the performance tend to de grade after 8 months lead time on several variables."}, "questions": {"value": "Please address some of the concerns mentioned in weakness sections.\nI think the problem needs to be reframed as long-term weather forecasting instead of climate forecasting.\nOR\nThe forecasting and evaluation framework needs to be adjusted according to the climate forecast problem.\nThere are many works on climate forecasting that goes beyond yearly forecasts.

However, the primary evaluation relies on the Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC), a deterministic metric that assesses the capability of the ensemble mean. This metric does not evaluate the quality of the predicted probability distribution itself (e.g., its spread or calibration). To fully substantiate the claims of probabilistic skill, the inclusion of a proper probabilistic metric, such as the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and Spread/Skill-Ratio would be essential.\n-  While the paper provides an efficiency study for model training, it omits a detailed analysis of the inference cost. Key details regarding the inference time and computational resources required to generate a full ensemble forecast are missing. This information is critical for assessing the model's practical viability for operational applications, where computational efficiency is often a major constraint. In addition it would be helpful to have a better understanding if the gain obtained from the new architecture comes from a higher complexity compared to the baseline."}, "questions": {"value": "- The VQ tokenizer is a critical component of ClimateAR, yet its design choices lack a detailed ablation study. Specifically:\na) Codebook Utilization: The paper does not provide an analysis of the codebook utilization or perplexity. This is important, as low utilization (i.e., \"codebook collapse\") can indicate an inefficient latent space where only a fraction of the learned codes are used, suggesting the codebook may be unnecessarily large.\nb) Codebook Size: While the authors provide a hyperparameter study for the number of codebooks (partitions N), there is no corresponding study on the size of the codebooks (V, set to 4096). An ablation on this key hyperparameter would be needed to understand the trade-offs between representational capacity and model efficiency.\n- The paper claims probabilistic superiority but primarily uses a deterministic metric (ACC of the ensemble mean). Could the authors provide results using a proper probabilistic score, such as the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), to validate this core claim?\n- How does the model ensure that the generated token sequences decode into physically plausible climate states, especially concerning conservation laws? Was any analysis performed to verify this?\n- What is the practical inference cost to generate a full 200-member ensemble forecast, and how does this compare to the operational baselines?\n- Could the authors provide a targeted ablation study to isolate the impact of the hybrid-scale prompt (C_mix) on the model's overall performance?\n- Given the widespread success of diffusion models in scientific generative modeling, the paper lacks a compelling justification for choosing an autoregressive framework. Could the authors either include a state-of-the-art conditional diffusion model as a baseline or provide a more rigorous argument for why the AR paradigm is fundamentally better suited for long-range climate forecasting?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "JWDuFSzENU", "forum": "MMcyzQUPqb", "replyto": "MMcyzQUPqb", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11323/Reviewer_r9QE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11323/Reviewer_r9QE"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11323/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761577469437, "cdate": 1761577469437, "tmdate": 1762922461459, "mdate": 1762922461459, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a visual autoregressive model for climate forecasting.

When doing climate forecasting, the variables are not predictable and we're instead interested in capturing climate statistics and dynamics. It is thus important to report additional metrics, such as mean + std. dev., or the power spectral density of the climate indices (as done in [1]) or the time-dependent area-weighted global mean and the area-weighted global mean bias and RMSE of time-mean fields (as done in [2]).\n\nSecond, it would be interesting to highlight learned relationships between multi-scale processes. For example by computing regression coefficient between climate indices (such as ENSO or IOD) with variables over the entire grid. \n\nThird, authors claim that the model does probabilistic climate forecasting, but this is not shown or evaluated in any of the experiments. Does the model learn a sensible uncertainty representation? I believe that the authors need to evaluate it since they argue that it is a strength of the model. To do so, it might be useful to evaluate the model on climate model data, where there are many more available years  than ERA5. Authors could show the uncertainty in the climate forecast (does it increase as you forecast longer time horizons?), continuous ranked probability score (by looking at different initial conditions for the different models) and maps of the uncertainty to check if predictable processes are associated with less uncertainty (are oceanic temperatures associated with less uncertainty than atmospheric temperatures over land?). \n\nThe authors should also highlight the limitations of the model in the discussion section.  \n \n[1] Hickman et al., Causal Climate Emulation with Bayesian Filtering, 2025\n\n[2] Watt-Meyer et al., ACE: A fast, skillful learned global atmospheric model for climate prediction, 2023"}, "questions": {"value": "The Intra-scale Mixed Token paragraph is a bit unclear to me. \n\nIn Equation 8, why are you doing down(f')?
