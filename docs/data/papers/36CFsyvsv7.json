While concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we present **ReFlux**, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow–based T2I framework. \nOur approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon known as *attention localization*. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies in rectified flow transformers.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Redteaming", "Diffusion Models", "Concept Attack"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2dc7e36a34c7b91261cf8ea321682b71b97882c3.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/cc61a263851cb6fb868ef393664daf7f8aa83f72.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a concept restoration attack (ReFlux) against concept erasure on the FLUX model, while prior research primarily focused on U-Net diffusion models. This paper motivates its method by pointing out that previous approaches are not directly applicable to the FLUX model, as they were designed for earlier architectures. In contrast to existing methods like UnlearnDiffAtk, ReFlux fine-tunes the model again, which makes the comparison to prior works (such as discrete black-box attacks) less clear. It has already been demonstrated many times that any downstream fine-tuning makes erasure effects slowly disappear; however, it remains unclear whether such benign fine-tuning would have similar effects to the proposed dedicated ReFlux fine-tuning. Unfortunately, the performance difference between UnlearnDiffAtk and the original model is usually fairly small, considering that UnlearnDiffAtk does not modify the model weights again. The inversion-based CCE attack is missing as a baseline. However, the general execution of this study is very well done, while the writing is a bit over-formalised.

The paper critiques prior black-box or LLM-based attacks for being \"unstable\" or \"slow\", but those methods operate under much stricter access assumptions (e.g., API-only, or even under white-box settings, they do not change the model parameter), which are more representative of real-world scenarios. In contrast, ReFlux assumes white-box access and permission to train the model, which is a much stronger and less realistic assumption.\n\n3. From my understanding, it is obtained by extracting the tokens in the prompt that are related to the target concept. However, in erased models, does the attention between the text tokens and the visual tokens corresponding to the target concept still remain?

Lack of novelty in the core idea: \n\nDespite the framing, the proposed “reverse-attention optimization” is essentially a restatement of gradient-based attention amplification with regularization terms (L2 and entropy). The formulation in Eq. (6) combines standard penalties already seen in prior works like ESD. There is no new learning principle introduced.\n\n2. No formal analysis of “attention localization:\n\nThe paper repeatedly claims that all erasure methods on Flux rely on “attention localization,” but provides only qualitative heatmaps. No quantitative correlation analysis, ablation on token indices, or mathematical evidence is offered to prove this is a necessary mechanism. The argument remains largely descriptive.\n\n3. The link between velocity guidance and flow-matching dynamics is hand-wavy:\n\nEquation (7) treats the velocity loss as an analog to v-prediction (Salimans & Ho, 2022), but the derivation is vague and lacks any justification for why this perturbation reliably reactivates erased semantics. The loss looks more like a heuristic energy term than a well-motivated generative control mechanism.\n\n4. No clear understanding of how LoRA affects erasure behavior:\n\nThe use of LoRA fine-tuning on text parameters is presented as “consistency preservation,” but the paper gives no empirical or theoretical evidence that this term actually prevents drift or stabilizes semantics. It is more likely that the LoRA term simply reduces attack strength due to smaller parameter capacity.\n\n5. Weak evaluation design:\n\nThe evaluation mostly uses automatic classifiers (NudeNet, Q16, CLIP, ViT), any human verification is missing. The authors claim “high-fidelity recovery” but present no quantitative perceptual metrics (FID, CLIP similarity).\n\n6. No comparison with stronger or more recent safety methods:\n\nThe erasure baselines stop at ESD, AC, and CP. There is no comparison to more advanced safety-tuned rectified-flow checkpoints or concept-regulated fine-tuning methods (e.g., MACE or SAFEDiff). The evaluation therefore does not convincingly show that ReFlux is effective against state-of-the-art defenses.\n\n7. Limited scope of the model base:\n\nAll experiments use Flux.1 [dev], a single open-source checkpoint. It is unclear whether the proposed attack generalizes to Flux [schnell], SD1.4/2, or other flow-based architectures.\n\n\n8. Efficiency claims are overstated:\n\nThe authors state that ReFlux requires “only one image generation (~0.5 min)” but fine-tunes LoRA for 1000 steps. This is contradictory — the cost of optimization per concept is not negligible. Compared to Ring-A-Bell (which is training-free), ReFlux is actually more computationally expensive per concept.\n\n\n9. Clarity and Presentation Issues: \n\nThe writing, while technical, is dense and overly formal, with many equations that add little insight (e.g., rewriting entropy and KL expansions just to derive Eq.
