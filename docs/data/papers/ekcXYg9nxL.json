To address the challenge, the author redesigned the training and generation process by introducing a new [REMOVED] states while treating the original mask state as transient, so encoding only happens on unremoved tokens.

The key idea, a gap counting mechanism, is simple yet clever."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "### W1. Execution\nThere is a significant lack of detail in many parts of the paper. I will list the most notable below.\n\n#### W1.1. Computation cost and asymptotic order\nThe computation cost reported in Table 1 is stated without derivation. (Q1) How does one conclude the reported costs? For example, the cost of the exponential schedule assumes a constant $\\sigma$, but surely larger $T$ call for smaller $\\sigma$? A detailed derivation that clearly states all assumptions should be provided in the appendix.\n\nThe experimental analysis of this (Fig. 4) also raises many questions. For starters, the 3 plots should be combined into one for the sake of easy comparison (e.g. using one color per noise schedule and one line style per model type). Next, there seems to be a lot of noise in the data, with 150 steps (linear schedule) taking significantly more time than both 200 and 250 steps. This casts doubt on the accuracy of the reported numbers: (Q2) What sample size was used, and what are the confidence intervals on the reported numbers? The text further claims that the exponential schedule “yields asymptotically $O(L^2)$ behavior” (i.e. *constant* in $T$), but the reported numbers clearly show linear growth in the number of sampling steps with no signs of slowing down. (Q3) How do you explain this discrepancy?\n\n#### W1.2. Length distribution\nMuch of the same issues are also found in Sec. 5.2 and Fig. 3. First, the plots are difficult to interpret (and the small font size and light colors are not helping); it would be better to plot the cumulative distribution of sequence lengths. (Q4) Like before, what is the sample size and confidence intervals associated with these numbers? Further, while the text claims that the length distribution of Elastic-MDM matches the data more closely than the baseline, from what I can tell, neither is particularly close. In fact, on OWT it appears that Elastic-MDM is even more concentrated around the maximum sequence length than the naive MDM baseline. (Q5) What is the quantitative overlap between the model and data sequence length distributions (e.g. measured via KL divergence or similar)?\n\n#### W1.3. Perplexity vs. wall time\nFirst, there are crucial details missing regarding the setup: (Q6) Which Qwen model was used for computing gen. PPL? (Q7) What are the denoising budgets used for the plotted points? (Q8) What is the sample size? Next, there are a number of oddities in the data. It seems like the walltime is non-monotonic in the number of denoising steps, with the first point in the line corresponding to Elastic-MDM (blue) taking less time than the second. Similarly, there exist points for MDM (red) that take the same amount of time, which is especially confusing given that MDM’s cost is linear and deterministic in the number of denoising steps. (Q9) What could be causing these discrepancies?\n\n#### W1.4. Sloppy ELBO derivation\nThe derivation of the training loss (ELBO) provided in App. B.3 has a couple of issues. First, and more cosmetically, there is a reference error on L707 and a placeholder text that is suggesting the full derivation is still missing. Next, in Eqs. 21 ff., the expectation over $q(z_{t-1})$ should be conditioned on $z_t$ and $z_0$. There are also a lot of constants being pushed into $C$, making its effect on the likelihood bound potentially non-negligible. This raises concerns about the tightness of the proposed bound, and (Q10) calls for concrete numbers on the training/validation ELBO (including the constant terms) of Elastic-MDM vs. MDM. Related to this is the issue that many of the ELBOs reported in the paper (Eq. 3, 9, 10) are stated without constants $C$, which are crucial for the bounds to be correct, especially for Eq. 10 where the constant includes $O(T)$ individual terms. Finally, the proposed ELBO (Eq. 10) does not include any scaling terms, even though the first term (“denoiser loss”) arises from masked diffusion, where it is well-known that the cross-entropy term includes a scaling factor of $\\frac{\\alpha_{t-1} - \\alpha_t}{1 - \\alpha_t}$ (Eq. 3) and one should expect this term to also show up in Eq. 10, casting doubts on the tightness of the proposed ELBO.\n\n#### W1.5 No results on training efficiency\nWhile a core contribution of this paper compared to related work (specifically: Kim at al., 2025) is claimed to be to “address computation efficiency gained by omitting masked tokens”, the analysis is restricted to inference time, even though efficiency gains should also be observed at training time. (Q11) How does the training efficiency of Elastic-MDM compare to standard MDM?\n\n#### W1.6. Lack of clarity regarding crucial design choices\n- (Q12) In L294 it is stated that $t$ is drawn uniformly between $1, \\dots, T$ (as is standard), but that $\\alpha_t$ is also drawn uniformly from $[\\beta, \\omega]$, with $\\beta$ and $\\omega$ seemingly not depending on $t$. This is confusing: Is the noise level $\\alpha_t$ indeed independent of $t$? If so, why worry about sampling $t$ at all? If not, what is the dependence of $\\beta$ and $\\omega$ on $t$?\n- (Q13) In L301 it is stated that the proposed model predicts $x_{t-1}$ directly rather than $x_0$, but the loss from Eq. 10 suggests that the model is trained to maximize the likelihood of $x_0$. How do we reconcile this?\n- (Q14) In Algo. 1, line 7, a binomial distribution is used to sample newly activated positions. Is this the correct choice? If so, what is the justification? And if not, could this potentially explain the mismatch in sequence length distribution observed between Elastic-MDM and the ground truth data?\n\n### W2. No continuous-time formulation\nThe proposed ELBO (Eq. 10) does not include any sort of scaling factor for the inner terms, seemingly growing linearly in $T$, especially at initialization. As already touch upon in W1.4, this should be addressed by reporting training curves of the ELBO (including constant terms) for increasing $T$. If the proposed ELBO is indeed tight, then we should expect it to get tighter (and in practice lower) as $T$ increases. If the ELBO grows with $T$, then it is not tight and should not be used as a likelihood bound (even though it can still serve as a surrogate training objective).\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, the paper tackles an important problem and proposes a good idea (similar to Kim et al.

Include both Elastic-MDM and your strongest baseline.\nThe current plots show trends (“Elastic-MDM is faster for the same perplexity”) but do not expose exact magnitudes, axes, or variance, so it’s hard to judge how big the gain is in practice. \n\n\n\nQ4. How is “generative perplexity” computed?\nYou say you evaluate sample quality by scoring generated text with a frozen LM evaluator. Please specify:\n\nWhich evaluator LM?\n\nAre you using its native tokenizer/BPE on the generated text?\n\nAre you sampling your model at a fixed temperature / nucleus setting?\n\nHow many samples and how long are they?\n\nDo you average per-token negative log-likelihood over the full generated continuation?\nWithout these details, I can’t tell if perplexity differences are meaningful or just artifacts of evaluation setup. \n\n\n\nQ5. Can you quantify the length-distribution match more rigorously?\nYou show that Elastic-MDM’s sampled sequence lengths roughly match the training length histogram, while the baseline collapses to a fixed max length. Could you report a metric (e.g. KL divergence between sampled length distribution and training length distribution, mean absolute error of length, etc.)? Also: can you steer the length?

But you also cite work on insertion/edit-based generation (variable length) and KV/compute caching for diffusion (efficiency). Can you either (i) include at least one of these as a baseline, even on a small setting, or (ii) explain concretely why they are not directly comparable (e.g. need different training data, incompatible objective)?\nRight now, this gap is one reason I’m only at “weak accept / borderline accept.” \n\n\nQ7. How general is the method to very long sequences?\nYou argue that total attention cost across all denoising steps can approach O(L^2) instead of O(T * L^2) because inactive tokens get dropped early.
