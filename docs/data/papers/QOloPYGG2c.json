Though many LLMs achieve similar accuracy on challenging tasks, such as math problem solving and programming, how their underlying reasoning \"algorithms\" compare remains poorly understood. To investigate this, we propose **ReJump**, which represents a reasoning trace as a visitation order over nodes in a tree of intermediate problem-solving steps. ReJump allows *tree jumps*, non-adjacent transitions between nodes that capture reasoning behaviors such as backtracking, verification, and calculation. This representation enables analyzing LLM reasoning with diverse and intuitive metrics that capture exploration, exploitation, overthinking, forgetting, and verification. We apply ReJump to analyze state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which are LLMs explicitly trained for long-form CoTs, and find that models with comparable final accuracy can nonetheless display distinct reasoning behaviors. We further compare distilled LRMs with their teachers, CoT-prompted LLMs with LRMs, and investigate how reasoning examples influence reasoning behavior.

We are particularly encouraged that the reviewers found that (i) our approach is sound (`R-Gh6N`), interesting (`R-qSFY`, `R-rKX8`), novel (`R-Gh6N`), interpretable (`R-Gh6N`), analytical (`R-Gh6N`), practical (`R-Gh6N`), verified by human evaluation (`R-qSFY`), and demonstrates clear gains (`R-Gh6N`);  (ii) our proposed metrics are intuitive (`R-qSFY`), reasonable (`R-qSFY`), and enable comprehensive (`R-Gh6N`) and quantitative (`R-Gh6N`) analysis; (iii) our experiments are solid (`R-Gh6N`) and comprehensive (`R-qSFY`, `R-Gh6N`, `R-rKX8`); and (iv) our paper provides quantitative (`R-qSFY`) and novel (`R-Gh6N`) insights and findings (`R-rKX8`).\n\nAs for the concerns/questions raised, we believe that we successfully addressed every single one, as replied to each reviewer. We integrated most of the answers and new results in the newly updated version (attached). \n\nHere we first restate the scope of the paper. **Our goal is to introduce and analyze the ReJump representation itself rather than to claim surprising findings or present a complete reasoning-improvement method.** With this clarified, we identify three key concerns raised by the reviewers. To address them, we conducted additional experiments, and the key concerns and our responses are summarized below.\n\n--- \n\n### Key Concern 1: Adaptation to Other Tasks\n\nTwo specific questions under this concern are: (i) that applying ReJump to other tasks may appear to require substantial effort, and (ii) that the experiments focus primarily on mathematical and arithmetic-style problems, and would benefit from additional tasks. Regarding (i), we argue that adapting ReJump to new tasks only requires lightweight prompt engineering. To demonstrate this and address (ii), we added two additional logical reasoning datasets: ZebraLogic `(Lin et al. 2025)` and Sodoku. \n\n* **ZebraLogic** `(Lin et al. 2025)` generalizes the classic Zebra Puzzle to an arbitrary $N\\times M$ setting, making deductive reasoning significantly harder as entities and attributes increase. We use their $5\\times6$, $6\\times4$, $6\\times5$, and $6\\times6$ subsets and sample 500 instances.\n\n* **Sudoku** is a grid-based constraint puzzle. We adopt a compact $6\\times6$ variant requiring each row and column to contain digits 1 to 6 exactly once, and generate 500 puzzles.\n\nWe further evaluate BoN with ReJump on these two tasks using Grok-3-mini-beta (chosen for its speed and low cost). The full setup is provided in Sec. E.1 of the updated pdf. BoN with ReJump continues to yield improvements on both new datasets:\n\n| Task | Method | Pass@1 |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| ZebraLogic | Majority Vote | 0.91 |\n| | BoN w. ReJump | **0.96** | \n| Sudoku | Majority Vote | 0.31 |\n| | BoN w. ReJump | **0.38** | \n\n\n### Key Concern 2: Benefit of ReJump over Simpler LLM-based Analysis\n\nThis concern stems from the complexity of the representation itself and whether ReJump-based analysis offers real advantages over a simpler baseline, such as prompting an LLM to directly output the metric values without extracting a ReJump representation. To test this, we ran the following experiments.\n\n* For metrics not defined on the graph (e.g., $\\#_{\\text{solution}}$, $r_{\\text{success}}$, $r_{\\text{forget}}$), we use the ground truth datasets created for evaluating ReJump-Extractor (see Sec. 4.1). Each sample is annotated with its correct metric value. We then compare two approaches: (i) directly asking the model to output the metric, and (ii) first extracting the ReJump representation and then computing the metric from that representation. The results below indicate that using ReJump-Extractor produces more accurate analyses compared to the simpler baseline.\n\n    | | #$_{\\text{solution}}$ (MAE $\\downarrow$) | $r_{\\text{success}}$ (MAE $\\downarrow$) | $r_{\\text{forget}}$ (Accuracy $\\uparrow$) |\n    |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n    | Direct | 2.12 | 0.11 | 0.87 | \n    | ReJump-Extractor | **0.62** | **0.08** | **0.89** | \n\n* For metrics defined specifically on the graph (i.e., $d_{\\text{jump}}$ and $r_{\\text{verify}}$), it is difficult to obtain them by directly querying Gemini-2.5-Pro. Since jump distance measures exploration, we instead prompt the model to classify exploration level using three examples. We then repeat the experiment of Sec. 6.1, where each prompt has three outputs and we apply Best-of-N (BoN) to choose the output with highest predicted exploration level. The table below shows that BoN with ReJump consistently achieves the best performance, further supporting that ReJump-Extractor enables more accurate analysis compared to the simpler baseline.\n    | Model | Majority Vote | BoN w. Direct | BoN w. ReJump |\n    |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| \n    | Phi-4-reasoning-plus | 0.77 | 0.77 | **0.84** | \n    | QwQ-32B | 0.76 | **0.82** | **0.82** |  \n    \nThese results are included in Sec.
