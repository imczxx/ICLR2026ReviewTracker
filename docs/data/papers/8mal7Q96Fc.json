Federated linear probing (FLP) is a practical paradigm that gains the communication efficiency from FL and generalization from pre-trained model, while still suffering from dimensional collapse that undermines its effectiveness. Dimensional collapse, originating from data heterogeneity, challenges the embedding space construction in FL, leading to suboptimal convergence and generalization. With a generalized frozen embedding extractor, FLP seems to be robust against dimensional collapse. However, in this paper, we emphasize that the dimensional collapse can also be represented in classifier construction, affecting the performance of the model. We propose FedRM to solve this problem, which randomly masks the dimension of the embedding and the classifier during the training to enforce the classifier to focus fairly on each dimension, guaranteeing diversity during decision generation. The simplicity of the method retains the communication efficiency of the FLP. We conduct empirical experiments to comprehensively evaluate the performance of FedRM. The results show FedRM achieves an overwhelming trade-off between efficiency and utility.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["federated learning", "data heterogeneity", "dimensional collapse", "pre-trained model"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7e5ee132030c7e5f5ddc7bf41e3ff0f7eca439d3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies dimensional collapse in federated linear probing (FLP) scenarios and proposes FedRM, a method that applies multi-ratio random masking to both the embedding and the classifier during training.

The current state-of-the-art in federated fine-tuning predominantly leverages Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA or Adapters, which adapt the model's internal representations rather than just the final layer. It is widely acknowledged that adapting only the final output layer often yields suboptimal performance, thus limiting the practical utility of the proposed method.\n\n2）The paper's central claim—\"dimensional collapse in the classifier\" (Section 4.1)—is poorly substantiated. The analysis is superficial, relying on brief textual descriptions rather than rigorous theoretical or experimental evidence. Despite motivating the entire work from this perspective, the paper lacks deep theoretical insights. No formal definitions or quantification (e.g., metrics reflecting the effective dimensionality or a direct analysis of the classifier weights' singular value distribution) are provided to empirically demonstrate the existence or severity of this challenge.\n\n3） The proposed FedRM method offers limited novelty, as it closely resembles a standard regularization technique (e.g., Dropout) applied to the embeddings and classifier weights. Additionally, the experimental evaluation is confined to traditional classification tasks. This overlooks the current, dominant trend of applying pre-trained models (such as LLMs and MLLMs) to more complex and relevant generative and understanding tasks.\n\n4）The choice of baselines is weak and lacks diversity. The paper fails to benchmark against modern, relevant state-of-the-art methods in federated PEFT (e.g., FLoRA[1]). Furthermore, there is no direct benchmarking or discussion of other highly relevant recent approaches that also employ masking, random noise, or collapse mitigation strategies in federated learning.\n\n\n\n[1] FLoRA: Federated Fine-Tuning Large Language Models with Heterogeneous Low-Rank Adaptations"}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "TD7yx4YHdv", "forum": "8mal7Q96Fc", "replyto": "8mal7Q96Fc", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11698/Reviewer_7jxB"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11698/Reviewer_7jxB"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11698/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761724415961, "cdate": 1761724415961, "tmdate": 1762922747215, "mdate": 1762922747215, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "Q4Nkm2eLI9", "forum": "8mal7Q96Fc", "replyto": "8mal7Q96Fc", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11698/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11698/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763035949880, "cdate": 1763035949880, "tmdate": 1763035949880, "mdate": 1763035949880, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the dimensional collapse presented in the classifier due to data heterogeneity.

To address this concern, please clarify and provide detailed explanations for the following:\n\n(1-a) A critical gap in the analysis is how FedAvg's aggregation mechanism interacts with local dimensional collapse. When multiple clients with different biased classifiers aggregate their parameters, the averaging process naturally generalizes dimension-specific biases across clients. The paper claims that “the global classifier inevitably inherits the dimensional collapse” (lines 280–282) without addressing why FedAvg's generalization does not mitigate this issue. Please clarify: What specifically differentiates the collapse mitigation achieved by FedRM from the natural mitigation effect of FedAvg aggregation? Can you provide a comparative analysis regarding this concern? For example, showing dimension utilization patterns for (i) local classifiers before aggregation, (ii) the global classifier after FedAvg, and (iii) the global classifier with FedRM. This is particularly important since the Personalized FL literature suggests that simple aggregation like FedAvg can diminish individual client characteristics under data heterogeneity, which would naturally counteract dimension-specific biases.\n\n(1-b) The paper lacks a theoretical analysis explaining why uniform dimension utilization is beneficial. Why is forcing the classifier to attend to all dimensions uniformly better than allowing it to focus on task-relevant dimensions? Could enforcing uniform utilization harm performance when certain dimensions are genuinely more informative for the task? Please provide a clear and intuitive explanation, preferably with empirical support.\n\n(1-c) The paper claims that “we investigate dimensional collapse occurring in the classifier in FLP, where data heterogeneity causes the classifier to rely on only a few dimensions rather than attending uniformly to all dimensions.” (lines 125–127), yet provides no empirical evidence, such as a visualization of the parameters of the classifier.\n\n(2) The experimental claims do not fully support the contribution of the proposed method. To address this concern, please clarify and provide detailed explanations for the following:\n\n(2-a) All results appear to be from single runs without confidence intervals. For rigorous evaluation, please provide mean ± standard deviation over multiple random seeds.\n\n(2-b) With M masks, the proposed method performs M forward passes per training step. How much does the computational cost increase as the number of masks increases, and how many masks are used as the default?\n\n(2-c) Figure 3 only removes masks incrementally, but critical ablations need to be provided to verify the robustness of the proposed method, such as the effect of the regularization weight $α_{RM}$.\n\n(2- d) Performance comparison with zero-shot methods does not necessarily support the superiority of the proposed method, since those methods are training-free and have fundamentally different computational profiles. If the authors aim to present the superiority of the FLP-like method, a full fine-tuning–based method needs to be added to the comparison.\n\nAlso, there are several minor issues to improve the paper:\n\n(3) For reproducibility, it would be better to provide complete algorithm pseudocode showing the full training loop, including mask generation, application, and aggregation.\n\n(4) Figure 2 has multiple issues: the server’s mask section shows two arrows with unclear meaning; the client’s embedding is depicted as a matrix, but Equation (8) (line 248) defines $𝑅_{𝑘,𝑖} ∈ 𝑅^{1×𝑑}$ as a vector.
