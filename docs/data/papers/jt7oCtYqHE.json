This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with RL alone even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies. This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms by which humans acquire new cognitive skills \\citep{Anderson1982Acquisition}. To mitigate data contamination and other confounding factors and to allow precise control over task complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation. Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function $f(x)$ given $x$. Once an LLM has already learned $f$ and $g$ prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen compositions of them $h(x)=g(f(x))$. Further, this compositional ability generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of $>2$ functions unseen during training. Our experiments provide surprising evidence that this compositional ability, acquired on the source task, transfers to a different target task. This transfer occurs even though the model has never trained with RL on any compositional problems in the target task, as long as it has acquired the target task's atomic skills prior to RL on the source task. Our qualitative analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the models. In contrast, neither of the findings is observed in next-token prediction training with the same data. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into the learning behaviors of widely-used post-training approaches for LLMs. They suggest the value of building base models with the necessary basic skills, followed by RL with appropriate incentivization to acquire more advanced skills that generalize better to complex and out-of-domain problems.", "tldr": "We show that once a model has acquired the necessary atomic skills for a task, RL enables the composition of these skills into more complex capabilities when properly incentivized.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Large Language Model", "Reasoning", "Exploration"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/728571d2efc5e8dc5e2b3c7e987ad5ce7339d507.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper argues that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones. \nUsing a controllable synthetic framework, this paper shows that LLMs compose learned string transformation functions via RL, and such compositional capability can transfer to different tasks.

We agree that demonstrating these findings in more complex, \"natural\" reasoning settings is a valuable and important direction for future work. However, we argue that using a synthetic task is arguably the only feasible choice for the goal of **scientific rigor and causal isolation** regarding the research question in this paper.\n\nThe central question of our paper, i.e., whether RL *genuinely teaches* new skills or just *activates existing ones,* requires an experimental setup that strictly ablates **prior exposure**. On most of the tasks, it is nearly impossible to determine if a model is learning a genuinely new compositional skill or merely activating a latent capability acquired during pre-training. As noted by previous work, many base models have likely been exposed to vast amounts of similar reasoning patterns or even the test data, making them \"confounded\" testbeds for studying the *origin* of a skill [1, 2].\n\nOur *entire* experimental framework was designed with **capability isolation as a core principle**. By selecting a model identified as having a \"cleaner\" baseline for these specific types of reasoning (Llama-3.1-8B) and designing novel, synthetic tasks from scratch, we create a controlled environment where the **atomic skills** are explicitly defined and the **compositional logic** is novel to the model. This almost ensures that the compositional skill we observe is *acquired* during our Stage 2 training, rather than being \"rediscovered\" from the pre-training distribution.\n\n---\n\n## General Response 2: Model Scale & Generalization\n\nTo further address the concern that our findings might be specific to the model choice or scale, during the rebuttal period, we replicated our main experiment on **Qwen-3-4B**, a model with a different architecture and scale. We kindly refer the reviewers to the figure in our anonymized repository [`https://anonymous.4open.science/r/rl-composition-rebuttal-DABE/qwen3_val.pdf`](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/rl-composition-rebuttal-DABE/qwen3_val.pdf). **The results follow the exact same trend:** RL on atomic tasks fails to generalize to high-level tasks, while RL on basic Level-2 compositional tasks unlocks generalization to deeper levels. This consistency across model families and scales reinforces that our synthetic testbed is capturing a fundamental mechanism of RL-based skill acquisition, rather than an artifact of a specific model.\n\nWe believe that providing this clear, causal proof-of-concept is a necessary and foundational contribution. We have established that the compositional mechanism *is* possible and LLMs learn new skills in RL through this mechanism. We hope this provides a solid foundation for the community to investigate it in more complex settings.\n\n[1] Wu, Mingqi, et al. \"Reasoning or memorization? unreliable results of reinforcement learning due to data contamination.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.10532* (2025).\n\n[2] Shao, Rulin, et al. \"Spurious rewards: Rethinking training signals in rlvr.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2506.10947* (2025)."}}, "id": "MxTuo6nzib", "forum": "jt7oCtYqHE", "replyto": "jt7oCtYqHE", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14300/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14300/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14300/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763699109724, "cdate": 1763699109724, "tmdate": 1763699109724, "mdate": 1763699109724, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates whether reinforcement learning (RL) genuinely teaches new reasoning skills to large language models (LLMs).
