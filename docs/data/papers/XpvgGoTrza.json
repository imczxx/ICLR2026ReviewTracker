However, existing methods use identical compression strategies for luma and chroma components, ignoring their perceptual differences in machine vision. To address this issue, a Chroma Superpixel Aggregation-based Learned Image Compression (CSA-LIC) method is proposed in this paper, which processes luma and chroma components differently according to their perceptual importance, and removes redundancies by exploiting intra-chroma and luma-chroma inter-component correlations. Specifically, a chroma adaptive sampling coding strategy is proposed, in which a superpixel-based chroma sampling module is designed to reduce chroma data volume by adaptively aggregating region-level semantic information based on chroma similarity, and a chroma generation module is built to enhance color integrity via luma compensation, thereby improving reconstructed chroma quality. To further eliminate cross-component redundancies, a cross-component feature transform module is designed to exploit luma-chroma correlations. Experimental results demonstrate that CSA-LIC outperforms state-of-the-art image compression methods in compression efficiency.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Machine Intelligence", "Learned Image Compression", "Chroma Superpixel Aggregation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9537bb03e8ff04449dc51322cd5bf0dd9e457d2f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel framework , CSA-LIC for Image Coding for Machines (ICM) designed to efficiently reduce redundancy for machine vision tasks by employing a separated processing pipeline for luma and chroma components. The core of this framework is the Chroma Adaptive Sampling Coding (CASC) strategy, which is integrated into the end-to-end nonlinear transform architecture. The CASC strategy includes a Superpixel-based Chroma Sampling Module (SCSM), which pre-processes the input by adaptively aggregating chroma regions to reduce data volume before the analysis transform, and a Chroma Generation Module (CGM), which post-processes the output by leveraging luma information to compensate and restore high-fidelity color details after the synthesis transform. To further enhance compression efficiency, a Cross-component Feature Transform Module (CFTM) operates within the codec, effectively eliminating redundancies between luma and chroma features. The author do experiments on the COCO2017 and OpenImagesV6 datasets for object detection and instance segmentation tasks to validate the proposed method, showing that it outperforms the baseline approaches discussed in the paper."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. Drawing inspiration from traditional image coding principles, the authors identify the potential benefits of applying differentiated processing to luma and chroma components. This approach aims to eliminate information redundancy that is irrelevant to downstream machine vision tasks in luma and chroma spaces separately.\n2. The paper provides empirical validation for its proposed modules. The authors have designed SCSM, CGM, and CFTM modules to implement their luma-chroma separation strategy and have conducted ablation studies that demonstrate performance gains over a baseline without these modules. This effectively validates the contribution of each component to the overall framework."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. While the authors propose that a differentiated compression strategy for luma and chroma is beneficial, the paper lacks persuasive experimental analysis to substantiate this core claim. A foundational analysis demonstrating the varying impacts of luma and chroma degradation on different machine vision tasks performance would be crucial. Such an analysis would not only strengthen the motivation for this work but also provide a clearer justification for treating these components differently.\n2.  The paper presents the framework more as a engineering integration rather than a principled design. The rationale behind key architectural choices is not adequately explained. For instance, why are SCSM and CGM designed as pre-processing and post-processing modules, respectively, outside the main codec, while CFTM is inserted within it? The paper can be more persuasive and readable if the author provide a deeper justification for this specific architecture over alternatives, such as modifying the nonlinear transform to handle luma and chroma features asymmetrically.\n3. The design choice of the loss function appears suboptimal for the goal. The objective is to optimize performance on machine tasks, yet the loss function includes a pixel-level distortion term ($D_i$), which encourages fidelity to the original pixels, is often has a traed-off  with machine vision task performance. Including $D_i$ could inadvertently penalize solutions that are better for the task but have higher pixel-level fidelity, leading to significant performance drop in machine vision tasks.\n4. The paper suffers from issues regarding its experimental setup. Firstly, the baseline codec used for ablation studies (\\textit{i.e.}, the model without the proposed modules) is not clearly pointed out. Secondly, the comparison with other ICM methods may not be entirely fair. The proposed CSA-LIC model is trained in an end-to-end manner, while it is unclear if the competing methods received similarly optimized fine-tuning. A more comparable baseline would involve fine-tuning the base codec (without the proposed modules) on the target tasks with the same task-oriented loss function ($R + \\lambda D_f$). Moreover, end-to-end fine-tuning may also implicitly learns the optimal luma and chroma importance allocation.\n5. The literature review on ICM is not comprehensive. ICM, particularly the learning-based methods, is a rapidly evolving field with a vast amout of existing work. The authors' categorization of the field into \"traditional\" and \"learning-based (attention- and task loss-based)\" is an oversimplification. A more thorough investigation and discussion of recent, relevant papers are needed to properly contextualize the proposed method and differentiate its contributions.\n6. The overall presentation and writing of the paper could be significantly improved. The manuscript currently reads as somewhat disorganized, and the logical flow between the different design components is not always clear. A thorough revision is recommended to enhance clarity, coherence, and the connection between the proposed modules.

This claim is quite limited from one visualization of a specific image. For a fair comparison of objective quality, the authors should provide BD-rate (PSNR) results or RD curves in terms of PSNR.\n* Figure 9 fails to demonstrate the effectiveness of CFTM, and its intended message is unclear.
