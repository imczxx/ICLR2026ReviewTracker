The paper clearly identifies a major gap in the field: the lack of interoperable tools and standardized benchmarks for irregular time series classification, which has long hindered cross-domain reproducibility and comparison.\n\n2.

While the benchmark covers a diverse set of classical and neural classifiers, recent developments in foundation or LLM-based time-series models (e.g., Time-LLM, CALF, or multimodal pretraining frameworks) are not discussed.

The paper briefly mentions runtime comparisons, but a deeper discussion of computational efficiency, scalability with data size, and memory footprint across model classes would strengthen the benchmarking narrative—especially given that one of pyrregular’s core motivations is interoperability and resource efficiency.\n\n3. The paper focuses exclusively on classification, leaving forecasting, anomaly detection, and imputation for future work. A brief demonstration or pilot benchmark on another task could have further illustrated the generality of the proposed framework.\n\n4.
