Although classical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms such as Random Forest and Decision Tree achieve high accuracy, their computational cost and memory consumption make them impractical for large-scale deployment in resource-constrained environments. To tackle this issue, this research investigates the use of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a bio-inspired and energy-efficient alternative, as the core of an IDS for IoT. We propose a comprehensive benchmarking analysis comparing six state-of-the-art HDC models (BinHD, NeuralHD, OnlineHD, AdaptHD, DistHD, and CompHD) against six traditional ML algorithms on modern cybersecurity datasets (NSL-KDD, IoT-Flock, UNSW-NB15, BCCC-CIC-IDS2017, CIC-IDS-2017, and BotNetIoT-L01). Our results demonstrate that the most advanced techniques in HDC models are able to improve accuracy while maintaining low memory consumption, especially NeuralHD and AdaptHD, which obtained the best accuracy results among the HDC models. NeuralHD consumed 467x less memory with a 4.72% accuracy difference compared to Random Forest on the UNSW dataset. We conclude that HDC emerges as a viable and necessary paradigm for IoT IDS, providing an ideal trade-off between performance, computational cost, and memory consumption.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Hyperdimensional Computing", "Intrusion Detection System", "IoT security", "Anomaly Detection", "Machine Learning", "NSL-KDD", "UNSW-NB15", "CIC-IDS-2017", "BCCC-CIC-IDS2017", "BotNetIoT"], "primary_area": "neurosymbolic & hybrid AI systems (physics-informed, logic & formal reasoning, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b99a31e61bdc49a9f5d6090e63798f1df8e071fd.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper addresses the problem of network intrusion detection, comparing six classical machine learning (ML) methods with six hyperdimensional computing (HDC) methods to demonstrate the tradeoffs between performance, computational efficiency, and memory consumptions.

KNN is an instance-based learner with no explicit training phase, which simply stores the training data, and is exactly why its inference time is orders of magnitude larger than all other models. Hence, the reported \"training time\" for KNN is misleading. What does the reported training time for KNN account for?\n\n* The paper lacks methodological novelty and offers only an empirical benchmarking study without any algorithmic, theoretical, or methodological contributions. While HyperDetect (Wang et al., 2024) already demonstrated HDC for IoT intrusion detection, this work essentially reduces to \"we tested more HDC models on more datasets\" without providing deeper insights into when, why, or how HDC should be preferred.\n\n* The paper claims in Section 4.1 that \"the complete source code is publicly available for reproducibility,\" however, no link, repository, or supplementary materials are provided in the paper or submission. \n\n* The preprocessing pipeline described in Section 3.4 appears to introduce data leakage or is poorly written. The paper states that data concatenation, cleaning, and standardization with StandardScaler occur before splitting into train/test sets (70/30), which would mean the scaler is fit on the entire dataset including test data, causing the test set statistics to leak into the training process and artificially inflate performance metrics. If this is merely unclear writing rather than actual leakage, the authors need to clarify the exact order of operations.\n\n* The energy measurement methodology is unspecified and not reproducible. The paper reports energy consumption in KWh and CO2 emissions in kg but provides no details on how these measurements were obtained, and what tools were used.\n\n* Section 3.4 states that the paper does not use the official test sets provided with these benchmark datasets and instead arbitrarily splits the data 70/30. As described in Section 3.1 datasets come with official train/test splits. It is unclear why the official test sets were not used, rather the data was re-split into train & test set.\n\n* The paper's presentation could be significantly improved by reorganizing figures and tables. Figures 1, 2, and 3 (accuracy, CO2 emissions, and model size comparisons) should be placed adjacent to each other to facilitate direct comparison across all three dimensions, rather than having Figure 1 followed by large empty space while Figures 2 and 3 appear on the next page.
