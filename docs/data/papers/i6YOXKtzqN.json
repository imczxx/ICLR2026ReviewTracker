We argue that this inefficiency stems from the fusion of information propagation and feature transformation within standard GNNs. In this paper, we introduce a design principle that decouples these two operations, enabling a highly efficient and linear architecture. Instantiating this principle, Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Model (DSTD) leverages the principle alongside a dynamic multi-scale aggregation mechanism to achieve remarkable performance. On widely-used spatio-temporal graph forecasting benchmarks, DSTD not only outperforms existing probabilistic methods but also surpasses top-performing deterministic models, while demonstrating a significant reduction in inference time. Our results validate that decoupling is a powerful and effective strategy for building scalable and high-performing generative models for graph-structured data.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["spatio-temporal graph forecasting", "probabilistic forecasting", "diffusion model", "decoupled graph neural network"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1d8a161984168a90fc774de6e727d2e567022e08.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/8ddf0f90f76eed634c51ff73aef81b279f696a52.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a decoupled spatio-temporal diffusion model (DSTD) for probabilistic traffic forecasting.
