While LLM-based auditors have demonstrated strong potential, their effectiveness remains limited by misalignment with the highly complex, domain-specific nature of bug detection. In this work, we introduce BugScope, an inference-time alignment framework inspired by human auditing practices. BugScope structures auditing into three steps: seed identification, context retrieval, and bug detection, and aligns LLMs to each step by analyzing real bug reports, generating diverse examples, and distilling concise, reusable guidelines. On a curated dataset of 40 real-world bugs from 21 widely used open-source projects,\nBugScope achieves 86.05% precision and 87.88% recall, corresponding to an F1 score of 0.87. By comparison, leading industrial tools such as Cursor BugBot and CodeRabbit achieve F1 scores of only 0.43 and 0.29, respectively.

A key aspect of BugScope is its learning phase, where it learns retrieval and detection guidelines from real bug reports to synthesize agent strategies and prompts, all without model retraining. An empirical evaluation on a curated dataset of 33 bugs from popular open-source projects shows that BugScope outperforms several industrial and research baselines (RepoAudit, Cursor BugBot, CodeRabbit, Meta Infer) in F1 score.

The evaluation primarily focuses on bug types (e.g., Out-of-Bounds, Divide-by-Zero) that are relatively well-structured and have been targets for traditional static analysis.

To better assess the generalization capabilities of the learning phase, it would be insightful to see how BugScope performs on bug types that were explicitly not included in the learning stage. Have any such `zero-shot` generalization experiments been conducted? \n5. The discovery of 141 new bugs in the Linux kernel is impressive. The paper states that 78 have been fixed and 7 confirmed. Could the authors clarify the status of the remaining 56 reports (141 - 78 - 7)?

Many details required for reproduction are missing and the soundness of the results based on such small sample sizes is questionable. Moreover, the presentation of the paper has multiple problems. Please find the details below.\n1) The main comparison is based on an extremely small sample of bugs: 33 bugs for testing, i.e., on average 11 per class of bug, and 4.7 per anti-pattern. Performance values on such small numbers cannot be trusted and are not sufficiently sound to demonstrate a robust and reliable performance improvement over prior work. \n2) There is no use of statistical methods to determine if any differences are significant or if they can be explained by random effects. \n3) Many details regarding how data collected are missing. While the authors list some prior works, I see nothing on existing bug data sets (e.g., for vulnerabilities like Devign or bugs in general like Defects4j, bugs.jar, etc), or how the sample of 40 bugs was selected based on these prior works.\n4) The application to real-world projects lacks information required to understand the process for selecting the targets, which is important to understand the quality of the results. There is some limited information for the Linux kernel issues, but basically nothing that explains anything regarding the data reported in Table 2. It is unclear how the projects were selected, and which kind of experimentation was conducted for each project, other than that the number of seeds per repository was limited. Moreover, it is unclear to if there are false positives and how they were handled. Note that this last point might also lead to ethical issues (see below).\n5) I would not be able to re-implement the work based on the level of detail of the reporting. Many important details are left out. As an extreme case, consider page 5, Line 255: “These steps rely on standard techniques and are our main contributions”. The only information we have is that “an agent is employed” for this. How this agent works and why an agent is chosen over algorithmic approaches for defect data collection (e.g., based on some SZZ algorithm variant), remains unclear. The other aspects of the method description have similar issues. For example, Page 6, Line 297 states that “relevant code should be collected by tracing data dependence and control dependence”. How exactly this works (e.g., based on a data flow graph of control flow graph), which steps are used, etc., is left unexplained. \n6) The authors argue that manually defined patterns (even large amounts of patterns) are still insufficient (Page 4, Line 184). However, they never back this claim with data. They never study how LLM-inferred rules compare to a large set of human-curated rules for the bug types they study. This needs to be put into proper context reducing the claims or data need to be provided that the suggested method is better than human experts defining rules. \n7) Many acronyms are not properly introduced. This includes the bug type “NPD” for the linux kernel. The acronyms for the anti-patterns are only introduced in the Appendix. While is in general okay, the main body at least needs to specify where this information can be found. \n8) A possible way to make room for more details is to avoid redundancies in the first sections. The general three-step process is explained multiple times, including twice in the introduction, once in the motivation and twice when explaining the idea. While is explanation is somewhat different from the others, often adding some piece of information, large portions are also redundant. \n9) All references in the paper are wrongly formatted (missing brackets), probably because this was converted from a different LaTeX style without checking."}, "questions": {"value": "1) Is there more data to support the validity the results and can it be shown that improvements are non-random?\n2) Is there any data that supports that this approach beats manually curated guidelines?\n3) How exactly was the application to the real-world software conducted?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["Yes, Responsible research practice (e.g., human subjects, annotator compensation, data release)"]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "Experimentation in the wild possibly requires an ethics statement.

Specifically, we synthesize the retrieval strategies and detection logics with all patches used in [1] and successfully uncover 41 additional new bugs in the latest Linux. These bugs span multiple categories, including use-after-free/double-free, error-code handling issues, memory leak, and uninitialized variables. Together with the other three categories of bugs previously reported in the paper (i.e, null pointer dereference, divide-by-zero, and out-of-bounds), BugScope covers seven different types of bugs upon Linux kernel. The overall precision upon Linux kernel reaches 91.07%.\n\nDue to time constraints, we have not yet received developer feedback on these newly reported bugs. We will provide the full list of detected bugs upon acceptance. We have updated the evaluation section (Section 4.2 and Appendix G) with these new statistics and additional explanations in the revised paper.\n\n**Compare BugScope with Baselines on Real-world Projects.**\n\nAs shown in Section 4.2 (original submission), we evaluated the generality of the retrieval strategies and detection prompts synthesized from the seven learning-phase cases by applying them to six high-profile real-world projects. We randomly sampled 100 seed statements per bug type per repository and attempted to detect new bugs. As reported in Table 2, BugScope successfully identified 80 new bugs with a precision of 76.92%.\n\nDuring the discussion phase, we further add a large-scale baseline comparison using all seeds extracted from the six projects (1800 in total, 3 times than the original). As shown in Table 7 of the revised paper, BugBot and CodeRabbit detect only 3 and 12 bugs (with precisions of 50% and 48%), RepoAudit detects 58 memory leak bugs and one out-of-bounds bug (with overall precision 53.64%), and Infer detects only 6 memory-leak bugs (with precision 22.22%). In other words, BugScope substantially outperforms all baselines in both recall and precision.\n\nThese expanded experiments demonstrate that BugScope generalizes robustly across large and diverse real-world codebases and consistently delivers stronger performance than prior work. We have updated Section 4.2 and Appendix F in the revised paper to include these new statistics and additional explanation.\n\n### **Reference**\n\n[1] Chen, Wei, et al. \"Seal: Towards diverse specification inference for linux interfaces from security patches.\" Proceedings of the Twentieth European Conference on Computer Systems. 2025."}}, "id": "lkokYB3C1V", "forum": "28ve0ItkGl", "replyto": "28ve0ItkGl", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9750/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9750/Authors"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9750/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763654624185, "cdate": 1763654624185, "tmdate": 1763663383524, "mdate": 1763663383524, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presented BugScope, a framework that used inference-time alignment to adapt LLMs for the complex task of code auditing.
