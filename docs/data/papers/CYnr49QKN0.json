In this paper, we present the first entropy-based formulation of satellite scanning optimization, designed to enable near real-time Earth observation with large-scale Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations. Unlike conventional coverage plans that follow rigid orbital patterns, our approach directly maximizes spatial entropy over imaging point distributions, promoting diversity and fairness in spatiotemporal coverage. This principled objective prevents redundant observations, ensures balanced regional attention, and provides smooth transitions between successive scan plans. To operationalize the framework, we introduce a differentiable solver that maps optimized imaging points into physically executable camera angles, and an efficient satellite-to-task assignment module that minimizes slewing effort through a hybrid of the Hungarian algorithm and nearest-neighbor heuristics.

Framing the problem as maximizing the entropy of a spatial probability distribution is a principled and novel approach in the context of satellite constellation scheduling. This is a clear departure from prior heuristic or event-driven methods.\n\nStrong and Principled Theoretical Foundation (Significant Contribution): The integration of spatial entropy maximization with Wasserstein-gradient flows (JKO scheme) is elegant and powerful. It provides a solid information-theoretic justification for promoting coverage diversity and a rigorous mathematical framework for ensuring temporal consistency. This theoretical depth elevates the work beyond a mere engineering solution.\n\nCompelling Empirical Results (Significant Contribution): The experimental results are highly convincing. The demonstrated performance gains—order-of-magnitude reduction in revisit times and minute-level continental coverage—are not just incremental. They directly address a critical bottleneck in Earth observation and convincingly showcase the framework's potential for real-world impact.\n\nCompleteness and Scalability: The proposed pipeline is end-to-end, moving seamlessly from high-level distributional planning to low-level, physically executable control angles. The successful scaling from regional (state-level) to continental (South America) scenarios strongly supports the claim of scalability, which is crucial for modern mega-constellations."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "While the paper is strong, the following points should be addressed to further improve its quality and impact.\n\nLimited Comparison to Modern Learning-Based Baselines: The chosen baselines (Push Broom, Whisk Broom, 4-Wide Swath) are representative of traditional methods but are relatively simplistic. The work would be significantly strengthened by comparing against more advanced, modern schedulers, such as those based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or other meta-heuristic optimization techniques, which have been explored in the satellite scheduling literature.\n\nAblation and Sensitivity Analysis is Insufficient: The paper lacks a thorough ablation study and sensitivity analysis. Key questions remain:\n\nHow critical is the Wasserstein term to the overall performance?\n\nHow sensitive are the results to the key hyperparameters (entropy balance factor β, learning rate η, Sinkhorn regularization ε)?\n\nA systematic analysis would provide deeper insights into the contribution of each component and the robustness of the method.\n\nValidation Under Real-World Uncertainties: The simulation is trace-driven but does not account for several critical real-world operational constraints. The most notable omissions are:\n\nCloud Cover and Atmospheric Conditions: This is a primary factor that invalidates optical observations. The framework's performance under persistent cloud cover is unknown.\n\nOnboard Computation and Communication Latency: A discussion on the feasibility of running the optimization on the ground and uploading commands within the required timelines, or a simplified version for onboard use, would enhance practical relevance.\n\nClarity on \"Soft Grid Probability\" Computation (Minor): The derivation of the soft grid probability p_j in Eq.

Therefore, the optimization problem (Eq 12) is not finding a general set of optimal points; it is finding the specific optimal point $I_i$ for each specific satellite $s_i$, given that satellite's physical constraints $\\mathcal{I}_i$. The assignment is an input to the optimization. Section 2.3 then states: \"After determining the optimal imaging point distribution $I_1, ..., I_n$, the system must assign each point to a suitable satellite...\". This is a direct contradiction. It is logically impossible to use the pre-assigned feasible sets $\\mathcal{I}_i$ to solve for the points $I_i$, and then afterward assign these points to satellites.\n\n* A central claim is on solving the scheduling problem in near linear time. Yet, the first and second parts of the proposed scheme discussed in sections 2.2 and 2.3 could involve $O(n^2)$ or $O(n^3)$ operations (for Sinkhorn's algorithm and the Hungarian algorithm, respectively). Further analysis and explanation are thus required about the detail of the implementations. \n\n* In line 248 it is correctly stated that \"the entropy term is concave in p but becomes nonconvex when expressed in I due to the nonlinear mapping.\" Yet, remarkably, the provided proofs in the Appendix (A.3 and A.4) are based on assertion of convexity of the entropy in $\\mathbf{I}$ (step 1 in Appendix A.3 and Step 2 in Appendix A.4). Overall, there are gaps in the proofs, and many terms are undefined, e.g.  coercive functionals. Also, it must be made clear which specific results from Jordan et al. (1999) and Ambrosio et al. (2008) are cited (the latter is a 340+ page book). Besides, the theoretical derivations lack novelty despite the lack of soundness I discussed above.\n\n* In a similar vein, Proposition 1 is \"empty\". That is, its proof claims to show that the entropy $\\mathcal{H}(I)$ is maximized when the coverage is proportional to the area of each cell. The derivation, however, does not perform any optimization. It simply assumes the desired solution and then computes the entropy for this assumed distribution. This is a circular argument. It never shows that a set of imaging points $I$ exists that can produce this exact distribution, nor does it show that this distribution is the maximizer of the functional $\\mathcal{H}(I)$ with respect to $I$.\n\n* The results in Figure 4 and 5 show that the proposed method achieves a near-perfect revisit gap (sub-100 seconds), while three standard baselines are orders of magnitude worse. This suggests either the baselines are either not SOTA or improperly implemented, or the proposed method's simulation is not subject to realistic physical constraints.\n\n* I think Figure 6 is demonstrating some chaotic, high-energy slewing paths which could contradict the validity of the proposed Wasserstein regularizer (e.g. blue circle sat in Figure 6 b and Longitude between -106 and -104 or the purple circle sat in Figure 6 c and Longitude between -102.5 and -100)."}, "questions": {"value": "* The forward projection model for mapping satellite angles to ground coordinates (latitude $\\varphi_{i,t}$ and longitude $\\lambda_{i,t}$) in eq 1 and eq 2 are provided without derivation or citation.\n\n* Please also see weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "VM4Ki69l2H", "forum": "CYnr49QKN0", "replyto": "CYnr49QKN0", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13315/Reviewer_syR7"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13315/Reviewer_syR7"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13315/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762098947607, "cdate": 1762098947607, "tmdate": 1762923977765, "mdate": 1762923977765, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
