Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

Although acknowledged in the limitations section, the log-replay simulation is a major weakness of this work for more realistic closed-loop evaluation, as it should be straightforward to incorporate behavior models for other agents. This could have been an advantage of using a driving simulator like CARLA, which offers easier agent management.\n2. The reconstructed digital twin of real-world interactions lacks diversity and realism. The layout of the intersection is all four-way intersections, and the assets, such as bushes, trees, and road textures, all appear the same. \n3. The collected real-world data all come from a small region with only 15 intersections, which lacks diversity. Therefore, the results from such a benchmark may not be general and comprehensive for the driving agent's performance.\n4. With the lack of photorealism of the image rendering of CARLA, the proposed DriveE2E benchmark is more suitable for modular testing of AD systems like downstream planning and decision making rather than evaluating end-to-end driving agents. End-to-end driving policies trained from such data may also exhibit a large sim2real gap."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
