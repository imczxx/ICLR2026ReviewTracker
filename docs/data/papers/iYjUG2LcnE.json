Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Speech large language model", "Multi-modal large langauge model"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cdc77cb22acdf622999d87664d145fbc2920ccec.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/8ea2eef19a5626a2a7e0767537cabf43d7b2b14b.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes EchoX, a three-stage pipeline for speech-to-speech LLMs. The key idea is to use a frozen text-to-codec module to generate pseudo speech targets from intermediate semantic representations, with the goal of reducing the acoustic-semantic gap.

The method feels close to a cascaded S2T + TTS system with an extra alignment step. The novelty and contribution are not very clear.\n2. The main claim (mitigating the acoustic–semantic gap) is not convincingly demonstrated. I would expect clearer evidence showing reduced semantic degradation compared to text-only or other S2S approaches. In particular, the paper does not show that the gap between S2T and S2S is actually smaller than in other systems. For example, the reported S2T vs. S2S scores are 77.3 vs. 63.3, while VITA-Audio shows 75.6 vs. 68.0, indicating a narrower gap than the proposed model. Maybe the paper can add WER results and S2T/S2S relative gap like [1] mentioned to show it clearly.\n3.  I have concerns about the fairness and stability of the test set. The accuracy on these spoken QA benchmarks is computed via keyword matching, which leads to inconsistent results across papers for the same model (e.g., GLM-4-Voice, LLaMA-Omni2). Some of questions also not suitable for testing, e.g. rely on chemical symbols or other abbreviated forms, which makes the score highly sensitive to ASR and text normalization errors rather than the S2S generation quality itself. \n\n[1] Towards Efficient Speech-Text Jointly Decoding within One Speech Language Model https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04518v1"}, "questions": {"value": "Overall, while the paper targets an important problem: the intelligence degradation introduced during modality conversion, and the dataset release is a valuable contribution to the community. But I remain skeptical that the proposed method effectively addresses this issue. The evidence presented does not convincingly support the main claim. \n\nBelow are several technical questions for the authors:\n1. The Echo loss uses speech codec targets obtained by decoding the S2T hidden states into text via greedy search and then passing them through a frozen T2C model. Since the T2C module is pre-trained independently and does not update during Stage III, all speech-token supervision could be precomputed offline by running T2C on ground-truth transcripts. Could the authors clarify what representational benefit the online speech label generation provides? In particular, what gradient differences arise compared to purely offline codec labels? \n2. Semantic–Acoustic Gap Quantification. Echo training is motivated by reducing the acoustic–semantic gap in representation space, yet the paper measures only downstream QA accuracy. Could the authors provide quantitative metrics validating that H is closer (e.g., via cosine similarity, probing, clustering entropy) to semantic spaces after Echo training than before? Without such evidence, it is unclear whether Echo training modifies representation geometry rather than simply regularizing the decoder.\n3. In an AR setup with NTP loss and causal masking, the model can already leverage corrected previous text and speech tokens during training to predict the token at timestep t. When paired with offline text labels and corresponding TTS-generated codec tokens, the model receives clean supervision at every step. Given this, it is unclear what additional benefit the Echo loss provides beyond standard AR conditioning. Could the authors clarify what unique learning signal Echo loss introduces that is not already captured by the lower-triangular causal mask and NTP supervision?\n4. Could the paper add benchmark like Voicebench? It would strengthen the empirical evidence and make the results more convincing."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "PLMXHMX5uN", "forum": "iYjUG2LcnE", "replyto": "iYjUG2LcnE", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8303/Reviewer_uHyc"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8303/Reviewer_uHyc"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8303/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761286189538, "cdate": 1761286189538, "tmdate": 1762920232567, "mdate": 1762920232567, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a multi-stage training framework of speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) in order to bridge the acoustic-semantic gaps.
