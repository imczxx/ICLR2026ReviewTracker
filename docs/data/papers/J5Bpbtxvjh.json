However, few studies have looked into the practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model, without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.", "tldr": "we propose Gaussian process based framework called RoCA, for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving.", "keywords": ["autonomous driving; Gaussian process; cross domain adaptation"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3a71e976e5f25612447f43d6d331ded333180f25.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f26975315b0521a8c4b5fe5058d868cbfbe916a1.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes RoCA (Robust Cross-domain end-to-end Autonomous driving), a Gaussian Process–based framework that enhances the robustness and adaptability of end-to-end driving models across different domains.

While the title suggests broad domain generalization (e.g., across cities, weather, or sensors), the experiments mainly cover cross-city and sim-to-real settings, which represent limited domain shifts.\n2. The paper argues that recent LLM/VLM-based E2E driving models do not guarantee cross-domain generalization and may incur high retraining costs. However, this claim is not experimentally supported, the authors do not provide many quantitative comparisons with such models (except for DiMA) under domain-shift scenarios. Given that LLMs and VLMs are often credited with strong open-world or cross-domain capabilities, the lack of empirical evidence weakens this argument and makes the motivation for replacing them with RoCA less convincing."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The author is expected to define or explain implementations of terminologies when they first appear.\n    - The paper lacks a clear, formal problem definition. It jumps into the system overview without first defining the precise inputs (e.g., multi-view images, ego status?) and the target outputs (e.g., ego waypoints, agent trajectories?).\n    - The entire method is based on Gaussian Processes, but there is no preliminary section or background provided. A brief mathematical overview of GP regression in the main text would be helpful for readers.\n    - The experiment section is dense and difficult to parse. It would be much clearer if it started with a summary of the experimental goals, the base models used, and explained more about the different settings being tested (e.g., source-domain generalization, unsupervised adaptation, active learning) before presenting the tables. Also, it will be clearer to bold the highest scores in tables.\n\n2. The paper is missing critical analysis to justify why the proposed formulation is superior to simpler alternatives.\n    - The core claim is that the GP formulation adds robustness. The t-SNE plot (Fig 2) shows better cluster separation, but the paper does not deeply analyze why this probabilistic approach leads to better generalization compared to a deterministic one.\n    - The \"codebook\" of \"basis trajectories\" sounds very similar to a set of anchors. The paper is missing a crucial comparison to a strong anchor-based method. What is the explicit advantage of this complex GP formulation over a simpler, non-probabilistic method that also learns a codebook of \"anchors\" (e.g., via k-means or simple end-to-end learning) and predicts a residual? An ablation is needed to isolate the benefit of the GP itself.\n\nI am willing to increase my score if the authors can substantially improve the paper's clarity and address the key questions regarding the method's justification."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
