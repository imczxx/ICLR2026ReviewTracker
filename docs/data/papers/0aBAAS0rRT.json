Despite its importance, achieving precise localization across diverse environments remains challenging due to the complex nature of wireless signals and their sensitivity to environmental changes. Existing data-driven approaches often suffer from limited generalization capability, requiring extensive labeled data and struggling to adapt to new scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SigMap, a multimodal foundation model that introduces two key innovations: (1) A cycle-adaptive masking strategy that dynamically adjusts masking patterns based on channel periodicity characteristics to learn robust wireless representations; (2) A novel \"map-as-prompt\" framework that integrates 3D geographic information through lightweight soft prompts for effective cross-scenario adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple localization tasks while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization in unseen environments, significantly outperforming both supervised and self-supervised baselines by considerable margins.", "tldr": "We propose SigMap, a foundation model that uses self-supervised learning with cycle-adaptive masking and map-conditioned prompting to achieve accurate and generalizable wireless localization across diverse scenarios.", "keywords": ["Wireless Localization", "Foundation Models", "Self-Supervised Learning", "Fine-Tuning", "6G Networks"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a2f94f111724bb91c2152a0630b1f1272584ecf4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes SIGMAP, a transformer backbone pre-trained with cycle-adaptive masked modeling on Channel State Information, then fine-tuned with a learned geographic prompt from a 3D map via a GNN.

By embedding spatial priors directly into the learning framework, the model can better understand geographic context without requiring explicit supervision or heavy parameterization. This approach provides a lightweight yet effective way to integrate domain knowledge into data-driven models.\n\n(2) The proposed cycle-adaptive masking strategy effectively leverages the inherent periodic and structural characteristics of CSI signals. This allows the pretraining process to focus on more informative segments of the data, improving robustness and representation quality, especially when dealing with noisy or incomplete measurements.\n\n(3) The demonstration of few-shot adaptation using a frozen backbone is impressive, as it highlights the model’s ability to generalize with minimal retraining.

Without validation on empirical datasets or publicly available benchmarks such as CSI-Bench, it is difficult to assess how well the approach generalizes beyond simulation. This gap weakens the practical relevance of the presented findings.\n\n(2) The paper’s claim of developing a “foundation model” for wireless localization appears overstated. While the architecture shows potential for generalization within simulated settings, it lacks evidence of robustness across devices, propagation environments, or hardware variations, all of which are critical for real-world applicability.\n\n(3) Although the system integrates several established components—masked autoencoders, vision transformers, and graph-based prompting—the overall architectural contribution feels incremental. The novelty lies more in the combination and application context rather than in introducing fundamentally new mechanisms or model designs.\n\n(4) The work asserts interpretability through the use of map prompts but does not provide supporting analysis. Visual or quantitative evaluation of how the prompts influence model predictions would strengthen the paper’s interpretability claims and offer deeper insights into model behavior.\n\n(5) The scalability of the proposed approach remains uncertain. The paper does not explore how the framework performs when applied to large-scale or densely connected map graphs, which are common in real-world urban deployments. Understanding such scalability constraints is important for practical use in complex environments.\n\n(6) While the paper relies on ray-tracing–based wireless simulation, this approach—though widely used—offers limited novelty unless extended with advanced modeling such as diffuse scattering, dynamic environments, or hybrid physics–ML calibration.
