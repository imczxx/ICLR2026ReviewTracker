The core idea of aligning data based on a period is a form of explicit feature engineering. However, the paper fails to discuss or compare its method against other well-established techniques that achieve similar goals, such as adding periodic positional encodings (e.g., Fourier features, time-of-week embeddings). These alternative methods can also explicitly inform the model about the periodic phase without the disruptive re-ordering and zero-padding of the input sequence.\n2. The experiments are not solid enough to support the paper's claims:\n   1. Limited Baselines: The experiments primarily compare against only one method (CycleNet). A stronger evaluation would require comparison against a wider range of methods that explicitly model periodicity, especially those using positional or temporal embeddings.\n   2. Choice of Backbone Model: The choice of SFNN as the main backbone model is questionable. While the authors state it is a state-of-the-art model, it is not yet a widely recognized or established benchmark model in the community. Demonstrating improvements on more models (e.g., DLinear, TimesNet, PatchTST) would be more convincing.\n   3. Insufficient Datasets: The evaluation is conducted on only three real-world datasets. Given the method's strong reliance on periodicity, its performance on a more diverse set of benchmarks, including those with varying degrees of periodicity, is needed.\n   4. Unconventional Data Splitting: The paper uses a 95%-5% train-test split without a validation set, arguing that this reflects real-world practice. However, this is a departure from standard practice in academic literature, making results difficult to compare with prior work.\n3. The choice to pad missing values with zeros in Section 3.2.1 is not well-justified. Zero-padding can introduce significant noise and create artificial discontinuities, especially for time series whose values are not centered around zero. The paper does not analyze the impact of this choice or explore more principled alternatives (e.g., padding with a mean value or a learned padding value)\n4. The paper's overall presentation is a weakness, making it difficult for the reader to follow the core argument. The motivation is not clearly articulated in the Introduction section; it fails to convincingly explain why this specific alignment approach is necessary compared to existing methods for handling periodicity.\n5. There are some unaddressed limitations and unrealistic assumptions:\n   1. The paper's analysis and experiments are confined to time series with strong, stable periodicity. The method's behavior on data with weak, multiple, or evolving periods is not discussed, which severely limits its practical applicability.\n   2. The theoretical analysis in Section 4.2 relies on strong assumptions (e.g., linear model, L=H=P, a specific autoregressive data-generating process) that may not hold for complex, real-world time series and deep learning models. The conclusions from this analysis (e.g., Theorem 4.2 stating that alignment increases testing error) seem to contradict the paper's main claims, and the subsequent \"rescue\" in the non-autoregressive case (Section 4.4) feels post-hoc and is based on a constructed toy example."}, "questions": {"value": "1. How does the proposed alignment method (PAPER) compare, both in performance and computational overhead, to simply adding periodic positional features (e.g., Fourier features, or one-hot encodings for the phase t mod P) to the input of a standard model? This seems like a crucial and missing baseline.\n\n2. Why was SFNN chosen as the primary base model over more widely adopted models in the time series community (e.g. DLinear, TimesNet, PatchTST)? The claim of being \"model-agnostic\" would be much stronger if tested on a more diverse and established set of architectures in the main results table. Besides, instead of presenting the results of three other base models for a specific dataset (as in Figure 5), I suggest using a single, comprehensive table. This table should show the performance of every base model (with and without PAPER) on every dataset, which would allow for a much clearer and more direct comparison.\n\n3. Could you provide a justification for using zero-padding in Section 3.2.1? Have you experimented with other padding strategies (e.g., mean-padding, replication-padding, or using a learnable padding embedding) and analyzed how they affect the model's performance? Padding with zero seems likely to introduce distribution shift.\n\n4. The assumptions in Section 4.2 are quite restrictive. In particular, Theorem 4.2 suggests that alignment increases test error under an autoregressive DGP. Given that many real-world time series can be well-approximated by autoregressive models, doesn't this theoretical result significantly weaken the case for your method? The non-autoregressive example in 4.4 feels contrived; can you provide evidence from real-world data that it truly operates in this non-autoregressive regime?\n\n5. The proposed period detection method's robustness is not thoroughly evaluated. The accuracy of P is critical to the entire method. How robust is the proposed periodicity detection method?  How does it perform in the presence of noise, trends, or multiple overlapping periodicities? What happens if it detects a slightly incorrect period? How does this error in P propagate and affect the final forecasting accuracy?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "kQ65AwVFwX", "forum": "cOTAC1cT5N", "replyto": "cOTAC1cT5N", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15151/Reviewer_jEFr"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15151/Reviewer_jEFr"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15151/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761652493712, "cdate": 1761652493712, "tmdate": 1762925465724, "mdate": 1762925465724, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces PAPER (Periodicity Alignment), a framework that explicitly leverages periodic structures in long time-series prediction by first detecting periodicity and then aligning sequences accordingly.
