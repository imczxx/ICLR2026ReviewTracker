Our adaptive exclusion mechanism removes the need for predefined attacker counts, and its server-side linear computational complexity of $O(nd)$ ensures its scalability and practical significance, while existing methods remain superlinear in complexity. We prove theoretically and experimentally verify faster convergence and computational efficiency on several benchmark datasets of various modalities, including non-iid scenarios and different model architectures such as CNNs and LLMs, and show that our method maintains effectiveness while boosting convergence. Our approach is generalizable across diverse task domains and aggregation methods, and is easily implementable in practice.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["federated learning", "security", "convergence", "anomaly detection"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f814f05b263be4f361844f47cfc4fe77c6fe20c9.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes **PID-MADE**, a history-aware anomaly detection and exclusion rule for federated learning (FL).
