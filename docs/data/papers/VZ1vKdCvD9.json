Most data-driven approaches for this rely on large language models (LLMs) and mimic fast, intuitive System 1 thinking. In contrast, clinicians typically reason about potential diagnoses and use that to guide the dialog.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we propose ProbMedTOD, a TOD system that combines the conversational abilities of LLMs with the probabilistic reasoning of a disease-symptom Bayesian Network (BayesNet). At each turn, ProbMedTOD extracts information from patient utterances, updates its diagnostic hypothesis over a set of potential principal diagnoses via Bayesian inference, and generates the next question using a supervised policy LLM trained on dialogue data.\nThe BayesNet structure is programmatically constructed from clinical documents, while its parameters are inferred automatically via self-consistent prompting of an LLM, removing the need for expert-labeled data.\n\nWe develop a patient simulator that uses patient profiles informed by the dialogue context and engages in realistic end-to-end interactions with the system, enabling evaluation of dialogue-level success. ProbMedTOD significantly outperforms LLM and retrieval-based baseline in next-question prediction and dialogue-level success, obtaining ~20 pt MRR improvement in simulation experiments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Medical Dialogue System", "Bayesian Inference", "Probabilistic Reasoning", "Task-Oriented Dialogue System"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c806c2a99f90139d7e69ba3313b397c602d2de3e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/82a5092753526fe4135675cc8e1cacc36af27761.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes ProbMedTOD, a task-oriented medical dialogue system that combines an explicit disease-symptom Bayesian Network with an LLM-based policy.

BayesNet parameters, namely disease priors and symptom likelihoods, are estimated directly by an LLM via self-consistency prompting, which avoids reliance on patient-level data. For evaluation, the authors build a patient simulator that constructs profiles from MediTOD and MIMIC-IV, then uses an LLM to generate faithful patient responses for multi-turn interactions. Relative to supervised LLM baselines and a retrieval-augmented baseline, ProbMedTOD shows modest gains on turn-level Medical-F1 and Precision@K and larger gains on dialogue-level diagnostic ranking measured by MRR and Hit@K.
