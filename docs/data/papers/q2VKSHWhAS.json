To tackle data shortage and heterogeneity across multiple users, federated prompt personalization (FPP) has received significant attention as an effective method to harmonize customized performance and pre-trained model generalization capability. However, user-specific prompts, as valuable intellectual assets, face increasing privacy risks such as prompt stealing attacks. Though conventional privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy can mitigate these risks by adding noise masks to prompt parameters, they can incur severe performance degradation due to prompt sensitivity. In this work, we propose SecFPP, a secure federated prompt personalization protocol, that reconciles the trade-off among model generalization, local personalization, and privacy preservation. SecFPP delivers state-of-the-art performance under severe data heterogeneity, while using secure multiparty computation primitives to provide formal privacy guarantees without utility loss. The proposed protocol employs a decoupled prompt adaptation strategy by decomposing user prompts into federated and local components, thereby improving personalization performance in multi-granular unbalanced data distributions. We develop a privacy-preserving adaptive clustering algorithm for federated prompts to capture different domains or dataset heterogeneity while using the local prompts to adapt downstream tasks and capture the class heterogeneity. We validate the security of SecFPP theoretically and empirically. Extensive experiments comparing SecFPP with non-private and privacy-preserving baselines demonstrate its superior personalization accuracy. Moreover, comparisons with existing privacy-preserving frameworks highlight that SecFPP significantly improves the privacy-performance trade-off in FPP, simultaneously delivering strongest privacy guarantees and enhanced personalization.", "tldr": "This paper presents a novel protocol to achieve federated prompt personalization for VLMs with provable privacy guarantees and state-of-the-art performance under severe data heterogeneity.", "keywords": ["Prompt Personalization", "Federated Learning", "Privacy Protection"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ff1d150603bf383d51b000e5716be430b16ad147.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4e1d3c38edc4a03e2720395306695a7b5a5c274e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes SecFPP, a federated prompt personalization framework that provide formal privacy.

What are $\\nabla_{G,i} \\mathcal{L}$ and $\\nabla_{L,i} \\mathcal{L}$ and how are they computed? They are not introduced anywhere in the paper. Step 7 is very confusing and incomplete. What exactly does $PCA(.)$ compute? How is $P_i^{(t+1)}$ computed? It seems that $P_i^{(t+1)}$ is not known until step 12.\n\n* The author points out the existing challenge of gradient-based privacy attacks in federated learning setting (line 150), however, the proposed method does not prevent such attacks. The shared components, i.e. personalized prompt and federated gradients, may have information about the gradient of the local components. This is a serious gradient leakage which is susceptible to gradient-based attacks.\n\n* I disagree with the author's claim that the proposed method has negligible overheads (line 90). There are lots of communication overheads in SecFPP compared to a standard federated learning framework and other FPP baselines. First, users share both the personalized prompt $\\bar{P_i}$ (Algorithm 1 step 9) and the federated gradients (Algorithm 1 step 10) to the server, while previous FPP baselines only need to share the latter. Second, the secure aggregation protocol requires user-to-user in addition to user-to-server communication as shown in Algorithm 2, while other FPP methods only require user-to-server communication. Furthermore, the protocol is applied twice to the personalized prompt and the federated gradients, adding extra overheads.\n\n* While dimension reduction may reduce some communication overhead, per-round SVD computation is expensive. A detailed communication-computation cost tradeoff should be discussed to justify if the use of truncated SVD brings any benefit."}, "questions": {"value": "* What does $F(.)$ compute mathematically?

How can one interpret the personalization and generalization based on the results, especially for single datasets (class heterogeneity)?\n\n* What are the communication and computation overheads of the proposed method compared to other baselines? It would be helpful if the author can show the overhead comparison theoretically and empirically.\n\n* Does SecFPP provide equivalent privacy guarantee to DP-FPL?

The DP method provides quantifiable privacy guarantees for the training data over the entire training process. While SecFPP gives a statistical measure of the privacy of the training data in SecPC, this is not as strong a guarantee as DP. More importantly, SecFPP leaks information about the training data though the aggregated gradient of the global prompts in line 10 of Algorithm 1. The secure aggregation does protect the inputs to the aggregate, but the aggregated value is still a privacy leak. This is a major issue as the method fails at its main claim of privacy.\n- Even if SecFPP does not protect privacy, the experiment results indicate it may still be of value for personalized prompt learning. The results do not really give a good indication of the balance between personalization and generalization. It would be helpful to break up the results in the multi-domain setting to differentiate performance on own domain vs. other domain.\n- Minor: there appears to be something wrong with the citations that are not used inline in sentences. \n- Minor: For Table 1, described in Section 2.2, please include the dataset details."}, "questions": {"value": "- What is the intuition behind the benefit of the clustering.
