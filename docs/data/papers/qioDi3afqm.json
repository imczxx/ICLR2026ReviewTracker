In this paper, we introduce EMAC+, an Embodied Multimodal Agent that collaboratively integrates LLM and VLM via a bidirectional training paradigm. Unlike existing methods, EMAC+ dynamically refines high-level textual plans generated by an LLM using real-time feedback from a VLM executing low-level visual control tasks. We address critical limitations of previous models by enabling the LLM to internalize visual environment dynamics directly through interactive experience, rather than relying solely on static symbolic mappings. Extensive experimental evaluations on ALFWorld and RT-1 benchmarks demonstrate that EMAC+ achieves superior task performance, robustness against noisy observations, and efficient learning. We also conduct thorough ablation studies and provide detailed analyses of success and failure cases.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multi-modal agent", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area":
