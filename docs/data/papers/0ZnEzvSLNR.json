This paper explores how LLMs can allocate computational tasks among agent networks, considering factors such as cost, efficiency, and performance. We address key questions, including the effectiveness of LLMs as orchestrators and planners, comparing their effectiveness in task assignment and coordination. Our experiments show that LLMs can achieve high validity and accuracy in resource allocation tasks. We find that the planner method outperforms the orchestrator method in handling concurrent actions, resulting in improved efficiency and better utilization of agents. Furthermore, we show that providing explicit information about worker capabilities improves the allocation strategies of planners, particularly when dealing with suboptimal workers.", "tldr": "This paper explores how LLMs optimize task allocation in multi-agent systems, evaluating their role as orchestrators and planners, and assessing task assignment based on cost and agent capabilities.", "keywords": ["Multi-Agent Systems", "Large Language Models", "Task Allocation"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/87540cb753853939ba423fab3dd789b5c1716e75.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/cf45a42097ca850f0eb063bbdc20cecdd6245ccc.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work tackles a key question for multi-agent AI systems: what's the best way to coordinate a team of LLM agents? The authors pit two strategies against each other in a simulated kitchen environment: a centralized 'Orchestrator' that dictates every agent's exact move, and a semi-decentralized 'Planner' that provides a high-level strategy, leaving individual agents to work out the details. The experiments reveal a crucial trade-off: while the Planner approach is far more cost-efficient (more tasks completed per dollar), the micro-managing Orchestrator consistently achieves higher absolute performance, completing more tasks overall.

As LLMs evolve into autonomous agents, exploring self-resource allocation is pertinent. The work builds on foundational ideas (for example Minsky's Society of Mind) and could inspire further studies on the applications.\n\n2. The distinction between Individual, Orchestrator, and Planner methods in Experiment 2 provides a novel lens for analyzing centralized vs. decentralized coordination in LLM systems. The use of CuisineWorld as a dynamic benchmark is appropriate, and the efficiency metric (orders completed per dollar) offers a practical way to quantify cost-performance trade-offs, potentially influencing real-world deployments where computational costs are a barrier.\n\n3. The findings on Planner efficiency and capability awareness may inform scalable multi-agent designs."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The experiment sets up a \"strawman\" comparison by evaluating out-of-the-box ability of LLM against the Hungarian Algorithm, a polynomial-time optimal solver for assignment problems. It is well-known that LLMs, especially without COT, perform poorly on strict combinatorial optimization tasks. The results \"Figure 4 showing <20% accuracy even for GPT-4o\" lead to misleading conclusions, suggesting the need for \"more efficient alternatives\" without truly assessing LLMs as orchestrators. A more meaningful setup would evaluate LLMs' ability to use tools like the Hungarian Algorithm for planning, rather than replacing it as a solver. Thus, Experiment 1 fails to support the paper's core claims.\n\n2. The authors claim the Planner method \"outperforms\" the Orchestrator in handling concurrent actions, emphasizing improved efficiency. However, this conflates efficiency (orders per cost) with absolute performance (total orders completed). Table 2 data reveals the opposite: Orchestrators (Claude-3.7 with 98 orders for 6 agents) often achieve higher absolute performance than Planners (Claude-3.7 + Llama-70B with 77 orders). The Planner's efficiency gains come at the expense of task completion, representing a performance-cost trade-off rather than outright superiority. The abstract and conclusions misleadingly equate \"higher efficiency\" with \"better,\" ignoring this trade-off and potentially misguiding readers.\n\n3. The comparison between \"On-the-fly Allocation\" (where the planner must dynamically infer worker capabilities) and \"Informed Allocation\" (explicit capability hints) is poorly defined. The paper does not explain the inference mechanism—e.g., whether the planner observes failures, uses feedback loops, or has any basis for dynamic learning. Without such details, the finding that Informed Allocation performs better is obvious and unsurprising.
