However, maintaining a large collection of task vectors introduces scalability challenges in both storage and computation. We propose Task Vector Bases, a framework compressing $T$ task vectors into $M < T$ basis vectors while preserving the functionality of task arithmetic. By representing each task vector as a structured linear combination of basis atoms, our approach supports standard operations such as addition, negation, as well as more advanced arithmetic ones. The framework is orthogonal to other efficiency-oriented improvements in task arithmetic and can be used in combination with them. We provide theoretical analysis showing that basis compression retains addition generalization guarantees and enables principled unlearning, with error bounds depending on reconstruction quality. Empirically, our proposed basis construction methods consistently outperform heuristic basis construction baselines and, in some cases, even surpass the performance of full task vector collections across diverse downstream applications while reducing storage and computational requirements.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["task arithmetic", "model compression"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c77c8f5644e600fa2508090a634578c0f6e76eab.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles the challenge of linearly increasing memory and merging costs in task arithmetic as the number of task vectors grows. To overcome this, the authors introduce a compression framework that reduces T task vectors into M task vector bases, while preserving the functional integrity of task arithmetic. The method leverages an autoencoder equipped with softmax activation to ensure that each base vector can be expressed as a convex combination of the original task vectors. Theoretically, the authors prove that arithmetic operations using the compressed vectors retain performance guarantees---up to a constant factor---across addition consistency, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and forgetting resilience. Empirically, the proposed approach achieves task arithmetic performance that matches or exceeds that of random selection and PCA-based compression on a range of vision and NLP tasks."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- Practical relevance of the problem formulation: Storing a full set of task vectors for each task in large-scale models is both memory-intensive and computationally expensive during merging. The desire to perform task arithmetic across multiple tasks with a minimal set of vectors reflects a realistic and pressing need in practical deployment settings. The authors' focus on this challenge is timely and well-motivated.\n\n- Limitations of PCA-based compression and proposed remedy: The paper highlights that conventional PCA compression yields task vector bases that are not expressible as non-negative linear combinations of the original task vectors, thereby breaking compatibility with standard task addition. To address this, the authors propose a solution that preserves compositional compatibility."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Why autoencoders?: While the authors rightly note that PCA-based compression does not yield basis vectors that can be expressed as non-negative linear combinations of task vectors, the paper does not clarify why alternative dimensionality reduction techniques with inherent non-negativity constraints were not explored. For example, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a well-established method that decomposes a non-negative matrix into a product of non-negative basis and coefficient matrices. Applied to the task vector matrix $T$, one could decompose $T$ into $T^+$  (where negative entries of $T$ are set to zero) and $T^-$ (where non-negative entries are set to zero) such that $T = T^+ + T^-$, and then apply NMF separately to $T^+$ and $-T^-$. This would enable reconstruction via non-negative combinations, preserving compatibility with conventional task addition. Without a clear justification for favoring autoencoders over such interpretable and constraint-aligned methods, the choice of architecture appears insufficiently motivated.\n- Reconstruction in task negation: If my understanding is correct, the authors suggest that task negation is not performed directly in the compressed basis space, but instead involves reconstructing the full set of T task vectors prior to executing the forgetting operation. If such reconstruction is deemed acceptable in the context of negation, it raises a key question: why isn’t the same reconstruction strategy employed for task addition? In fact, if reconstruction is permitted, one could simply store PCA-compressed task vectors and reconstruct them at merge time to apply conventional task arithmetic techniques. The paper does not address this inconsistency, leaving a significant conceptual gap in the proposed framework.\n- Experimental configuration of M: In the experiments, the number of compressed bases M is set as a fixed proportion (e.g., 50% or 25%) of the total number of task vectors T. However, in realistic applications where computational and storage resources are limited, it is far more common for M to be fixed independently of T. This makes the experimental design less reflective of practical deployment conditions. Providing results under a fixed M setting regardless of T would offer a more robust and practically relevant evaluation. Demonstrating effectiveness under such constraints would significantly strengthen the credibility of the proposed method.\n- Competition with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT): While task arithmetic traditionally involves full-parameter task vectors, recent advances increasingly leverage PEFT methods such as LoRA[1], which offer significant improvements in memory efficiency and merging cost. These approaches may not only be more scalable than full-parameter models but could also outperform the proposed base-compression strategy in both efficiency and task performance. Despite this, the paper lacks a comprehensive comparison between the proposed method and PEFT-based alternatives in terms of memory footprint, merging complexity, and empirical performance.\n\n[1] Zhang, Jinghan, Junteng Liu, and Junxian He. \"Composing parameter-efficient modules with arithmetic operation.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2023): 12589-12610."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "6DGXUaaC5w", "forum": "tcuaVzKm3e", "replyto": "tcuaVzKm3e", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9441/Reviewer_U1TV"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9441/Reviewer_U1TV"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9441/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760667908686, "cdate": 1760667908686, "tmdate": 1762921040375, "mdate": 1762921040375, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper advances Task Arithmetic (Ilharco et al., 2023) by proposing an orthogonal framework aimed at reducing storage and computational costs of task vectors.

However, in light of recent advances in Task Arithmetic, the following points require some attention:\n\n**W1.**\n\n[1,2,3,4] prove and support the idea that linearization around the pre-trained parameters is the key enabler of proper Task Arithmetic. The intuition is that, when task vectors implement functions that are linear w.r.t. the weights of the model, the composed model will act as a linear combination of orthogonal functions (thus, allowing for minimal interference across task vectors eg. see Fig. 2 of [4] or Fig. 3 of [3]).\n\nBeing these vectors orthogonal by design (when tasks are statistically different), they should already form a basis by themselves, without any need for the proposed methodology: compressing linearized task vectors, intuitively, simply reduces to discarding some task vectors that, possibly due to tasks being very similar (in a statistical sense), will approximately point in the same direction in parameter space.\n\nIn essence, it could be interesting to observe what happens when compressing task vectors obtained from linearized fine-tuning [1].\n\n-------------------\n\n**W2.**\n\nI'm finding Section 3.2.3 weakly linked to the rest of the paper: up until the end of Section 3.2.1 the narrative focuses on basis arithmetic, reconstruction errors of your framework etc. Then, abruptly the paper presents some results regarding multi-task/OOD loss bounds. I'd suggest the authors to strengthen the connection with the previous section and why these bounds matter.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not even sure the theorems/bounds of this section are needed for the narrative of your paper, as they partially overlap with already established literature which proves slightly stronger results (eg. see [5], which also characterizes the second-order term of the Taylor expansion, or [6] which characterizes task addition, negation and OOD generalization with non-linear transformers under the light of task alignment).

Questionable practical motivation for very large T. A major stated goal is reducing storage overhead for many task vectors. Yet in practice, the quality of simple task-vector merging typically degrades rapidly as T grows; much prior work evaluates in the ~8–20 range. If real deployments rarely maintain very large libraries of task vectors due to performance collapse, the storage-savings motivation is less compelling without concrete use cases.\n2. Limited baselines. The main experiments compare against only three Task-Vector variants. Recent, stronger baselines—e.g., Parameter Competition Balancing for Model Merging [1], Task Arithmetic in the Tangent Space [2], and Beyond Task Vectors: Selective Task Arithmetic [3]—report substantially better results than the original Task Vector. Omitting them weakens the empirical claim.\n3. Architecture sensitivity is unclear. The method relies on a softmax-activated linear autoencoder to form bases. There is no ablation on the autoencoder design (e.g., softmax vs. simplex constraints via projection, temperature, coefficient sparsity, nonlinearity), so robustness to architectural choices is unknown.\n4. Compute/storage savings not quantified. The paper lacks concrete measurements of wall-clock speed, memory footprint, and I/O savings attributable to compression. Without numbers (for, say, T=100 and T=1000), it is difficult to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the approach.\n5. Non-trivial performance loss on many datasets. In several cases, the compressed basis representation trails the original Task Vector approach. The paper should analyze whether the accuracy drop is acceptable relative to storage/computation gains, ideally with a Pareto plot and quantified trade-offs.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Parameter Competition Balancing for Model Merging.\n[2] Task Arithmetic in the Tangent Space: Improved Editing of Pre-Trained Models.\n[3] Beyond Task Vectors: Selective Task Arithmetic Based on Importance Metrics."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
