However, existing methods rely solely on noise learning or flow matching to implicitly model the relationship between latent representations and multimodal features, making it difficult to fully capture their semantic associations and resulting in suboptimal conditional consistency in the generated outputs. To overcome this limitation, we propose EC\\textsuperscript{2}Face, a novel facial generation method based on an explicit conditional consistency diffusion framework. Our approach introduces a temporally modulated conditional consistency guidance mechanism in the pixel space, explicitly driving precise semantic alignment between the latent representations and multimodal conditions. In addition, to address the poor response to long-tailed attributes in mask conditions, we design a long-tail adaptive learning strategy. It dynamically assigns differentiated weights to spatial locations through gradient reweighting, enhancing the model's ability to perceive rare attributes and effectively mitigating model bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EC\\textsuperscript{2}Face significantly outperforms other competing methods across most evaluation metrics, particularly exhibiting an improvement of over 9.0\\% in mask accuracy for regions with rare attributes.", "tldr": "We present a new multimodal facial generation method with explicit consistency guidance, and introduce a long-tail adaptive strategy that boosts the diffusion model's sensitivity to rare facial attributes through gradient reweighting", "keywords": ["diffusion transformer", "multimodal facial generation", "condition consistency", "long-tail adaptive learning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9920c410988f00bfc774d26e2986e760e9e9a0ee.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7486131121ad265d25130c1ea00e8f27a3997e83.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces EC2Face, is a facial generation approach built on explicitly conditioning an image diffusion model on face semantic maps.

Explicit conditional consistency guidance in pixel space.

Considering the generated image reversed from noisy latent can be unreliable, authors also present a timestep-dependent strategy to weight the losses adaptively.\n\n2.

The benefit brought by the Explicit conditional consistency guidance looks limited.\n\n2. It is well known at the early stage of denoising, the latent is noisy and can produce unreliable estimated $z_0$. The proposed Temporal Dynamic Modulation dynamically assign loss weight according to the time steps. In other words, it compromises the gradients at the early stage by assigning a smaller weight, making it fail to fully utilize the supervision signal. In contrast, recent diffusion-based works like PuLID[1] presents a way to propagate the gradients through the whole denoising trajectory and they claim to utilize the supervision better. I would encourage the authors to provide a discussion about this design. \n\n3. The evaluation looks limited. During evaluation, the input shares the similar distribution with the training data. In qualitative results, most of information in the text prompts are covered by the human mask.
