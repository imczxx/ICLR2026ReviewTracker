Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models, standard AI evaluators, predominantly trained on perspective image-text pairs, face an open question regarding their understanding of the unique characteristics of 360-degree panoramic image-text pairs. This paper addresses this gap by first introducing two concepts: \\emph{360-degree textual semantics}, semantic information conveyed by explicit format identifiers, and \\emph{360-degree visual semantics}, invariant semantics under horizontal circular shifts. To probe CLIP's comprehension of these semantics, we then propose novel evaluation methodologies using keyword manipulation and horizontal circular shifts of varying magnitudes. Rigorous statistical analyses across popular CLIP configurations reveal that: (1) CLIP models effectively leverage explicit textual identifiers, demonstrating an understanding of 360-degree textual semantics; and (2) CLIP models fail to robustly preserve semantic alignment under horizontal circular shifts, indicating limited comprehension of 360-degree visual semantics. To address this limitation, we propose a LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that explicitly instills invariance to circular shifts. Our fine-tuned models exhibit improved comprehension of 360-degree visual semantics, though with a slight degradation in original semantic evaluation performance, highlighting a fundamental trade-off in adapting CLIP to 360-degree panoramic images.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["CLIP", "360-degree panorama", "360-degree textual semantics", "360-degree visual semantics", "evaluation"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/015b62736b9ca49b4701a387041dd6d74f4a7f6e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/74512135aee78acaad4c15fa3d4286070a66bf40.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper's title is \"probing CLIP's comprehension of 350-degree textual and visual semantics\". The paper presents several themes, including 360-dgeree panoramic image generation (040), accurate evaluation of semantic alignment between generated 360-degree panoramic images (Line 050), and CLIP models' comprehension ability in 360-degree panoramic image-text pairs (Line 072). These themes make the paper less focused. Nevertheless, the paper studies CLIP models in term of their ability to understand panoramic images. It adopts various statistical tools to investigate this matter. It horizontally shifts panoramic images and measures how consistent CLIP models output scores.

It adopts LoRA to adapt the visual encoder, enhancing this robustness."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "Below are notable strengths of this paper.\n\n- The variety of statistical tools are interesting.\n- Technical design choices are generally well thought-out, e.g., the null hypotheses, dataset construction, etc.\n- Using LoRA to empower CLIP models' robustness to horizontal-shift panorama is interesting."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Below are notable weaknesses of this paper.\n\n- The focus of this paper is not clear. Line 011 and the first paragraph of Introduction leave an impression that this paper focuses on generating 360-degree panoramic images. However, Line 049 motivates evaluating semantic alignments between generated 360-degree panoramic images, leaving an impression that the work focuses on developing methods to evaluate generative models' performance in terms of semantic alignments of their generated images. Quite confusingly, Line 051 and Line 072 state that the the work particularly focuses on CLIP models and studies their understanding ability of panoramic images.\n\n- As the paper is motivated for accurate evaluation of semantic alignment between generated 360-degree panoramic images, it is not convincing to only focus on CLIP (Line 073). Given the existing of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), it is natural to ask whether these MLLMs can serve as the evaluator. \n\n- Line 064 states \"raises questions about their applicability to evaluating 360-degree panoramic image-text pairs, which present fundamentally different characteristics\". Did the authors justify that 360-degree panoramic image-text pairs \"present fundamentally different characteristics\" from CLIP's pretraining data? Do the CLIP's pretraining data contain panoramic images? This is an important point, as the analysis of CLIP's understanding ability on panoramic images can be greatly determined by whether the CLIP's pretraining dataset contains panoramic images and the amounts / portion of such images\n\n- Line 035 and 068 mention \"360x180\". What does 180 mean?\n\n- In Equation (1), it is unclear why multiplying the constant 100. It is unclear either why using a max operation. The paper does not explain these\n\n- Table 1 presents some statistical testing results but does not explain what data are used in the test. Specifically, it states that it uses \"two paired image-text datasets (360_real and 360_syn) but does not explain how they are constructed and what data they contain. (Okay, the paper talks about them in later text, Section 4.1. But the current presentation causes confusions, i.e., using the acronyms without defining them.)\n\n- It is questionable whether the current design of beta (Line 240) is a good choice. It is based on the difference of CLIP scores between images and their left-right flips. To align with horizontal shifts in the study of 360-degree visual semantic, isn't it a better choice to properly horizontally shift images to derive beta?\n\n- The paper uses LoRA to adapt CLIP models for gaining a robust understanding of understanding of 360-degree visual semantics. But the paper does not explore how it helps evaluate generated panoramic images, which is the theme of the paper (Line 049)."}, "questions": {"value": "The reviewer asks the authors to address each point in weaknesses listed above and does not repeat them in this Questions box."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "2kAehkkxU4", "forum": "iQLZChxwDu", "replyto": "iQLZChxwDu", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5668/Reviewer_3QfH"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5668/Reviewer_3QfH"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5668/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761537931522, "cdate": 1761537931522, "tmdate": 1762918184309, "mdate": 1762918184309, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"title": {"value": "Response to all Reviewers"}, "comment": {"value": "We would like to thank all reviewers for their valuable feedback and constructive suggestions.
