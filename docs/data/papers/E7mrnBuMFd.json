Capturing chirality in machine learning models remains challenging due to the geometric complexity of stereochemical relationships and the limitations of traditional molecular representations that often lack explicit stereochemical encoding. Existing approaches to chiral molecular representation primarily focus on central chirality, relying on handcrafted stereochemical tags or limited 3D encodings, and thus fail to generalize to more complex forms, such as axial chirality. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{ChiDeK} (\\textbf{Chi}ral \\textbf{De}terminant \\textbf{K}ernels), a framework that systematically integrates stereogenic information into molecular representation learning. We propose the chiral determinant kernel to encode the SE(3)-invariant chirality matrix and employ cross-attention to integrate stereochemical information from local chiral centers into the global molecular representation. This design enables explicit modeling of chiral-related features within a unified architecture. To support the evaluation of axial chirality, we construct a new benchmark for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) prediction. To the best of our knowledge, ChiDeK is the first architecture capable of jointly encoding central and axial chirality. Across three tasks, including R/S configuration classification, enantiomer ranking, and ECD spectrum prediction, ChiDeK achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, most notably yielding over 18\\% higher accuracy on axially chiral molecules.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["chirality", "molecular representation learning", "axial chirality"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6f0b3bbfdb5568693466d3640a88cc3d7d51bdc8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/eebda45cc09a814d89782aa87f6249a55f6ec273.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes ChiDeK, a novel framework that explicitly models molecular chirality using chiral determinant kernels and a chiral-aware cross-attention transformer to capture stereochemical interactions.

Although acquiring chiral information of molecules is important, using a model to distinguish R/S configurations of point and axial chirality appears to be of limited practical significance. Well-established chemical rules, such as those implemented in RDKit, already exist for such differentiation. While the authors generate discriminative features for enantiomers via the chirality matrix and deep learning—which can indeed distinguish R/S configurations—this should not be the ultimate goal. The application of these chirality-related features should target more valuable downstream tasks, such as predicting enantioselectivity in asymmetric catalytic reactions or binding affinity between chiral drug molecules and protein targets.\n2. This work can largely be viewed as an extension of the ChIRo study, expanding its scope from point chirality to axial chirality. However, after demonstrating that ChIRo could generate discriminative features for enantiomers, its authors further conducted a practically meaningful downstream application: ranking enantiomers by docking scores in an enantiosensitive protein pocket. In contrast, the present authors only replicated similar benchmark tests on point chiral data and did not perform valuable downstream application experiments on the axially chiral molecules emphasized in this work.\n3. The authors claim that this is the first architecture capable of jointly encoding central and axial chirality. In reality, existing methods such as ChiralFinder and SPMS, which are mentioned in the paper, can also extract features that distinguish point and axial chirality. Moreover, the authors' model itself utilizes the chirality matrix generated by ChiralFinder. To ensure a rigorous performance comparison, the authors should benchmark their model against features derived from ChiralFinder and SPMS on the same set of tasks.\n4. The core chiral information in this work is derived from ChiralFinder, which appears crucial to ChiDeK's ability to distinguish chirality. As a result, the unique contribution of ChiDeK itself to the task of axial chirality discrimination remains unclear.\n5. According to the results in Table 1 for point chiral molecules across R/S classification, enantiomer ranking, and ECD prediction tasks, the model does not show a significant advantage in point chirality-related predictions. In particular, the accuracy for ECD sign prediction is only 53.3%, which—assuming a 1:1 positive-to-negative sample ratio—is barely better than random guessing (50%).\n6.
