However, certain cardiac conditions (e.g. Brugada syndrome) require additional, non-standard viewpoints to reveal diagnostically critical patterns that may be absent in standard leads. To systematically overcome this limitation, Nef-Net was recently introduced to reconstruct a continuous electrocardiac field, enabling virtual observation of ECG signals from arbitrary views (termed Electrocardio Panorama).  Despite its promise, Nef-Net operates under idealized assumptions and faces in-the-wild challenges, such as long-duration ECG modeling, robustness to device-specific signal artifacts, and suboptimal lead placement calibration.\nThis paper presents Nef-Net+, an enhanced framework for realistic panoramic ECG synthesis that supports arbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view, generalizes across ECG devices, and compensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode placement. These capabilities are enabled by a newly designed model architecture that performs direct view transformation, incorporating a workflow comprising offline pretraining, device calibration tuning steps as well as an on-the-fly calibration step for patient-specific adaptation. To rigorously evaluate panoramic ECG synthesis, we construct a new Electrocardio Panorama benchmark, called Panobench, comprising 9369 recordings with 48-view per subject, capturing the full spatial variability of cardiac electrical activity. Experimental results show that Nef-Net+ delivers substantial improvements over Nef-Net, yielding an increase of around 6 dB in PSNR in real-world setting.", "tldr": "An enhanced variant of Nef-Net to

Limited Validation of Geometry-Aware Attention: While the MGAA and GeoVT modules are claimed to model inter-lead angular relationships, the paper lacks quantitative evidence that these mechanisms genuinely capture geometric or biophysical correspondence. \nWhile the geometry-aware mechanism is formally defined and integrated into the architecture, the paper does not present attention-weight visualizations nor any correlation analysis between learned attention weights and actual spatial distances or electric potential gradients.\n\n- Lack of Clinical Interpretability: The performance evaluation relies heavily on signal reconstruction metrics, which do not directly reflect diagnostic or physiological relevance. \nThe absence of task-oriented evaluation metrics limits the interpretability and translational value of the proposed framework in clinical contexts.\n\n- Computational Efficiency and Deployment Feasibility: Although the architecture simplifies the overall transformation pipeline, the paper does not quantify the practical cost of on-the-fly calibration, which requires per-examination adaptation. \nThe manuscript does not report time-to-adapt (wall-clock latency from raw input to an adapted model), compute/memory budget for the calibration step on realistic hardware, or convergence stability under streaming/telemetry conditions. \nThis omission makes it difficult to assess whether the per-patient adaptation loop can meet real-time throughput constraints in clinical workflows and whether maintaining adapted parameters across encounters is feasible on resource-constrained medical devices.\n\n- Limited Accessibility of the Panobench Dataset: While the appendix provides detailed descriptions of the Panobench dataset and its construction process, the dataset itself is not publicly available at the time of writing. \nGiven that Panobench serves as a central contribution and evaluation benchmark, the lack of open access limits reproducibility and independent verification of the reported results (the paper only states that code and data “will also be released publicly”)."}, "questions": {"value": "It would be helpful to address the
