We introduce FORMCRAFT, a structure-and relation-centric benchmark for form intelligence in vision–language models (VLMs). Unlike OCR or DocVQA-centric evaluations, FORMCRAFT operationalizes a three-level taxonomy: Content Modality (L1), Layout Structure (L2), and Semantic Relation (L3), into targeted tasks and structure-aware metrics. On real-world forms with professional annotation, we find that recognition is relatively strong while hierarchical reconstruction and cross-field consistency remain challenging across popular open-source and proprietary models. Upon paper acceptance, we will release the dataset and annotation schema to standardize future research.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Form Understanding", "Benchmark", "Multi-modal Large Language Model"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dfecd3246c47d6eb163ffb67f3bb4e50fcb6160d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a new framework for the evaluation of form understanding.

The authors claim that they aim at overcoming the limitations of evaluations based on ocr and vqa, but some of their metrics are based on ocr (for content) and vqa (for semantic relations) metrics, contradicting their initial claim. \n- I think that the proposed three-level evaluation framework is not much useful. The final goal of form understanding is being able to extract all relevant information including relations among the different fields. For that, a VQA-based evaluation as proposed in section 4.4 should be enough. Answering those types of questions already imply being able to recognize content and interpret layout structure, which will be implicitly evaluated. Diversifying the evaluation with so many metrics is a distraction from the ultimate goal of evaluating form understanding. \n- The work does not contain any technical contribution that advances form understanding. Only SoA VLMs are evaluated without proposing any specific new baseline. \n- There are some aspects of the definitions and terminology that, in my opinion, are not relevant or well defined. For instance, I do not understand why modality subtype is relevant, we should be able to recognize any content independently of the format (machine-printed, handwritten). Also, I do not understand how in a document form a checkbox can enable/disable a table field (definition of semantic linkage), ..."}, "questions": {"value": "- Concerning the metrics, why BLEU is used as an additional metric for evaluating content recognition? Why is not enough with CER and WER? The same for visual modality? What is evaluating visual modality? Why are metrics such as CER, WER and BLEU used to evaluate recognition of visual content?\n- It is not clear what is the expected output of the evaluated models for the different tasks. For instance, for recognition is it just a sequence of the text in the form? How is it compared this output with the annotation? For the layout, which is the expected output? A layout tree? In which format? Maybe it would be helpful to provide some example of the prompts used as input to the VLMs to better illustrate how the VLMs operate and what is the expected output in each task."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "yh7ztdOMpV", "forum": "ajtZbe9M6E", "replyto": "ajtZbe9M6E", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9494/Reviewer_Ucby"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9494/Reviewer_Ucby"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9494/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761691531780, "cdate": 1761691531780, "tmdate": 1762921072839, "mdate": 1762921072839, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces FormCraft, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the form intelligence of VLMs by moving beyond the limitations of simple OCR and VQA tasks.
