Current methods for this task operate under a model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves, rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, \\textsc{Scales++}, where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark samples. Empirically, we show \\textsc{Scales++} reduces the upfront selection cost by over 18$\\times$ while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores with a 2.9\\% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more interpretable benchmarking.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["LLM evaluation", "efficient benchmarking"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/20c27a0c6cabf3f3fd0093a48e37e9398284c29b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new method, Scales++, to predict benchmark performance, based on evaluating LLMs on a limited number of items.

The approach basically ensembles AnchorPoints, TinyBenchmarks, and GeneralScale. AnchorPoints already evaluated an embedding-based baseline (see \"Pretrained\" in Table 2). This paper builds on that idea by replacing pretrained embeddings with GPT-4o annotations (General Scales). Following TinyBenchmarks, it also uses a weighted average between two estimators.\n- The proposed method does not necessarily solve the generalization problem. Previous approaches can indeed fail to transfer when behavior learned from one model family does not generalize to another. Similarly, the proposed approach relies on GPT-4o to annotate the 16 dimensions, and those annotations may also fail to generalize across different model families. The results in Table 2 and 3 also don't support the better generalization of the proposed method. \n-  The IRT implementation differs from the original TinyBenchmarks paper. TinyBenchmarks Section 3.2 states that data points are clustered by the scores of existing LLMs. This paper, however, implements IRT by clustering IRT parameters, as stated in line 252.\n-  The comparison is incomplete. For methods like AnchorPoints and IRT, one could reduce the number of training models instead of using 300 models; that comparison is missing.

This is inconsistent with the results in the TinyBenchmark paper, e.g., Figure 5.\n- The Random baseline error looks unusually high. How was the Random baseline implemented?
