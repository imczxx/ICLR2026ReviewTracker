However, our reproduction studies reveal a critical limitation: these approaches suffer from unacceptably high false positive rates (FPR) that undermine their practical deployment. Specifically, existing multi-bit encoding schemes like RS-Watermark achieve high true positive rates even with insertion/deletion attacks but exhibit FPR exceeding 0.90, rendering them unreliable for real-world applications. We propose a robust multi-bit text watermarking framework that addresses this reliability challenge through two key innovations: (i) block-wise error correction that embeds complete codewords within independent text segments, localizing the impact of edits and preventing cascade failures, and (ii) window-shifting detection that systematically recovers codewords despite insertion/deletion-induced misalignments. Our method verifies watermark presence by confirming recovery of the initially embedded codewords, significantly reducing false positives while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on OPT-1.3B and LLaMA-3.2-3B demonstrate substantial improvements over existing multi-bit methods. Under 10\\% synonym substitution attacks on 200-token texts, our approach achieves TPR of 0.965 with FPR of 0.02 (Precision: 0.9797), compared to RS-Watermark's TPR of 0.97 with FPR of 0.925 (Precision: 0.5132). The framework is code-agnostic, supports progressive detection from partial text, and provides theoretical guarantees for false-positive control. These results establish our method as a practical solution for reliable multi-bit watermarking in production environments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Text Watermarking", "Multi-bit Watermarking", "Large Language Models", "Block-wise Error Correction", "Window-Shifting Detection", "Insertion/Deletion Robustness", "Codeword-Presence Verification"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3838e1d474113d6ca06021ed932150ff89aa15eb.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a block-wise multi-bit watermarking framework which improves reliability over prior ECC-based methods.

Fundamental Misunderstanding of Prior Methods' Detection Protocol**\n\nThe authors claim that prior methods like Qu et al. (2025) and MPAC suffer from \"unacceptably high false positive rates\" (lines 54-57, 142-144). However, this criticism stems from a misunderstanding of how COUNT matrix-based multi-bit watermarking actually works.\n\nAs Qu et al. explicitly state in their Introduction: *\"Given a text that is suspected to be LLM-generated, the watermark extraction function can be used to identify whether the text is watermarked. Furthermore, if the watermark is identified, the user ID can be extracted from the watermark.\"*\n\nSimilarly, Yoo et al. (MPAC) describe in Section 3.3: *\"To distinguish between a watermarked text and a non-watermarked (human-written) text, we count the number of tokens assigned to the predicted message...\"*\n\n**The standard workflow is**:\n\n   1. First, use the COUNT matrix to perform zero-bit detection (is watermark present?)\n   2. Only if watermark is detected, then extract the multi-bit message\n\nThe authors' experimental comparison appears to skip the essential first step, directly applying message extraction to unwatermarked text. This fundamentally misrepresents the FPR of prior methods. A fair comparison must include the initial watermark presence detection step that these methods explicitly specify.\n\n**2. Overstated Novelty Claims**\n\nThe paper claims several innovations, but careful examination reveals significant overlap with existing work:\n\n- **\"Code-agnostic design\"** (lines 90): Yoo et al., Qu et al., and Feng et al. are all code-agnostic and compatible with different ECC schemes. This is not novel.\n- **\"Distributed codeword architecture\"** (line 159): Yoo et al., Qu et al., and Feng et al. use hash functions to distribute multi-bit messages across different tokens/segments. The token-to-segment and bit-to-G/R list mapping described here is essentially the same mechanism.\n- **\"Incremental detection\"** (lines 81-82): First, the idea of \"graduated confidence assessment\" and using multiple codeword segments already exists in prior methods employing COUNT matrices (Yoo et al., Qu et al., Feng et al.). Second, the claim \"enabling graduated confidence assessment rather than binary detection\" is confusing, as multi-bit watermarking is inherently non-binary by definition. \n- **\"Codeword assignment with key-derived mask\"** (line 224): This XOR approach appeared in prior works (Fairoze et al, Feng et al.) but lacks proper citations.\n\n**3. Insufficient Analysis of Core Design Mechanisms and Their Trade-offs**\n\nThe authors claim their method \"achieves substantially improved TPR–FPR through incremental evidence collection with explicit insertion/deletion handling\" (lines 159-193). However, the paper fails to establish a clear causal chain linking individual design components to the claimed improvements:\n\n**Potential Contradictory Effects of Core Mechanisms**:\n- **Window-shifting detection**: Intuitively, this technique should increase FPR by creating more alignment opportunities for spurious matches in non-watermarked text, even as it improves TPR by recovering misaligned codewords after insertions/deletions.\n- **Designated codeword verification**: only accepts codewords matching the initially embedded \nmessage, which should decrease both TPR and FPR.\n\nWhile designated codeword verification appears to be the core innovation, the paper lacks critical analysis of how these opposing mechanisms interact. The two techniques have contradictory effects on both metrics, yet the paper claims simultaneous improvements in TPR and dramatic FPR reduction without providing:\n\n   1. Trade-off analysis: How do these two mechanisms balance against each other? What are the optimal parameters for this balance?\n   \n   2. Ablation studies: What is the individual contribution of each component to the final performance?\n   \n   3. Computational efficiency analysis: Window-shifting requires trying multiple alignment positions. What is the computational overhead compared to prior methods?\n\nWithout such analysis, it remains unclear whether the improvements stem from the specific design innovations, parameter tuning, or other confounding factors in the experimental setup.\n\n**4. Inconsistency in Evaluation Metrics: Mixing Detection Paradigms**\nThe paper employs a problematic double standard in its evaluation framework that undermines the validity of its comparative results:\n\n- **For False Positive Rate** (Lines 357-361):\nThe paper evaluates prior methods using a binary detection criterion: any successfully decoded codeword triggers a positive detection. This is essentially 0-bit watermarking evaluation.\n\n- **For False Negative Rate** (Lines 362-365):\nThe paper switches to a multi-bit perfect matching criterion: only exact recovery of the originally embedded message counts as successful detection. This is multi-bit extraction accuracy evaluation.\n\n[1] Yoo, KiYoon, Wonhyuk Ahn, and Nojun Kwak. \"Advancing beyond identification: Multi-bit watermark for large language models.\" Proceedings of the 2024 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (Volume 1: Long Papers). 2024.\n[2] Qu, Wenjie, et al. \"Provably robust multi-bit watermarking for {AI-generated} text.\" 34th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 25). 2025.\n[3] Feng, Xiaoyan, et al. \"BiMark: Unbiased Multilayer Watermarking for Large Language Models.\" Forty-second International Conference on Machine Learning.\n[4] Fairoze, Jaiden, et al. \"Publicly-Detectable Watermarking for Language Models.\" IACR Communications in Cryptology 1.4 (2025)."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
