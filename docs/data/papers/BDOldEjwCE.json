As a result, generating pseudo–GPS trajectory data has become an active area of research. Recent diffusion-based approaches have achieved strong fidelity but remain limited in spatial scale (small urban areas), transportation-mode diversity, and efficiency (requiring numerous sampling steps). To address these challenges, we introduce TrajFlow, the first flow-matching–based generative model for GPS trajectory generation. TrajFlow leverages the flow-matching paradigm to improve robustness across multiple geospatial scales and incorporates a trajectory harmonization & reconstruction strategy to jointly address scalability, diversity, and efficiency. Using a nationwide mobile phone GPS dataset with millions of trajectories across Japan, we show that TrajFlow consistently outperforms diffusion-based and deep generative baselines at urban, metropolitan, and nationwide levels. As the first nationwide, multi-scale GPS trajectory generation model, TrajFlow demonstrates strong potential to support inter-region urban planning, traffic management, and disaster response, thereby advancing the resilience and intelligence of future mobility systems.", "tldr": "This paper proposed TrajFM, a flow-matching-based GPS trajectory generation model that overcomes scale, diversity, and efficiency limitations of diffusion approaches to enable nationwide, multi-scale, and multi-modal human mobility data generation.", "keywords": ["Flow matching", "Human Trajectory", "Generative modeling", "Human mobility"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a8e2f1139d77c1251c30106175ebb2cf2f8991bb.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces TrajFlow, a flow-matching-based generative model for synthesizing pseudo-GPS trajectories at a nationwide scale.

Although real GPS data is highly valuable, its application is hindered by privacy concerns, high costs, and access restrictions. Existing generation methods based on diffusion models have high fidelity but suffer from three major limitations: they are limited to small urban areas, lack diversity in multi-traffic patterns, and are inefficient in terms of training and inference. The TrajFlow applies the flow-matching paradigm to GPS trajectory generation. The core of the approach is to address the signal-to-noise ratio collapse problem encountered by diffusion models when scaled to large scales. It achieves this goal through a trajectory coordination and reconstruction strategy: the trajectories are first compressed using the RDP algorithm and then normalized to a uniform feature space for training. Experiments on a nationwide GPS dataset covering the entire country of Japan demonstrate that TrajFlow outperforms baselines, such as diffusion models, at city, metropolitan area, and nationwide scales, while maintaining the diversity of traffic patterns and being highly efficient."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "1.
