At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and sycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect mathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the applicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed proofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians.\nHowever, existing benchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus solely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated datasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that create ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are demonstrably false. \nTo address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of natural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025 competition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false statements and subsequently refined through expert review.\nUsing an LLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems and find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing sycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation strategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on curated sycophantic examples. These approaches substantially reduce, but do not eliminate, sycophantic behavior.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["llm", "reasoning", "math", "mathematics", "sycophancy", "hallucinations", "trustworthy"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b81d918813be90232870d044b87d1df9c340e37a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7c575fe4707ae57b342828307a5a5df76eac6be5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work finds that the LLMs are prone to hallucination and sophistry for theorem proving.

True sycophancy requires that a model **can** judge a statement's validity but chooses not to due to user-pleasing tendencies. The paper's methodology cannot differentiate:\n\n- **Phenomenon A**: Model accepts false statement because it cannot judge truth/falsity (competence deficit)\n- **Phenomenon B**: Model can judge but suppresses critical thinking to please user (alignment sycophancy)\n\nA rigorous operationalization would require:\n```\nFor proposition P and its negation ¬P:\n  Step 1: Filter to problems where model can correctly prove P\n  Step 2: Further filter to problems where model can correctly disprove ¬P\n  Step 3: Only on this filtered set, if the model still attempts to prove ¬P without questioning or refuting it, does this represent sycophancy.\n```\n\nThe paper performs no such filtering, rendering all claims about \"sycophancy as an alignment problem\" unsubstantiated.\n\n### 2. **Table 2 reveals that the measurement is fundamentally contaminated**\n\nTable 2 presents \"sycophantic behavior\" split by whether models can solve the original problem:\n- Solved problems: 21.5% (GPT-5 example)\n- Unsolved problems: 47.7% (GPT-5 example)\n- Gap: 26.2 percentage points\n\nThe existence of this table itself demonstrates the methodological failure. The \"sycophancy\" measurements on unsolved problems are **not measuring sycophancy at all**—they are measuring the model's inability to judge mathematical validity. This is pure competence deficit misclassified as alignment failure.\n\nThe solved/unsolved gap does not reveal \"difficulty as an influencing factor.\" It reveals that the reported sycophancy rates are **contaminated metrics** mixing:\n- True potential sycophancy (from solved subset, and even this requires further validation per Step 2 above)\n- Competence limitations (from unsolved subset, which should not be in the dataset at all)\n\nThere should be no \"All/Solved/Unsolved\" breakdown because only the subset satisfying both Steps 1 and 2 should be included in the benchmark. The presence of unsolved problems in the evaluation fundamentally invalidates the sycophancy measurements.\n\n### 3. **Cascading invalidation of all derivative analyses**\n\nWith the core measurement conflating competence and alignment, all subsequent analyses become uninterpretable within the paper's claimed framework:\n\n- **Main results (§4.1)**: The reported rates (29%-70%) are inflated by competence limitations, cannot quantify alignment issues\n- **Difficulty analysis (§4.2)**: The paper interprets the solved/unsolved gap as \"higher difficulty implies higher sycophancy,\" but this correlation precisely demonstrates that the measurement captures the mixture of alignment and competence rather than only alignment\n- **Problem type comparison (§4.2, Fig 4)**: Cannot distinguish whether proof-style vs. final-answer differences reflect difficulty (competence) or alignment dynamics  \n- **Self-sycophancy (§4.3)**: Cannot determine if increased rates reflect consistency bias (competence-related) or alignment failures\n- **Mitigation strategies (§5)**: The \"modest\" improvements are uninterpretable—are they trying to enhance critical reasoning ability or adjust alignment? The experimental design cannot answer this\n\n### 4. **Mischaracterization of related work**\n\nThe paper states that prior works \"typically modify existing final-answer problems... Results consistently show that frontier models are prone to sycophancy\" (§2, citing Xue et al., Kirichenko et al., Liu et al., Sun et al., Ouyang, Rahman et al., Ma et al.). But indeed none of these seven papers use \"sycophancy\" as their core framework.\n\n### 5. **Method is isomorphic to prior work despite claims of novelty**\n\nDespite criticizing prior work for using \"ill-posed questions\" versus \"well-posed but false\" statements (§1), the perturbation approaches are structurally identical:\n- Prior work: Perturb problems (remove constraints/add contradictions) → test detection\n- This work: Perturb problems (change conclusions) → test detection\n\nBoth evaluate the same capability: detecting problematic mathematical inputs. The \"ill-posed\" vs. \"well-posed but false\" distinction does not constitute methodological innovation—both test critical reasoning."}, "questions": {"value": "The main questions and concerns are detailed in the Weaknesses section above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "l8KRZJvlc8", "forum": "o7avj3PWNC", "replyto": "o7avj3PWNC", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20666/Reviewer_FxiE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20666/Reviewer_FxiE"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20666/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761915312713, "cdate": 1761915312713, "tmdate": 1762934055086, "mdate": 1762934055086, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces BROKENMATH, a benchmark to measure sycophancy - LLMs \"going along\" with incorrect prompts - in natural-language theorem proving.
