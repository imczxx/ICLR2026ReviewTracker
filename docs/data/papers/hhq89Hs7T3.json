Existing virtual cell models rely heavily on large-scale single-cell datasets, learning explicit mappings between gene expression and perturbations. Although recent models attempt to incorporate multi-source biological information, their generalization remains constrained by data quality, coverage, and batch effects. More critically, these models often function as black boxes, offering predictions without interpretability or consistency with biological principles, which undermines their credibility in scientific research. To address these challenges, we present VCWorld, a cell-level white-box simulator that integrates structured biological knowledge with the iterative reasoning capabilities of large language models to instantiate a biological world model. VCWorld operates in a data-efficient manner to reproduce perturbation-induced signaling cascades and generates interpretable, stepwise predictions alongside explicit mechanistic hypotheses.  In drug perturbation benchmarks, VCWorld achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance, and the inferred mechanistic pathways are consistent with publicly available biological evidence.

The authors reformulate the traditional cell-level regression problem into a gene-centric binary classification framework addressing two tasks: differential expression detection (DE) and directional change prediction (DIR). VCWorld integrates a biological knowledge graph built from seven databases with LLM-based retrieval and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning using Gemini 2.5 Flash to produce mechanistic explanations. A new benchmark, GeneTAK, derived from Tahoe-100M, includes five cell lines and 348 drug perturbations with a 30:70 train-test split by perturbation. VCWorld achieves an average accuracy of 0.68 on both tasks, outperforming existing deep learning baselines: STATE (0.30–0.51), scVI (0.42–0.61), and CPA (0.23–0.44).\n\nThe experimental methodology shows both strengths and weaknesses. Positively, the work uses appropriate statistical testing (Wilcoxon signed-rank), clear dataset construction, extensive ablations, and transparent reporting. However, several issues limit validity. The term “world model” is used incorrectly; in established RL literature (Ha & Schmidhuber 2018; Hafner et al. 2020), world models learn temporal dynamics, which VCWorld does not. Key baselines are missing: no graph neural networks (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE) on the same knowledge graph, no classical ML using graph features, no simpler retrieval pipeline without LLM reasoning. Consequently, it is unclear whether performance gains stem from graph structure, LLM reasoning, or both. While the ablations are informative, the large performance gap between Gemini 2.5 Flash and Llama3-8B (0.68 to 0.37 DE accuracy) without cost or compute analysis raises reproducibility concerns. Finally, the “white-box” interpretability claim is unvalidated; the paper includes no quantitative audit verifying that reasoning traces correspond to real biological mechanisms.\n\nThe paper is well-organized and clearly written, with strong visual presentation (pipeline diagram and tables). The GeneTAK dataset and labeling procedures are described in adequate detail, and the appendices provide useful prompt examples. Nonetheless, the “world model” framing is misleading and should be replaced with a more accurate term such as knowledge-grounded retrieval-augmented classification system. The novelty is somewhat overstated: VCWorld is essentially retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applied to biological perturbation prediction, combining known components (knowledge graph integration, hybrid retrieval, CoT reasoning) rather than introducing a new algorithm. Discussion of existing RAG literature could be expanded, and the paper should include clearer descriptions of knowledge-graph maintenance, conflict resolution, and update policies.\n\nEmpirically, the paper contributes valuable resources and results; methodologically, it is modest. Strengths include the GeneTAK benchmark, the gene-centric reformulation improving data efficiency, strong empirical performance demonstrating that knowledge-grounded reasoning outperforms purely data-driven models, and interpretable natural-language reasoning outputs. However, the architecture primarily reuses established components: graph construction, hybrid semantic-structural retrieval, contrastive case retrieval, and CoT prompting (Wei et al. 2022). There are no fundamentally new algorithms or theoretical insights. The system’s dependence on proprietary Gemini 2.5 Flash, with much weaker results for Llama3-8B (0.37 DE, 0.56 DIR) limits reproducibility and accessibility. Without graph-based or classical ML baselines, it remains unclear whether LLM reasoning is necessary or whether the knowledge graph alone drives performance improvements."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.\tAddresses an important problem in computational biology with strong empirical performance: VCWorld reaches 0.68 accuracy on both DE and DIR, while existing models perform near chance on DIR.\n\n2.\tGeneTAK provides a useful community benchmark with rigorous construction and consistent evaluation protocols.\n\n3.\tGene-centric formulation effectively mitigates data sparsity and improves interpretability.\n\n4.\tProvides mechanistic textual explanations alongside predictions, improving transparency over black-box deep models.\n\n5.\tThorough ablation studies demonstrate component importance: removing BioContext drops accuracy to ~0.51, removing CoT to ~0.59, and replacing Gemini 2.5 with Llama3-8B to ~0.37 (DE).\n\n6.\tIntegrates structured biological knowledge from seven authoritative databases in a coherent, data-efficient system."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.\tVCWorld does not learn temporal dynamics or simulate cellular trajectories and this misframing creates false expectations about the system's capabilities.
