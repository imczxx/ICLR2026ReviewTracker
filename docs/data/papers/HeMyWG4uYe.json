The dataset includes 1,000 reviews from 2024 ICLR papers, which appears rather limited given the actual volume of publicly available conference data (NeurIPS, EMNLP, CoRL, etc).\n\n2. One of the major findings (LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance) has been mentioned in previous papers such as [1, 2], although the authors test the robustness of this finding through different models.\n\n3. In **Embedding Analysis: Summaries** paragraph, the authors claim that the mean distance of LLM generated summaries to the according human texts is almost as low as the mean dissimilarity between human summaries. While the numerical results are similar, even small differences in cosine similarity can have substantial implications in high-dimensional embedding spaces. Hence, I would suggest authors conducting significance testing before reaching to the conclusion. In addition, I think the interpretation of Embedding Analysis could be improved.\n\n4. I assume each paper was evaluated once by each model since no implementation details are given. I'm wondering if the authors could share some insight into the randomness of LLM output for a paper.\n\n5.
