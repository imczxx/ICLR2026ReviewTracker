The main idea is to control the contribution of large eigenvalues (of the matrix defining the problem) when the algorithm lies near the eigenspace for the smaller eigenvalues of the problem. The proposed scheme is doing this by doing a check on the value of the step-size based on the \"spikes\" of the eigenvectors present, and eliminating the minor components accordingly.\n\nThe paper does not provide any theorems, and only tests the proposed strategy in a toy example. It is a nice starting point for studying fine-grained step-size schemes for quadratic programming, and I encourage the authors to continue working on these ideas. However, the paper itself is not yet at a state where it can be considered for publication at ICLR.\n\nMy score of \"0\" should not be interpreted as a harsh criticism of the authors' work, but as my assessment of the distance that the paper would have to close in order to be considered for publication at a top-tier conference or journal."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper is a nice starting point and the geometric ideas are interesting."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The paper is not up to par in any of the three axes below:\n- *Writing / Presentation:* The paper needs to be proof-read and the authors would need to provide much more context and explanations\n- *Theoretical results:* The paper doesn't have any.
