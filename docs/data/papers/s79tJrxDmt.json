To address these challenges, we introduce an approach for scalable, task-agnostic ExG monitoring in the wild. We collected 50 hours of unobtrusive free-living ExG data with an earphone-based hardware prototype to narrow the data diversity gap. At the core of our approach is Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization (PiMT), which decomposes ExG signals into 12 physiology-informed tokens, followed by a reconstruction task to learn robust representations. This enables adaptive feature recognition across the full frequency spectrum while capturing task-relevant information. Experiments on our new HumanSense dataset, the first to enable ExG-based analysis across five human senses, together with four public ExG benchmarks, demonstrate that PiMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse tasks.", "tldr": "We collected 50h of free-living ExG data with an earphone-based device and propose PiMT, a physiology-informed multi-band tokenization approach designed for task-agnostic representation learning with reconstruction-based pre-training.", "keywords": ["Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization", "ExG", "Representation Learning", "Free-living ExG dataset", "Task-agnostic training"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9842896470b066db944002ab6aa8f8fe2eae0a41.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The author introduces a new design of earphone based wearable device incorporating several electrode sensors to capture EEG, EOG, and EMG.

Ambitious Data Collection and New Benchmark: The DailySense dataset, comprising the largest known free-living ExG recordings across diverse human activities and all five senses, marks a significant step toward real-world applicability for physiological sensing. The use of an earphone-based device (NeuroBuds) demonstrates strong engineering innovation, promising unobtrusive and scalable physiological monitoring.\n\n2. Principled Tokenization Approach: The PiMT framework’s multi-band tokenization sits on a solid physiological basis, decomposing signals into 12 canonical sub-bands. This overcomes the usual artificial rigidity of task-specific band choices and supports more generic, transferable representations. The explicit mapping of ExG modalities to sub-bands is clearly visualized and justified in both Figure 1 and the accompanying methodology.\n\n3. Thorough Experimental Validation: The paper conducts comprehensive comparisons against traditional and state-of-the-art baselines (SVM, DeepConvNet, EEGNet, PatchTST, EEGConformer, Bidirectional-Mamba), with both within-dataset and cross-benchmark evaluations. Ablations and analyses deepen understanding of where the gains come from and how PiMT generalizes.\n\n4. Foundation Model Potential: By combining self-supervised pre-training on free-living data with a flexible multi-band tokenization scheme, PiMT takes a meaningful step toward a foundation model for ExG. The method is not tied to any specific task or sensor configuration, and its performance gains across diverse tasks and datasets suggest that it learns robust, general-purpose representations. This is a notable advance in a field often dominated by narrow, task-specific models."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited Generalization to Unseen Subjects and Modest Cohort Size: While the participant count (N=22) is comparable to prior lab-based ExG studies, it remains insufficient to support strong claims of robust population-level generalization. This limitation is clearly evidenced by the significant performance drop in the cross-subject setting (Table 7), where the average F1-score falls to ~58%. Although the authors acknowledge this challenge and provide Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) results (Figure 7), the sharp decline underscores that user-independent modeling remains a substantial hurdle. The current work is a robust proof-of-concept rather than a fully generalizable solution. Future work would benefit from larger-scale recruitment to better address subject variability.\n\n2. Ambiguity in Filter Bank Implementation and Saliency Analysis: The physiological basis for the 12 frequency bands is well-motivated, but the practical implementation lacks critical details, which may hinder reproducibility. The manuscript does not specify key filter parameters (e.g., filter type, order, transition bandwidth, or handling of overlapping bands like EMG-Low and EEG-Beta/Gamma). These details are crucial for replicating the tokenization process.\n\n3. Lack of Statistical Significance Testing: The reporting of mean performance with standard deviations is standard practice, but it is not sufficient to firmly establish the superiority of a proposed method over multiple strong baselines. The absence of statistical significance tests makes it difficult to assess whether the observed improvements (e.g., the 4% F1-score gain in Table 1) are statistically reliable, especially given the variability inherent in physiological data. Incorporating such tests would greatly strengthen the quantitative claims.\n\n4. Insufficient Validation of NeuroBuds Signal Quality Against Gold Standards: A key selling point of the work is the novel NeuroBuds hardware. However, the validation of signal quality is primarily indirect, relying on downstream task performance. To fully establish the device's credibility for research use, a more direct, quantitative comparison with a clinical-grade or research-standard ExG system (even on a small subset of participants) would be highly valuable."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "No ethics concerns are apparent.

The technical details of the proposed method are unclear, and the reported numbers are way off the range of existing numbers, leading to doubts and questions about their experimental settings. For example, in papers like [4], they report around 40% balanced accuracy on SEED-V dataset and around 54% balanced accuracy on BCI competition, which is the state-of-the-art performance that is commonly reported. Yet in this paper, there is 82% accuracy on SEED dataset (which one?) and 69% accuracy on BCI competition, which leads to concerns - have the authors used the common metrics like balanced accuracies? Also, the performance reported on SleepEDF seems to be quite low, see [2, 5], which both reported 83%-85% accuracy on SleepEDF. The experimental results inconsistency makes it hard to evaluate if the machine learning method is effective.\n\n[4] Wang, Jiquan, Sha Zhao, Zhiling Luo, Yangxuan Zhou, Haiteng Jiang, Shijian Li, Tao Li, and Gang Pan. \"Cbramod: A criss-cross brain foundation model for eeg decoding.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2412.07236 (2024).\n\n[5] Eldele, Emadeldeen, Mohamed Ragab, Zhenghua Chen, Min Wu, Chee Keong Kwoh, Xiaoli Li, and Cuntai Guan. \"Time-series representation learning via temporal and contextual contrasting.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.14112 (2021).\n\n\nOverall, the contribution of the prototype and the self-collected dataset is a bit disconnected from the machine learning perspective.
