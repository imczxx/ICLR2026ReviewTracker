This suggests a diagnostic gap: existing datasets are either trivial, synthetic, or overly advanced, limiting their usefulness for exposing reasoning failures. To address this, we introduce CUMath, a benchmark of 2,100 real problems from undergraduate courses in Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and related fields. Each problem includes step-by-step solutions, enabling evaluation of both final answers and intermediate reasoning. Moreover, current evaluations treat accuracy and reasoning separately, overlooking their joint role in problem-solving. To address this, we propose a multi-layered evaluation framework that combines automatic metrics with an LLM-as-a-grader pipeline, integrating symbolic encoding and external verification. Using this setup, we evaluate 15 LLMs across various prompting strategies. Our results show that even advanced models often misuse symbolic methods and rely on shortcuts, leading to polished but flawed solutions. Our findings reveal the ongoing issue of inconsistent reasoning, highlighting the need for improved benchmarks, evaluation frameworks, and the development of models with enhanced consistency and reasoning capabilities.

To this end, the authors introduce CUMath, a new benchmark of 2,100 problems from real undergraduate computational math courses, with each problem annotated with step-by-step solutions. Concurrently, they propose a multi-layered evaluation framework that combines automatic metrics with an \"LLM-as-a-grader\" pipeline, which is augmented with external tools like MathBERT and Wolfram Alpha for verification.

As models approach saturation on benchmarks like GSM8K, there is a pressing need for more challenging, realistic, and diagnostically useful benchmarks. The focus on undergraduate mathematics is an excellent choice for a domain that can effectively distinguish between superficial fluency and deep reasoning abilities.\nThe construction of the CUMath dataset is a solid and meaningful effort. Its grounding in authentic instructional materials (quizzes, exams, textbooks) ensures the practical relevance of the problems. Most importantly, providing detailed step-by-step solutions is crucial for enabling fine-grained analysis of where models' reasoning chains fail, which will greatly benefit future research in this area.\n\nThe authors' advocacy for an integrated assessment of \"answer correctness\" and \"reasoning quality\" is insightful. Highlighting the evaluation blind spot of \"correct answers derived from flawed reasoning\" demonstrates a deep understanding of the limitations of current LLM evaluation. The conceptual direction of the proposed multi-layered framework, which attempts to synthesize automated metrics with qualitative LLM-based feedback, is both correct and worthy of exploration."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The authors repeatedly claim to evaluate \"state-of-the-art LLMs\" or \"frontier LLMs.\" However, the list of evaluated models (Table 12) primarily consists of older models such as GPT-3.5, an early version of GPT-4.1, and smaller-scale open-source models (e.g., LLaMA 3 8B/70B). Given the rapid pace of development in the field (and a target publication date of ICLR 2026), these models are no longer representative of the cutting edge. More recent and powerful reasoning models, such as the latest GPT and Claude series or other specialized math models, are conspicuously absent. This outdated selection invalidates the paper's main conclusion that \"even the strongest LLMs achieve an accuracy of less than 25%.\" A rigorous claim about the capabilities of \"frontier models\" must be substantiated by testing the models widely considered to be the most capable at the time of submission. Without such experiments, the observed failures could be limitations of the specific models tested rather than a general bottleneck for all LLMs.\nWhile the concept of a \"multi-layered evaluation framework\" is appealing, its components are largely direct applications or combinations of existing work (e.g., SRS from ROSCOE, VR from ReasonEval). The main claimed novelty, the \"LLM-as-a-grader\" pipeline, lacks the most critical piece of validation: there is no quantitative analysis comparing its outputs to those of human experts. A reliable automated grading system must demonstrate high inter-rater reliability (e.g., using Cohen's Kappa or Krippendorff's Alpha) with human graders. Without this evidence, the reliability and fairness of the LLM grader cannot be trusted, rendering the scores it produces (the \"LLM\" column in Table 2) unsubstantiated.\n\nThe framework's reliability is highly dependent on its automated preprocessing modules, especially the \"Math Segmentation\" component. As described in Section 4.2, this module relies on simple heuristics—looking for explicit \"step k\" markers and defaulting to \"line-based segmentation\" otherwise. This approach is extremely brittle when processing the free-form, structurally diverse outputs of LLMs. A single complex reasoning step can span multiple lines, and models may use different delimiters or none at all. Incorrect segmentation leads to cascading errors in all subsequent evaluation steps (e.g., semantic F1, SRS, LLM-as-a-grader). Yet, the paper provides no evaluation of this module's accuracy (e.g., against a human-annotated ground truth) nor does it discuss its fault tolerance or potential impact on the final results. This oversight regarding a core component's robustness casts serious doubt on the entire framework's practical usability."}, "questions": {"value": "1.\tCould you explain the decision to exclude more recent, top-performing models renowned for their mathematical reasoning abilities (e.g., the latest GPT-4 series, Claude 3 series)?
