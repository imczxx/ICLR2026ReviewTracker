However, research into hypergraph synthesis is limited, and state-of-the-art approaches yield limited generation quality in terms of overall structural patterns and graph-level validity. This is caused by the hypergraph's combinatorial structure, which is composed of a number of possible hyperedges that is factorial in the number of nodes. In fact, current solutions rely on diffusion models denoising graph projections, which are exact but inefficient, or lightweight but approximate. To address such shortcomings, we introduce SuperHype, the first hypergraph diffusion model with tractable and exact modeling. To tackle the complexity of hypergraph representation, we introduce graph superposition, a novel representation that embeds a hypergraph into a multilayer graph. Superposition enables a tractable representation that maintains exactness. To generate new samples from such representations, we introduce a Graph-Superposition Transformer that treats the superposition as an interconnected sequence of layers. We optimize the model architecture to learn low-level patterns within individual graphs in the superposition and high-level patterns between the different graphs of the same superposition. Moreover, we enhance the model's performance with hypergraph-specific auxiliary features and triplet aggregation of indirect node interactions. Our evaluation on five datasets shows that \\algo generally reproduces local and global connectivity patterns with superior fidelity to state-of-the-art baselines.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["graph", "hypergraph", "diffusion model"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/48521cf4fc679879e92f3522a6e356419a2392a5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes SuperHype, a diffusion-based framework for hypergraph generation.

My key concern is lack of theoretical guarantee of the graph superposition projection process. For example, it would be very helpful to have theoretical insights about under what conditions the superposition projection algorithm can succeed (or fail); what's the relationship between the layer number d and the probability of success of the algorithm (and how do we choose a small enough d); are there many hypergraphs that fail the algorithm (which is closely tied to the general applicability of your method)\n\n2. The denoising process also seems to lack enforcement/usage of some hard combinatorial constraints. For example, how can you guarantee that the generation result is (of high confidence) containing a set of \"proper\" maximal cliques. A counter example would be that you generate, say, a 10-complete graph with only 1 random edge missing. We know that in reality this structure is very unlikely the clique expansion of a real hypergraph. Also,  my sense is that different layers also have some hard combinatorial constraints with each -- I think it would be helpful to explicitly figure out what these constraints are, and how we can utilize them to help with denoising. \n\n3.
