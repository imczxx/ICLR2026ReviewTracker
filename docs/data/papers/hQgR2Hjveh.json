This emphasizes well-clustered points while suppressing ambiguous or noisy regions. K-Sil supports both macro- and micro-averaged silhouette aggregation through adaptive weighting schemes, and achieves scalability via efficient sampling and approximation strategies.

While minor, in the theoretical part, use explicit lemmas, theorems, claims, assumptions, etc. For example, in section B.2. \"Non-Decreasing Silhouette Scores for High-Silhouette Score Points\" should be a lemma/theorem followed by a proof, and currently it reads as a paragraph.\n2. Either:\n- Add more comprehensive empirical evaluations, using some of the many works cited in the related work, or other recent works.\n- Provide approximation guarantees for the suggested method, so it could fall under a theory paper, and as such, the evaluation could be more relaxed (still a few additional methods seem needed).\n3. Add a synthetic dataset considering imbalanced clusters, for example, the following dataset on the plane consisting of two clusters.\n- A uniform sample of 1000 points from the unit circle.\n- A uniform sample of 25 points, where each point is chosen from a disc of radius 0.1, centered at (2, 0).\n4. It seems that the running time was not provided in the empirical section. It is important, given the changes mentioned in the paper, to this end, and for a more comprehensive comparison. Also, given that the running time of the solution is only shown to be finite (and not provided with an explicit bound), I believe that the runtime for at least one test should be plotted as a histogram. This would allow a rough understanding of the runtime distribution, for example, whether the tail decays rapidly (and can thus be empirically ignored) or decays slowly, making the expected runtime heavily affected by the not-so-rare, long-running cases.\n5. While minor, the caption of the algorithm seems informal. I would suggest K-Sil-Clustering(X,...) over the current \"K-Sil Clustering\", which doesn't name the parameters explicitly.\n6. The algorithm should be formalized. For example, instead of just \"Sampling size\" and then \"Let $C_j^S \\subset C_j$ be the sampled subset\", explicitly state *$\\lambda\\geq 1$ sample size* and then *Let $C_j^S \\subset C_j$ be a uniform i.i.d. sample of size $\\lambda$*, or something along the lines.\n7.
