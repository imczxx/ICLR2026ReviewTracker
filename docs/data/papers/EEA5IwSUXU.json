A key difficulty arises from the discretization of Gaussians, which often produces artifacts during animation. Another challenge lies in rigging arbitrary, template-free shapes without sufficient training data. To address these challenges, we propose A$^3$-GS, a new 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework that reconstructs articulated objects from multi-view images while simultaneously estimating a skeleton and skinning weights, thereby enabling rich animations with high-quality rendering. Technically, we first introduce a Mesh–Gaussian hybrid representation for articulated objects. By exploiting the continuity of the mesh, our method mitigates rendering artifacts such as spikes and tearing caused by Gaussian deformation, thereby enhancing the visual quality of animated results. We further learn motion-coherent skinning weights by leveraging motion priors from visual foundation models trained on large-scale 2D video data, reducing reliance on scarce 3D datasets. In addition, we incorporate local rigidity regularization to improve the smoothness of skeleton-based deformation and further suppress artifacts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating clear advantages over existing methods. The code will be made publicly available.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["generation", "3D", "animation", "skinning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/aba35088a4e6cbe9aa6a0b1b39564d1738df0fcf.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/44a45a065025961ba67dc7781407f55c0950325a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes A³-GS, a framework for reconstructing articulated objects from multi-view images and automatically rigging them for animation.

Although objects may exhibit secondary motions in skeleton-driven animations (e.g., the hair dynamics in the second example of Fig. 1), the paper does not demonstrate the ability to model such effects.
