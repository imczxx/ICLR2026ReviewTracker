This yields a representation that adapts its characteristics per task domain while retaining linear-time inference and memory. The key novelty is the trainable spectral front-end through which the model can adapt frequency weighting and inter-bin window size. We show the effectiveness of our learned spectral representations on two independent domains: radar object detection and speech keyword recognition, outperforming state of the art frequency based methods in both domains while maintaining competitive throughput and computational overhead.

It is advertised for using SSMs to enhance spectral representation learning, but it is barely accessible to either community. For SSM people, section 3 is written in a mysterious way. There are multiple new design choices different from a standard SSM/Mamba and no intuition is given. For spectral learning people, the benefit of SSM is not clearly anticipated and there also lacks enough background provided for understanding the proposed SSM integration.\n* There is no analysis of the model in addition to experiments. It is intuitively unclear why the proposed method should outperform the existing ones. Some theoretical insights could be helpful.\n* While the experiments on radar and speech are thorough, these two choices seem quite arbitrary; no direct ablation is provided (see questions below).\n* The presentation of the paper needs to be improved. In addition to cleaning up the formulas in section 3 and make the transition smoother, there are a couple of things that need to be corrected, including the extensive misuse of en dashes and em dashes and the storage of figures, which should be in a vectorized format."}, "questions": {"value": "1. How is FSSM computed during training and inference? In Algorithm 1, the psuedocode appears as a loop. Almost all previous SSMs are trained in parallel using either FFT (for S4, S4D, etc.) or parallel scan (for S5, Mamba, etc.). Can this be done to an FSSM?\n2. Relatedly, how easy is it to train an FSSM to achieve the results in section 4?\n3. I am confused about the position of the proposed FSSM. In particular, I cannot tell which models are FSSMs supposed to compete against. If FSSM is proposed as a alternative to SSMs/Mambas, then there is no empirical comparison found in the paper. If FSSM is to be competed against traditional methods like FFT, then their distinction needs to be highlighted and the \"SSM\" needs to be ablated. The name \"FSSM\" probably also need to be changed into something like \"SSM-augmented FFT front-end.\"\n4. There are multiple components proposed in section 3, and many of them are not totally intuitive. Is it possible to have ablation for the phase alignment, learnable damping, and the proposed parameterizations?\n5.

Speech Commands v2 has 35-keyword classes and is an English-only dataset, and is rather limited.\n- A more comprehensive audio recognition task, like multi-label audio classification on AudioSet or FSD50k would have been a better test-bed for testing frequency-selectivity of the proposed FSSM frontend.\n- In essence, to be of wider applicability and to prove that FSSM is a good learnable frontend, a better pairing of auxiliary task is needed alongside radar-based object detection.\n\n---\n\n## Weakness 2: Figures\n- Maybe I'm splitting hairs here, but all the figures in the paper are subpar. They have poor resolution and quality, and the text is too small (especially Figure 3), making it difficult to read in print. \n- In Figure 5, there are so many empty bins it is not possible to clearly see the difference between the FFT and FSSM visualizations. There is also an outline to the figure which looks weird.\n\n---\n\n## Weakness 3: Frequency-selectivity\n\n- The frequency selectivity of the proposed approach is not well demonstrated. Only Figure 5 shines a light on it, that too poorly.\n- A more comprehensive empirical/exploratory investigative analysis is necessary to ascertain that FSSM indeed does better at being frequency selective.\n\n---\n\n## Weakness 4: Empirical analysis\n\n- Alongside the use of Speech Commands as the auxiliary task, the overall quality of empirical analysis in the paper is lacking.\n- There are no confidence intervals, and the precision used in reported results (significant digits) is insufficient, especially for RADIal analysis, where margins between the evaluated approaches are quite small. For instance, the mAP for FFT-RadNet and the proposed FSSM-FFTRadNet is 0.97 and 0.98, respectively.\n\n---\n\n## Weakness 5: Spelling and grammatical errors\n- There are several spelling and grammatical errors throughout the paper. for instance *represetation*, *segentation*.
