However, most existing linear discriminant analysis (LDA) methods are sensitive to deviations from normality and may suffer from suboptimal performance in heavy-tailed settings. This paper investigates the robust LDA problem with elliptical distributions in high-dimensional data. Our approach constructs stable discriminant directions by leveraging a robust spatial sign-based mean and covariance estimator, which allows accurate estimation even under extreme distributions. We demonstrate that SSLDA achieves an optimal convergence rate in terms of both misclassification rate and estimate error.

Limited Discussion on the Elliptical Distribution Assumption:** The paper's entire theoretical framework relies on the assumption that the data follows an elliptical distribution. This is a potential limitation for real-world datasets that may exhibit significant skewness or more complex, non-elliptical dependency structures. The work could be improved by explicitly discussing the robustness of SSLDA to violations of this assumption. A constructive suggestion would be to include a simulation where data is generated from a clearly non-elliptical (e.g., skewed) distribution to empirically explore the method's performance boundaries and better define its applicability.\n- **2. Scope of Experimental Validation Could Be Broadened:** Although the experiments are well-designed, they could be more comprehensive to fully demonstrate generalizability. Specifically, the empirical validation relies heavily on synthetic data and a single, specific image classification task. To more convincingly argue for the method's broad utility, the authors could include experiments on a wider range of real-world benchmark datasets from other domains where high-dimensional, heavy-tailed data is common, such as finance (e.g., stock returns), genomics, or text analysis. This would provide stronger evidence of the method's practical impact beyond the presented application.\n- **3. Lack of Comparison with Alternative Robust Sparse Methods:** The paper effectively compares SSLDA against several leading sparse LDA methods. However, it does not include comparisons with other classes of robust, high-dimensional classifiers that are not based on the LDA framework, such as robust sparse logistic regression or support vector machines with robust kernels. Including such comparisons would help to position SSLDA more clearly within the broader landscape of robust classification tools and would provide a more complete picture of its relative strengths and weaknesses."}, "questions": {"value": "- **1. On the Robustness Beyond Elliptical Distributions:** The theoretical guarantees of SSLDA are firmly established under the elliptical distribution assumption. Could you please comment on the empirical robustness of SSLDA when this assumption is violated, for instance, with significantly skewed distributions? Have you conducted any preliminary tests on such data? A discussion on the expected behavior or potential modifications to handle non-elliptical data would greatly help users understand the boundaries of the method's applicability.\n- **2. On the Generalizability and Practical Impact:** The experimental results on synthetic data and the image classification task are compelling. To further demonstrate the general utility of SSLDA, it would be highly beneficial to see its performance on one or two additional benchmark datasets from domains known for high-dimensional, heavy-tailed data, such as finance (e.g., asset returns) or genomics. This would significantly strengthen the claim of the method's broad practical impact.\n- **3. On the Comparison with the Broader Robust Classification Landscape:** The paper provides excellent comparisons against other sparse LDA methods. Could you discuss the rationale for not including comparisons with other paradigms for robust high-dimensional classification, such as $l_1$-regularized robust logistic regression or sparse SVM with robust kernels? A discussion on how you expect SSLDA to perform relative to these alternative approaches, or results from such a comparison, would help to better position your contribution within the entire field of robust classification, not just the LDA family.\n- **4. On the Choice of Tuning Parameters:** The method involves a regularization parameter $\\lambda_n$. It would be helpful for practitioners if you could provide more detailed guidance on the selection of this parameter in practical scenarios, especially when the underlying distribution is unknown.

As discussed in Section 1, the spatial-sign-based methodology is a mature tool for high-dimensional data classification, and it has been integrated into many machine learning algorithms.

In Section 1, the first main contribution states that ‘we establish theoretical results for SSLDA in the sparse scenario’. What exactly does this theoretical result mean? There is a lack of detailed explanation.\n3. Section 1 provides a detailed history of LDA with high-dimensional classification, which is somewhat long-winded, and fails to elaborate on the key concepts relevant to SSLDA. What are spatial sign and elliptical distribution? The author should appropriately reduce the review of previous works, and provide a more detailed introduction to SSLDA. It is necessary to clearly and intuitively state why the spatial sign can handle high-dimensional long-tailed distributions.\n4. The comparative algorithms are too old. The latest was published in 2019.\n5. SSLDA is regarded as a robust classification approach.
