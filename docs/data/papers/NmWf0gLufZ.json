Current VL systems rely on cloud-based 3D scene representation storage and client-side feature extraction, thus creating significant privacy risks. A privacy breach is framed as a malicious actor recovering privacy-preserving representations being sent from the client to the server. This paper therefore aims at finding out what can be recovered from these representations and comparing the multiple privacy-preserving solutions within the literature. We define privacy as the inability to recover personally identifiable information from image representations, acknowledging that general scene details do not inherently represent a privacy breach. We assess the degree of privacy of a representation by evaluating the amount of sensitive information it contains. To that end, we introduce a new privacy attack in which we train a diffusion model to reconstruct images through conditioning on different groups of privacy-preserving representations. \nWe then measure what can be recovered in the images through a set of comprehensive experiments, which effectively act as a proxy to evaluate the degree of privacy of the initial representations. We apply this comprehensive evaluation protocol on different privacy-preserving representations and provide the first comparison between multiple branches of privacy-preserving visual localization methods. We plan on releasing code and trained checkpoints.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Privacy-preserving visual localization", "benchmark", "diffusion", "segmentation", "geometric obfuscation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2e53ac87292db16e726d436e6ddfd70ccb410d77.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/852232bc19d017a9b33c9f4a6bff32001d1cf0bb.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a method to preserve privacy for the client-side image that will be sent to the server to localize the client's position.

It remains unclear what the attacker knows or can access (e.g., full access to the PPVL algorithm, model parameters, or only transmitted features). The paper assumes that the attacker already knows the type of privacy-preserving representation (e.g., segmentation or descriptors), which is a strong assumption. The authors should clarify whether the attack operates under a white-box, gray-box, or black-box scenario, as this distinction fundamentally determines the practical applicability of the attack. Without these details, the realism of the threat is difficult to assess.\n\n* Limited scope of privacy-preserving representations evaluated\n\nThe paper tests only a few known PPVL representations (SIFT, SuperPoint, XFeat, SegLoc, GSFF, SAM2, DPT). However, in practice, many localization systems use other forms of compressed or learned representations. It is not discussed whether the proposed diffusion-based attack can generalize to other PPVL schemes, such as encrypted feature transmission or homomorphic embeddings. This omission limits the generality and impact of the findings.\n\n* Lack of discussion on random seed influence and reconstruction variability\n\nThe proposed evaluation introduces the Reconstruction Diversity (RD) metric but does not thoroughly analyze how different seeds affect reconstruction quality or fidelity. In diffusion models, sampling variability can significantly alter perceptual and semantic content. The authors should have presented a systematic study showing how seeds impact privacy evaluation and whether reconstruction quality can be optimized or averaged across multiple runs.\n\n* Weak connection between theoretical motivation and experimental outcomes\n\nThe motivation section emphasizes the importance of understanding what information diffusion models recover from obfuscated representations, yet the experimental results primarily focus on reconstruction quality rather than the mechanisms of leakage.
