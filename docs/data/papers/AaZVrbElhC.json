However, the discrete and non-differentiable nature of spikes leads to unstable gradient propagation in directly trained SNNs, making Batch Normalization (BN) an important component for stabilizing training. In online Reinforcement Learning (RL), imprecise BN statistics hinder exploitation, resulting in slower convergence and suboptimal policies. While Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can often omit BN, SNNs critically depend on it, limiting the adoption of SNNs for energy-efficient control on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, we propose Confidence-adaptive and Re-calibration Batch Normalization (CaRe-BN), which introduces (i) a confidence-guided adaptive update strategy for BN statistics and (ii) a re-calibration mechanism to align distributions. By providing more accurate normalization, CaRe-BN stabilizes SNN optimization without disrupting the RL training process. Importantly, CaRe-BN does not alter inference, thus preserving the energy efficiency of SNNs in deployment. Extensive experiments on both discrete and continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that CaRe-BN improves SNN performance by up to $22.6$% across different spiking neuron models and RL algorithms. Remarkably, SNNs equipped with CaRe-BN even surpass their ANN counterparts by $5.9$%. These results highlight a new direction for BN techniques tailored to RL, paving the way for neuromorphic agents that are both efficient and high-performing.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Spiking Neural Networks", "Batch Normalization", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b4cee0dce933a504b9f7b0fcd2441a7b662ca239.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d24c798f75e7488595b21d7268076fb8c487bb43.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work presents Confidence-adaptive and Re-calibration Batch Normalization (CaRe-BN) to stabilize Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Theory–data distribution mismatch in Theorem 1 (target inconsistency between moving BN and batch BN)\nThe theorem assumes that the “moving/prior” BN estimator and the “mini-batch/observation” BN estimator are unbiased estimates of the same target distribution with correctly specified variances. In online RL with replay, this assumption is typically violated: the moving BN statistics track the current inference distribution, while the batch BN statistics are computed from a replay mixture of (often older) policies, with temporal correlation and potentially heavy-tailed activations. Consequently, the two estimators do not share the same target, unbiasedness/i.i.d. fail, and the linear fusion with gain 𝐾 is not guaranteed to be valid or optimal (and may introduce bias). \n\n2. Limited experimental scope beyond MuJoCo \nAlthough the paper compares against common SNN normalization baselines (e.g., BNTT), the evaluation remains restricted to MuJoCo continuous control. To substantiate generality and the claimed benefits under stronger non-stationarity, the method should also be tested on exploration-hard and vision-based benchmarks (e.g., Atari).\n\n3. Exploration claim lacks causal evidence and proper metrics\nSection 5.2 infers “more precise BN statistics → better exploration” primarily from an “exploration return” curve without defining the metric, controlling confounders (action-noise schedule, value-estimation bias, policy smoothness), or reporting standard exploration measures (state-coverage/visitation, occupancy entropy, trajectory diversity, feature-space coverage). No experiments are provided on exploration-hard tasks or against classic intrinsic-motivation baselines (ICM, RND, NGU/Plan2Explore, count-based variants). The authors need to further analyze the reason why the proposed method can improve the efficiency of exploration. \n\n4. Unestablished advantage over strong ANN-RL and unmeasured energy claims\nThe only ANN comparison uses a vanilla ANN-TD3 (in the appendix). Modern, stronger ANN-RL baselines (e.g., SAC; TD3/SAC with LN/GN/RMSNorm or Batch Renorm/AdaBN; distributional critics; entropy/parameter-noise regularization) are not evaluated, so superiority over ANN remains unproven. Moreover, the touted energy advantage of SNNs is theoretical and specific to neuromorphic hardware; no deployment-phase energy/latency measurements (or credible proxies) are reported, nor is training vs. inference cost disentangled. Open discussion: beyond theoretical energy efficiency on neuromorphic hardware, what concrete advantages does SNN + CaRe-BN have over strong ANN-RL methods (e.g., sample efficiency under non-stationarity, stability under distribution shifts, low-latency control, small-batch robustness), and can the authors provide controlled evidence for them?"}, "questions": {"value": "1.
