To remedy this limitation, we propose elastic optimal transport (ELOT) which is distinctive from the classical optimal transport in its ability of adaptive-mass preserving. It aims to answer the problem of how to transport the probability mass adaptively between probability distributions, which is a fundamental topic in various areas of artificial intelligence. The strength of elastic optimal transport is its capability to transport adaptive-mass in the light of the geometry structure of the problem itself. As an application example in machine learning, we apply elastic optimal transport to both unsupervised domain adaptation and partial domain adaptation tasks. It adaptively transports masses from source domain to target domain by taking domain shift into consideration and respecting the ubiquity of noises or outliers in the data, in order to improve the generalization performance. The experiment results on the benchmarks show that ELOT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. As a powerful distribution matching tool, elastic optimal transport might be of interests to the broad areas such as artificial intelligence, healthcare, physics, operations research, urban science, etc. The source code is available in the supplementary material.", "tldr": "A novel optimal transport method with solid theory, broad applicability, and promising empirical evaluation.", "keywords": ["optimal transport", "domain adaptation", "transfer learning"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fdad4efd34ccbb708154b42009db993aa11245f7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/be838222fcb99ec9bc799dc1ca28874731dea66d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper considers the mathematical aspects of optimal transport (OT), where a variant of existing OT formulation is proposed.

The elastic optimal transport (ELOT) is not rigorously defined and analyzed. Specifically, the notation $\\mathbb{R}_{±}$ in Eq. (6) for the cost function is not defined. If it implies that the cost function could be both positive and negative, the ELOT could not be well-defined, e.g., does it still satisfy the metric property? A rigorous and complete theoretical analysis is necessary to ensure the validity of ELOT.\n\nQ2. The ELOT seems to be an incremental work of partial OT. Specifically, the basic conclusions and technical details (i.e., Thm. 1 and its proofs) of ELOT are almost the same as partial OT [27, Prop. 1], while the proofs in line 54-56 manuscript seem to be problematic, i.e., there are no rigorous proofs to ensure that the submatrix of augmented OT plan is equivalent to the OT plan of ELOT.\n\nQ3. Moreover, the formulation of ELOT in Eq. (6)-(7) still cannot ensure the adaptive learning of mass value $s$. Specifically, the technique based on dummy variables still induces the parameter $\\sigma$ in Eq. (8), which is basically equivalent to adjusting $s$.\n\nQ4. In the claim below Eq. (8), the authors set $\\sigma$ as 0 in the experiment. However, in such a formulation, the ELOT problem seems to be exactly the original Kantorovich OT problem, as the augmented cost matrix is block-diagonal where the $n\\times m$ block and $1\\times 1$ block are independent. Based on this problem, it would be hard to understand the performance improvement of ELOT in experiments.\n\nQ5. The comparison experiment with SOTA methods is not significant. This experiment is conducted on 3 DA datasets, where the performance is significantly lower than the SOTA methods in recent years. Some further verifications on the latest proposed datasets and advanced baselines are necessary, e.g., DomainNet dataset and ViT backbone.\n\nQ6.

Partial OT already allows transporting only part of the mass. In classical formulations, one can introduce a Lagrange multiplier that effectively shifts the cost matrix and induces an “automatic” choice of how much mass to transport. Prior work (the paper cites Caffarelli & McCann, 2010) can create a situation where negative effective cost encourages matching only for “good pairs,” and the transported mass adapts as a function of that shift. \nELOT is described as more general because it directly allows mixed-sign costs and only imposes marginal $\\le$ constraints, and it claims to “automatically finds the optimal mass to be transferred without setting a priori budget.” However, ELOT can still look like “partial OT with a specific cost shaping and slack embedding.” The paper should give a crisper mathematical argument for why ELOT is fundamentally different and not just a repackaging.\n\n- Calling $W(\\mu,\\nu)$ a ‘distance’ may be misleading. Because $C$ can be non-symmetric and can contain negative values, the induced objective $W(\\mu,\\nu)$ is not guaranteed to be a metric or even a divergence: non-negativity, symmetry, and triangle inequality can fail.\nThe paper uses “optimal transport distance” language, which is standard OT terminology, but here it risks overstating the geometric meaning. This should be toned down or clarified. Meanwhile, the commonly used costs, e.g., L1 L2, are not suitable. How could ELOT be applied to partial transport under such widely utilized costs?\n\n- The paper aims to avoid hand-tuning transport mass, a hyperparameter. However, the costs in the domain adaptation task and the partial domain adaptation task involve hyperparameters, to which the performance is sensitive, as shown in the experiments. So I feel like the authors avoid tuning one parameter but instead tune several other parameters. For DA, the parameters are set to the values in the compared methods. But for other applications, how these parameters are determined."}, "questions": {"value": "- Could the authors explain how to define the cost for a general task, as the commonly utilized costs are often non-negative in most tasks?\n- Can the private class data be detected and omitted by ELOT in partial DA?\n- The compared methods are not soTA.
