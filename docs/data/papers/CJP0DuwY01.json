Previous approaches leverage techniques such as flow or Schrödinger bridge matching to implicitly learn joint trajectories through data snapshots. However, many systems, including biomolecular systems and heterogeneous cell populations, undergo *dynamic* interactions that evolve over their trajectory and cannot be captured through static snapshots. To close this gap, we introduce **Entangled Schrödinger Bridge Matching (EntangledSBM)**, a framework that learns the first- and second-order stochastic dynamics of interacting, multi-particle systems where the direction and magnitude of each particle's path depend dynamically on the paths of the other particles. We define the Entangled Schrödinger Bridge (EntangledSB) problem as solving a coupled system of bias forces that *entangle* particle velocities. We show that our framework accurately simulates heterogeneous cell populations under perturbations and rare transitions in high-dimensional biomolecular systems.", "tldr": "We introduce Entangled Schrödinger Bridge Matching, a framework that learns the second-order Langevin dynamics of multi-particle systems where the direction and magnitude of each particle's path depend dynamically on the paths of the other particles.", "keywords": ["Schrödinger Bridge Matching", "transition path sampling", "stochastic optimal control", "molecular dynamics", "generative modelling", "trajectory inference", "stochastic processes", "probabilistic transport"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0e26567314f39cb937c6519f303548ab02752442.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work extends Schrödinger Bridge Matching with a bias force that depends on the velocity of all particles (instead of just one) and is therefore “entangled”.

Do we have multiple observation of  $\\mathbf{X}\\_{t}$ so that information about $\\pi\\_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is available or we only have one observation $\\mathbf{X}\\_{t}$? \n\n- When we are thinking two marginals, what are we having? Do we have 1) an ensemble of these multiple particle systems, but they are different ensembles at two ends, but we observe all particles within each ensemble? or 2) we only have one ensemble and at each end we see different part of it? \n\n- Do we need to assume at the beginning and the end samples have same number of particles and they are all interacting? \n\n- Do we know $\\pi_{\\mathcal{A}}$ and $\\pi_{\\mathcal{B}}$ or we only have sample to some extend. \n\n- How is the setup different from an augmented vanilla SB whose state space is the concatenation of all particles?  \n\n- Use MD as an example, is the author saying all the molecules are interacting or the measured angle are interacting? Are there multiple molecules in the sample? \n\n## Notation\n- In section 2, the authors used some convention from physics like Boltzmann constant $k_B$ temperature $\\tau$ and mass $m_i$. These are obvious for people with some level of physics background but less obvious for people in ML and it will be nice to briefly explain, or just absorb things into constants like $\\gamma$. \n\n## Proofs\n- Using Girsanov: there are some conditions needed that are not spelled out. More importantly, the diffusion matrix $\\Sigma$ on the position part are 0 since this is a Langevin rather than over-damped one, this makes $\\Sigma$ not invertible. The conclusions *are* correct since the drift on locations is known but one need to be careful about these dynamics."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "iAgKfQveLU", "forum": "CJP0DuwY01", "replyto": "CJP0DuwY01", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10077/Reviewer_GHiq"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10077/Reviewer_GHiq"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10077/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761768780138, "cdate": 1761768780138, "tmdate": 1762921466963, "mdate": 1762921466963, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces Entangled Schrödinger Bridge Matching (EntangledSBM), a framework designed to model the second-order Langevin dynamics of multi-particle systems with entangled bias forces.

Since the original submission of our manuscript, we have made the following **key updates** to improve both the presentation and empirical validation of our paper. \n\n### Overview of Key Updates\n\n- In Sec. 5.2, we provide **quantitative** and **qualitative** experiments on Alanine Dipeptide and three fast folding proteins: **Chignolin** (10 amino acids; 138 atoms), **Trpcage** (284 atoms; 20 amino acids), and **BBA** (504 atoms; 28 amino acids). We compare against non-ML and ML baselines, including unbiased MD (UMD), steered MD (SMD), PIPS (Holdijk et al. 2023), and TPS-DPS (Seong et al. 2024). **Notably, we show superior target hit percentage for all proteins against all baselines.**\n- Instead of using a target-aware base dynamics for the cell perturbation modelling experiment, we define the base dynamics as just the **natural gradient of the data manifold** that points in the direction of the largest increase in data density. This allows us to rigorously evaluate the ability of EntangledSBM to **fully capture the cellular dynamics as a result of the drug perturbation.**\n- In Sec. 3 and App. B.2, we provide a deeper, intuitive and theoretical justification for integrating dependencies on joint particle positions and velocities.\n- To demonstrate the significance of the **cross-entropy (CE) objective that we formalize in Sec. 4.2**, we provide additional background on the alternative log-variance (LV) objective in App. B.1 and a rigorous evaluation of the theoretical and empirical benefits of the CE objective over the LV objective in **App. F**.\n- To assess the computational efficiency of our framework, we report the average training and sampling times per rollout across molecular dynamics systems of increasing atomic complexity in **Table 6 in App. E.3**.\n- We provide the full codebase for our models and experiments in the anonymous repository: [https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EntangledSBManon](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EntangledSBManon/README.md)"}}, "id": "fN2j2WgBeM", "forum": "CJP0DuwY01", "replyto": "CJP0DuwY01", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10077/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10077/Authors"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10077/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763309913926, "cdate": 1763309913926, "tmdate": 1763313668990, "mdate": 1763313668990, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
