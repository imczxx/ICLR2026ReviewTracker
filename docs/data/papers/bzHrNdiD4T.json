Significant recent research established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee convergence of the training loop. \nThis line of work uses averaging as the aggregation rule for the training models. \nIn particular, we are interested in whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions from distributed computing.\nWe show that the various validity conditions alone do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. \nFurthermore, we show that reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings due to possible Byzantine outliers. \nOur main contribution is the first lower bound of $\\min\\{\\frac{n-t}{t},\\sqrt{d}\\}$ on the centroid approximation under box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and $d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower bound by an upper bound of $2\\min\\{n,\\sqrt{d}\\}$, by providing a new analysis for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a $\\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting.

The mathematical rigour of the definitions should be improved.

Also I think that introducing Notation 1 after its actual use in Def. 2.6.\n\nW2. The overall exposition should be more formal and clear, particularly statements and lemmas.\n\nW3. In the introduction, the authors remark that their results are valid up to a number of attackers $t < n/3$. This sounds a little limiting, as most of the FL literature assumes that $t < n/2$, and now more recent works are moving towards $t< n$. \n\nW4. In the 'Centroid Approximation' setting (lines 179-180), the authors assume that the number of participating clients at each round $m$ is between $n-t$ and $n$. The first concern is that, hence in the worst case scenario, when $ t = n/3$ (or something slightly smaller), the server samples more $2n/3$ clients, causing a non negligible bottleneck -- thus violating the low communication overhead principle in FL. Consider that most of the FL literatures considers federations larger than 100 clients, and the sampled clients are around 10%, or less.Furthermore, as far as I have understood, in order to make the method work, the server should know exactly the number of faulty clients $t$, which is not possible.\n\nW5.
