Existing methods typically assess data quality by measuring the margin between preferred and dispreferred responses in each pair. Following the common intuition that small-margin (i.e., difficult) pairs are uninformative or even noisy, such pairs are often discarded. In this work, we challenge this natural practice and propose a new insight: “While difficult pairs may hinder alignment when optimized with preference-based objectives due to potential likelihood displacement, they can still provide valuable learning signals when trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT).” We empirically validate this insight through systematic experiments and highlight two key findings: (1) Structuring training from easy to difficult samples improves alignment performance, consistent with the curriculum learning paradigm; (2) Difficult pairs negatively impact preference-based optimization but become useful when optimized using SFT loss. Based on this insight, we introduce a simple yet effective method, MixDPO, which ranks preference pairs by difficulty and dynamically switches to SFT loss for difficult pairs. Our approach achieves improved alignment performance on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark, outperforming existing DPO variants, particularly for the Length Control (LC) win rate.", "tldr": "We propose a simple method that improves LLM alignment by sorting preference pairs by difficulty and applying SFT to hard cases instead of discarding them.", "keywords": ["Preference Alignment; DPO; Curriculum Learning"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/774ff9aaf9a0d7a532c89c52d78f84fe1a846b25.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies how to utilize ambiguous preference pairs in LLM alignment.\nThe authors argue that the ambiguous and \"difficult\" preference pairs, where the predicted scores of the two responses are close, still contain useful information for alignment.\nUnlike prior works that discard such pairs, the authors propose to apply a curriculum learning strategy that sorts the training data by difficulty and gradually introduces more difficult pairs during DPO training, and apply SFT on the rest most \"difficult\" and ambiguous data."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "This paper addresses how to better utilize ambiguous preference data for LLM alignment.

For example, Pal et al. [1] previously proposed DPO-Positive, explicitly adding SFT terms to mitigate failure modes like likelihood displacement. Given this, MixDPO is effectively a hyperparameter-guided switch for this known fix, which is a minor novelty.\n\n### **Old baselines**\nWhile MixDPO improves over vanilla DPO (achieving ~36% raw Win Rate and ~14% Length-Controlled Win Rate on AlpacaEval 2 with Llama-3-8B), recent work from late 2024 and 2025 has higher performance on the same model class. Does the conditional SFT improve these methods as well? See [1-5].\n\n\n### **SIMPO Numbers**\nThe authors quote simpo's number as 24%, whereas the paper reports 44% on the same model (see Table 1 in the paper)? Am I missing something or are the numbers totally off?\n\n\n#### **Hyperparameter Brittleness**\nThe method introduces a critical sensitivity to the difficulty threshold $\\tau$. As shown in Table 3, selecting a suboptimal threshold (e.g., $\\tau=1.5$) can degrade performance to below that of vanilla DPO. Can you show the hyperparameter ablation to find tau?.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n[1] Chen, H., He, G., Yuan, L., Cui, G., Su, H., & Zhu, J. (2024).
