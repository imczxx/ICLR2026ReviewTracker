Distributionally Robust RL (DR-RL) offers a principled framework to mitigate this issue by learning a policy that maximizes worst-case performance over a specified uncertainty set of transition dynamics. Despite its potential, existing DR-RL research faces two key limitations: reliance on prior knowledge of the environment -- typically access to a generative model or a large offline dataset -- and a primary focus on tabular methods that do not scale to complex problems. In this paper, we bridge these gaps by introducing an online DR-RL algorithm compatible with general function approximation. Our method learns an optimal robust policy directly from environmental interactions, eliminating the need for prior models and enabling application to complex, high-dimensional tasks. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis establishes a near-optimal sublinear regret for the algorithm under the total variation uncertainty set, demonstrating that our approach is both sample-efficient and effective.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["distributionally robust", "reinforcement learning", "function approximation"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/231ce53d0ddc3903e12d02f3baabb5b3aa89f7af.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f3c4152925f3aca1b334cb96066a9bda5d971f6c.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a near-optimal algorithm in online distributional robust reinforcement learning under the general function approximation setting, demonstrating sample efficiency.

One of the results in this work focuses on the hybrid (offline and online data) version of the DR-RL problem. I thank the authors of this submission for citing my earlier work (Panaganti, K., Xu, Z., Kalathil, D., & Ghavamzadeh, M. \"Robust reinforcement learning using offline data.\" NeurIPS 2022) that is focusing on the offline version of the DR-RL problem. I am thrilled to see this ICLR 2026 submission focuses on the complete online version of the DR-RL problem.\n\nHowever, the overlap between this ICLR 2026 submission and the published Panaganti et al. (ICML 2024) paper is significant and covers the core problem formulation, key technical definitions, and the main theoretical proof structures.

Add a thorough citation and acknowledgement of the Panaganti et al. (ICML 2024) paper. \n2. Reframe the contributions of this submission to clearly delineate what is novel versus what has already been established by that foundational work.

(ICML 2024) paper is also an online setting for the total-variation case.)\n3. Actual placement of this work in comparison to the Panaganti et al. (ICML 2024) paper.
