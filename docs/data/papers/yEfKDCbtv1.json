To address this challenge, we construct structure-preserving metrics that are geodesically complete while ensuring that every stationary point under the new metric remains stationary under the original one. Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from an intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold’s geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $\\epsilon$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $\\epsilon$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting.  Empirical studies on synthetic problems confirm our theoretical findings, and experiments on a practical mesh optimization task demonstrate that our framework maintains stable convergence even in the absence of geodesic completeness.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["zeroth-order optimization", "riemannian optimization", "stochastic gradient descent"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c4c420a659136f067aeb07fa45034453135fa689.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/81bc3ae9c9cc1ae46a09d395dd4ecc5d466de106.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors consider the minimization of a real-valued smooth function on a manifold, using only function evaluations.

There exist algorithms that rely on the exponentail mapping, but do not account for this fact. Unless the manifold is proved to be geodesically complete, that is the exponential mapping is defined for any tangent vector, such algorithms are ill-defined (theoretical guarantees are not applicable, possible breakdown in practice).\n- A theoretical guarantee that the metric of a geodesically incomplete manifold may modified such that it becomes geodesically complete, while preserving the stationary points of any function to be minimized (Th. 2.2).\n- a zero-th order gradient estimator that relies on two function evaluations, two geodesic computation, and a sampling routine on the tangent space.

However, the introduction does not provide any practical situations where this situation occurs.

This does not account for the additional complexity of the rejection sampling, relative to the rescale sampling. As such, the plots does not inform on the performance of the complete method (SGD + gradient sampling scheme).\n- Experiments, sec 3.3: authors compare variants of SGD relative to the number of iterations, with four different strategies for the update.
