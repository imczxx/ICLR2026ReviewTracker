This paper formalizes this conjecture. Specifically, we establish precise conditions for cluster structure preservation and derive bounds to quantify its extent. Through this analysis we are able to show that certain neural networks are learning parameters that preserve the clustering structure of the original data in their embeddings, without the need to impose mechanisms to promote this behavior. Extensive numerical analysis and experiments validate our results. Our findings offer deeper insight into neural network behavior, explaining why certain data types (such as images, audio, and text) benefit more from deep learning. Beyond theory, our findings guide better initialization, feature encoding, and regularization strategies.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Clustering", "Subspace", "Neural Networks", "Activation Functions", "Preserving Structure"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cc8929a32b860ae0241e91f8df591212bd172ac7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper theoretically investigates the ability of certain neural networks to preserve subspace clustering structures and formalizes this conjecture using empirical research."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The mathematical analysis in the paper is confusing. Symbols used in proofs are not clearly defined or without any interpretation. For example, the norm of the matrix, $\\| Z\\|$ and $\\| Z \\|_\\infty$ are not clearly defined, $\\sin (\\Theta)$ is not clearly defined. Even worse, the projection $P$ and $W$ are also not clear.   \n\n2. The derivations in the proofs are incorrect. \n- For example, in the proof of Lemma 4.1, the third equality seems incorrect. How to build the equality from a trace of the two projected matrix to the squared Frobenius norm of them? \n- In the proof of Lemma 4.2, the reviewer cannot see how \"plugging this and (5) in (6) we obtain the lemma.\" The reviewer cannot obtain the result in Lemma 4.2. The proof for Lemma 4.2 are wrong.  Moreover, for the matrix $W$, it is weight matrix, without any implicit assumption on the rank (if not specially claimed). \n\n3. Regarding to Theorem: It is not clear how the condition of $\\delta_1$ which is defined as the singular value gap of $X$ and $X^\\ast$ is actually used. \n\n4. The empirical evaluations are insufficient and incomplete. How the neural networks are trained actually? Which loss function is used? Are the empirical results obtained from the synthetic data generalizable in a broad sense, or it is just because of the special structure of the synthetic data? The way to generate the synthetic data is to form a set of nearly orthogonal subspaces. \n\n5. Is the initialization of $W$ reasonable? What happens if $W$ is initialized with an iid Gaussian of zero mean and variance of $1/m$? From the viewpoint of the reviewer, it is more natural and making sense, or even with nice property.  Why initialize $W$ with i.i.d. uniform entries in the range of $(- \\sqrt(m), \\sqrt(m))$? \n\n6. The worse results in Fig.2 (right panel) are not clearly interpreted.  In Fig. 5, why CNN and Transformers are failed to preserve the clustering structure? How the clustering accuracy is obtained in Fig.4?  \n\n7.
