Recently, explainable FL (XFL) has gained traction, aiming to generate semantically-rich latent representations that enhance interpretability of predictions. However, obtaining such representations typically requires large amounts of labeled data, which limits its applicability. Active learning, which reduces labeling cost by querying the most informative samples, is a promising solution. Existing federated active learning (FAL) methods mainly exploit model uncertainty for data selection. They mostly overlook the interactions and training dynamics of local and global models in data selection. This shortcoming can lead to suboptimal performance and reduced explainability in XFL settings. In this paper, we propose a novel explainable FAL framework - \\underline{Fed}erated \\underline{M}inimax \\underline{A}ctive \\underline{D}ata \\underline{S}election (Fed-MADS). The method leverages the information bottleneck technique to analyze model training dynamics, wherein a variational distribution is introduced and proposed to be implemented using the global model, making the approach well suited to the XFL setting. Then, a minimax objective is designed to identify unlabeled data points exhibiting significant divergence between local and global models in both latent representations and predicted labels.

The primary strength of this paper is the novel application of the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle to the problem of active data selection in a federated setting. While IB has been used to analyze deep learning and federated learning, its use to derive a concrete query strategy for FAL is new and provides a fresh theoretical perspective that moves beyond conventional uncertainty-based methods.\n\n2. The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The overall framework is clearly depicted in Figure 1, and the proposed algorithm is concisely summarized in Algorithm 1. The motivation for the work is well-articulated in the introduction.\n\n3. The problem of data-efficient training for explainable models in a privacy-preserving context is highly significant. If the claims hold, this work would represent a valuable contribution by providing a principled and effective method to reduce labeling costs in XFL, making it more practical for real-world applications."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The claim that the selection strategy is \"derived from the IB principle\" is overstated. The derivation involves a critical approximation step that lacks rigorous justification. Specifically, the transition from Eq. (10) to Eq. (11) $E_{z\\sim P(z)}[H_{p_d,q_d}(y|z;\\theta_2,\\mu_2)]\\approx E_{x\\sim P(x)}E_{z\\sim p_e(z|x;\\theta_1)}[H_{p_d,q_d}(y|z;\\theta_2,\\mu_2)]$ is not theoretically sound without strong, unstated assumptions. The expectation over the marginal distribution $P(z)$ is replaced by an expectation over the empirical data distribution $P(x)$ and the local model's encoder. This seems to be a heuristic choice made for computational convenience to arrive at a sample-wise score, rather than a principled derivation. This leap of faith undermines the theoretical foundation of the entire method, making it appear more as a well-motivated heuristic with a post-hoc IB justification.\n\n2. The final selection score, $Score(x)=DKL(latent)~+\\beta * CE(prediction)$, essentially boils down to selecting samples where the local (student) and global (teacher) models disagree. This \"disagreement-based\" querying is a classic and well-explored idea in the active learning literature (e.g., query-by-committee). Methods like KSAS also explicitly use the divergence between local and global model predictions. The paper fails to adequately differentiate its core mechanism from these existing ideas, beyond the IB framing. Given the weak derivation, the contribution risks being perceived as an incremental variant of disagreement-based sampling.\n\n3. The paper explicitly states that the study \"focuses on horizontal FL scenarios with i.i.d. data\" (Line 118). This is a major limitation that severely curtails the significance and generalizability of the results. Data heterogeneity (non-i.i.d. data) is a fundamental and defining challenge in federated learning. In a non-i.i.d. setting, a large divergence between a local and global model could simply be due to the client's local data distribution shift, rather than the sample being genuinely informative for the global task. The proposed Fed-MADS method might be systematically biased towards selecting samples from clients with unique data distributions, which may not be optimal for improving the global model. Ignoring the non-i.i.d. case makes the evaluation feel incomplete and unrealistic for the FL domain."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could the authors provide a more rigorous justification for the approximation made between Eq. (10) and Eq. (11)? What are the underlying assumptions required for this approximation to hold, and how do they affect the validity of the final objective? Without this, the connection to the IB principle feels tenuous.\n\n2. The core idea of selecting samples based on local-global model disagreement is shared with other methods. For instance, KSAS also measures the KL-divergence between local and global predictions. Could you please elaborate on the fundamental difference between Fed-MADS and other disagreement-based FAL methods? Why is the inclusion of the latent representation divergence (the $s_1$ term) critical, and why is the IB formulation superior to a more direct heuristic formulation of model disagreement?\n\n3. The experiments are conducted exclusively on i.i.d. data. This is a critical omission for a paper in federated learning. How do you expect Fed-MADS to perform in a non-i.i.d. setting? Is there a risk that the selection score would be dominated by distribution shift rather than sample informativeness, potentially leading to suboptimal or biased data selection? A discussion or, ideally, preliminary experiments on non-i.i.d. data would be necessary to assess the practical viability of the method."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "7zWvyycdlS", "forum": "3TaaM0p64w", "replyto": "3TaaM0p64w", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12129/Reviewer_8SPU"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12129/Reviewer_8SPU"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12129/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761924715292, "cdate": 1761924715292, "tmdate": 1762923092739, "mdate": 1762923092739, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a simple way to choose which data should be labeled in Federated Learning, where many users train a model together without sharing their raw data.

Therefore, it is important to investigate learning performance for a wider range of number of queries. However, the experiments in the paper only cover a limited range, as illustrated in Figure 1 (a) and (d), where the accuracy has already exceeded 99.8%. Scientific research should also include investigations on scenarios where the proposed method fails, rather than only showing its successful outcomes.\n* The proposed method only selects top-b scores data for label queries (e.g. line 10 in Algorithm 1).
