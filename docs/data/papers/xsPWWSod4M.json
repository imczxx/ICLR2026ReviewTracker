These methods aim to learn a representation of the environment while also incentivizing exploration thereof. However, the role of the representation and mutual information parametrization in MISL is not yet well understood theoretically. Our work investigates MISL through the lens of identifiable representation learning by focusing on the Contrastive Successor Features (CSF) method. We prove that CSF can provably recover the environment's ground-truth features up to a linear transformation due to the inner product parametrization of the features and skill diversity in a discriminative sense. This first identifiability guarantee for representation learning in RL also helps explain the implications of different mutual information objectives and the downsides of entropy regularizers. We empirically validate our claims in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control and show how CSF provably recovers the ground-truth features both from states and pixels.", "tldr": "Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) methods learn identifiable features in reinforcement learning via diverse policies and inner product feature parametrizations", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "representation learning", "identifiability", "ICA", "exploration", "unsupervised skill discovery"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b2e82722b9cb7939e2761c4baa5eb5944f6cd916.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/208d27833af34d311b6330aecff2a53e31e80a7a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper offers an explanation for the effectiveness of skill-learning methods based on mutual information (MISL). The authors provide both theoretical and experimental analyses of how the representations learned by a representative approach (CRL) of MISL relate to the true latent factors of the environment. Their results show that, under certain assumptions, CRL implicitly learns representations that are linearly related to the environment’s underlying latent state.\n\nI believe the paper touches an important topic and provides an interesting and novel analysis on the representations leaned by skill learning methods. However, the writing could be improved and the analysis could be strengthened to support the claims.\n\nWriting:\n- The introduction could be made easier to follow. Some parts would fit better in the related work section, and long citation lists should be avoided. The connection to causality is not entirely clear, and lines 81–89 do not seem directly related to the paper’s main motivation.\n- The explicit definition of identifiability should appear earlier in the manuscript to help readers grasp the theoretical framework. The discussion in the introduction is not sufficiently explicit.\n- I recommend separating the related work from the background section to improve readability and structure.\n- Line 156: This paragraph lacks clarity and could benefit from rephrasing or additional context.\n- Definition 1 (line 171): The proposed definition seems closer to “distinguishability” than “diversity.” Two skills may produce very similar trajectories yet still represent different behaviors. The relationship between this definition and the notion of diversity used in Assumption 1 should be clarified.\n- The statement “Each pair of consecutive states corresponds to one skill” introduces a strong and limiting assumption. This is unlikely to hold in many environments. For instance, an agent might need to traverse a corridor before exploring an area, or operate in an MDP with discrete actions and deterministic transitions. A more thorough discussion of such edge cases would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, the connection to the statement line 293 is unclear.\n- In Figure 2 (right), the direction of the arrows is ambiguous and should be clarified.\n- First paragraph of Section 3.2. I do not catch why z and feature representations could be antipodal by maximizing their dot product.\n- In Section 3, the example at line 241 is particularly helpful and could be emphasized earlier in the section. However, the statement \"to distinguish data under different distribution shifts or interventions\" is not \"intuitive\".\n\nExperiments:\n- In Figure 3, using features or feature differences do not induce meaningful difference in identifiability. This should be discussed. Overall, it lacks a baseline that gives indications of what is a high identifiability.\n- The authors should formally define state coverage in the manuscript. \n- The authors rightly note that the R2 score is influenced by state coverage, but the CDR² curve remains difficult to interpret and, in practice, seems to primarily reflect coverage rather than the main contribution of this work.To clarify this point, the authors should compute the R2 score over a set of presampled agent positions, either manually defined or extracted from trajectories of trained DRL agents. Optionally, they could separately evaluate the R2 for covered and uncovered states to analyze potential generalization properties of the learned representations.\n- From Figure D1, it seems relatively easy to achieve high identifiability in these experiments. The metric starts very high, drops sharply when learning begins, and then rises again. This pattern raises concerns that learning state-related representations might be too simple in these environments, and therefore not representative of more complex scenarios. Some environments include objects, i.e. parts of the true state that are relatively difficult to manipulate and represent. To strengthen the paper’s validity, the authors should include a correlation coefficient that relates to only these parts of the state space and discuss the result with respect to the ability of the agent to reach these states."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper makes an original contribution, supported by both theoretical and experiment results."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The writing should be improved and the analysis should be strengthened."}, "questions": {"value": "Please, see above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "sHmzmAi0di", "forum": "xsPWWSod4M", "replyto": "xsPWWSod4M", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12598/Reviewer_YV3A"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12598/Reviewer_YV3A"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12598/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761833855552, "cdate": 1761833855552, "tmdate": 1762923447223, "mdate": 1762923447223, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates identifiability in mutual information skill learning and contrastive successor features (CSF).

Namely, is it common that \"each state difference is equiprobable\"? What is the support for this claim?\n2. **Transitions are typically not skills**: The authors also assume that \"each pair of consecutive states is a skill\". I believe that this is not a typical definition of skills. Skills are often defined on a longer time horizon and so single-step transitions are not wholly descriptive of what is traditionally called a skill. Further, there is literature that demonstrates that the controllable state (i.e., features that are affected by actions) are not identifiable using single-step transitions (see [1]). With that in mind, i believe it is not reasonable to define skills as (s,s') pairs.\n3. **Lacking explanation for necessity of inner product parameterization**: The authors repeatedly claim that the inner product parameterization is important for identifiability, but do not share any evidence towards this end. Is there a specific result that they found that would indicate this? Or is this notion sourced from previous literature?\n4. It is not clear to me why $I(s; z)$ or $I(s_0, s; z)$ are reasonable alternatives to $I(s, s'; z)$ as the former two information quantities would imply things about the visitation distributions alone. Is there a valid reason to consider these as alternatives to $I(s, s'; z)$?\n\n### Minor Weaknesses\n\n1. The authors claim that  $\\phi(s) - \\phi(s')$ is typically a learning target (line 161). Can the authors point to a method that uses such a construction? Are the authors are referring to metric-based methods like value implicit pre-training where $\\|phi(s) - \\phi(g) \\| $ is used?\n2. It believe it would be good to see actual MSE on extracted states as opposed to the correlation coefficients. In my experience, it is very possible to extract the ground truth state from encoded images in DM Control.\n### Nitpicks\nLine 267 has colon at end of line"}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the weaknesses section for my questions about the work."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "F1DSlPmrr4", "forum": "xsPWWSod4M", "replyto": "xsPWWSod4M", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12598/Reviewer_vUpn"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12598/Reviewer_vUpn"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12598/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761954432925, "cdate": 1761954432925, "tmdate": 1762923444331, "mdate": 1762923444331, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work aims demonstrate that the causal features of an environment can be identified using contrastive successor features from up to a linear transformation.

Interconnection does not produce a distinction between decisionmaking with scalar rewards (RL) and cause-effect models. \n\nTraditionally, unsupervised skill discovery is in the setting of fully observed MDPs rather than partially observed, so the focus on identificability results is somewhat jarring. This focus could be introduced a bit earlier rather that in the description of ICA.\n\nDoes the definition of diversity (definition 1) really capture the meaning? It seems like diversity should also cover some description of the breadth of skills, but in this case any pair of skill parameters is sufficient for diversity. Maybe a term such as distinguishable is more appropriate.\n\nWhile CSF is a meaningful algorithm, is it really \"prototypical\" (l183) of MISL methods? In many cases it is closer to a representation learning algorithmm with a skill parameter added to it, rather than a MISL algorithm which often has the representation learning component built into the skill learning.\n\nIt makes sense that the assumptions are required to guarantee identifiability, but in order to make the claim that identificability is robust to assumption violations in practice it does not seem sufficient to simply claim success in other fields, since RL is a significant different setting, especially since the agent is part of the data generating process. Is there some stronger evidnece to suggest robustness to assumption violations, especially theoretically.\n\nTHe fact that Empirical observations show that the fatures of consecutive observations are close is not entirely convincing universally, since in many cases with locomotion tasks that these algorithms are tested on, the observations are often visually close together as well (an ant moving around will have similar appearances), so this closeness could just be a consequence of this. \n\nWhile it is certainly the case that I(s,s';z) is more stable to optimize, it seems like this state difference may not always be the best choice for representing a variety of different policies, since identifying policies from their state difference means that it can be hard to distinguish when policies should start changing their direction.\n\nThe experimental domains are sufficeint for demonstrating that the underlying state is discovered, though they are certainly not complete. In particular these environments focus on motion planning with various morphologies, not on the manipulation of different eleemtns in the domain, of whose underlying state might be much harder to describe, especially when randomly initialized.\n\nIs the true underlying state really the state of the joints in mujoco, since to some extent this also is a layer of abstraction abouve the length of the joints or the shape of the agent."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "yoNZ1CD4Gi", "forum": "xsPWWSod4M", "replyto": "xsPWWSod4M", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12598/Reviewer_o5Lj"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12598/Reviewer_o5Lj"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12598/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761973202837, "cdate": 1761973202837, "tmdate": 1762923443904, "mdate": 1762923443904, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Despite the popularity of mutual information skill learning (MISL) methods in RL, they are not theoretically well understood.
