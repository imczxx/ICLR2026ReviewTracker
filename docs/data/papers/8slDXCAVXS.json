Our unified framework provides a streamlined approach for constructing coresets and offers significant runtime improvements in applications such as clustering, regression, and low-rank approximation.

Our approach achieves a better dependence on $d$ and constructs smaller coresets that only consist of points in the dataset, compared to recent results of [Xue, Chen, Li and Jiang, ICML'23].\n    \n* **$\\ell_p$ regression:** For $\\ell_p$ regression problems $\\min_{x\\in \\mathbb{R}^d}\\\\|Ax-b\\\\|_p$ where $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$ and $b\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, we construct an $\\epsilon$-coreset of size $\\widetilde O_p(d^{\\max\\\\{1, p/2\\\\}}\\epsilon^{-2})$ in time $\\widetilde O_p(n^{0.5}d^{\\max\\{0.5, p/4\\}+1}(\\epsilon^{-3}+d^{0.5}))$, improving upon the prior best quantum sampling approach of [Apers and Gribling, QIP'24] for all $p\\in (0, 2)\\cup (2, 22]$, including the widely studied least absolute deviation regression ($\\ell_1$ regression).\n    \n* **Low-rank approximation with Frobenius norm error:** We introduce the first quantum sublinear-time algorithm for low-rank approximation that approximates the best rank-$k$ solution to a matrix $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{d\\times n}$ and does not rely on data-dependent parameters, and runs in $\\widetilde O(nd^{0.5}k^{0.5}\\epsilon^{-1})$ time.

The standard approach performs a weighted sampling procedure where each point is drawn with probability $s_i = \\max_{x\\in X} \\frac{cost(A_i,x)}{cost(A,x)}$, called *sensitivity*, and assigns weight $1/s_i$ to the drawn point which has sample complexity $O(\\epsilon^{-2}(\\sum_{i=1}^n s_i) \\text{dim X} \\log(1/\\delta))$ to find an $\\epsilon$ coreset with probability at least $1-\\delta$. Since the computation of $s_i$ requires a pass over each element of $A$, this process has $O(n)$ dependency. The goal of the paper is to reduce $n$ dependency to sub-linear by using quantum computing techniques, mainly quantum amplitude amplification/Grover's search. The authors give hybrid algorithms to construct coreset for various problems including clustering, regression and low rank approximation.\n\nThe main ingredient seems to be the recursive procedure to do weighted sampling originally used by Apers &Gribling in the context of quantum linear programming.

As the bottleneck to obtain sublinear runtimes is due to sensitivity computation, it is natural to consider quantum algorithms which are known to give speedups for similar problems. Although the quantum part of the algorithm is previously known, the paper has still include novelty as the previous work did not address the problems considered here. Some of submodules such as quantum weighted sampling could be seen as an independent tool that could be used for different problems in the future although it was developed in previous works.\n\nEach algorithm has been given in detail in the appendix as pseudocode and the analysis seem to be thorough and correct. The paper does not provide empirical evidence, yet at this stage the proposed algorithms cannot be implemented on the existing hardware because of error overheads.

Without this input model, the quantum state needs to be prepared from scratch which adds additional loop to each of these algorithms. It seems that the previous paper by Apers & Gribling also have this input model, and the remark in that paper states that this assumption can be removed by paying poly cost in *time* which can potentially remove the claimed speedup over classical algorithms. Note that this is not  very important in Apers & Gribling paper as their claim is on the *query complexity* not time. If this remark is not applicable in this paper, this has to be discussed and justified properly. \n\nIt is also known that realizing QRAM structure might be challenging. From the theoretical perspective, it is completely valid to assume this structure; however this also needs to be highlighted in the main text. The paper also claims that the runtime is independent of data set parameters. However, the loading to QRAM initially might have data dependent overhead. Similarly input representation depends on how QRAM is implemented, therefore it becomes important whether we can load this set to QRAM. \n\n\nIt is also not clear how Grover’s algorithm is incorporated into different classical algorithms. Although the main body introduces the Grover’s algorithm, it is not clear at intuitive level how each application makes use of QSample routine,. Along the lines of my previous comment, it seems that QRAM model also makes the algorithms somewhat straightforward (not to trivialize the contribution of the paper but I would think without QRAM, the algorithms might need significant modification)."}, "questions": {"value": "Questions/Suggestions\n\n1. The runtime $T_\\text{sensitivity}$ does not seem to be instantiated for the specific problems in the main text and details seem to be postponed.

Maybe this is natural since it contains too many results. I appreciate the high-level technical overview in Section 2; however, I found that the technical overview is still very technical. Reading Section 2 doesn't help with grasping the intuition; I would rather directly read the appendices. I think the authors should work on improving the presentation in this section.\n\nIn addition, the presentation lacks clarity. For example, in Line 57, is the number of samples here the size of the coreset? In Line 84, does the final sample size mean the same thing? In Lines 164-165, is the $s$ (upper bound on the total weight) the same as the $s$ in Line 84, and also the $s$ in Line 315? In Lines 220-222, the description of the sampling process is rather confusing. Why not just use the language of \"sampling a subset\" as in Apers & Gribling (2024)? In Line 233, the matrix $S$ is not defined. In Lines 243-244, \"uniformly sample half of the points from $A'$\" should be stated more precisely here.\n\nBesides the presentation issues, there's a more critical technical flaw. In the statement of the theorems, a classical oracle that outputs an estimation of sensitivity (or weights) is assumed. However, in Grover's algorithm, one needs a quantum oracle. If a classical subroutine (a classical white-box) is given, additional work needs to be done: one first needs to turn the classical subroutine into a quantum circuit, and then clean the garbage during the conversion by uncomputing the ancillas. It could be more complicated when the classical subroutine generates approximations of the true value with a success probability (like Algorithms 4, 5, 6). In this case, the corresponding quantum oracle will produce a superposition of an estimate (with bounded approximation ratio) and some garbage state. Also, the portion corresponding to the desired estimate itself is a superposition of different approximations. Maybe I am wrong, but I don't think directly plugging this oracle into Grover's algorithm will produce the correct state. Some additional steps need to be done, including concentrating the estimate using the median trick. Also, a careful error analysis of the quantum algorithm with this concentrated oracle should be done to prove the correctness of the entire approach.\n\nThere are other minor things:\n1. In the second and third bullet points of the abstract, $n, d, k$ are not defined.\n2. In Theorem 1.1, a quantum algorithm is randomized, so there's no need to say a \"randomized\" quantum algorithm\n3.
