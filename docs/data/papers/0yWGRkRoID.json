However, progress in this field is hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from 2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS (Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale, publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 15 geographically and culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a wide range of POI models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and equitable research in human mobility and POI trajectory modeling.

Therefore, developing a new public dataset with recent movement patterns, high diversity, and enriched semantics is highly meaningful for POI-related research.\n\n2.\tFor POI modeling, existing datasets are often outdated, of low quality, lack regional diversity, or are not publicly available. The paper provides a thorough analysis of these limitations in existing POI datasets.\n\n3.\tThe paper is clearly written and easy to follow, demonstrating good organization and readability."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.\tAlthough the dataset provides diverse data sources, it remains challenging for models to effectively learn from this diversity in Massive-STEPS. As shown in Table 3, each model is evaluated on a single sub-dataset of Massive-STEPS, resulting in no substantial difference in data usage compared to other datasets.\n\n2.\tMassive-STEPS is derived from the STD dataset with several preprocessing steps, such as trajectory grouping, city-level matching, and filtering. However, the transformation from STD to Massive-STEPS appears to be more of a data aggregation process rather than the construction of a fundamentally new dataset. Similar improvements in recency and diversity could potentially be achieved by aggregating existing POI datasets. Thus, the novelty of the dataset is somewhat limited.\n\n3.\tThe paper would benefit from including additional descriptive statistics—such as the average trajectory length, mean sampling interval, or metrics that capture trajectory sparsity—to provide a clearer understanding of the dataset’s characteristics."}, "questions": {"value": "1.\tThe authors claim that existing datasets suffer from low data quality.

Its purpose is to address critical limitations in current human mobility research, which heavily relies on outdated datasets from 2012–2013 and is disproportionately focused on a handful of cities like New York and Tokyo. Furthermore, many existing datasets suffer from poor data quality (e.g., GSCD contains nearly 50% erroneous entries) and lack reproducibility. To address these issues, Massive-STEPS is built upon the high-quality STD dataset, providing data across 15 geographically and culturally diverse cities, including understudied regions. The dataset incorporates both recent (2017–2018) and earlier (2012–2013) check-in data, spanning a total duration of 24 months. It is further semantically enriched using Foursquare OS Places data, supplementing metadata such as POI coordinates, names, and addresses.
