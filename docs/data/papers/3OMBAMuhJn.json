To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities. \nTo learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task. \nSpecifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains. \nExtensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSB achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Transfer learning", "Domain adaptation", "Heterogeneous-modal unsupervised domain adaptation"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9f14537a93b7547a828f694bd03163574811670a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/bbdb013e7940a8394052a91ac30d77a231014122.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a Heterogeneous UDA method that aims to transfer knowledge across two different modalities from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.

However, the proposed bridge domain introduces a strict limitation, as it requires data from both modalities corresponding to the same input.

The work would be more meaningful if the authors could extend the setting to other modality pairs, such as visible–infrared.\n\n- 2D–3D UDA for segmentation has already been explored in several prior studies.

Moreover, using EMA to stabilize knowledge transfer between networks has also been extensively explored in previous works [5][6].

It would be interesting to investigate how the method performs when the source and target domains each consist of multiple datasets within the same modality, i.e., whether intra-modality domain differences could lead to performance degradation: S = {(x^{s_1}, y_{s_1}), (x^{s_2}, y_{s_2})}, T = {x^{t_1}, x^{t_2}}.\nSince autonomous driving data are typically collected under diverse driving conditions, it is difficult to ensure that all samples originate from the same domain.
