While video datasets inherently contain greater redundancy, existing video dataset distillation methods primarily focus on compression in the pixel space, overlooking advances in the latent space that have been widely adopted in modern text-to-image and text-to-video models. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a novel video dataset distillation approach that operates in the latent space using state-of-the-art variational auto-encoders. Furthermore, we employ a diversity-aware data selection strategy to select both representative and diverse samples. Additionally, we introduce a simple, training-free method to further compress the distilled latent dataset. By combining these techniques, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performances in video dataset distillation, outperforming prior methods on all datasets, e.g. on HMDB51 IPC 1, we achieve a 2.6\\% performance increase; on MiniUCF IPC 5, we achieve a 7.8\\% performance increase.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Dataset Distillation", "Video Distillation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/79bbb7ae50ae7fa2e56c500f0a70b6eb2e0cb208.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/caa64627124cc30fc39f39e5b6099aff6da32174.pdf"}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
