Prior work on symmetry discovery broadly falls into two categories: methods that prioritize Lie-algebraic structure but operate on static datasets rather than dynamical systems, and methods that discover symmetries for dynamical systems but often do not enforce algebraic structure. Across both threads, most approaches also neglect the infinitesimal invariance condition (IIC)—that prolonged generators annihilate the governing equations. To fill this gap, we introduce LieDynNet, which learns Lie symmetry generators directly from data by pairing neural ODE/PDE models with two families of constraints: dynamical validity, enforced both via IIC (via generator prolongations) and under finite flows; and algebraic soundness, enforcing closure, antisymmetry, and the Jacobi identity so the generators form a Lie algebra. The framework is model-agnostic and applies to both ODEs and PDEs without hand-crafted priors. On canonical dynamical systems, LieDynNet recovers symmetry algebras and associated invariants from data, showing that learned symmetries can be simultaneously algebraically consistent and dynamically faithful. These results provide a practical, data-driven route to discovering the symmetry structure of complex dynamical phenomena.", "tldr": "LieDynNet learns Lie symmetry generators for unknown ODEs/PDEs from data by pairing neural dynamics surrogates with IIC and Lie-algebra constraints, validated by finite flows, to recover symmetry algebras and invariants.", "keywords": ["Lie Symmetries", "Dynamical Systems", "ODE/PDEs", "Neural Networks", "Unsupervised Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/732926aa0e39a66155b76e5c90c6de9bb331a176.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3bee408efa70ba51a279ff828a4fa2f0d362b2d9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper addresses discovering the Lie symmetries of dynamical systems.

Part of the contributions claimed in this work are already present in existing papers. For example, Forestano et al have introduced the *closure* loss (the 4th item in your list of learning objectives), and Ko et al have introduced the flow-based loss (the 2nd item in your list).\n\nAlso, the authors mentioned that the method is *prior-free*, as opposed to Ko et al, which requires the governing equations to evaluate the symmetry validity loss. However, as stated in L206-207, your method trains a PINN as a surrogate, which also involves the differential equation. While the subsequent step of learning vector fields does not require this prior knowledge, this is not true for the entire method with all components combined.\n\n## Soundness\n\nThe method for learning the vector fields is basically to parameterize them using neural networks and introduce different loss terms to ensure they meet certain conditions. However, certain design choices and the motivations behind them remain elusive to me. Specifically:\n* According to the infinitesimal criterion of Lie point symmetry, the finite group symmetry is equivalent to the infinitesimal invariance $v(F)=0$. Is it necessary to use both infinitesimal invariance and flow-based validity then? What would happen if only one of them were included in loss?\n* How are the structure constants $c_{ij}^k$ computed? From the fact that you introduced a constancy loss, I suppose they are outputs of some neural net that takes points in jet space as input. However, structure constants, as the name suggests, should be constant regardless of where the vector fields are evaluated. Why not just make them learnable constants? Or compute them differentiably as the solution to minimizing the closure loss? What are the pros and cons of these different approaches?\n* For PDEs, the proposed method trains a PINN to directly fit the solutions. Can you do the same thing for ODEs? What is the advantage of fitting the vector field $f_\\theta$ instead?\n\n## Experiments\n\n* In some dynamical systems considered in the experiments, only 1 infinitesimal generator is trained. In this case, those additional loss terms such as closure become unnecessary. Also, for those experiments, the infinitesimal generators approximately correspond to the time translation symmetry, which can be readily recovered from the equation or the surrogate model itself.\n* The paper does not provide sufficient evaluation of the trained infinitesimal generators. The figures only show the trajectories of transformed solutions and claim that the *shapes* of the transformed solutions remain similar, but this does not guarantee that the transformed solutions are still solutions to the same equation at all. I'd suggest including the residual error from substituting the transformed solutions into the differential equations to show whether they are indeed the symmetry of the differential equations by definition. Similarly, the vector fields are visualized for the simple harmonic oscillator, but readers might not be able to interpret the meaning of these vector fields just by looking at those plots. Do they match the ground truth 8-dimensional symmetry of this system? What are the structure constants of the discovered generators? Are they closed under Lie brackets? All of these are required to assess if the discovered symmetry is correct or not.\n* There is no baseline comparison, which is also a critical issue.\n\n## Presentation\n* The methodology and the experiment sections can be organized better. For example, I'd suggest moving L301-320 to the method section and focusing on showing and explaining results in the experiment section.\n* Math writing needs to be more clear and precise. For example, write out the actual formula for the text in the equation $L_\\text{flow}$; define the $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ and $\\lambda_\\text{min}$ explicitly in L256; check for typos such as the missing subscript in the vector field in L376.\n* Table 3 is not very informative."}, "questions": {"value": "see Weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "eBPaA78BjI", "forum": "VgZ8BJkneV", "replyto": "VgZ8BJkneV", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23491/Reviewer_MMrc"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23491/Reviewer_MMrc"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23491/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760658890704, "cdate": 1760658890704, "tmdate": 1762942680760, "mdate": 1762942680760, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces LieDynNet, a prior-free framework for learning Lie point symmetries of unknown ODE and PDEs directly from spatiotemporal data.

This design is principled but increases optimization complexity and computational cost. The paper outlines practical training schedules and JVP-based implementations, yet it omits runtime or memory benchmarks.
