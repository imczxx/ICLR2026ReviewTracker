While effective in one-shot settings, extending Bayesian persuasion to real-world long-term interactions becomes NP-hard.\nA separate empirical mismatch is also evident, where people tend to be much more truthful in practice than the signaling scheme predicted by Bayesian persuasion equilibria.\nTo address these issues, we first prove that long-term Bayesian persuasion can be decomposed into a bargaining stage and a realization stage while preserving optimality and equilibria. This decomposition disentangles the previously conflated informational and first-mover advantages of the sender. Based on the results, we establish a unified, realistic, and fairness-oriented framework called \\emph{information bargaining}. \nVariants of bargaining-game settings and their associated solution concepts, such as the Nash cooperative bargaining model and the Nash bargaining solution, can be applied directly to persuasion games to yield more realistic models.\nTo validate our framework, we identify and employ capable reasoning LLMs that can solve persuasion game equilibria effectively. In long-term persuasion task variants and in the corresponding bargaining game variants, these capable LLMs demonstrate that they reach the same equilibrium.", "tldr": "We show that variants of bargaining-game settings and their corresponding solution concepts can be applied to persuasion games to create more realistic persuasion models, thereby introducing fairness and Pareto optimality.", "keywords": ["Information Bargaining", "Bayesian Persuasion", "Bargaining Games", "Fairness", "Large Language Models"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f5a253884778ddd8f0963751ef699f279e6f801a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/0d320399e7933b272bded1ad0504f7b638e30ba3.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a framework that modifies the Bayesian persuasion framework by adding elements of bargaining theory.

I find neither the proposed model nor the empirical results convincing in their current form.\n\nStarting with the model. The paper augments the standard Bayesian persuasion framework with an additional bargaining phase. However, the motivation for this modification is not discussed. The discussion around lines 52 and 58–60 does not provide a solid justification, nor does it cite evidence for the “truthfulness discrepancy” it mentions. Since this is a substantial departure from the standard model, a more convincing argument is needed to explain why the extension is necessary. At present the modification may appear ad hoc, with the byproduct of having a setup for LLM-based experiments.\n\nThe proposed framework also introduces strong assumptions that are not discussed or justified. In particular, the assumption of complete mutual knowledge of preferences (e.g., the receiver knowing the sender’s utility function) is quite restrictive and not standard in Bayesian persuasion. The paper should discuss why this is reasonable, since most of the subsequent discussion is based on this assumption. \n\nIn terms of exposition, the model description is vague and not formal. The paper repeatedly refers to “long-term persuasion” but never clearly defines what this means, nor does it relate the setup to existing formulations of online Bayesian persuasion (in case “long-term” refers to this). Similarly, the repeated claim that the proposed decomposition “does not change optimality or equilibrium” is stated without formal proof or explanation. \n\nThe theoretical insights are quite weak in their current form. Section 3 mainly states straightforward implications of giving both players full information about expected payoffs. Lemma 4.3 is a simple observation once the assumptions are granted and does not represent a substantive theoretical contribution. \n\nThe empirical validation adds little to the argument.

This is an interesting observation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "(1) The paper's first contribution is claimed to be \"We show that long-term persuasion problems can be decomposed into a bargaining stage and a realization stage without affecting optimality or equilibria\".  I don't think this claim is supported well mathematically.\n\n(1.1) First, the \"long-term persuasion problem\" is never mathematically defined. Section 2 defines one-shot Bayesian persuasion and cheap talk games.  And Section 4 directly introduces a model of \"long-term persuasion with two stages (bargaining and realization)\".  I thought the authors wanted to show that \"long-term persuasion problem __(without bargaining)__ can be decomposed into a bargaining stage and a realization stage\". However, \"long-term persuasion problem\" (without bargaining) is never defined, in my understanding.  \n\n(1.2) Then, I tried to read Lemma 4.3 to understand what this claim truly means.  The lemma says that a Bayesian persuasion task is reducible to a bargaining game, where \"reducible\" means any solution concept in bargaining game can be turned into a solution concept in Bayesian persuasion game.  There are two issues with this lemma:\n\n  (1.2.1) The Bayesian persuasion game in this lemma is not the traditional Bayesian persuasion game where only the sender has commitment power; instead, it is a game with joint commitment where the receiver can also commit.  So, this lemma is proving \"BP with joint commitment can be reduced to bargaining game\", instead of \"classical BP can be reduced to bargaining game\".  BP with joint commitment is unconventional and lacks motivation: why does the receiver have commitment power?  I think the authors might want to do the reduction in the opposite direction: showing that the bargaining game can be reduced to BP with joint commitment.  Given that reduction, we can then use BP with joint commitment to study the bargaining game (which is a more natural problem than BP with joint commitment in my opinion). \n\n  (1.2.2) The bargaining game constructed in this reduction (in Appendix E) is trivial: it only contains the joint payoff profile $(R^i, R^j)$ that is induced by the sender's signaling scheme and the receiver's response in the solution of the Bayesian persuasion problem (with joint commitment).  Because the bargaining game only contains this profile, then clearly any solution concept of the bargaining game will pick this solution, making the argument trivial.  Usually, a bargaining game should contain a set $\\mathbb Y$ of multiple feasible agreements, and a solution concept picks an agreement from $\\mathbb Y$.  The bargaining game is meaningful only when $\\mathbb Y$ contains multiple agreements, but the bargaining game in this lemma only has a single agreement.  The correct argument should, in my opinion, consider the bargaining game where the feasible set of agreements consists of the payoff profiles associated with all feasible pairs of signaling scheme and receiver response, and argue that the bargaining solution concept picks the agreement that is equal to the BP solution.  \n\n\n\n(2) The paper's second contribution is \"We clarify two advantages that have been conflated in Bayesian persuasion, namely the sender's information advantage and the first-mover advantage\".  It's unclear to me how these two advantages are \"clarified\" mathematically.  Do you mean that, when one advantage is removed, the solution of Bayesian persuasion will change?  And the sender's payoff will decrease when the advantage is removed?  These two advantages are already known in previous literature. The long-term Bayesian persuasion problem considered in this paper seems to still allow the sender to have these two advantages.  I don't know if this paper provides any new observations about these two advantages."}, "questions": {"value": "## Questions for the authors\n\nAs written in the Weaknesses, I am confused by many parts of this paper.
