Existing RAG methods are largely semantic and typically neglect explicit temporal constraints, which leads to time-inconsistent answers and inflated token usage. We propose STAR-RAG, a temporal GraphRAG framework that relies on two key ideas: building a time-aligned rule graph and conducting propagation on this graph to narrow the search space and prioritize semantically relevant, time-consistent evidence. This design enforces temporal proximity during retrieval, reduces the candidate set of retrieval results, and lowers token consumption without sacrificing accuracy. Compared with existing temporal RAG approaches, STAR-RAG eliminates the need for heavy model training and fine-tuning, thereby reducing computational cost and significantly simplifying deployment.\nExtensive experiments on real-world temporal KG datasets show that our method achieves improved answer accuracy while consuming fewer tokens than strong GraphRAG baselines.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Knowledge graph", "Retrieval-augmented generation", "Large language models"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e90862d319af20da09de8e2fd7d12a93f2bf50bb.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ef62e938f4109ff640003664123b1434088b33ee.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces STAR-RAG, a temporal Graph RAG framework that uses a rule graph to summarize and encode event categories and temporal relations, followed up by a PPR retrieval.

It relies purely on graph summarization and propagation, which makes the approach lightweight, reproducible, and easy to deploy in real RAG systems.\n3.

The MDL-based graph summarization part is mathematically dense and difficult to follow. A more intuitive explanation or illustrative example would help readers understand how multiple events are merged.\n2. Both L_cov/L_time and Hamming components (eq2) are equally weighted, and this could introduce priority mismatches across different query types. For example, in a query such as “What events followed after the signing of the peace agreement in 2018?”, temporal consistency should be the dominant factor—edges that preserve tight chronological alignment should weigh much more heavily than broad event coverage. However, in a more static reasoning query like “Which countries typically cooperate in trade negotiations?”, semantic overlap (relations and entity types) is far more critical, while time alignment matters little. Since STAR-RAG fixes both weights globally, it cannot dynamically adapt to these varying priorities, which may lead to sub-optimal retrievals—either ignoring temporally relevant evidence or including semantically weak connections depending on the query type.\n3. Although STAR-RAG demonstrates strong performance on mid-scale benchmarks such as CronQuestion, Forecast, and MultiTQ, these datasets contain only about 300k–400k temporal events—far smaller than industrial Temporal Knowledge Graphs like ICEWS, Wikidata, or EventKG, which often include millions of timestamped triples. Because the rule-based graph construction relies on Apriori-style relation mining, it remains unclear whether the proposed summarization framework can scale to such large TKGs.\n4. There is no runtime or memory comparison on large temporal graphs, which would better represent real-world scalability. It would be helpful if the paper additionally reported both the theoretical time complexity analysis of each component and empirical measurements of wall-clock runtime and memory footprint on larger datasets."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the weaknesses above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "1QAwOWAiu7", "forum": "kwro5432AI", "replyto": "kwro5432AI", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9430/Reviewer_4PC7"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9430/Reviewer_4PC7"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9430/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761969366481, "cdate": 1761969366481, "tmdate": 1762921028886, "mdate": 1762921028886, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses a key limitation in RAG and GraphRAG frameworks: their inability to handle temporal queries over temporal knowledge graphs.

The method consistently improves performance across three datasets, with particularly strong gains on multi-event queries, demonstrating the importance of temporal alignment.

The framework relies on Apriori-based frequent pattern mining for entity typing, which may fail under sparse or noisy relations and scale poorly for long-tail graphs with many weak patterns.\n2. All QA sets are template-generated from ICEWS/Wikidata. STAR-RAG’s rule graph may align with templated regularities, potentially overstating gains. Including human-written or out-of-template questions, cross-dataset transfer, and adversarial temporal confounds is recommended.\n3. While token savings are notable, retrieval latency and memory footprint for rule graph construction are not fully quantified. Profiling build time (separate from reasoning time) would help assess practicality.\n4. Entity labels generated by Algorithm 2 are static, ignoring temporal dynamics in entity roles. This may lead to an overly coarse or inaccurate rule graph.\n5. The baseline comparison is limited to other GraphRAG methods, omitting prominent LLM+KG approache. This absence makes it unclear if STAR-RAG is superior in accuracy or efficiency to these mainstream methods, weakening the paper's overall claims.\n6.
