Existing I2V methods concatenate the full information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance. We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V, surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Image-to-Video Generation", "Conditional Image Leakage", "Flow Matching", "Latent Shifting", "Fourier Transform"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b9965a88074fdc6c7f2406bebf650158265f625d.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/58d1cef0c6c6a3797c932534a4002d6a6043b2ef.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents FlashI2v, an image-to-video (I2V) generation based on prompts using latent flow models.

As I am not aware of the literature in this area, I am not sure if it is novel or not.\n* The results on OOD scenes seem strong relative to other I2V paradigms.\n* The paper is written clearly and is easy to follow, although motivations for several design choices are missing as detailed next."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* Method:\n  - Motivation to Eq. 7 is missing. While I understand why it makes sense to add the conditional image to the noise, it is less clear why to add it to $x$ as well, which should represent the full video. What should one expect when adding the same frame to all of the video frames (even if done in the latent space)?\n  - If I am not mistaken, there is an error in the author's calculation of Eq. 8 and Eq. 9. Just to verify, to arrive at Eq. 8, the authors isolate $\\epsilon$ in Eq. 5, and assign its value in $z_1^I$? If so, according to my calculations, additional terms are neglected. Similarly, these terms are missing in Eq. 9. Can the authors please clarify their derivation?\n  - Even if the derivation in the last bullet is true, the connection to the actual proposed method in Eq. 11-14 seems contrived. If I am not mistaken, Eq. 11, 13, & 14 can all be derived by changing the boundary condition of the ODE from $x$ at $t=0$ to $x - \\phi(s)$.\n  - Can the authors further clarify the motivation for using $\\phi(s)$ instead of $s$? What do you expect $\\phi(s)$ to learn and represent? If I understand correctly, using $\\phi(s)$ causes losing information about $s$ and to remedy that $s_{high}$ is used. Does that sound right?\n\n* Experiments:\n  - Overall it is hard to assess the quality of this method compared to baseline methods since the NN models are different (at least in the size, perhaps in architecture as well). For instance, it may be that increasing Flash2IV model size will result in lower dynamic degree due to higher overfitting. Conversely, it may be possible that other baselines will benefit in that metric when decreasing the number of parameters. \n  - According to Table 1, the baseline SVD-XT has roughly the same number of parameters as FlashI2V and is comparable to it. Yet, this baseline is missing from all the qualitative comparisons as far as I can tell. Why is that? In which cases is FlashI2V better, and in which cases is SVD-XT? At the current state I do not see an advantage for the proposed method over this baseline.\n  - It seems that the OOD experiment compares different I2V paradigms, yet not FlashI2V to different baselines. I am not sure that it shows that indeed FlashI2v is superior in OOD compared to other baselines as other methods probably have other components in them.\n  - Code is missing from the submission to self-evaluate the method quality and better understand the implementation."}, "questions": {"value": "."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "e3IiqtqrfS", "forum": "9pVOX5UcBV", "replyto": "9pVOX5UcBV", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1846/Reviewer_uPPA"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1846/Reviewer_uPPA"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1846/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761311937445, "cdate": 1761311937445, "tmdate": 1762915911598, "mdate": 1762915911598, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}, "comment": {"value": "Dear reviewers, thank you for your valuable suggestions.

The paper observes that existing I2V models fine-tuned from T2V models suffer from slow motion and color inconsistency compared with their T2V counterparts. It argues that this issue arises from how existing T2V models provide the input image (i.e., the first frame) to the model — by simply concatenating it with noisy latents, which often leads to shortcut learning, where the model directly copies the input condition. To mitigate this, the paper proposes providing the input condition by subtracting it from the noisy inputs and corresponding targets. However, this approach results in slower convergence. To address this, the authors introduce Fourier Guidance, which conditions the model on high-frequency image details extracted through a Fourier transform and concatenated during training. They also remove only magnitude features (not phase) to prevent the model from generating shortcut solutions. By doing so, FlashI2V generates more dynamic videos without quality degradation compared with existing I2V models."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.\n- The motivation is very clear, as empirically, people have observed I2V models tend to generate much less dynamic videos compared with generating videos through T2V models.\n- The proposed method to subtract the input condition from the source/target is a simple yet interesting approach."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- While the paper compares the quality of generated videos with other existing I2V models, I believe the baseline should include Wan2.1 1.3B I2V models fine-tuned with common techniques (e.g., concat) using the same dataset used for fine-tuning with FlashI2V. This will remove the potential bias from pretrained models, post-training data, etc., which can validate the effectiveness of the proposed method much better.\n- This paper shows a very similar motivation and goal to ALG [Choi et al., 2025]. Although ALG is a training-free method, I believe the comparison should be done in both qualitative and quantitative manners. For instance, could authors provide results that compare Wan2.1 14B+ALG with FlashI2V?\n- There are several recent works (e.g., Wan2.2 5B) that try to jointly train a single model for both I2V and T2V, but it seems the proposed method cannot do.  \n- Figure 4 is great, but could the authors provide qualitative examples when the sample input condition and prompts are given?
