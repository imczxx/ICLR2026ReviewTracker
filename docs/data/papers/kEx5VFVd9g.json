As these models continue to scale larger and as the demand for task-specific and personalized adaptation grows, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical alternative to full fine-tuning. PEFT enables effective adaptation while updating only a small fraction of the total parameters. While various PEFT techniques have shown strong performance, many still suffer from increased inference latency and inefficiencies in multi-adapter scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a novel PEFT approach that leverages auxiliary representations to enable fast and flexible inference. In our method, Latent Task Embedding fine-tuning, a small task-specific latent embedding is concatenated to the original embedding. The corresponding weight matrices are extended, and only the additional parameters introduced by this expansion are trained. This design allows for efficient inference using a single matrix multiplication per weight, minimizing latency overhead, and supports task-specific masking to handle multiple adapters within a single model. We evaluate our method on large language models and latent diffusion models, demonstrating improved efficiency and flexibility over existing PEFT baselines.", "tldr": "We introduce a new efficient and flexible fine-tuning scheme by enlarging the latent embedding’s dimension", "keywords": ["Parameter-efficient-fine-tuning", "Representation tuning", "LLM efficiency"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/14e1eaa96cba05e60fe1e38c443a1a1fe97328bd.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Latent Task Embedding (LTE), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework.

Could the authors clarify why these adapters are a latency bottleneck? Each adapter involves small matrix multiplications per layer, which typically contribute marginally to total inference time. Moreover, LatTE also introduces extra embedding transformations (𝑓_in and 𝑓_out), which are applied to every FFN layer. Why, then, is LatTE expected to reduce latency rather than increase it?\n\n- Latency Profiling:\nIn line 454, the paper reports latency measurements for generating 100 tokens with a 10k context length, averaged over 10 trials. However, the observed improvement seems trivial. Could the authors provide more detailed time profiling (e.g., breakdown by attention, FFN, embedding) to demonstrate the latency behavior of LatTE versus LoRA?\n\n- Architectural Overhead:\nBoth “more-heads” and “wider-heads” LatTE variants introduce additional projections, which likely increase inference time. Is there quantitative evidence or profiling that measures the actual latency introduced by these modifications?\n\n- Initialization Strategy:\nIn line 194, the paper states that LatTE initializes the embedding with a constant value. What initialization strategy is used for the additional matrix dimensions (𝐴 and 𝐵)? Initialization plays a crucial role in the performance of low-rank methods, and more discussion on initialization sensitivity would be valuable.\n\nI would like to discuss the questions I raised regarding the weaknesses and concerns with the authors.
