It has applications in domains such as drug discovery, social network modeling, and knowledge graph construction. Unlike existing methods that only provide coarse control over graph properties, we introduce a novel conditional variational auto-encoder for fine-grained structural control in graph generation. The approach refines the decoder’s latent space by dynamically aligning graph- and property-driven representations to improve both graph fidelity and control satisfaction. Specifically, the approach implements a mixture scheduler that progressively integrates graph and control priors. Experiments on five real-world datasets show the efficacy of the proposed model compared to recent baselines, achieving high generation quality while maintaining high controllability.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Control Generation", "Graph Generation"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cf11683e32061f931655d7c6e43272cfc1591cfa.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents TOPOGEN, a conditional variational autoencoder designed for attribute-controlled graph generation. The model introduces a Mixture-Scheduler that gradually integrates structural and attribute-based latent representations during training, aiming to better align generated graphs with desired topological properties. The method supports fine-grained control over various structural attributes such as density, transitivity, and connectivity. The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.\n\nHowever, the work lacks strong theoretical grounding, and the empirical evidence supporting the model’s effectiveness is limited. \n\n1. In particular, it is unclear why the authors constructed new benchmark datasets (Section 3, Datasets) instead of evaluating their model on standard benchmarks such as GRID, LOBSTER, or PROTEIN, which are commonly used in prior studies like GraphRNN and GenStat.\n2. There is also insufficient evidence regarding the diversity of the generated graphs. Since TOPOGEN conditions generation on attribute vectors, additional analysis is needed to confirm that the model is not simply memorizing graphs from training data. Established metrics such as F1-PR [1,2] could have been included to better evaluate the diversity and novelty of generated graphs.\n3. Furthermore, the results reported in Table 2 are not fully consistent with the qualitative examples shown in Table 6. For instance, the graphs generated by DiGress appear visually similar across all datasets, often small tree-like structures with very few nodes, which do not match the ground truth samples. Yet, according to the GED metric, DiGress performs best among all models on Citeseer and Ogbn-Arxiv. This discrepancy raises concerns about the suitability of evaluation metric.\n4. Finally, while the Mixture-Scheduler is clearly described mathematically, the paper does not formally connect it to the variational inference objective, how it modifies or influences the ELBO formulation.\n\n[1]  Rylee Thompson, Boris Knyazev, Elahe Ghalebi, Jungtaek Kim, and Graham W Taylor.
