Demonstrating that the method can identify known regulatory drivers or predict outcomes in an experimental dataset (e.g., from public single-cell studies of cell differentiation or disease progression) is necessary to prove its utility for real-world biological applications.\n2. The work posits itself as suitable for high-dimensional data, but the simulation model uses only 5 genes and 5 proteins which is significantly smaller than the high-dimensional systems often encountered in practice (n > 10^4). Furthermore, the chosen network topology (a single protein positively affecting all genes) further limits the conclusions that can be derived at this stage as real regulatory networks involve very complex interactions that may be combinatorial in nature and may involve feedback loops. Assessing scalability, by increasing n and studying more complex networks (e.g., from STRING [1]) is crucial for understanding the method's feasibility on realistic, large-scale genomic datasets.\n3.
