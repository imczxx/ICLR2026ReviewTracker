In the planning stage, state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end autonomous driving models decouple planning into parallel lateral and longitudinal predictions. While effective, this parallel design can lead to i) coordination failures between the planned path and speed, and ii) underutilization of the drive path as a prior for longitudinal planning, thus redundantly encoding static information.\nTo address this, we propose a novel cascaded framework that explicitly conditions longitudinal planning on the drive path, enabling coordinated and collision-aware lateral and longitudinal planning. Specifically, we introduce a path-conditioned formulation that explicitly incorporates the drive path into longitudinal planning. Building on this, the model predicts longitudinal displacements along the drive path rather than full 2D trajectory waypoints. This design simplifies longitudinal reasoning and more tightly couples it with lateral planning. Additionally, we introduce a planning-oriented data augmentation strategy that simulates rare safety-critical events, such as vehicle cut-ins, by adding agents and relabeling longitudinal targets to avoid collision. Evaluated on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, our method sets a new SOTA, achieving a driving score of 89.07 and a success rate of 73.18\\%, demonstrating significantly improved coordination and safety.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["end-to-end autonomous driving"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/acc33f33be14f2514de6b7d0b11add576bf0ae6b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/85e38e701bddbcf9e4a2c6d1412faf1c06082022.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel end-to-end autonomous driving planning model called AlignDrive.

Regarding data augmentation, there is an important issue that remains unclear. Why is agent encoding (Line 251) necessary? Is it because the data augmentation is not performed during data generation (i.e., the corresponding surround-view images are unchanged), and thus the model needs this encoding step to recognize the newly added agents? If so, the feature representations of these synthetic agents would inherently differ from those detected by the perception module. A better solution might be to introduce such augmentation directly during data generation, which would eliminate the need for extra encoding operations and ensure feature consistency across agents.\n2. The proposed data augmentation strategy is somewhat effective, but it also has clear limitations. It only generates agents randomly along the ego vehicle’s driving path. Therefore, the generalizability of this augmentation method to broader datasets and real-world driving scenarios remains to be validated.\n3. The statements in Line 015 and Line 046: “splitting planning into two independent branches can lead to coordination failures. For example, the longitudinal trajectory may indicate a high desired speed, but executing this speed along the lateral drive path can cause collisions” are not entirely accurate. Both the joint prediction of lateral and longitudinal displacements and the proposed decoupled approach can potentially lead to prediction errors and collisions; whether collisions occur depends on the prediction accuracy itself. The current phrasing could give readers the misleading impression that the proposed method inherently avoids such issues."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

In Figure 2, there are several interaction modules (e.g., “Contextual Interaction”), yet it is not clearly shown which queries are involved in each interaction.
