Despite recent progress, models still struggle with scene compliance, often producing off-road or traffic-violating forecasts. We revisit and enhance three intuitive auxiliary objectives—Offroad Loss, Direction Consistency Loss, and Diversity Loss—that enhance map adherence, traffic rule compliance, and trajectory coverage. While each improves a specific aspect, our key finding is that only their combination delivers robust road-compliant predictions. To make this practical, we propose a lightweight adaptive weighting scheme that balances auxiliary losses automatically, succeeding where existing multi-task training strategies fail.\nExtensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 show consistent gains in safety and robustness without sacrificing accuracy, with 43\\% decrease in off-road errors on average. Notably, under the SceneAttack benchmark, which perturbs road geometry to create out-of-distribution driving scenarios, our method reduces off-road errors by 25\\%, demonstrating that learned road compliance transfers to unseen environments. Our plug-and-play package can be integrated into any trajectory predictor, and code will be released.", "tldr": "We introduce auxiliary losses and an adaptive weighting scheme that improve road adherence and diversity in vehicle trajectory prediction.", "keywords": ["Vehicle Trajectory Prediction", "Multi-loss training", "Loss Balancing", "Autonomous Vehicles"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8d459dccc6bb6c1dc6b5551bc2857e52144d796b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a unified auxiliary loss package to improve the safety and robustness of vehicle trajectory prediction models. The authors identify that standard accuracy-focused losses (like minADE) often lead to predictions that are off-road, violate traffic direction, or lack diversity. To address this, the paper introduces three auxiliary losses: Offroad Loss, Direction Consistency Loss, and Diversity Loss.\n\nA key finding is that while each loss improves its targeted metric, their combination is essential for robust performance. To balance these losses with the main objective without costly manual tuning, the authors propose an adaptive weighting scheme. This technique dynamically adjusts the weight of each auxiliary loss based on its gradient's magnitude and its cosine similarity with the main loss gradient.\n\nThe method is evaluated by integrating it into two baseline models (Wayformer and AutoBots) on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets.

The adaptive weighting scheme, though intuitive, lacks strong theoretical motivation and seems potentially sensitive to gradient noise. The authors do not sufficiently justify why their proposed weighting strategy, which combines gradient norm scaling with cosine similarity, outperforms more established multi-task learning techniques. A deeper comparative analysis with recent adaptive loss balancing methods would strengthen this claim.\n\nA key limitation is the method's reliance on high-quality map inputs. Both the Off-road and Direction losses assume accurate drivable-area polygons and centerlines, yet real-world maps often contain noise, missing lanes, or outdated geometry. The paper does not evaluate performance under such realistic conditions, which limits the claimed practical applicability. Additionally, while the Diversity loss filters out off-road predictions to maintain feasibility, this filtering itself depends on the Off-road loss, creating a potential circular dependency that may not hold with imperfect maps.\n\nThe experimental evaluation has several shortcomings. The proposed Offroad, Direction, and Diversity metrics, though useful for quantifying specific behaviors, are self-defined and lack established baselines or clear connections to real-world safety outcomes such as collisions or planning failures. Their implementation details and threshold selections are not thoroughly explained, affecting reproducibility.\n\nThe comparison with adaptive weighting baselines raises concerns, particularly the notably poor performance of GradNorm, which may indicate implementation or hyperparameter issues. The authors should clarify whether these baselines were reproduced faithfully or adapted from official implementations. Moreover, the paper lacks comparisons with recent SOTA trajectory predictors that also address scene compliance, limiting the claim of general applicability.\n\nSeveral critical experiments are missing, including evaluations under map noise or centerline errors, repeated runs with different random seeds to assess variance, sensitivity analysis of training strategies such as warm-up and exponential moving average parameters, and closed-loop testing in realistic simulation environments. These are essential for assessing the method's robustness and readiness for deployment.\n\nAlthough the authors commit to releasing code, key implementation details, such as efficient GPU computation of the signed distance function, centerline matching logic, and hyperparameter ranges for weight updates, are omitted, hindering reproducibility.\n\nIn summary, while the work offers a sensible engineering contribution and shows improvements in auxiliary metrics, it falls short in demonstrating novelty, robustness, and practical generalizability. The paper would be significantly strengthened by evaluating performance under map degradation and domain shift, providing statistical significance tests and repeated run results, including comparisons with stronger baselines, and clarifying the relationship between the proposed metrics and actual driving safety. Without these additions, I find the paper not yet ready for acceptance."}, "questions": {"value": "See the last section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "woV6zjJiVu", "forum": "nyO2yx9Fd2", "replyto": "nyO2yx9Fd2", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12478/Reviewer_ZZZB"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12478/Reviewer_ZZZB"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12478/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761921802181, "cdate": 1761921802181, "tmdate": 1762923354127, "mdate": 1762923354127, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This article introduces auxiliary loss functions designed to guide trajectory prediction models to follow road constraints while maintaining diversity in predicted trajectories.
