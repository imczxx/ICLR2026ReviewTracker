By utilizing contextual information about the properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made towards multi-robot control. When the robots have highly dissimilar morphologies, this becomes a challenging problem, especially when the agent must generalize to new, unseen robots. In this paper, we hypothesize that the relevant contextual information can be partially observable, but that it can be inferred through interactions for better multi-robot control and generalization to contexts that are not seen during training. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent transformer-based architecture and evaluate its (generalization) performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The results show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics, kinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.", "tldr": "Introduction of modular recurrence in the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents for improved (zero-shot generalization) performance in robotic control.", "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning", "Robotic Control", "Generalization"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3e8ba8d88aa6342db3c51a858fb7f8b5dd405c9d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper builds upon previous modular robotic control approaches, and proposes to infer unobservable but relevant contextual information from history interactions using recurrent networks to enhance cross-embodiment generalization.

The paper does not analyze how the recurrent mechanism scales with larger or more diverse sets of robots, nor does it investigate the relationship between the amount of training data and the observed generalization gains. Without experiments on different dataset sizes or more complex morphological distributions, I'm not convinced that the proposed recurrent module truly improves generalization in a scalable and robust manner.\n- The proposed approach mainly extends existing transformer-based frameworks MetaMorph and ModuMorph by introducing a recurrent layer to handle partial observability, which is also a hypothesis brought by this work. Although this modification leads to performance improvements, it represents a relatively minor architectural change without introducing new learning principles or theoretical insights. The paper positions the work as addressing partial observability, but the underlying idea of adding recurrence to capture temporal dependencies is conceptually straightforward and has been widely explored in prior reinforcement learning and robotics studies. Therefore, the novelty and contribution may not be sufficient.\n- Several figures use inconsistent evaluation scales, which makes it difficult to visually compare performance across different settings, especially for training/testing comparison. For example, in Figure 4 the returns in Incline reach nearly 3000 during training, whereas in Figure 6 the corresponding test returns drop below 1000."}, "questions": {"value": "- Are there any other methods beyond MetaMorph and ModuMorph that can be integrated with recurrence?\n- Why in Fig. 8, train and test performance in Flat Terrain, the variance of ModuMorph when provided with body_mass is exceptionally large?
