However, existing symbolic regression methods often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system. We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts' preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's interpretability.

I list the key reasons which affected my score below. **If addressed adequately in the rebuttal, I will increase the score by multiple stages to be in the acceptance range**.\n\nFirst, in line 189, the equation given, f(x) = (x+10^100) – 10^100, is given as an example with suffers from “catastrophic cancellation”, is this not just a data structure/programming issue? For example, is this not just an issue of using the wrong data structure for numerical precision? Also, simplification (which has been done in SR [1]) mechanisms can remove this error. It is not clear why this example is relevant to EIC, is the EIC of this equation not just 0, according to equation (4)? What is the point of this equation when on one hand the paper claims it is “bad” because it suffers from catastrophic cancellation, yet under the new contribution, EIC, it is perfect at a value of 0? Is this not a contradiction?\n\n[1] Cao, Lulu, et al. \"Genetic programming symbolic regression with simplification-pruning operator for solving differential equations.\"\n\nSecond, it seems that the computation in the experiments highly depend on the underlying data structure (e.g., float64, binary128, etc., or even a custom one) used to perform computations. This is not stated clearly in the paper, and I am unable to find what computation precision is used for the experiments.\n\nThird, the LARGEST error, which is the key reason for the \"reject” score, is in lines 207-208, when giving the equation “$M = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\log_{10}(12\\delta_r^2)$”. This relation is a major part of EIC, and affects the correctness of the WHOLE paper. There is no justification for how the equation is obtained, and it is flawed if the paper is assuming that the output noise is uniform. Is the paper saying that for equations in SR, say f(x)=1/x, injecting a uniform random noise to x will result in a uniform noise to f(x) as well? I suspect the paper made the serious mistake of assuming that uniform input noise will result in uniform output noise, which is not true for many equations in SR (e.g., non-linear operators), even with small noise.\n\nFourth, lines 194 to 196 is problematic too. The paper claims “truncating a variable x to N significant digits can be expressed as…”. This can be disproved with a simple counter example, where x=3, and we choose N=1, then using the definitions (e.g., the range of noise in line 195 and M=log_10|x| in line 196), x_hat ranges from about 1.5 to 4.5. Here, 1.5 is not a truncation of x=3 to N=1 significant digits and 4.5 is not a truncation of x=3 to N=1 significant digits either. This affects the “physical meaning” of EIC.\n\nFifth, the white-box and black-box results are inconsistent in the paper itself. For instance, there are algorithms which are present in Figure 6 which are NOT present in the corresponding Table 7. Likewise, there are algorithms which are present in Table 7 which are NOT present in the corresponding Figure 6. Also, using aggregated “rank” in Figures 5 and 6 (note: the computation of ranking is not clear in the paper so I am assuming the same process as SRBench is used) has been shown to lead to paradox where the algorithms on the Pareto frontier is different when the absolute value of the metrics are used instead of “ranks” [2]. It would be better to show a plot with the axis using the absolute value of the metrics, instead of aggregated ranks, this way, the absolute difference in metric values can be seen as well. Finally, confidence intervals/error bars should be added to the plot as well, as done in the EIC plot.\n\n[2] Fong, Kei Sen, and Mehul Motani. \"Pareto-Optimal Fronts for Benchmarking Symbolic Regression Algorithms.\""}, "questions": {"value": "Please address each of the 5 weaknesses above, especially the third weakness.

But in some sense this is unavoidable, and the solution proposed in this paper introduces even larger problems. In its current form, I have major concerns about EIC that leads me to recommend rejection. Fundamentally, EIC looks to not be invariant to how a formula is written or to the choice of units, which is an even bigger problem than the formulation of SR already has. I don't believe this concern can be addressed by a rewrite of the paper.

EIC is not invariant to algebraic rewrites or to units/scales. 3*x and x/0.3333... are algebraically identical yet score differently because EIC depends on the concrete parse/encodings. This means that even changing units (kg <-> lb) changes constants and can flip selections. For scientific use this is a non-starter, and in SR representation choices materially affect behavior.\n2. Taking the maximum over all subformulas is an ad-hoc patch with no apparent theoretical basis. It hard-codes representation dependence (parenthesization/temporaries change the max) and penalizes algebraically harmless subterms. I view this as a fundamental issue with the approach, and the patch as a symptom of a deeper issue.\n3. The noise model is internally inconsistent and lacks sensitivity analysis. The derivation assumes uniform rounding <-> significant digits, the implementation uses Gaussian relative noise, and sigma is fixed while calling the method \"parameter-free.\" There is no sigma sweep and no stated near-zero policy for $(\\tilde{y} - y)/y$. Rankings can flip under these choices.\n4. The evaluation is circular and confounded. The paper introduces a metric, optimizes it during search, then declares wins under that metric; baselines are not optimized for EIC. Reported R^2/length shifts are also confounded by in-loop coefficient refitting, early stopping that peeks at test, an EIC threshold chosen from the test distribution, and dropping ~39% low-R^2 runs. These choices inflate the gains.\n5. I think the human study is a bit of an overreach on interpretability. The human study uses low-D problems, preselects pairs to have large EIC gaps, and does not report inter-rater reliability or per-task effect sizes. Using LLM votes as a proxy for expert judgment does not strengthen the claim. At best this shows a correlation in a narrow setting.\n6. I believe the evaluation is entangling search with selection, and this makes it seriously difficult to evaluate if there is any actual benefit to this method, ignoring the theoretical inconsistencies. So, in practice, SR will yield a frontier of accuracy vs complexity, and users might pick a mid-complexity point for generalization. But, the procedure effectively bakes in \"pick mid-complexity\" and then credits EIC for the generalization, while other methods might simply (by default) select the most accurate expression, which is high complexity. That does not demonstrate that EIC measures something fundamental. To fix this, I think you need to separate the roles of search and selection. I recommend using EIC for selection, and then evaluating using some existing search code.\n7.
