A Mathematical Analysis of the ICLR 2026 Reciprocal Reviewer Nomination Policy", "abstract": "The rapid growth of AI conference submissions has created an overwhelming reviewing burden. To alleviate this, recent venues such as ICLR 2026 introduced a reviewer nomination policy: each submission must nominate one of its authors as a reviewer, and any paper nominating an irresponsible reviewer is desk-rejected.\nWe study this new policy from the perspective of author welfare. Assuming each author carries a probability of being irresponsible, we ask: how can authors (or automated systems) nominate reviewers to minimize the risk of desk rejections?\nWe formalize and analyze three variants of the desk-rejection risk minimization problem. The basic problem, which minimizes expected desk rejections, is solved optimally by a simple greedy algorithm. We then introduce hard and soft nomination limit variants that constrain how many papers may nominate the same author, preventing widespread failures if one author is irresponsible. These formulations connect to classical optimization frameworks, including minimum-cost flow and linear programming, allowing us to design efficient, principled nomination strategies. Our results provide the first theoretical study for reviewer nomination policies, offering both conceptual insights and practical directions for authors to wisely choose which co-author should serve as the nominated reciprocal reviewer.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reviewer nomination", "Desk-rejection minimization", "Author welfare", "Optimization", "Theory"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e535a6582e0da35caeb28b9dd56a8725dc04e8b3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the problem of minimizing desk rejections in AI conferences that have implemented a reviewer nomination policy.

While the basic problem (Definition 3.1) is naturally motivated, in practice, there are no hard or soft nomination limits (Definitions 3.4 and 3.9) imposed by conferences. The authors motivate these variants as ways to prevent widespread failures if one author is irresponsible, but this seems contrived. As the expected number of desk rejections is already minimized in the basic problem, it is unclear why one would want to impose additional constraints that could potentially increase the number of desk rejections.\n- All three variants of the problem are joint optimization problems over all authors to minimize the total number of (expected) desk rejections. However, in reality, the authors do not have the incentive to cooperate with each other to minimize the total number of desk rejections. It is unclear which party would implement the proposed algorithms.\n- Relatedly, the practical impact of this work is limited. The paper does not provide any empirical evaluation or real-world case analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Without such evidence, it is difficult to assess the practical utility of the methods.\n- Technically, the paper reads like a juxtaposition of three sets of problem formulations and their solutions using very basic techniques.

While true in a narrow sense (fractional can occur in degenerate cases), the text misleadingly suggests that the LP relaxation is generally non-integral.\n\nIn fact, the constraint matrix (each paper nominates one author; each author ≤ b papers) is totally unimodular. Hence every vertex of the feasible polytope is integral, and an integral optimum always exists unless costs are exactly tied.\n\nThus, Theorem 4.3’s appeal to “minimum-cost flow integrality” adds little: integrality was already guaranteed by very basic linear programming theory.\n\nSuggested correction: clarify that fractional optima only arise under tie conditions, and that the LP already guarantees an integral optimal vertex.\n\n5. *Conceptual disconnect from ML venue*\n\nThe paper contains no learning, no data, and no connection to representation, optimization, or generalization—its content is pure combinatorial optimization.\n\nThe “ICLR policy” context is not sufficient to justify ICLR as a venue; the paper would at best fit a workshop on peer review systems or theoretical computer science.\n\nThe tone (“We design efficient, principled nomination strategies…”) exaggerates novelty for a standard LP→flow mapping."}, "questions": {"value": "Clarification on modeling assumptions:\n\nThe paper assumes that each author submits multiple papers and can nominate reviewers reciprocally.
