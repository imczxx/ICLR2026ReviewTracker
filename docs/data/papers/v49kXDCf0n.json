While deep learning has shifted molec-\nular representation learning from hand-crafted fingerprints to learned features,\nthe high cost of labeled data has motivated self-supervised learning (SSL) on\nlarge-scale unlabeled datasets, with contrastive learning being a leading approach.\nHowever, existing methods rely on augmented views of the same molecule\nas positives, overlooking structural and functional similarities between distinct\nmolecules. To address this, we propose the Functional Group-Guided Molecular\nGraphs (FGMG) algorithm, which constructs molecular graphs with linear com-\nplexity while better capturing structure-activity relationships (SAR). Based on\nFGMG, we introduce CLUSMOL, a cluster-assisted contrastive learning pretrain-\ning framework that assigns graph-labels via graph clustering and employs a Chem-\nical Semantic-Weighted Contrastive Loss (SemCoL) to treat molecules within the\nsame cluster as “soft positive” pairs.

FGMG aims to avoid \"Activity Cliffs\" (where structurally similar molecules exhibit significant differences in activity) by using chemical transformations. However, single-step functional group substitutions may still introduce substantial activity changes, as functional groups can significantly influence biological activity. Therefore, edges generated by FGMG may still connect molecules with large activity differences. To strengthen the approach, the authors could consider incorporating multi-step transformations or activity-aware filtering to better mitigate the risk of misleading signals.\n- The paper lacks sufficient references to recent related work, citing only one 2025 study (KGG).
