Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency. Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to *9.1*$\\times$ speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality. Notably, our method brings dLLM inference latency close to that of ARMs under many settings. *Codes are provided in the supplementary material and will be released publicly on GitHub.*", "tldr": "We accelerate diffusion LLMs with a training-free adaptive caching strategy, reusing prompt and response features to significantly reduce inference latency.", "keywords": ["Diffusion Large Language Models", "Model Acceleration", "Adaptive Caching"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bbb0d922478ec6b430e560769f62a1cb1fcbcc0e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7fbf8792aa1a3f3f392030e87abf6d6ef0aa7d3e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces dLLM-Cache, a novel training-free framework designed to accelerate\ninference in diffusion LLMs. It proposes a dual-component caching strategy.

Contribution is limited\n\nThe paper claims two main contributions: (i) adopting different update intervals for the prompt and response, and (ii) introducing V-verify to identify the most changed tokens for partial updates. However, the first contribution, also emphasized in the main analysis experiments (Section 3.2), has already been explored in prior works on KV-Cache for diffusion LLMs, such as dKV-Cache (the prefill part) and Fast-dLLM (PrefixCache). The other contribution is the V-verify mechanism, which selects tokens to be cached based on the similarity between their V vectors. While this idea is interesting, it appears too incremental to constitute a sufficient contribution for a full paper.\n\n2. Comparison with AR models requires stronger justification and additional results\n\nThe comparison with autoregressive models presented in Table 4 lacks clarity and fairness. The reported acceleration is marginal (47.73 vs 49.86 TPS), and the base model used for comparison is not instruction-tuned for reasoning tasks like GSM8K, making the results less meaningful. For instance, using a more appropriate baseline such as Llama3-8B-Instruct would yield around 79.6% accuracy on GSM8K, significantly higher than the 67.2% reported here. An apple-to-apple comparison is needed.\n\nFurthermore, the procedure for measuring TPS and the experimental setup are unclear. From the FLOPs calculation in the appendix, it seems that diffusion LLMs inherently require more computation than AR models, so it is counterintuitive that they achieve higher speed. Clarification on this discrepancy and a more thorough comparison of speed with ARs is needed. \n\nIn addition, the efficiency evaluation is conducted with only 128 steps, resulting in relatively poor accuracy (67%) compared to the 71% and 78% reported in Table 1. A more comprehensive comparison across different steps is needed."}, "questions": {"value": "1. In the v-verify stage, since q is not recalculated and only a subset of tokens is available for q, the input x to the attention input \nx only has the hidden states with partial tokens.

Could you elaborate on why your approach outperforms dKV-Cache and Fast-dLLM? It would be helpful to provide some insights or for this improvement.\n\n3. Is your method sensitive to the number of decoding steps? Given that many recent works support parallel decoding with multiple tokens per step and I think it would be a trend, how would your method perform when applied to those settings?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "gCA6vEA0Z4", "forum": "DriG3hgh42", "replyto": "DriG3hgh42", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13465/Reviewer_s8FB"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13465/Reviewer_s8FB"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13465/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762045757789, "cdate": 1762045757789, "tmdate": 1762924082462, "mdate": 1762924082462, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces dLLM-Cache, an adaptive caching framework designed to accelerate diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) without retraining.
