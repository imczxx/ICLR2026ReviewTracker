Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection. In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models. To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.", "tldr": "Inspired by human nervous system, formulate the collaboration between LLM and task-specific anomaly detection model and solve involved challenges", "keywords": ["Unsupervised Anomaly Detection", "Time Series", "Large Language Model", "Task-specific Small Model", "Model Collaboration"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0d0df78460f8b15a72bd1e67d425910f9469ba6e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c0d42f966479f981e3f8da6052bb3c4e47eba934.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes CoLLaTe, a framework that integrates a task-specific time-series anomaly detector (TSADM) with a large language model (LLM) for enhanced anomaly detection.
