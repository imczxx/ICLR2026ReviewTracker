In recent years, many online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed to learn constructive heuristics for JSP and FJSP. Although effective, these online RL methods require millions of interactions with simulated environments, and their random policy initialization leads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL algorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from datasets, eliminating the need for training in a simulated environment, while still being able to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a quantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return distribution of each machine–operation pair rather than selecting pairs outright. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CDQAC's remarkable ability to learn from diverse data sources. CDQAC consistently outperforms the original data-generating heuristics and surpasses state-of-the-art offline and online RL baselines. In addition, CDQAC is highly sample efficient, requiring only 10–20 training instances to learn high-quality policies. Notably, CDQAC performs best when trained on datasets generated by a random heuristic, leveraging their wider distribution over the state space, to surpass policies trained on datasets generated by significantly stronger heuristics", "tldr": "We present Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), an offline RL method that learn a SOTA constructive heuristics for FJSP and JSP, soley trained with Random data.", "keywords": ["Flexible Job-shop Scheduling", "Job-shop Scheduling", "Offline Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/71c660fd7ddf1fc3787761a16c6995171dfa4570.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/399a97fec9e4da027d7f33ba89dc901c8aeca3d8.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), an offline reinforcement learning algorithm for job shop and flexible job shop scheduling.

The immediate question is of course why not use the better method - if I am not mistaken then this one would take 30 mins to provide a better solution for any of the considered problems - 30 mins does not sound like a lot, especially when considering RL training time is likely higher (I believe it is not reported).\n2) If I assume the better method is for some reason not applicable, i.e. because 30 mins is too long, then probably the training time of the RL algorithm does not matter as much - the time needed to solve is reported for some problems within seconds, which is likely only the inference time. I wonder then why training time does not seem to matter - maybe the policy can be reused across many new instances, while the \"classical\" solution needs to start from scratch always, but I am not sure.\n3) Somewhere along the same lines: It seems that the main reason heuristics and RL methods are considered in these settings in the first place is because classical approaches do not scale to large problem sizes / complexities. I wonder if sufficiently large problem instances have been considered in the paper then, since any problem is solved better by a classical approach within just 30 minutes, which again does not sound like a lot (also 30 minutes is a relatively weak quantification; I don't know whether this uses the same GPU hardware, better would be to report FLOPS used by both methods). I presume it would make sense to consider a problem size where the best method \"switches\", i.e. where the optimality gap becomes negative since the classic approach cannot come up with a reasonable solution within 30 minutes, while the RL solution can.\n\nI guess generally the paper could use a bit more clarifications on the constraints and requirements that arise in practice from these scheduling problems - at least for me some things remain unclear."}, "questions": {"value": "see weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "L1Mqu4ccz4", "forum": "IdsRzAAkB2", "replyto": "IdsRzAAkB2", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7987/Reviewer_fDH7"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7987/Reviewer_fDH7"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7987/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761908302690, "cdate": 1761908302690, "tmdate": 1762919993770, "mdate": 1762919993770, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), an offline reinforcement learning algorithm for Job Shop Scheduling Problems (JSP) and Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems (FJSP).
