Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i) semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii) discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW, CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.", "tldr": "We contribute Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an attribute-label-free method for bias auditing in face recognition that uses latent directions to (i) form semantically coherent subpopulations and (ii) discover interpretable directions.", "keywords": ["Fairness", "bias discovery", "face recognition", "latent directions", "interpretability"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b67e228bb367d0e719e27b77e1f3fc26f09ddc37.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6eae072e9f6160efd3b7384e6ad5ac43ab9f37ab.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a method to discover subpopulations in the representation space of face recognition models.
