While prior methods have made significant progress, they typically depend on heuristics or approximations and do not offer provable guarantees over continuous input domains for the resulting circuits. In this work, we leverage recent advances in neural network verification to propose a suite of automated algorithms that yield circuits with *provable guarantees*. We focus on three types of guarantees: (1) *input domain robustness*, ensuring the circuit agrees with the model across a continuous input region; (2) *robust patching*, certifying circuit alignment under continuous patching perturbations; and (3) *minimality*, formalizing and capturing a wide array of various notions of succinctness. Interestingly, we uncover a diverse set of novel theoretical connections among these three families of guarantees, with critical implications for the convergence of our algorithms. Finally, we conduct experiments with state-of-the-art verifiers on various vision models, showing that our algorithms yield circuits with substantially stronger robustness guarantees than standard circuit discovery methods, establishing a principled foundation for provable circuit discovery.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["interpretability", "mechanistic interpretability", "circuit discovery"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0792d95019e99580f4fba4c5a3102c5e5f4459fb.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b5f81e60c92e40ce153d2b74a01cc906451b083c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a framework for provable circuit discovery in mechanistic interpretability, offering formal guarantees of input robustness, patching robustness, and minimality.

It directly addresses a fundamental and critical limitation in the field of MI (moving from heuristic approximations to provable guarantees), which has been acknowledged in many recent works in the literature. This work makes a significant step towards increasing the reliability of MI methods and is much-needed.\n- The paper is technically excellent. The formalizations are clear, and the introduced hierarchy of minimality guarantees (Definitions 3 through 6) clarifies a concept often used loosely in the literature. All of the stated theorems are proved in depth in the Appendix, which is rare to find in this type of work.\n- The experiments clearly support the paper's claims. The authors use the SOTA α,β-CROWN verifier on standard benchmarks, and their proposed methods achieve 100% certified robustness (Tables 1 and 2), whereas sampling-based methods largely fail. Finally, the experiments in section 5.3 are a good illustration of the trade-off between minimality strength (as defined in the proposed hierarchy) and runtime.\n- The paper is very well-written, given the complexity of the topic."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The most significant weakness (which the authors do acknowledge) is the scalability of the neural network verification methods. The experiments are conducted on relatively small vision models (e.g. ResNet2b) yet already require computation time in the minutes to hour range. Current MI research largely focuses on large LLMs or other models using the Transformers architecture, and as proposed, the authors' framework would likely be computationally intractable for such models. This is an inherent challenge of the verification field and by no means a flaw in the paper's methodology itself and doesn't detract from the foundational contribution of the work, but it does limit the immediate practical applicability to SOTA models.\n- The paper could be strengthened by adding a more detailed qualitative analysis of the discovered circuits. For example, the provably robust circuit depicted in Figure 1 contains an extra component. A natural question is: What functional role does it play? An illustrative example would make the benefits of the approach even more tangible and would also be interesting from a research perspective.\n- The paper uses a logit-difference metric for faithfulness, which works well for verification and is a standard choice in MI, but may not always accurately reflect the semantic meaning of a circuit that one may be interested in. It is not entirely clear if a small logit difference is always the most meaningful proxy for a circuit \"doing the same thing\" as the model (a circuit could potentially maintain a small logit difference but modify its internal representations or attributions in a way which may be significant). However, this is, again, the de facto standard used in most MI research and this is a fairly minor point."}, "questions": {"value": "- Have the authors considered adapting the framework to certify different properties? For instance, instead of bounding the logit difference (which can be problematic, as stated above), could it be adapted to certify that the predicted class remains invariant across the input domain? This seems like a natural guarantee for classification.\n- The complexity of MHS depends on enumerating blocking sets up to size t_max. What was the practical size of the blocking sets found in the experiments, and how large did t_max need to be to provide good lower bounds or find the minimal circuit? (My apologies if this is answered in the attached codebase, which I did not consult)\n- For the example in Figure 1, do the authors have any functional hypothesis for why the components highlighted in green are essential for robustness (handling specific edge cases)? What kinds of input perturbations would cause the sampling-based circuit to fail, which the provably-robust circuit correctly handles?\n- Do the authors have any insight into potential ways to apply this framework to larger models/architectures, such as Transformers? Are there specific verification techniques that offer a better trade-off for this application?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "N8ZVibrv1N", "forum": "Timsb74vIY", "replyto": "Timsb74vIY", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14389/Reviewer_ZmUt"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14389/Reviewer_ZmUt"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14389/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761932545536, "cdate": 1761932545536, "tmdate": 1762924802128, "mdate": 1762924802128, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
