A crucial one is the ability to determine the agent's own location and heading in an environment. However, existing navigation approaches either assume this information is given, or use methods that lack a suitable inductive bias and accumulate error over time. Inspired by neuroscience research, the method of slow feature analysis (SFA) overcomes these limitations and extracts agent location and heading from a visual data stream, but has not been combined with modern, deep reinforcement learning agents. In this paper, we compare SFA representations with those learned by convolutional neural networks in deep RL agents. We also demonstrate how using SFA representations can improve navigation performance. Lastly, we empirically and conceptually investigate the limitations of using SFA and discuss how they currently prevent it from being used more widely for visual navigation in RL.", "tldr": "Combining slow feature analysis with deep reinforcement learning lets agents recover location and heading from visual streams and can improve navigation, compared to representations learned with convolutional neural networks.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning", "representation learning", "slow feature analysis"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6b380c72b09c0a3c157f46f89bfb016a0e1ed782.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper investigates whether “interpretable” representations learned by hierarchical Slow Feature Analysis (hSFA) can improve the performance of reinforcement learning agents (PPO) in visual navigation.

Thus I believe an important comparison while arguing for its benefits would be to show the breakdown of the system when the features are not slow.

Maybe a better alternative could be to just show the performance of the models (on y-axis) across different dataset sizes (on x-axis).
