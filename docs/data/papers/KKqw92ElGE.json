Its effective utilization in data-driven models is frequently hindered by data scarcity and privacy concerns. In response, synthetic tabular data generation has emerged as a powerful solution that provides privacy-preserving data mirroring real-world distributions. However, many existing generative models still struggle to preserve the complex column relationships within tabular data. Additionally, they often fail to account for the real-world constraints that are essential for ensuring the authenticity and practical usability of the generated data. In this paper, we propose ECR-DM, the Explicit Column Relationship-Based Diffusion Model for synthetic tabular data generation. In the forward diffusion process, we introduce the Noise Perturbation Mechanism, which enables the model to learn column distributions in a fine-grained manner. In the reverse diffusion process, we incorporate Constraint-Guided Recovery, which guides the model to recover inter-column dependencies and restore the true data distribution. NPM helps the diffusion model capture the detailed column-wise characteristics of the data, while CGR ensures the preservation of inter-column relationships and the high-quality synthetic tabular data generation. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on six tabular data benchmarks. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across seven evaluation metrics, particularly in downstream tasks.

This work fails to correctly cite.\n- It is unclear how the columns’ interdependency can be well reflected by adding individual noise to each column. How does the learning distribution of each column effectively (with individual noise) lead to preserving the inter-column dependency? There is a logical gap. This is not clarified in the manuscript. Adding separate noises seems to be very empirical, rather than based on rationales.\n- How to set the right noise for each column? Is it dependent on the column’s statistics? \n- It is unclear how the real-world constraint C in natural language’s representation space is well aligned with the semantic representation of tabular data. \n- It is unclear how to generate high-quality real-world constraints.
