However, existing datasets either rely heavily on manual annotation or are synthesized within artificial environments such as logic games. In this work, We propose a data synthesis framework that transforms formal mathematical statements into high-quality verifiable reasoning data. It first performs Statement Collection and Quality Control to obtain high-quality proven statements, then applies Problem Generation to convert them into verifiable math solving problems, and finally leverages RLVR with a verifier for Model Training. Using this framework, we synthesize 19k high-quality mathematical problems at levels 5–10 and train the F1-Reasoner series of models. Across six challenging benchmarks, F1-Reasoner consistently improves upon 3 different open-weight models across different sizes, outperforming models such as SynLogic and Absolute-Zero that are trained on verifiable data from other environments. Moreover, we mix our data with MATH to create F1-Reasoner-Mix, which further boosts performance; notably, F1-Reasoner-Mix-8B surpasses General-Reasoner-14B while using substantially less data. Further analysis shows that F1-Reasoner generalizes to informal theorem proving and exhibits richer thinking behaviors.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Large Reasoning Models", "Mathematical Reasoning", "Synthetic Data", "RLVR"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/df50c003b68c0292486683ce4ba68e7e54d212e1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a framework for synthesizing verifiable mathematical reasoning data from formal theorem proving systems.

Therefore, this paper is expected to be based on these new models, since the \"Statements Collection\" phase is the foundation of the proposed pipeline.\n2. The methodology introduces biases to the selected data by using formal provers' success as the filter. The paper aims to improve general informal reasoning, but its training data is filtered through the narrow bottleneck of a specific prover's capabilities. This risks training the LLM on a \"prover-friendly\" subset of mathematics, excluding many correct and difficult problems that the chosen provers simply failed to solve. While the authors introduce methods like difficulty sampling, this only samples from an already-biased pool and does not mitigate this fundamental issue.\n3. The generalizability of the \"Problem Generation\" step is questionable. While the paper provides one concrete example of math inequalities, it is not clear how this method would apply to other, more diverse types of mathematical problems, especially those with numbers or math terms as their answers, which is common in informal math. Actually, the example provided is really weak. The answer to the generated problem is whether correct or wrong, making it easy to guess.\n4.

It is particularly hard to understand the motivation behind translating formal mathematical statements back to natural language. Formalized statements are much more scarce than natural language statements, a significant part of which are actually translated from natural language, such as Lean-Workbook. Augmenting data in the natural language domain is far more flexible than in the formal domain. In fact, formal math provers [1] augment formal statements by synthesizing natural language statements and translating them into the formal domain. \n\n2. The question synthesis stage is not verified to ensure consistency between formal and informal problems. The synthesized informal problem can be far easier than the original formal one. For Example 1 in section D.3, the translated question can be solved by simply plugging in a=0 into the inequality, then confirms that a sufficient small positive 'a' satisfies the inequality for any S < 250. While the original statement requires a proof for arbitrary a>0. For example 3, proof of an inequality is synthesized into deciding whether there is a condition such that the reversed inequality satisfies. This is an yes/no question which can be well guessed even if the solver fails to provide a correct proof.\n\n3. Given that many lean statements are translated from natural language, it is in particular important to examine the improvement of the augmented dataset with respect to natural language datasets. Therefore, the experiment with simpleRL should have been most convincing. However, the result is only provided on Qwen2.5-7B but not for Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B.
