RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate: (1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for RLLMs. Additionally, we discuss strategies for enhancing the performance of LLMs and RLLMs in financial question answering, which may serve as a inspiration for future improvements. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.", "tldr": "This study explores the impact of prompting methods and frameworks on LLMs and RLLMs in financial question-answering, revealing that RLLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities limit traditional enhancements.", "keywords": ["Large language model", "financial question answering", "reasoning", "long chain-of-thought"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/30e5792ac49468200d1f0a04a5c8c5818e575675.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a detailed analysis of why LLMs and LRMs fail in financial question answering.

The topics covered appear compositional rather than complementary. It is not immediately clear how the performance of LLMs/RLLMs under various techniques (prompting, agents) meaningfully relates to their multilingual performance. The rationale for combining these two research directions in the same paper could be better articulated—specifically, how they echo each other or contribute to unified insights. The separate investigations might benefit from either deeper integration or independent exploration with greater depth in each area.\n\n- In the experiments, some critical details are missing, and some of the claims are not well supported by the experiment results.\n  - In the experiment section, the authors did not provide the details about how the agentic frameworks are implemented, or the details of the prompting techniques or examples.\n  - In section 4.2, the authors claim that an effective prompting method significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. However, Table 1 shows that prompting techniques lead to worse performance in some subtask categories, and even when examining the aggregated overall performance, the improvements are marginal rather than significant.\n  - In section 4.3, the authors claim that the smaller LLMs benefit more from the agentic framework. But in Table 1, only one small model is evaluated, and I think more evidence is needed to show whether this behavior is unique to the model or a more general behavior.\n  - In section 4.4, the authors claim that the reading length significantly enhances the performance of LLMs, with the evidence of the performance of the model with CLP. First, as the method and the reasoning length are changed simultaneously, it would be hard to attribute which part contributes more to the performance difference. And the conclusion would be clearer if the measurement of reasoning length were included in the analysis.\n  - In section 4.3, the authors claim the performance gains of RLLMs in the agentic framework are due to agent collaboration. However, there is no metric/measurement introduced to measure agent collaboration or a concrete analysis to support their claim.\n\n- Many of the findings have been well-established in prior work, which limits the paper's significance. For example, the performance improves as LLMs' parameters increase, which is well understood in the context of the scaling law; the longer reasoning steps generally lead to better performance, which is also well understood and studied comprehensively in previous works, e.g., [1]\n\n[1]: Jin, M., Yu, Q., Shu, D., Zhao, H., Hua, W., Meng, Y., ... & Du, M.
