This is especially important as e.g. the Liver usually has DSC >97% while smaller organs like the gallbladder are substantially worse. Just reporting the mean is not transparent enough.\n\n### Prompt to Segmentation (2D and 3D)\n\nThe authors use interactive segmentation methods to generate 2D segmentations from the 2D bounding boxes and then go to 3D.\nHowever, their used promptable methods seem to somewhat miss a few important promptable methods, like ScribblePrompt [4] or nnInteractive [5].\nIn particular, nnInteractive should be included, as they report very high performance and can use 2D prompts (2D bounding-boxes) to yield 3D segmentations. This removes 1 additional step, which may introduce additional errors.\n\n\nWhile this may seem nitpicky, I believe the success of this Benchmark dataset solely hinges on the lesion segmentation quality. Hence the authors should try to make this as reliable as possible and should exhaust all resources available to them. Moreover, making this an addendum afterward will just reduce the impact of the paper as people won't use it when trying out an unfinished version.
