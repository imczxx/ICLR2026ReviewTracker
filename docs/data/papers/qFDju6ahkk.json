Equipping them with thinking capabilities is a critical step to enhance their performance and reliability in these specific domains. However, existing training paradigms, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding the capacity of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to SVLMs fails to instill the desired thinking abilities. A natural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity to reduce the dependence on model capacity. Yet the core challenge lies in managing the inherent trade-off: excessive reliance on SFT can force the model to memorize pseudo thinking traces, while over-emphasizing RLVR can lead to unstable exploration (*i.e.,* advantage collapse). To address this, we propose *DyME*, a novel training paradigm that **Dy**namically selects between **M**emorization (via SFT) and **E**xploration (via RLVR) at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes to the trade-off. By ensuring that every update contributes to the trade-off, *DyME* serves as a robust, standalone strategy that stabilizes SVLM learning. Complementing this paradigm, we further introduce a synergistic \\textit{Visual Supervision} mechanism (comprising a visual checker and refiner) designed to inject dynamically enhanced, image-grounded guidance during optimization. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that *DyME* consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial performance improvements on specialized tasks. These results establish *DyME* as a practical and effective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["GRPO", "SFT", "Small-scale VLM", "Computer Vision"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2a022771d57366adf5258bba0ba8f2542100978f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles a critical and practical challenge: enabling reasoning (“thinking”) in Small-scale Vision-Language Models (SVLMs).

We are encouraged that you found the problem important and the proposed DyME paradigm simple yet effective, and we appreciate the concrete suggestions on fairness, external dependencies, novelty, and qualitative evaluation.\n\nIn the revised manuscript and additional experiments, we have made the following main changes:\n\n1. **Clarified core contribution.** We now clearly separate **DyME (the dynamic Memorize–Explore paradigm)** from the **Visual Supervision (VS) module**, and explicitly position VS as an *optional* enhancement rather than a required component of DyME.\n\n2. **Fairer and stronger baselines.** We added **Pure DyME** experiments that remove VS and train on the **same offline CoT data** as SFT/two-stage. With extensive hyperparameter and epoch sweeps, Pure DyME consistently outperforms all baselines across Low/Medium/High data quality, addressing concerns about fairness and the possibility that “catastrophic failure” is due to insufficient tuning.\n\n3. **Broader evaluation.** We extended our study beyond the original SVLM setting by\n\n   * applying DyME to a **stronger LVLM** (Qwen2.5-VL-7B), and\n   * evaluating DyME on a **pure-text reasoning benchmark (GSM8K)**,\n     showing that the dynamic switching mechanism remains beneficial across models and domains.\n\n4. **Quality and cost analyses.** We added (i) a **human evaluation of CoT traces**, confirming that DyME produces shorter but more valid and visually grounded reasoning than two-stage training, and (ii) a **detailed cost/sensitivity analysis** of the VS module with respect to external model size and training time, clarifying the trade-off between Pure DyME and DyME+VS.\n\n5. **Reproducibility and transparency.** We added a dedicated **LLM usage statement**, discussed limitations of VS, and released our **full anonymized code, processed data, prompts, and logs** via the anonymous repository linked in the rebuttal.\n\nPlease refer to our individual responses for detailed discussions on specific points; we have addressed each weakness and question raised by every reviewer point-by-point."}}, "id": "Voml0sIDrH", "forum": "qFDju6ahkk", "replyto": "qFDju6ahkk", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2276/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2276/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2276/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763644139877, "cdate": 1763644139877, "tmdate": 1763644139877, "mdate": 1763644139877, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the challenge of instilling reasoning (\"thinking\") capabilities in SVLMs. SFT overwhelms the models' limited capacity, leading to \"pseudo thinking traces,\" while RLHR fails due to poor instruction adherence, causing \"advantage collapse.\"\n\nThus, the authors propose DyME (Dynamic Memorize-Explore), a novel training paradigm. DyME dynamically switches between an exploration (RLVR) mode and a memorization (SFT) mode at each optimization step. The switch is governed by a simple rule: if the model fails to produce any correct response in a batch, it falls back to SFT mode. If at least one response is correct, it uses RLVR mode.\n\nFurthermore, DyME introduces a \"vision supervision\" mechanism, composed of a \"Visual Checker\" and \"Visual Refiner\", which use an external LLM to (1) provide a more nuanced \"thinking reward\" for the RLVR mode and (2) dynamically refine the SFT ground-truth targets to be more visually grounded and consistent with successful exploration traces. \n\nExperiments across three domains show that DyME substantially improves the performance of SVLMs, whereas the SFT and RLVR baselines are shown to degrade performance."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper tackles a practical and important problem of enabling complex reasoning on small, efficient models.\n\n2. The paper is generally well-written, and the problem is clearly motivated.

The authors show in Tab. 1 that standard SFT, RLVR, and a two-stage approach degrade the performance of SVLMs on these tasks, while DyME consistently provides significant gains.\n\n4. Effective ablation study. The ablation in Table 2 does a good job of validating the key components of DyME. It shows that removing either the memorization or exploration mode is catastrophic, supporting the need for a hybrid approach. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of the visual supervision modules."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The \"vision supervision\" modules (Visual Checker and Refiner) involves additional dependencies. The modules are critical to the method's performance (as shown in Tab. 2), but they are implemented via prompting an external Qwen2.5-14B. This involves additional knowledges and causes unfair comparisons.\n\n2. Question regarding novelty of this work. Compared with existing hybrid SFT+RL methods, the authors claim the main novelty is the dynamic switching criterion. However, the criterion used (fall back to SFT if all $K$ samples are incorrect) is a relatively simple and heuristic. The paper note that prior hybrid methods are \"static,\" but this might be an oversimplification. A deeper comparison to other dynamic weighting schemes (e.g., PPO-SFT hybrids) may be helpful to fully position the novelty of this specific heuristic.\n\n3. The fact that all baselines (SFT, GRPO, Two-stage) fail so catastrophically (e.g., dropping average performance from 49.9 to 44.1 or 44.0 for SmolVLM) is surprising. While I understand the  limited capacity of SVLMs can lead to underperforming results, I wonder if this could be caused by under-optimized tuning. For example, SFT's failure is attributed to overwhelming the modell, but could a simpler baseline (e.g., SFT on far less data or shorter CoT) have been more effective? I would appreciate any deeper discussion into this concern.\n\n4. Clarity of \"Vision Supervision\" and lack of details. While the ablation shows the visual checker/refiner are important, their description in the main paper is high-level. More detail on the prompts, the failure modes of this LLM-based pipeline, and its reliability would be \nnecessary to make the method truly reproducible.\n\n5. The visual refiner/checker requires additional inference of a LVLM during the training of a LVLM. This seems time consuming and may harm the effectiveness of the proposed training pipeline. Could you quantify the computational cost of this pipeline? How critical is the choice of Qwen2.5-14B? What happens if a weaker/stronger model is used for the checker and refiner? Does the method still work?\n\n6. More investigation into the switching criterion. The binary switch (all fail vs. $\\ge 1$ success) is simple and effective. Did you experiment with other criteria (e.g., switching if the average reward of the batch is below a threshold, or using a \"budget\" for SFT steps) that might be more robust?\n\n7. It seems the authors omit the visual checker/refiner in the abstract.
