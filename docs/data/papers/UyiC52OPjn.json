However, this task is challenging, especially due to transient variability in systems with equivalent long-term dynamics. We address this by introducing smooth prototype equivalences (SPE), a framework matches between sparse observations of phase space and prototypical behaviors using invertible neural networks. SPE enables classification by comparing the deformation loss of the observed sparse measurements to the prototype dynamics. Furthermore, our approach enables estimation of the invariant sets of the observed dynamics through the learned mapping from prototype space to data space. Our method outperforms existing techniques in the classification of oscillatory systems and can efficiently identify invariant structures like limit cycles and fixed points in an equation-free manner, even when only a small, noisy subset of the phase space is observed. Finally, we show how our method can be used for the detection of biological processes like the cell cycle trajectory from high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["normalizing flows", "single cell", "scRNA-seq"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9b22731a1885910490b8be6d808ef1aa307204ba.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/2154f5e412688b6c98658275966446090f752211.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a method called Smooth Prototype Equivalences (SPE) for characterizing dynamical systems from sparse, noisy observations without explicit governing equations.

The model learns diffeomorphisms, parameterized by normalizing flows, that smoothly map between vector field data sampled from unknown systems and their prototypical counterparts. If a system is smoothly (or orbit) conjugate to a specific prototypical vector field, then the pushforward of the observations should match that prototypical vector field. This principle is encoded in the equivalence loss, which measures the discrepancy between the two. The prototypical vector field with the lowest equivalence loss is then selected as the canonical form of the data, and the pullback of its invariant set serves as an approximation of the invariant set of the data.

When the equivalence loss is exactly zero, the pullback of the prototypical invariant set indeed corresponds to the true invariant set of the data dynamics. Yet, when the loss is nonzero, it is not guaranteed that a smaller equivalence loss implies a closer approximation of the true invariant set.\n\nIf the underlying invariant sets are hyperbolic, the equivalence loss might still be meaningful. The persistence theorem ensures that hyperbolic invariant sets cannot be destroyed by small perturbations. Thus, if the equivalence loss can be regarded as a perturbation metric, one might argue that a smaller loss increases the likelihood that the pullbacked invariant set remains approximately invariant. However, since the persistence theorem requires $C^1$-closeness, this justification is not entirely rigorous in the current formulation based on C0-closeness. It may be possible for the authors to derive a $C^1$ bound from $C^0$-closeness, though this is uncertain.\n\nMoreover, if the underlying invariant sets are non-hyperbolic, no such guarantee exists. Even a small perturbation (= a nonzero equivalence loss) can drastically alter the structure of the invariant sets. The benchmarked systems in the paper appear to be restricted to low-dimensional, hyperbolic cases (such as attracting limit cycles), where the theoretical assumptions implicitly hold. It remains unclear whether the proposed framework would perform reliably beyond these settings."}, "questions": {"value": "The authors' method relies on the assumption that a smaller equivalence loss implies a closer correspondence between the true invariant set of the target system and the pullbacked one.
