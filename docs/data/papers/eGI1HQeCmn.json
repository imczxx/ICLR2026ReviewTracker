We present ImmunoTrace, an AI agent for immune history tracking that estimates past pathogen exposure from a single time-point repertoire by linking TCRs and HLA alleles to proteome-scale peptide libraries. A shared protein language model encodes TCR CDR3 sequences, HLA pseudo-sequences, and candidate peptides. Three high-capacity projection heads adapt these embeddings, and two cross-attention modules explicitly model TCR–peptide and HLA–peptide interactions. The fused representation is passed to a deep classifier to produce binding probabilities, while a contrastive branch with an InfoNCE objective and a learnable temperature sculpts the embedding space; we jointly optimize the contrastive and BCE losses while partially fine-tuning ESM2. For subject-level tracking, scores are calibrated into probabilities and evidence is aggregated across the repertoire with a probabilistic fusion scheme, yielding pathogen-level exposure estimates together with interpretable peptide-level evidence. On a multi-pathogen benchmark that includes Treponema pallidum (syphilis) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea), ImmunoTrace surpasses strong baselines, generalizes under protein and HLA distribution shifts, maintains well-calibrated predictions, and scales to proteome-sized libraries with practical latency.

The claim of being a “meta-agent” seems more aspirational than real. The architecture is a static retrieval-and-calibration pipeline, not an adaptive or reasoning system. It would be helpful if the authors clarified what exactly makes it an agent beyond modular composition. There’s no mention of statistical testing. Are the reported improvements significant at all? Even a simple bootstrap or t-test across splits would help substantiate the conclusions.\n2. The reported accuracy is around 0.9, alongside an AUC of 0.6 suggests heavy class imbalance. If so, accuracy is not meaningful; the authors should clarify their class distribution and thresholding approach.\n3. The probabilistic fusion step for aggregating clone-level scores feels ad hoc. It’s described in text but without mathematical justification, no comparison to Bayesian or ensemble fusion, nor analysis of how it affects calibration.\n4. There’s little biological validation of interpretability. The top peptides aren’t checked against known epitope databases (e.g., IEDB), so we don’t know if the evidence is biologically plausible or just statistical artifacts.\n5. Baselines feel cherry-picked. The paper compares ImmunoTrace mainly against older or less task-specific models (e.g., MHCflurry, generic sequence classifiers), while omitting several modern transformer or triad-based architectures that directly address TCR–peptide binding, such as TITAN, TCR-BERT, or DeepTCR-Plus, all of which have published benchmarks on similar datasets. These are widely recognized as stronger baselines for this problem. As a result, it’s difficult to tell whether the reported improvements reflect genuine advances or simply arise from comparing to weaker, partially unrelated methods. Including these contemporary models would make the “state-of-the-art” claim more credible and fair.\n6. The claim in the abstract \"scales to proteome-sized libraries with practical latency\" has no evidence. No runtime, memory, or latency benchmarks are provided.

Explicitly using both TCR and HLA information is biologically sound, as TCR recognition depends on presented peptides by specific HLA molecules.

For emerging pathogens like syphilis or gonorrhea, there is little known TCR data, so presumably the model is tested on predicted binding to entire proteomes. If so, the ground truth is synthetic. The absence of validation on real exposure data (e.g. known infected vs naive patients) is a major limitation. The authors should make clear whether any real repertoire-exposure datasets were used, or if all evaluation is on simulated labels.\n\n3. As Moris et al. (2021) note, models often fail on unseen epitopes. The paper claims good generalization under “protein and HLA shifts,” but the experimental protocol must ensure that epitopes (and HLA alleles) in test are disjoint from training. It is not evident that this was rigorously enforced.\n\n4. Predicting exposures requires distinguishing true binders from non-binders. The paper does not detail how negative examples (non-binding TCR–peptide pairs) are generated for training and evaluation. Careful selection of negatives is critical, as random negatives can make the task artificially easy.\n\n5. The method uses only CDR3 sequences (apparently of one chain) and HLA pseudo-sequences. Real TCR recognition involves both α and β chains, and co-receptors (CD4/CD8) which determine class I/II. These simplifications should be discussed.
