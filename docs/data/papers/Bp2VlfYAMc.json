To address these challenges, we propose a Text-Image Pairs Synthesis (TIPS) framework, which is capable of generating high-fidelity and diverse pedestrian text-image pairs in various real-world scenarios. Firstly, two efficient diffusion-model fine-tuning strategies are proposed to develop a Seed Person Image Generator (SPG) and an Identity Preservation Generator (IDPG), thus generating person image sets that preserve the same identity. Secondly, a general TIPS approach utilizing LLM-driven text prompt synthesis is constructed to produce person images in conjunction with SPG and IDPG. Meanwhile, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) is employed to filter images to ensure data quality and generate diverse captions. Furthermore, a Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) strategy is introduced, which combines textual and visual features via dual-encoder inference to consistently improve performance without architectural modifications. Extensive experiments conducted on TPR datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements of three representative TPR methods across zero-shot, few-shot, and generalization settings.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Text-based Person Retrieval", "Text-Image Pairs Synthesis", "Diffusion Model", "Identity Preservation", "Test-Time Augmentation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5cb31f70745199896376e10546aaff84dae3aefc.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a fully automated text-image pair synthesis framework, TIPS, to address critical challenges in Text-based Person Retrieval (TPR), such as poor zero-shot adaptability and the low quality and limited practicality of existing synthetic data.

However, in the methodology, the collection of training data in this work also involves gathering real-person images, which appears inconsistent with the stated motivation.\n2. **Presentation and Reproducibility**: The descriptions of SPG and IDPG in the methodology section are rather opaque, making it difficult to fully understand the specific generation processes. Moreover, the correspondence between the textual descriptions and Figure 2 is unclear, which further hinders comprehension. Additionally, the writing in the methods section lacks technical rigor and professionalism. For example, in the S3 stage, the paper merely states that the outputs are \"further evaluated for identity and outfit consistency with the seed image,\" but does not specify how MLLMs are utilized for evaluation, what the evaluation criteria are, or how generation quality and identity consistency are measured. Such methodological details are essential for reproducibility and for ensuring the technical soundness of the proposed approach.\n3. **Novelty**: The proposed framework is largely an engineering integration of existing generation techniques for data augmentation under different scenarios. While practically valuable, the paper lacks substantial methodological innovation, which may limit its impact on future research.\n4. **Experimental Setup**: The zero-shot setting samples images from CUHK03, CUHK02, Market-1501, MSMT17, and VIPER. However, the downstream dataset CUHK-PEDES contains images from CUHK03, Market-1501, and VIPER, while ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid contain images from MSMT17. This setup may lead to identity overlap, which contradicts the claimed zero-shot setting.
