As the number of cases continues to rise, the reliance on manual drafting of legal case documents is facing increasing pressure and challenges. The development of large language models (LLMs) offers a promising solution for automating document generation. However, existing benchmarks fail to fully capture the complexities involved in drafting legal case documents in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce CaseGen, the benchmark for multi-stage legal case documents generation in the Chinese legal domain. CaseGen is based on 500 real case samples annotated by legal experts and covers seven essential case sections. It supports four key tasks: drafting defense statements, writing trial facts, composing legal reasoning, and generating judgment results. To the best of our knowledge, CaseGen is the first benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in the context of legal case document generation. To ensure an accurate and comprehensive evaluation, we design the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework and validate its effectiveness through human annotations. We evaluate several widely used general-domain LLMs and legal-specific LLMs, highlighting their limitations in case document generation and pinpointing areas for potential improvement. This work marks a step toward a more effective framework for automating legal case documents drafting, paving the way for the reliable application of AI in the legal field.

The paper addresses an important and practical challenge in the legal domain.\n2. The creation of an expert-annotated dataset is a valuable contribution."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "My major concerns are about clarity and evaluation. The descriptions of the dataset construction and task definitions are ambiguous, making the work difficult to understand. More critically, the reliability of the evaluation is questionable; the reported human inter-annotator agreement (Kappa < 0.5) is too low to establish a reliable \"ground truth\", which in turn undermines the validity of the proposed LLM-as-judge. Detailed Comments are shown below:\n\n1. Ambiguity in Case Selection: The procedure for selecting the 500 representative cases is underspecified. The authors state they used K-means clustering but omit crucial details: How many clusters were generated? What was the distribution of cases across clusters (e.g., were sizes balanced)? What sampling strategy (e.g., random) was used to select cases from these groups? The paper should also justify why clustering was used over a more interpretable method for ensuring diversity, such as sampling cases based on their legal charges.\n\n2. Missing Annotation Consistency: The paper does not report the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) scores from the initial dataset annotation phase (Section 4.2.2). This metric is essential for assessing the quality and reliability of the ground-truth data itself.\n\n3. Lack of Data Filtering: The decision to keep all 500 initially selected cases is questionable. The authors note that some cases involved uncertain evidence or non-textual evidence (audio, images). Such cases are poor candidates for a text-generation benchmark and should have been filtered out to ensure data quality and task focus.\n\n4. Ambiguous Task Definitions: The definitions of the four subtasks are unclear, particularly regarding their specific inputs. For example, in Task 3 (Composing Legal Reasoning), it is not specified whether the input includes only the trial facts or also the original prosecution, evidence, and defense statements. Besides, Figure 2 appears to be misleading. It depicts the input for Task 2 as solely the \"Defense,\" whereas the text in Section 4.1.2 states the input is the \"evidence list, prosecution, and defense statement.\" This inconsistency should be resolved.\n\n5. Unsupported Motivation for Task Decomposition: The paper claims that splitting the generation process into four subtasks is necessary because the end-to-end task is too complex for current LLMs. This central claim is not substantiated with any empirical evidence. To justify this design choice, the authors should provide results from a baseline experiment showing a state-of-the-art LLM failing at the complete, end-to-end generation task.\n\n6. Incomplete Dataset Statistics: Table 1, which presents the statistics for the CaseGen dataset, only provides average lengths. To give readers a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, this table should be expanded to include other key descriptive statistics, such as the minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for document lengths.\n\n7. Low Human Agreement in Evaluation: The paper reports a human annotator's Kappa score of \"almost below 0.5\" for the evaluation task. A Kappa in this range (often considered \"slight\" or \"fair\" agreement) is insufficient to establish a reliable ground truth. If human experts cannot consistently agree on the quality of the generated text, it is difficult to trust the validity of an LLM-as-judge method that is calibrated against this inconsistent standard."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "asWJ7x9bvS", "forum": "fphoSzP4tI", "replyto": "fphoSzP4tI", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16155/Reviewer_WtDq"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16155/Reviewer_WtDq"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16155/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761838260716, "cdate": 1761838260716, "tmdate": 1762926323501, "mdate": 1762926323501, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper aims at benchmarking legal case document generation across an entire lifecycle of the legal process: from drafting defense statements, writing trial facts, composing legal reasoning, to generating judgment results.

There are some presentation issues that I think are detrimental to the quality of the paper. First and foremost it's the citation format that needs to be fixed. I don't think ICLR cites by numbers?

Also, you have four tasks for your set-up, and I am finding it hard to understand what those four tasks are based on Figure 1 alone. I think there should be significant modifications.\n\n2. I appreciate you releasing your inter-annotator agreement level - it is low (~50%) and I really think that however reduces the rigor of your eval - because it shows that the tasks are not that verifiable, even by 'gold' standards. So I hope to see you can analyze why the agreement level is low - just a few in-depth examples would give us much information and figure out the verifiability of this task.\n\n3. As I said, I think the problem in this paper is original and interesting. However, I think what's missing is that you can also study how different components relate to each this longitudinal process, like tracking the long context of the language model and see it can improve the overall generation.
