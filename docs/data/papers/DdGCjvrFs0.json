For biosensing, however, the primary early-stage task is different: selecting recognition elements (RE) that bind selectively to a given analyte. We present a large-scale biomolecular knowledge graph that aggregates data from 15 heterogeneous open sources: ~1.3 M entities and ~43 M edges of three types - interacts_with (experimental analyte-RE interactions), has_similarity (structure/sequence similarity), and has_biomarker (associations with physiological conditions). Despite typical sparsity, the graph is highly connected (97% of nodes in the giant component) and exhibits heavy-tailed degree distributions.\nWe cast the problem as large-scale link prediction on symmetric IW edges using PyTorch-BigGraph and introduce a symmetry-aware protocol (mirror pairs are not assigned to different splits). In a controlled operator-comparator study under a pairwise ranking loss, the unit-norm DistMult (cosine) configuration delivers the most stable results (MRR = 0.457, Hits@10 = 0.822) on a ~2.6 M-triple test set. A lightweight web interface supports interactive navigation and analysis. Overall, our KG and protocol provide in-vitro-oriented ranking of analyte-RE pairs, helping to narrow the experimental search space and accelerate the transition to sensor prototypes.", "tldr": "The large-scale biomolecular knowledge graph (1.3M entities, 43M edges) is constructed by integrating heterogeneous data sources and evaluated with PyTorch-BigGraph embeddings for link prediction.", "keywords": ["knowledge graph", "knowledge graph embedding", "link prediction", "biosensor"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f0587437998062399c9ca7c91feef2cbf4d76824.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper suggests an edit to a molecular graph dataset, to include new type of edges that correspond to e.g. structural similarities."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "Encoding new types of edges into molecular graphs seems interesting and possibly has potential, with aduiqete motivation and empirical validation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.
