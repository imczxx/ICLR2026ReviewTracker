However, standard pooling methods like mean or max aggregation treat tokens as an independent set, discarding the rich relational structure captured by the model's self-attention layers and making them susceptible to signal dilution. To address this, we introduce GLOT, a lightweight, structure-aware pooling module that reframes pooling as relational learning followed by aggregation. Operating on the outputs of a frozen LLM, GLOT first constructs a latent token-similarity graph, then refines token representations with a graph neural network, and finally aggregates them using a readout layer. Experimentally, our approach is remarkably robust and efficient: on a diagnostic stress test where 90% of tokens are random distractors, GLOT maintains over 97% accuracy while baseline methods collapse. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like GLUE and MTEB with 20x fewer trainable parameters and speeds up the training time by over 100x compared with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Supported by a theoretical analysis of its expressive power, our work shows that learning over token graphs is a powerful paradigm for the efficient adaptation of frozen LLMs.", "tldr": "A lightweight relational learning based pooling module for sentence representations from frozen LLMs. It attains SOTA on GLUE, IMDB, and MTEB, and remains highly robust to random noise.", "keywords": ["Graph-based token pooling; Sentence embeddings"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/db6e1657160a4fa9bb51faf4d4d22cb88ad3203c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes GLOT which is a novel pooling methodology that builds graph out of latent representations and then pass through them multiple layers of GNN and lastly using the recent learnable pooling technique called AdaPool to capture sentence level representations.

The authors construct the graph based on the similarity between token embeddings. This approach is relatively straightforward for discriminative PLMs with bidirectional attention.

Reframing sentence pooling as token-relation modeling.\nThe paper introduces GLOT, a new framework that replaces traditional pooling (e.g., mean or [CLS]) with a graph-based aggregation process. GLOT unifies prior pooling schemes as special cases (when the graph is empty or uniform) and explicitly addresses the long-standing signal dilution problem in sentence embeddings. Demonstrated by strong improvements in the signal dilution test (≈97% accuracy under 90% distractors; Table 7, Sec. 5.4).\n\n2. Strong consistency across diverse settings.\nGLOT shows consistent, significant improvements over both static and learnable pooling baselines on major benchmarks: GLUE, IMDB, and MTEB. It outperforms methods such as mean pooling, weighted pooling, [CLS] pooling, across both encoder-based and decoder-based LLMs. This shows the method’s robust generalization and practical applicability across models and tasks. (Sec. 5.1–5.3, Tables 2–4, Fig. 3.)\n\n3. High efficiency with minimal training cost.\nThe proposed module is extremely lightweight, only ≈ 8.9 M trainable parameters and ~ 0.42 GB GPU memory, compared to full fine-tuning or LoRA. Despite this small footprint, it delivers comparable or better accuracy and over 100× training-speed improvement. This efficiency makes GLOT highly practical for large-scale or resource-constrained deployments, supporting the paper’s claim of being a drop-in, low-cost alternative to fine-tuning.

While GLOT introduces a graph-based pooling paradigm, the graph construction step is heuristic; edges are formed by thresholding pairwise cosine similarities between token embeddings.\nThe paper does not explore learnable or adaptive graph formation, nor analyze how different thresholds quantitatively affect representation quality beyond a small ablation (τ = 0.4–0.6 works best). As a result, the approach lacks a deeper theoretical justification on how graph topology influences performance. (Sec. 3.2, Sec. 5.5, Table 6.)\n\n2. Although Table 5 reports large efficiency gains (≈100× faster, 0.42 GB GPU), this measurement is only for one dataset (CoLA) and one backbone (Mistral-7B). The paper does not provide cross-task or cross-model runtime, throughput, or latency benchmarks, and omits the cost of graph construction itself. Therefore, the claimed computational advantages, while promising, are not fully validated across broader conditions.\n\n3. The related-work section briefly mentions prior pooling and token-interaction models but does not clearly position GLOT relative to recent work. This leaves ambiguity about whether the proposed approach is a substantial conceptual advance or an effective adaptation of known ideas.\n\n4. The first step of GLOT involves computing a pairwise cosine similarity matrix between all L tokens in the sequence to determine the edges. This is an O(L^2) operation with respect to the sequence length L. While the paper tests on sequences up to 512 tokens (IMDB)9, this O(L^2) step could become a significant computational bottleneck for applications involving very long contexts (e.g., thousands of tokens), a limitation which is not discussed."}, "questions": {"value": "see Weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "QqRJcMbCWy", "forum": "stMX9KBhUI", "replyto": "stMX9KBhUI", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18979/Reviewer_56SJ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18979/Reviewer_56SJ"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18979/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761975430566, "cdate": 1761975430566, "tmdate": 1762931030823, "mdate": 1762931030823, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
