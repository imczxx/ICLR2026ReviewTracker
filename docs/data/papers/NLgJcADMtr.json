Iterative improvement frameworks address the limitations of pure construction policies, which often struggle with exploration and large-scale performance, but they remain constrained by solution encodings that ignore the hierarchical structure of routes. We introduce Hierarchical Aggregation Deconstruction Search (HADES), a neural improvement method with distance-aware, anisometric positional encodings tailored to routing solutions. HADES incorporates two complementary components: an in-route positional encoding, which captures the circular and non-uniform ordering of nodes within tours, and a cross-route encoding, which represents route membership and structural relations across tours. This hierarchical design provides solution representations better aligned with the anisometric and head-tail connected nature of VRPs, leading to more effective deconstruction. Extensive experiments across multiple VRP variants demonstrate that our model consistently advances the state of the art, with particularly strong gains on large-scale benchmarks.

While larger instances show stronger gains, the marginal improvement on smaller scales suggests the method's advantage is primarily in scalability rather than fundamental quality.\n- Incomplete Analysis of Discovered Heuristics: The paper claims operators are \"novel and powerful\" but provides no concrete examples. No visualization or interpretation of what the model learns through IPE/CPE. Missing analysis of which types of removals the model prioritizes (e.g., does it preferentially select customers with high cumulative distance? customers at angular boundaries?\n- Computational Cost Not Reported: Training cost is not mentioned (2000 epochs × 150K instances × 128 rollouts is substantial). Comparison of training cost vs. performance gain is missing. No discussion of whether the improvements justify the training investment.\n- Methodological Concerns: CPE reference route selection: Randomly selecting a reference route r* seems arbitrary. How sensitive is performance to this choice? Would a consistent selection (e.g., leftmost route) be more stable? Head-tail alignment: The circular normalization ˆdi = (di/dL) · 2π ensures IPE(v1) = IPE(vL), but this assumes symmetric distance matrices. For asymmetric problems, this alignment may be misleading. \n- The term \"anisometric\" is used extensively but never formally defined. A brief definition would help readability.\n- Algorithm notation inconsistency: the paper uses both πθ(·|·) and p(·|·) for the policy\n- Experimental Design: Why use different numbers of augmentations for different problems (8 for CVRP/VRPTW, 128 for PCVRP)? This inconsistency is not explained. Test set sizes vary (128 for CVRP-500 from Drakulic, 100 for CVRP-1000/2000 from Ye, 250 new for VRPTW/PCVRP). This heterogeneity complicates comparison. No error bars or variance across runs reported.\n- NCO-LLM and other LLM-based methods are included but not discussed in detail.\n- Generalization Claims: Table 3 tests low-capacity and clustered distributions, but these are relatively mild distribution shifts. More challenging shifts (e.g., extremely heterogeneous demands, mixed urban/rural layouts) would strengthen the generalization story."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Computational Cost Analysis\nWhat is the total training cost (GPU hours, wall-clock time, dollars) for each problem/size? On CVRP-500, you improve by only 0.10% absolute (36.66 → 36.60) over HGS. Does the performance gain justify the training investment, and at what deployment scale does HADES become cost-effective?\n\n2. IPE Normalization Across Routes\nYou normalize cumulative distance per route: ˆdi = (di/dL) · 2π. How does this handle tours of vastly different lengths in the same solution (e.g., one route of length 100, another of length 10)? Doesn't the same physical distance map to different IPE values across routes, breaking the \"distance-aware\" property you emphasize? Have you tried global normalization instead?\n\n3. CPE Reference Route Selection\nThe reference route r is randomly selected, meaning different random seeds produce different CPE values for the same solution. How does the model handle this non-determinism during training and testing? Have you compared random vs. deterministic selection (e.g., leftmost route)? Additionally, why not use circular mean instead of arithmetic mean for ϕr to avoid wraparound issues (e.g., averaging 10° and 350° gives 180°)?\n\n4. Interpretability and Learned Strategies\nCan you provide concrete examples with visualizations showing what removal patterns HADES learns? Does it preferentially remove customers with high cumulative distance, customers at route boundaries, or customers from specific angular sectors? Can you visualize decoder attention weights to show which customers receive high attention? This analysis is crucial for understanding why your method works and building trust for practical deployment.\n\n5. Statistical Rigor\nTable 1 reports point estimates with no error bars or variance. Can you provide standard deviations across multiple runs, confidence intervals, and statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-test vs. HGS)? \n\n6. Ablation to Isolate Contributions\nThe IPE ablation shows only 0.02% improvement (36.56 → 36.54), while CPE shows 0.04% (36.57 → 36.54). These gains seem marginal. Have you tested an \"NDS + IPE/CPE\" configuration to isolate whether the improvements come from the encodings vs. other algorithmic choices (winner-takes-all training, architecture, hyperparameters)? Can you attribute the 0.10-0.14% gain over NDS to specific components?\n\n7. Generalization Beyond Training Distribution\nYou train on N ≤ 400 but test on N = 2000 (5× larger). Why not train on larger instances? Table 3 tests relatively mild distribution shifts (low capacity, clustered layouts). Can you test more challenging shifts like extreme demand heterogeneity (demand ∈ {1, 100}), mixed urban/rural layouts, asymmetric distances, or multi-depot problems? How well do the circular and radial inductive biases hold in these cases?\n\n8. Experimental Design Concerns\nSeveral design choices seem inconsistent or unexplained: (a) Why use 8× augmentations for CVRP/VRPTW but 128× for PCVRP? (b) Your test protocol uses 200 rollouts × 8 augmentations = 1600 evaluations while HGS/SISRs use deterministic search. Is this a fair computational comparison? (d) Why use different test set sizes (128, 100, 250) across benchmarks?\n\n9. Practical Deployment and Future Directions\nCan HADES handle real-world constraints like driver breaks, multiple depots, and heterogeneous fleets, or would you need to retrain for each constraint? \n\n**Minor Corrections**\n\n- Line 229: \"ˆdi = di/dL · 2π\" should clarify whether this is element-wise\n- Figure 4: The illustration could benefit from showing actual angle values"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "hqq5nU8ykF", "forum": "NLgJcADMtr", "replyto": "NLgJcADMtr", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24233/Reviewer_VDdB"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24233/Reviewer_VDdB"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24233/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761989706154, "cdate": 1761989706154, "tmdate": 1762943008861, "mdate": 1762943008861, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Hierarchical Aggregation Deconstruction Search (HADES), a neural improvement framework for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) under the umbrella of Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO).
