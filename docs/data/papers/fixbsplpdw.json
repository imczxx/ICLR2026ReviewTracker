A single simulation can generate tremendous data volumes, often forcing researchers to discard valuable information. A prime example of this is plasma turbulence described by the Gyrokinetic equations: nonlinear, multiscale, and 5D in phase space. They represent one of the most computationally demanding frontiers of modern science, with runs taking weeks and resulting in tens of terabytes of data dumps.\nThe increasing storage demands underscore the importance of compression, however, compressed snapshots might not preserve essential physical characteristics after reconstruction. To assess whether such characteristics are captured, we propose a spatiotemporal evaluation pipeline which accounts for structural phenomena and multi-scale transient fluctuations. Indeed, we find that various compression techniques lack preservation of temporal turbulence characteristics. Therefore, we explore Physics-Informed Neural Compression (PINC), which incorporates physics-informed losses tailored to gyrokinetics and enables extreme compressions of over 100000x.

Additionally, performance was also listed as a strength (__kwUE__, __Dmk1__, __QH9G__), with extreme compression ratios (up to 70,000x) while preserving physics. The strong and comprehensive empirical evaluation, with extensive ablations, scaling and a large-scale dataset was also praised (__kwUE__, __Dmk1__).\n\n## Common concerns\n__Temporal Consistency Evaluation__. Quantitative metrics assessing transient dynamics are missing (__kwUE__, __QH9G__). To address this, we add the metric suggested by __kwUE__, as well as the endpoint error of optical flow, commonly used for temporal evaluation in video processing and generation.\n\n__Generalizability__. PINC is _gyrokinetics-specific_, and extension to other scientific fields is unclear (__Dmk1__, __WgAS__). We clarified our contributions, some of which may be transferrable to other domains, such as specific loss terms of evaluation metrics.\n\n__Stability__. Concerns regarding the sensitivity of the various loss terms and the difficulty of the optimization (__kwUE__, __Dmk1__). We did not experience severe instabilities during optimization, especially for neural fields where equal weighting across loss terms performs well. In addition we experimented with established methods tackling conflicting gradients in Appendix C.5 and C.6.\n\n__Related works and positioning__. Differences to prior work are unclear (__Dmk1__, __kwUE__, __WgAS__). We clarify our positioning in the respective responses and in the revised manuscript.\n\n__Baselines__. Limited to traditional methods (e.g., ZFP, JPEG2000), no comparisons to learned compression methods (__kwUE__, __QH9G__). We reimplemented  VAPOR (Choi et al.) and added it to our manuscript. Our neural compression techniques trained with PINC significantly outperform it w.r.t. both compression rate and physics preservation.\n\n---\nChoi et al., 2021, _Neural data compression for physics plasma simulation_"}}, "id": "a2HYfsIqOe", "forum": "fixbsplpdw", "replyto": "fixbsplpdw", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18255/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18255/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18255/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763486310798, "cdate": 1763486310798, "tmdate": 1763486310798, "mdate": 1763486310798, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the storage and analysis bottleneck for high-fidelity 5D gyrokinetic plasma turbulence simulations, which generate terabytes of data.
