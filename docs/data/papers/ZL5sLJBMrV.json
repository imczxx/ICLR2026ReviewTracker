In this work, we focus specifically on\naquatic locomotion of fish-like robotic, where the control objective is to track spe-\ncific target point while maintaining energy efficiency within the constrained time.\nThe agent observes low-dimensional kinematic states and flow-related signals,\nand outputs oscillation frequency commands that drive body undulation. These\nsensing–action constraints define a task that requires both accurate flow responses\nand fast, iterative learning. Motivated by these domain-specific requirements, we\npropose a task-oriented Physical Data-Driven Flow Simulation (PD-FS) frame-\nwork—a staged pipeline that couples lightweight neural surrogates with physics-\nguided refinement in full-order CFD. PD-FS incorporates mode-conditioned sur-\nrogate models with cycle-locked and memory-aware updates, enabling sample-\nefficient training while faithfully reproducing critical frequency-switching dynam-\nics. Rather than claiming general applicability, we position PD-FS as an engineer-\ning integration tailored for fish swimming control under fluid–structure interac-\ntion. Policies refined in the CFD solvers adapt to nonlinear flow responses without\nrelying on extensive domain randomization. In controlled fish-locomotion bench-\nmarks, PD-FS achieves nearly 50 times faster training compared with CFD-only\nbaselines, while reducing energy expenditure by over 20% at comparable success\nrates.

The paper frames PD-FS as “first” to unify surrogate efficiency with CFD fidelity for DRL, which overreaches given prior aquatic-control simulators and surrogate-guided RL; the abstract/intro should avoid first-claim language and more carefully position contributions as an engineering integration for a specific domain.\n\n(B) *Literature coverage and positioning*: The aquatic locomotion and RL for fluidic control literature is treated narrowly. There is substantial prior work (from multiple groups at Caltech/Stanford/Harvard/UW, and others) on DRL/MBRL for flow/flow-control that is either omitted or not compared. This contributes to the impression of novelty inflation.\n\n(C) *Baselines are dated for the surrogate*: Comparisons emphasize global MLP / GNN surrogates and the proposed partitioned MLP, but omit state-of-the-art global operators widely used for fluid dynamics (e.g., Fourier/transformer operators, modern transformer world-models). Consequently, the experimental evidence doesn’t establish PD-FS’s competitiveness versus stronger global surrogates; even the “dated” baselines sometimes behave poorly (drift), which could be an artifact of baseline under-tuning. A contemporary baseline like SHRED (and/or latent-transformer models) would materially strengthen claims.\n\n(D) *Misleading narrative focus*: The abstract/intro lead with broad, almost robotics-generic motivation before specifying the aquatic locomotion control problem. For clarity and honesty, the paper should state the aquatic task first, then argue why the staged surrogate-CFD pipeline helps with this problem. The current ordering contributes to a mismatch between promises and scope. (specifically CFD fo acquatic is **significantly** easier than CFD for aerial)\n\n(E) *Limited insight beyond engineering integration*: While the pipeline is practical, the paper does not surface new scientific insights about flow control or learning dynamics"}, "questions": {"value": "Abstract/Intro reframing: Please reorder the abstract and Section 1 to state the aquatic locomotion task upfront (objective, constraints, sensing/action space) and then motivate the surrogate to CFD strategy relative to this task? This would reduce over-generalization and align claims to scope.\n\nLiterature integration: Please substantially expand the aquatic-control related work and provide direct empirical or conceptual comparisons to prior DRL/MBRL efforts in fluidic control (including multi-institution work from Caltech/Stanford/Harvard/UW, etc.). Where do your contributions concretely advance beyond those systems (data regime, wall-clock, sim-to-real robustness)?\n\nSurrogate baselines: Why are transformer/Fourier operator surrogates absent? Given their strong performance in CFD surrogacy, adding at least one modern global operator baseline seems essential. If not included, please justify (data size, stability issues) and discuss how PD-FS would adapt to a transformer-style surrogate.\n\nWhy does partitioning help? Can you quantify the hysteresis the network is capturing (e.g., Bode-style phase lag vs. (\\omega) change, recovery time constants, energy transients) to turn a heuristic into an insight? A brief system-ID analysis would help crystallize the contribution\n\nControl-algorithm baselines: Beyond PPO, can you include model-based RL (e.g., planning with the learned surrogate) and/or DR + residual policy baselines commonly used for sim-to-real? This would test whether the speedups translate to policy quality at equal compute.\n\nReal-robot evaluation: The hardware demo concentrates on straight-line swimming.

The authors, at multiple points in the paper, claim some property of their framework without providing sufficient (or any) evidence. First, they claim on line 72, that their model generalizes across regimes and perturbations, but their experiments are only limited to fish locomotion. The model or the learned policy is not demonstrated in other tasks. In this sense, the title of the paper is quite misleading, since the proposed methodology is only applicable to fish locomotion and not for general control. Second, around line 306, the authors claim that the learned policy exhibits robust propulsive stability and adaptive control capability, yet there are no experiments/ablations demonstrating that. In Appendix E, the authors attempt to demonstrate some ablations, but the results seem to be less numerical and more subjective, like ‘low’ or ‘high’ drift, ‘slow’ or ‘fast’ convergence speed, which is unsatisfactory.\n2. The paper can be improved a lot writing and presentation wise. First, there are points like model drift from not using a partitioned frequency, or the three stage pipeline which is the main contribution, which are repeatedly mentioned unnecessarily. The authors can instead use the space to expand on some required background for a general reader, like the dependance of dynamics of locomotion on the tail-beat frequency which seems to be one of the central motivations of the network design. Second, most of  the figures and diagrams (both the ones explaining the methodology and the experiments) are not adequately explained, only mentioned briefly in the text. It would be very informative if you include this valuable information in the captions. For example, it is not clear at all what the swim modes represent in Figure 5.  \n3.
