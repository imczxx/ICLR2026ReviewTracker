Prior work treats this as a security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice, most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can become a central point of failure. We study \\textit{adaptive} attacks by an untrusted model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector by which the attacker embeds known or zero-shot prompt injections in the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires, as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.", "tldr": "We show that AI controls can be easily subverted when, in adaptive evaluations, an untrusted LLM targets trusted monitors", "keywords": ["AI Control", "AI Safety", "Jailbreaks", "Oversight"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0ea56b5b86265ba5f86043eb59601030b9f82363.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper shows that the simple prompted monitors used by prior work on AI control are easy to jailbreak, either by having LLMs adapt existing attacks from the literature, or by having LLMs find new attacks zero-shot.
