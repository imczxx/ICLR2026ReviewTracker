In theory, even with a fixed index distribution, by appropriately updating the model parameters, we can still achieve a good approximation of the posterior. Thus, we need a better justification of Bayesian ensemble. I think the theoretical justification of this paper is relatively weak. In particular, the analyses (Theorem 1 and 2) are limited to a specific case. Also, the conclusions on variances are only vaguely connected to the \"exploratory behavior\". I recommend that the authors significantly improve the theoretical results of this paper: first, please analyze under a general setting rather than a specific case; second, please present the analysis results in term of regret bounds rather than the variance. One possible result is that the authors might prove a better regret bound of Bayesian ensemble compared to the standard ensemble with a fixed index distribution. This will significantly strengthen the paper.\n\n- The experiment results of this paper look interesting and strong, but it is unclear to me if this paper has done sufficient hyper-parameter sweep for the baseline agents.

Similar questions for all other agents. \n\n- It seems that this paper has only considered Beta index distributions in the experiments, why?

The paper justifies this as mitigating overestimation, but this design is not fully ablated or motivated. It's unclear why a more standard Thompson Sampling approach (sampling an index $j \\sim p$ for action selection) was not used.\n3.  **Theoretical Limitations:** As noted, the variance analysis for BE-DQN is performed in a zero-reward MDP. The authors rightly state in the appendix that these bounds may not hold in environments with high reward stochasticity. This is a significant limitation that should be more prominently acknowledged in the main paper, as it bounds the applicability of the theoretical stability guarantees.\n4.  **Experimental Gaps:** The exclusion of the `ensemble+ (BEB)` method from the real-world Yahoo!R6B experiment due to computational cost is understandable but leaves a gap in the evaluation.
