It requires interpreting fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on selectively identifying and integrating the right details from a rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse mathematical domains, covering videos from 10 seconds to over 1 hour. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality, for over 920 man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios, questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem solving, conceptual transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model capabilities. Through this benchmark, we establish an evaluation framework for models that must reason, rather than merely perceive, jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and textual modalities, across temporally extended mathematical problem settings.", "tldr": "Mathematical Reasoning using Video MLLM Benchmark", "keywords": ["Multimodal Reasoning", "Video Question Answering", "Mathematical Understanding", "Temporal Reasoning", "Visual Grounding"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1817d3f4aa7687075a080937c2401cfd105bbb26.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces VideoMathQA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical reasoning in videos.

While the authors claiming that they have filled the gap of video-based reasoning in math or very specific domains, there is work in [1] which have (1). videos in math, biology and various other scientific domains; and (2). question with high-quality human annotations which include reasoning. Therefore, the contribution might be incremental. A discussion and comparison should be made.\n\n[1] Sun et al. \"video-SALMONN-o1: Reasoning-enhanced Audio-visual Large Language Model\". ICML 2025.\n \n1.2. The size of the dataset is questionable especially when there are only 420 MCQs. The authors should justify whether 420 questions are enough to draw statistically significant conclusions when comparing different models. Especially when 10 sub-categories are given, as shown in Table 1, there are a lot of systems having the same score because there are not enough data samples. This makes analysis in the results part unconvincing because the difference might just be getting a couple more questions right. \\\nI would encourage the authors to theoretically compute the number of samples needed to have statistically significance in their results.\n\n1.3. Statistics and verification of human annotator quality missing. Statistics and evidence should be provided to show whether the annotators are reliable, such as inter-annotator agreement for their reasoning steps etc. I do not see a reason why we need the number of human-hour since the efficiency of human annotators can vary a lot.\n\n2. __Lack of justification for the need of Human Reasoning__:\n\nWhile a lot of efforts have been made to human reasoning annotation, it is unclear whether those are helpful performance indicators. While the authors try to do a comparison using LLM-as-a-judge. I have the following concerns regarding this part:\n  - I do not understand the results stated in Appendix C (Note that without referring to Appendices, the justification for this is missing in the main paper). Proper metrics, e.g. Pearson Correlation Coefficient at sample level should be given instead of saying the performance metrics are close to each other. Per-sample PCC is suitable here because we are assigning scores and comparing the absolute values of the scores. \n  - An easier and more objective way would be to perform rollout and check the rate of correctness to assign scores to each reasoning step. This is standard in reasoning literature and is more controllable and convincing to me than using LLM-as-a-judge, especially with such a small LLM.
