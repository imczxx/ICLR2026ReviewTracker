Most existing approaches treat forward problems and inverse problems as separate ones. In this article, we present a novel method based on rectified flow that integrates the solution of both problems in a single model. Specifically, in the training stage, we approximate the velocity field in rectified flow with fixed pairs $z(0) = a$ and $z(T) = u$, where $a$ is the input parameter and $u$ is the corresponding solution. In the inference stage, the forward problem can be solved by feeding $z(0)$ with $a$ and running the forward pass of the flow model, and the inverse problem can be solved by feeding $z(T)$ with $u$ and running the reverse pass of the flow model. Numerical results on various equations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy in solving forward problems and shows better performance in solving inverse problems within a single model.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["operator learning", "inverse problems", "flow-based models", "partial differential equations"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e64972782e44a60a346aa1d1af336033c14a67e3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a Rectified Flow-Based Operator (RFO) that unifies the solution of forward and inverse PDE problems within a single model.
