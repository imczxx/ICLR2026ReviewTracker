MAP inference in credal networks, which seeks the most probable variable assignment given evidence, becomes inherently more difficult than in Bayesian networks because it involves computations over a complex joint credal set. In this paper, we introduce two tasks called \\emph{maximax} and \\emph{maximin} MAP, and develop depth-first branch-and-bound search algorithms for solving them \\emph{exactly}. The algorithms exploit problem decomposition by exploring an AND/OR search space and use a partitioning-based heuristic function enhanced with a cost-shifting scheme to effectively guide the search. Our experimental results obtained on both random and realistic credal networks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms as they scale to large and complex problem instances.", "tldr": "The paper presents new branch and bound search algorithms for exact MAP inference in credal networks", "keywords": ["probabilistic reasoning", "credal networks", "search", "MAP inference"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e727ba68adf9f6d85c23a37536cdd3892bf1e73e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f323f1da02c0305428886c9d7d87c6eec416d942.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a new way of exactly deriving versions of the MAP estimate for credal networks, a generalization of Bayesian networks to sets of probabilities.

In principle, the algorithm can find the true optimal MAP solution if given enough time, since branch-and-bound guarantees exactness through exhaustive search with pruning. However, in practice, the approach relies heavily on heuristic bounds to reduce runtime, meaning that its “exactness” depends on the tightness of those bounds.
