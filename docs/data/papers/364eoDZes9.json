Authors propose an approach dubbed Pre-Control, which optimizes a MLP-based value function to estimate the (multi-)attribute intensity of resulting outputs from the LLM's hidden representations of partial generations. Once trained, the value function is exploited during generation to perform test-time interventions on LLM representations, aiming to achieve the requested attribute conditioning by adjusting the hidden states via gradient descent. Notably, the traditional alignment problem aiming to maximize/minimize attributes is reformulated as target-reaching to enable finer-grained control over attribute intensities. Authors propose using Pre-Control to efficiently estimate the best combinations of attribute control without incurring in the costly sampling of grid search for various attribute intensity values. Pre-Control is evaluated on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini for the HelpSteer2 and Code-UltraFeedback datasets, showing improved attribute adherence across one-shot and iterated interventions, and applications to efficient Pareto frontier approximation and controllable model distillation."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "Originality: The use of TD learning for value function training in the context of LLM attribute control is a creative application of reinforcement learning techniques.\n\nQuality: The experimental evaluation is sufficiently comprehensive, spanning two datasets, two models and various baseline methods. Results seem to suggest consistent improvements over the tested baseline approaches.\n\nClarity: The mathematical formulations and figures in the paper are clear and well-structure, aiding understanding. The inclusion of qualitative examples in Tables 9-10 helps demonstrate the practical impact of the method.\n\nSignificance: The work addresses an important are of research, aiming to render the process of multi-attribute control more efficient. A reduction in sample requirements for distillation while maintaining quality could have significant implications for efficient model adaptation to arbitrary styles, making the proposed implementation desirable over more costly approaches."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Limited novelty: The proposed method closely resembles to the established Plug-and-play language modeling (PPLM) paradigm [1], which employs the prediction of a conditional attribute model at inference time to update the activations of a language model using a gradient update. The main innovations in this context are 1) the use of temporal difference learning for training the attribute model, as opposed to BoW/supervised classifiers used in PPLM; 2) The usage of scalar values expressing intensity for the property of interest, instead of binary properties to maximize. The combination of various attribute models at inference time was already proposed and evaluated by the PPLM authors, so it cannot be considered particularly novel. For 1), authors state that TD provides \"crucial intermediate feedback signals that were previously missing in preference alignment methods\". In this context, an ablation of the effectiveness of TD compared to traditional supervised approaches would have been necessary to provide evidence in support of this statement. In the case of 2), requiring attributes to match a specific scalar value can be equated to a progressive shift towards the desired attribute, modulated by some step size to enable gradual maximization towards a desired non-binary attribute intensity. In light of these remarks, the core contribution of this work in terms of novelty is the proposed replacement of traditional supervised approaches  for conditioning with established RL methods represents an interesting, albeit modest innovation.\n\nEvaluation of Style vs Quality Trade-off: The main concern with the proposed approach and the evaluation conducted by the authors is the absence of explicit controls to ensure attribute conditioning does not disrupt generation quality. This is commonly done in conditioning approaches, e.g. by using a reference model for PPO or incorporating non-conditional LM probability in the loss. In the proposed formulation, I do not see any component accounting for overall quality beyond attribute conditioning. In the evaluation, the only metric that does not concern attribute accuracy is diversity measured by Self-BLEU, which is however not sufficient to account for generation quality. \n\nClarity issues: Despite the stated ability to condition on multiple attributes at once, the examples provided in Appendix G are, in essence, simply showing an increase/decrease in verbosity, and are for this reason not very convincing in showcasing multi-attribute conditioning. Relatedly, while the paper demonstrates strong average performance, it lacks discussion of when and why the method might fail. Analysis of cases where Pre-Control fails to reach target intensities, or where the generated text quality degrades despite matching target scores, would provide valuable insights. \n\nSignificance of the results: Regarding the Pareto frontier approximation experiments, the shift in reward resulting from conditioning shown in Figure 4 is barely noticeable, putting in question the significance of the results. In general, the choice of evaluation metrics favor direct optimization of precise attribute values, for which is not surprising that an ad-hoc optimized model achieves the best scores compared to the other tested methods.\n\n[1] Dathathri et al. 2020.
