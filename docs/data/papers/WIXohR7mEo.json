Models that perform well on these tasks could in principle be integrated into a planner or be used directly as a policy. We discuss the complexity of these tasks as well as the complexity of validating the correctness of their answers and present validation algorithms for each task. Equipped with these validators, we test the performance of a variety of models on our tasks and find that for most of these tasks, the performance of even the largest models is still subpar.  The models do not possess even the most basic capability of identifying which actions can be performed in a given state.   No model outperforms any other on our proposed tasks and, with a few exceptions, all tested language models score below 65\\%, indicating that even the current frontier language models as well as so-called reasoning models have a long way to go before they can reliably reason about planning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Planning", "Dataset and Benchmark", "Large Language Models"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b6a69da53e2e365b656c4817b18c72ba19b984ff.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/1e7a9dbbba73aac58ca9bf0bf0a0f7aebfeecb9d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper describes and novel dataset on planning tasks which are supposed to be harder.

It builds upon the prior ACPBench work which only included boolean and multiple-choice questions, with the difference being that this benchmark requires models to generate complete answers that automated planners would produce during the planning process. Specifically, the benchmark includes eight reasoning tasks across thirteen planning domains: applicability, progression, reachability, action reachability, validation, justification, landmarks, and next action. The authors develop symbolic validators for each task and evaluate fifteen models ranging from 8B to 405B parameters, including reasoning models like o1. Their central finding is that even frontier language models perform poorly, with most scoring below 65% on most tasks, indicating substantial gaps in planning reasoning capabilities."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper makes an important advance in evaluating the planning/reasoning abilities of LLMs and LRMs by shifting from discriminative to generative evaluation, which more faithfully represents the actual decision-making processes that (symbolic) planners perform. This transition is non-trivial because generative tasks require models to produce answers from large action spaces rather than selecting from pre-curated options, making the benchmark more realistic for assessing practical planning capabilities.\n\nUsing symbolic validators is also a substantial strength of the benchmark. Unlike other approaches that use other LLMs for evaluation (which introduces noise and potential biases), these validators provide deterministic and theoretically grounded correctness verification. The authors thoughtfully discuss computational complexity for both the tasks themselves and their validation procedures, with several tasks being PSPACE-complete.\n\nThe empirical evaluation is comprehensive, testing fifteen models including small (8B), medium (33-34B), large (70B-405B), and reasoning models (o1, DeepSeek R1), providing good coverage of the current model landscape. The inclusion of recent reasoning models is particularly valuable for understanding whether extended inference computation translates to improved planning reasoning.\n\nThe qualitative analysis also provides insights into specific failure modes, such as models recognizing blocks cannot be stacked on themselves but struggling with more subtle applicability constraints, or o1-preview's systematic off-by-one errors in the validation task. These concrete observations are more informative than aggregate statistics alone.\n\nThe investigation of representation formats, i.e., combinations of NL and PDDL descriptions, is a good additional experiment. Maybe not surprisingly, the PDDL+NL representation substantially improves performance, which may have some implications for how planning problems should be presented to LLMs."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "One of the immediate weaknesses I notice in the paper is on the evaluation side. Namely:\n\n- The main paper lacks details about exact prompts used, model hyperparameters (temperature, top-p,), random seeds, and how many independent runs were conducted. The paper states a maximum of 1,000 tokens was used (4,000 for GPT-OSS models) but does not specify whether models used greedy decoding or sampling with what parameters. Given the stochastic nature of LLMs, these details are essential for reproducibility.\n\n- The paper employs only 2-shot prompting without exploring alternative prompting strategies. Given the complexity of these tasks, this seems limiting. The paper does not investigate whether chain-of-thought prompting, task decomposition, or additional examples might improve performance. The reasoning models presumably use some form of extended reasoning internally, but the regular LLMs were not given explicit instructions to reason step-by-step in the prompts. At least, that's what can be inferred from the main paper. Additionally, the \"lenient grammar-based parser\" that discards non-conforming tokens may reject valid answers expressed in unexpected formats. The paper acknowledges evaluating only the first answer when models might produce multiple, but does not quantify how often parsing failures occur versus genuine incorrect answers.\n\n- The representation experiment reveals that PDDL+NL substantially improves performance (at least for DeepSeek V3). But why does providing PDDL help? Is it because the structured representation reduces ambiguity? Do models pattern-match on PDDL syntax? Does this suggest LLMs are better at parsing structured representations than natural language descriptions? This result might have implications for prompt engineering and practical deployment, meaning that a deeper analysis including ablations and attention visualization will be beneficial (however, one can argue this is beyond the scope of this paper)."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
