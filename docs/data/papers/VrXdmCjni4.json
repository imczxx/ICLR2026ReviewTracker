This capability is essential for adapting to dynamic environments without forgetting prior information. Although existing IOD methods have made progress in mitigating catastrophic forgetting, they usually lack explicit and quantitative modeling of information conflicts during knowledge preservation, making task boundaries ambiguous. Such conflicts often stem from the fact that a single image can contain objects belonging to previous, present, and future tasks, where unlabeled past and future objects are often mistakenly treated as background. In this paper, we propose a novel approach grounded in Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to alleviate conflict knowledge preservation caused by task interference. Specifically, we introduce the Interference Knowledge Isolated Elastic Weight Consolidation (IKI-EWC) framework for IOD, which leverages the mispredictions of the old detector on new task data to estimate task conflicts and suppresses them at the parameter level. By reformulating the Bayesian posterior of model parameters, we derive a mathematical relationship between previously learned knowledge and interference knowledge, enabling targeted elimination of conflicts during model weight updates. In addition, we also propose a prototype-based knowledge calibration (PKC) mechanism to further preserve old knowledge during the training of the objector's classification head. This method employs a learnable projection layer to compensate semantic drift in old class prototypes, and then jointly trains the classification head using both calibrated prototypes and current task features, thereby mitigating forgetting caused by classifier updates. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches across various settings.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["continual learning", "object detection"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ff6b0bacd946c01804562f510ee27e57ee6f0daf.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f8423f5086ef315f7c4f0132157c2d8604b11ba3.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses a key issue in incremental object detection: future classes are unlabeled in early tasks and are therefore learned as background, but later must be detected as foreground.

PKC addresses semantic drift using a lightweight projection together with prototype-based retraining, with small overhead and yielding clear gains (as confirmed by ablations). Moreover, compared with certain dual-teacher distillation schemes, the proposed method is simpler in both computation and implementation.\n\n3. The paper is well structured and clearly written. Figures 1 and 2 intuitively illustrate the core idea and overall framework, enabling rapid understanding.

The core of IKI-EWC is to accurately estimate interference regions, a procedure that relies entirely on pseudo-labels generated by the previous model ($M_{t-1}$ ) on the new data. If $M_{t-1}$ has degraded in performance or exhibits prediction bias, the interference estimation may be inaccurate, thereby affecting the overall performance of the framework. Although the paper notes this in the limitations section, it does not experimentally analyze how sensitive the method is to pseudo-label quality as a function of  $M_{t-1}$ performance.\n\n2. The statistical robustness of the relative mass $k$ is not demonstrated. Since $k$  is computed as a ratio of proposal counts, it is highly sensitive to the IoU threshold, the number of proposals, class long-tail effects, and scale distributions. When sample size or the positive/negative balance fluctuates across stages, the variance of  $k$  can become large, causing the importance III to oscillate excessively. The paper lacks a systematic report of confidence intervals and sensitivity analysis for $k$ .\n\n3. Evidence for the “approximate independence/orthogonality” assumption is limited. The derivations assume that “clean historical data” and “current data” are approximately independent, and cite an early-training gradient angle of ≈90° as support. However, orthogonality is not independence, and early mini-batches do not characterize the entire training trajectory. If representations become increasingly coupled later on—especially in multi-object/multi-scale settings—the premise underlying the posterior reconstruction weakens, potentially biasing the direction of the regularization. This point requires more extensive discussion.\n\n4. PKC’s “prototype + linear projection” design is simple; however, compared with EFC’s anisotropic constraints with Gaussian-prototype updates, and LDC’s label-free learnable drift compensation, it might show clear shortcomings in the granularity of drift modeling, robustness and statistical sufficiency.\n\n5. Several implementation details are insufficiently specified—for example, the confidence threshold for pseudo-labels, the method and computational cost of Hessian/Fisher estimation, and the sampling procedure used in PKC. In addition, it is not fully transparent whether data augmentation and preprocessing are exactly matched to the strong baselines in both the rehearsal-free and rehearsal-based regimes.\n\n[1] Elastic Feature Consolidation for Cold Start Exemplar-Free Incremental Learning, ICLR 2024.\n[2] Exemplar-free Continual Representation Learning via Learnable Drift Compensation, ECCV 2024."}, "questions": {"value": "See above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "smiEJCN66f", "forum": "VrXdmCjni4", "replyto": "VrXdmCjni4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12158/Reviewer_V8s4"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12158/Reviewer_V8s4"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12158/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762047231851, "cdate": 1762047231851, "tmdate": 1762923112261, "mdate": 1762923112261, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles the interference of knowledge between past/present knowledges in Incremental dense prediction problems.
