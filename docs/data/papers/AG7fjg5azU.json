Yet, most research assumes this structure is given, overlooking the fact that alternative designs can emphasize different aspects of the data and substantially influence downstream performance.\nAs a theoretical foundation for such designs, we introduce the principle of entity-attribute duality: attributes can be atomized as entities with their associated relations, while entities can, in turn, serve as attributes of others. This principle motivates atomic HIN, a canonical representation that makes all modeling choices explicit and achieves maximal expressiveness.\nBuilding on this foundation, we propose a systematic framework for task-specific schema refinement.\nWithin this framework, we demonstrate that widely used benchmarks correspond to heuristic refinements of the atomic HIN---often far from optimal.\nAcross eight datasets, refinement alone enables a simplified Relational GCN (sRGCN) to reach state-of-the-art performance on node- and link-level tasks, with further gains from advanced HGNNs. These results highlight schema design as a key dimension in heterogeneous graph modeling.\nBy releasing the atomic HINs, searched schemas, and refinement framework, we enable principled benchmarking and open the way for future work on schema-aware learning, automated structure discovery, and next-generation HGNNs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Heterogeneous Information Networks", "Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks", "Graph Representation Learning"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/01521607c3899bf24ce43a54d3cf442f90ceb580.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/fe0dbd48fdb1beb499d3f72c3bea28de6a08a545.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces the principle of entity-attribute duality, motivating an 'atomic HIN' where all attributes become entities to maximize the graph's expressiveness.

The papers validates its framework across eight heterogeneous benchmark datasets from diverse domains (bibliometrics, e-commerce, knowledge graphs, biomedicine).\n2. By canonicalizing schema design and turning it into a first-class, searchable object, the work shifts attention from only designing graph neural layers to co-designing data schemas + models.\n3.

The paper formalizes attribute atomization and 'atomic HINs,' but it also acknowledges that constructing structure from attributes is a long-standing preprocessing technique (e.g., one-hot/multi-hot attributes turned into nodes/edges, as in IMDB). This makes the core idea feel more like a principled unification than a new representational primitive. It is recommended to add a small related-work ablation to show where each piece of the proposed appproach adds value beyond prior metapath/feature-node practices.\n2. Schema refinement is cast as binary search with a genetic algorithm and a sizeable budget (1024 schema trials), followed by 256 model-HP trials. This raises fairness and overfitting concerns if competitor baselines do not receive commensurate tuning. \n3. Several methods effectively learn metapaths/subgraphs via soft weights (e.g., GTN, MHGCN, RE-GNN). Since these are differentiable schema search to a degree, they’re natural baselines/foils for the discrete approach.
