While recent advances leverage specialized architectures or selective activation, they typically require (re)training or architectural modifications, limiting their broad applicability. Training-free sparse activation, in contrast, offers a plug-and-play pathway to efficiency; however, existing methods often rely solely on hidden state magnitudes, leading to significant approximation error and performance degradation. To address this, we introduce WINA (Weight-Informed Neuron Activation): a simple framework for training-free sparse activation that incorporates both hidden state magnitudes and weight matrix structure. By also leveraging the ℓ2-norm of the model’s weight matrices, WINA yields a principled sparsification strategy with provably optimal approximation error bounds, offering better and tighter theoretical guarantees than prior state-of-the-art approaches. Overall, WINA also empirically outperforms many previous training-free methods across diverse LLM architectures and datasets: not only matching or exceeding their accuracy at comparable sparsity levels, but also sustaining performance better at more extreme sparsity levels. Together, these results position WINA as a practical, theoretically grounded, and broadly deployable solution for efficient inference.

WINA is compared against several strong baselines, including TEAL, R-Sparse, and CATS.

We provide a general response here along with individual point-to-point responses to each reviewer further below. We have also uploaded a revised version of our manuscript reflecting changes and additional experiments/results wherein updated portions of the manuscript are marked in $\\color{blue}{\\text{blue}}$. \n\nBelow, we highlight three main groups of newly added experiments suggested during the rebuttal process. The latter two present newly important aspects which are typically not shown in existing sparse activation literature (i.e., effect on social bias and effect on long-context reasoning ability). \n\n- **Experiment 1. Realistic Speed-up via WINA Triton Kernel.**\n    -  Per the suggestion of multiple reviewers, we have implemented a custom WINA Triton kernel to benchmark realistic latency and speed-up performance.\n    - We have tested it over different GPUs (A800, A100, RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), matrix-vector multiply sizes, and batch sizes.\n    - The updated results are provided below and in our revised manuscript (Section 4.4 and Appendix A.10, A. 11) and Q1/A1 in our General Response.\n    - Overall, at the same sparsity level, WINA achieves almost identical realistic speed-ups to TEAL. Consequently, at the same accuracy level, WINA gating mechanism attains higher speed-up than TEAL, highlighting the advantage of WINA’s accuracy–efficiency trade-off.\n\n- **Experiment 2. Sparse Activation on Social Bias.**\n\t- To our knowledge, existing sparse activation works do not document the effects of their respective sparse activation methods on model/social bias.\n\t- As suggested by reviewer `DJxS`, we have conducted experiments following [1] where we evaluate our WINA-sparsified LLMs on CrowS-Pairs across Gender, Race, and Religion. These results are present in our updated manuscript (Appendix A.6).\n\t- Across all architectures and sparsity levels, we observe no systematic increase in bias, instead sparse activated models often move closer to the optimal 50% neutrality target, which is consistent as the compressed models in [1]. These results suggest that WINA does not exacerbate bias and can modestly mitigate it.\n\n\t[1]. Strubell et al., Understanding the Effect of Model Compression on Social Bias in Large Language Models\n\n- **Experiment 3. Sparse Activation on Long-context Benchmark, LongBench.**\n\t- Similarly, to the best of our knowledge, assessing how well sparse activated models perform in long-context reasoning settings is typically not evaluated in this domain. \n\t- As suggested by reviewer `SJQR`, to provide insight into WINA’s effects, we adopt the widely-used LongBench benchmark to assess model performance across different sparsity levels. LongBench covers six long-context scenarios across 4,750 examples. We report results for Llama-2-7B, Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B, and Phi-4-14B. \n\t- The results have been updated in our revised manuscript (Section 4.5 and Appendix A.5). In general, we can see that across all settings, WINA consistently outperforms TEAL in long-context scenarios.\n\nWe kindly invite reviewers to assess whether our revisions and additional experiments address their concerns. We would be grateful if ratings can be updated where appropriate. We thank the reviewers for their time, constructive feedback, and thoughtful engagement with our work.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAuthors"}}, "id": "7O8rScRVy2", "forum": "l7Vb3yxmuz", "replyto": "l7Vb3yxmuz", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8065/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8065/Authors"], "number": 12, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8065/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763613893651, "cdate": 1763613893651, "tmdate": 1763614647965, "mdate": 1763614647965, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
