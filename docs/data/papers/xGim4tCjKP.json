However, a significant gap persists in existing methods: current diffusion-based causal models rely on restrictive assumptions of causal sufficiency or static confounding. To address this limitation, we introduce the Partially Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal Model (PFD-BDCM), a generative framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach uniquely incorporates valid backdoor adjustments into the diffusion sampling mechanism to mitigate bias from unmeasured confounders. Specifically, it captures their intricate dynamics through region-specific structural equations and conditional autoregressive processes, and accommodates multi-resolution variables via functional data techniques. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by establishing error bounds for counterfactual estimates. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and a real-world air pollution case study confirm that PFD-BDCM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Unmeasured confounders", "Spatio-temporal dynamics", "Multi-resolution data", "Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal Model"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5c343884b72309464d50316336ed8dea501cf736.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces the Partially Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal Model (PFD-BDCM), a generative framework for causal inference in complex spatio-temporal settings with unmeasured confounding.

It is confusing what the 'unmeasured confounding' means in this paper. For example, the abstract claims 'incorporates __valid backdoor adjustments__ into the diffusion sampling mechanism to mitigate bias from __unmeasured confounders__'. However, if a valid backdoor adjustment set exists, this typically implies that there are no unmeasured confounders. Clarification is needed regarding how unmeasured confounding is formally defined and addressed in this framework.\n2. As a follow-up question, if unmeasured confounders are indeed present, how does the authors' approach ensure identifiability of causal queries? The conditions for identifiability under unmeasured confounding should be explicitly stated.\n3. The (partial) additive form of relationship in Eq.1 between $X_{C_{1,ij}}$  to  $X_{C_{2,ij}}$ may be restrictive. Would this formulation exclude interaction terms and potentially limit the model's applicability to more complex real-world processes?\n4. Theorem 1 resembles results in causal representation learning (e.g., SIG [1], iVAE [2]), which typically rely on different sets of strong assumptions. Could the authors discuss potential connections or distinctions between their assumptions and those in the CRL literature?\n5. Assumptions 2 and 3 appear strong. A2 requires $f$ to be strictly increasing wrt $U$ and A3 requires $g$ to be invertible. It would be helpful to provide real-world examples or justifications supporting the plausibility of these assumptions.\n\n\n[1] Li, Zijian, et al. \"Subspace identification for multi-source domain adaptation.\" *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* 36 (2023): 34504-34518.\n\n[2] Khemakhem, Ilyes, et al. \"Variational autoencoders and nonlinear ica: A unifying framework.\" *International conference on artificial intelligence and statistics*.

(1) an additive noise model.\n  - **W1.2.** Moreover, the only structural relationships defined are those of the explained nodes, which only depend on explanatory nodes. What about dependencies between explained nodes? And nodes that do not fit in any of the two categories?\n  - **W1.3.** Then, still in section 2.1, the variables of the problem statement are modeled using a basis expansion in Eq. (4). Shouldn't that be part of modeling?\n- **W2.** Similarly, it is rather unclear to me what it the exact setting being tackled. \n  - In section 2.1, there are no dependencies between variables of different timesteps and they share structural equations, making it a multi-environment problem where the different timesteps only act as more i.i.d. data.\n  - Then, in section 2.2 (3rd paragraph) the authors model the equations as $X_{ijk} = f_{ij}(X_{B_k}, U_k)$. That is, the same variable $k$ shares exogeneous noise (which I would not call \"unmeasured confounders\" as in line 206) across regions and timesteps, and differ on the structural equations, turning the problem into a multi-view problem.\n- **W3.** More generally, all the writing needs further polishing.
