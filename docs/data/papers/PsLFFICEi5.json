This quantity is closely related to the well-known total variation (TV) distance, since the two are exact complements: knowing one determines the other. While additive approximations of TV distance translate directly to additive approximations of statistical similarity, this correspondence does not extend to relative (multiplicative) approximations.\n\nThe paper focuses on computing statistical similarity between product distributions over the corners of a unit hypercube, i.e., $[0,1]^d$, where each coordinate has an independent one-dimensional marginal. Since the exact computation of TV distance between such product distributions is known to be #P-hard, the same hardness applies to statistical similarity. The authors present a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for estimating statistical similarity in this setting. An FPTAS for the TV distance between product distributions was previously known, and my understanding is that the proposed algorithm extends and adapts those ideas to handle the statistical similarity formulation.\n\nThe paper also establishes that obtaining a relative approximation is NP-hard for Bayesian networks of in-degree two, complementing the positive result by showing that multiplicative approximations are generally intractable. Together, these results delineate the boundary between tractable and intractable cases for this class of problems.\n\nMy main concern is the level of algorithmic novelty relative to prior work on TV distance approximation—the techniques appear to be reparameterization of the TV-distance approximation rather than containing any fundamentally new algorithmic ideas.

The algorithm is not sampling from the distributions! Rather, this is a purely query complexity result where the result assumes knowledge of the underlying probability values. There is no notion of sample complexity which is what the title 'statistical similarity' would suggest. \n\nIn fact, this problem does not seem to admit any meaningful approximation using samples. This is perhaps why the authors are assuming access to the probability values? But this should be spelled out in the text as getting samples is usually the standard way of accessing distributions. The reason this problem is difficult with samples is that the quantity $\\sum_x \\min(P(x),Q(x))$ can be very close to 0 (e.g. imagine distributions that are supported on disjoint subsets) and we would not figure this out unless we took many samples. Indeed, as the authors point out, this relates to estimating the total variation distance which is known to require samples almost equal to the domain size. \n\nBut I don't see why assuming the knowledge of the exact marginal probabilities (in the case that P and Q are product distributions) is a natural assumption. In fact, I also don't see why assuming P and Q are product distributions in the first place is a natural assumption. This makes the problem feel very niche (note that the interesting cases of TV estimation assumes only sample access and it is known that one needs sample complexity scaling with the domain size to obtain additive error).\n\nThus it is unclear to me if this is an interesting result for the learning theory community since there is no aspect of sample complexity.\n\nThe presentation of the main theorem statement also leaves a bit to be desired. Theorem 6 is written extremely informally and does not state what the exact epsilon dependence is on the query complexity (of how many of the underlying probabilities are queried). It also seems to 'hide' the PDF access model by saying \"product distributions succinctly represented by their component distributions\" , which should not be appropriate for a formal theorem statement."}, "questions": {"value": "See above"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "oBjJ3dNPwG", "forum": "PsLFFICEi5", "replyto": "PsLFFICEi5", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13537/Reviewer_kgs5"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13537/Reviewer_kgs5"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13537/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761969525052, "cdate": 1761969525052, "tmdate": 1762924137638, "mdate": 1762924137638, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
