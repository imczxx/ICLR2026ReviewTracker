Although it is an effective way of scaling inference time, it often struggles to generate diverse solution candidates, frequently relying on the same underlying approach to solve the problem and thus producing redundant samples. To address this limitation, we propose a new inference algorithm, GuidedSampling, which decouples the exploration and generation phases during inference, increasing diversity of generated candidate solutions. The exploration phase identifies multiple concepts that can be utilized to solve the problem, while the generation phase applies a specific concept to provide final solution candidates. We first define the theoretical bounds of GuidedSampling and then empirically demonstrate that it improves the performance of base model at pass@50 by on an average $\\sim21.6$% across various benchmarks compared to RS. Furthermore, models trained on trajectories of GuidedSampling exhibit substantial performance improvements at pass@5 by on an average $\\sim9.7$%, compared to models trained on traditional RS. Additionally, models trained with GuidedSampling increases the average number of concepts per instance ($1.67 \\to 3.03$), yielding a diverse set of candidates than traditional RS.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Inference-time algorithms", "LLMs"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b16e002f3e1d142f7582c5e321455c645524020e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes GuidedSampling, a novel inference-time algorithm designed to address the limited diversity of solutions generated by standard Repeated Sampling (RS).

Assumption 1 (minor issue: notation $C_{inf}$ should be $C_r$) has four lines of equations, but the second and third are equivalent and both can be derived from the fourth. I suspect the authors wanted to justify the fourth assumption and introduction of $k_c$, but this is not a good way to write assumptions. Furthermore, the fourth line can be relaxed from an equation to a greater-than-inequality, which immediately relaxes the assumption to be much more reasonable, since the original version stipulates two partial probability distributions have the exact same ratio across $x$ and $y^\\*$. \n    2. Theorem 1 is misleading for using \"iff\" on Line 281/282: Equation (2) is not equivalent to $P_{GS} > P_{RS}$, but can only derive the latter. This means it is possible that Equation (2) does not hold, but the desired advantage of GS over RS still holds. Despite this, I still think there is value in the theoretical analysis, since the passage under \"Sufficient Concept Coverage\" is still perfectly valid. I would suggest addressing these problems and rephrasing the theory to be more straightforward and clear. \n\n2. The value of hyperparameter K, the number of concepts, is not clearly specified for the main result in Figure 4. \n\n3.

A naive concatenation of concept + answer may shift the model rollout distribution to exhibit unprecedented behaviors (e.g. become more verbose, suggest unnecessary things), potentially decreasing model generalizability and utiliy. Do models fine-tuned on one synthetic dataset generalize its performance (not diversity) across others? What other validations did you do to ensure no model collapse occurs with CCA fine-tuning? \n\nQ2. Do you have any results on whether the earlier concepts suggested by the concept generator are better than later ones, or vice versa?
