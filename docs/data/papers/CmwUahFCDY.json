In real-world scenarios, these data often have missing values occurring under different mechanisms, which limits the applicability of most existing approaches, especially when the missing values do not occur randomly due to the influence of other variables. This challenge is further exacerbated when missingness mechanisms also depend on nonstationarity in time series data. In this paper, we propose CANMI, a novel constraint-based approach designed for CAusal discovery under Nonstationary MIssingness mechanisms. Our proposed method can recover the causal structure using only observed data with different missingness mechanisms, including missing not at random (MNAR). Furthermore, we prove the identifiability of the direct causes of missingness and reveal a formula for recovering the data distribution from nonstationary data with missing values. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrated that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for causal discovery across various evaluation metrics even under substantial missingness.

The methodological and theoretical foundation of the work appears to be a relatively straightforward extension of MVPC [1]. Moreover, the main contribution of the nonstationary missingness mechanism is simply solved by introducing a time index, which, however, is only a direct application of [2].\n\n- Furthermore, the definition of nonstationary that is used in this work is not formally defined. One typical type of nonstationary data should be defined on time series data, with, for example, different lengths of time lag and the Granger causality. This vagueness makes it difficult to assess the generalizability and boundaries of the proposed approach.\n\n- The method's reliance on using time as a proxy variable is not sufficiently justified. The paper lacks a clear discussion of the assumptions and conditions under which a simple time index can adequately capture complex, underlying nonstationary processes.

The paper’s main novelty lies in Theorem 1 (Step 4), whereas Propositions 1–3 and Steps 1–3 are relatively standard under Assumption 5 after introducing missing indicators. The central challenge in time series, exacerbated by nonstationarity and missing data, is spurious (false-positive) edges. Therefore, the parts on distribution reconstruction and importance resampling should be explained more clearly and given greater emphasis. For example, Step 2 is not directly useful for causal discovery; it serves as a prerequisite for Step 4 to remove spurious edges. Additionally, is the output of Step 1 used in later steps? (See the Questions section for further points about Step 1.) Given this, an ablation study with and without Step 4 would be valuable, since Step 4 appears to be the key step.\n\n2. The rationale for the chosen baselines is unclear, since many of them are not designed for time series. Why use LiNGAM instead of VAR-LiNGAM, NOTEARS instead of DYNOTEARS, and why omit PCMCI, which is widely used as a time-series causal discovery baseline?\n\n3. While the proposed algorithm can identify variables with time-invariant mechanisms, can it also identify variables whose mechanisms are time-variant correctly? Step 1 is titled Detecting changing causal mechanisms, but it discusses only invariance. Could edges between variables and $T$ also arise from spurious correlations? If the method can detect variables with changing mechanisms, it would be helpful to report the accuracy for this sub-task.\n\n4. It would be better to include an official computational analysis.\n\nOther comment:\n\nConsider adding an assumption that nonstationarity changes effect sizes only, while edge presence remains fixed."}, "questions": {"value": "1. What is the difference between Step 1 and CD-NOD? Can CD-NOD be directly extended to the missing-data setting by combining distribution reconstruction and importance resampling?\n\n2. Beyond nonstationarity and missing data, spurious edges can occur even in stationary time series without missing data due to autocorrelation. Can Step 4 also address it?\n\n3. After Step 4, are all obtained edges retested on the modified datasets? If spurious edges arise between observed variables and missingness indicators in earlier steps, and hence the indicator’s parent set is Eq.3 is a superset of the true parents, what is the impact?\n\n4.
