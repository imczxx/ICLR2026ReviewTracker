The outputs are fused online by a compact temporal-attention mechanism that adjusts their relative weights according to the motion dynamics. On the RONIN dataset, our method reduces final position error by about 10% compared with the previous state of the art, and this advantage persists across four smartphone models and three sampling rates. Integrating the dual-path block into other backbones yields similar gains — for example, roughly a 10% error reduction for a ResNet-based odometry network — and produces consistent improvements for both TCN and LSTM baselines, suggesting the approach generalizes across architectures.", "tldr": "Dual-path IMU odometry fusing raw and SG-filtered signals via temporal attention cuts RONIN error by 10%, improving robustness to devices, sampling rates and backbones (ResNet, TCN, LSTM) with minimal overhead.", "keywords": ["Dual-path IMU odometry; Temporal attention fusion; Cross-backbone improvement"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/efe321146770e37e5bfa3bb54ec88d8b62010613.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel variant of neural inertial odometry for estimating 2D motion in the horizontal plane from IMU measurements.

Please discuss the state-of-the-art approaches to the 2D inertial odometry problem which is also tackled in this paper (e.g. RONIN, RIDI, TLIO, EqNIO, Neural Inertial Odometry from Lie Events). References to the discussed related methods are missing. Please cite related works correctly and discuss how the proposed method differentiates and advances the state of the art.\n- Using the notion of a physical prior for the proposed smoothing seems overstated. Which physical law does the smoothing correspond to? Why should actual rotational velocities and linear accelerations follow exactly or approximately the proposed smoothing in the physical world?\n- The proposed smoothing introduces a delay of half the window size. This should be clearly stated as a potential limitation of the method.

This restricts the claimed applicability to a narrow ODD—primarily pedestrian navigation. However, the introduction motivates the method for general “autonomous systems” and “robots” (L30–35) without limiting the scope to human locomotion. To substantiate broader claims, the authors should either constrain their problem statement accordingly or include experiments with IMUs mounted on robotic platforms (e.g., ground vehicles, drones) undergoing high-dynamic maneuvers.\n\n2. **Inconsistent State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Claim**: The paper asserts it “achieved state-of-the-art results” (L68), yet on the more challenging unseen subjects split, the reported ATE (5.43) is higher than that of DiffusionIMU (5.27). This contradicts the SOTA claim unless explicitly qualified (e.g., “on seen subjects” or “for certain architectures”). The authors must clarify the conditions under which their method outperforms prior work.\n\n3. **Lack of Qualitative Analysis**: Results are presented almost exclusively through numerical tables. The absence of qualitative trajectory visualizations, error distribution plots, or per-dimension (x/y/z) error breakdowns limits insight into failure modes and the nature of improvements.\n\n### Minor Weaknesses:\n\n1. **Incomplete Related Work**: Sections 2.1 and 2.2 cite only foundational or older references (e.g., Titterton & Weston, 2004; Falagas et al., 2006) but lack engagement with recent advances (post-2020) in SINS and PDR, especially compared to works like DiffusionIMU (L113), which demonstrates more comprehensive literature coverage. Updating these subsections would better position the work within the current research frontier.\n\n2. **Limited Fusion Ablation**: The ablation study compares the proposed attention-based fusion only against simple averaging and a generic “confidence net.” It omits comparisons to established sensor fusion strategies such as Kalman filters, uncertainty-aware weighting, or gating mechanisms. Including these would more rigorously justify the necessity and superiority of the proposed temporal attention module."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the weaknesses section. :)"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Z7Qo8O4ClC", "forum": "XRf2Uscsa4", "replyto": "XRf2Uscsa4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24954/Reviewer_fJwm"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24954/Reviewer_fJwm"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24954/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761795910589, "cdate": 1761795910589, "tmdate": 1762943259849, "mdate": 1762943259849, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a dual-path inertial odometry framework that processes IMU signals through two complementary branches: one using raw IMU data to preserve high-frequency dynamics, and another using Savitzky–Golay filtered signals to enforce physical smoothness.
