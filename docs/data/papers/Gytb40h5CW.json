It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries, such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper, we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions (better than 97\\%) with only a fraction of computational time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where product utilities are non-additive.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["bundle pricing; graph convolutional network"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e4eaeb0aeb450d24d030fd9289bda895d95e478f.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c3e2e70ad88233ad73167eb229b381387236cbcf.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper explores the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the bundle pricing problem.

In my understanding, the GCN is parameterized so training is a necessary step before using in experiments. In addition, the output of GCN is followed by an MILP solver, the latter of which is (probably) non-differentiable. Differentiating the target w.r.t. GCN parameters seems to be impossible.\n2) The paper also does not clearly explain the experimental settings. For example, it is expected that the determination of all model parameters, such as $c _j^u, c _k^s, u _{kj}$, should be explained before experimental results.\n3) The choice of baseline is questionable. The authors only select two baselines, only one of them (BSP) works in large settings. The authors have also mentioned that BSP is possibly suboptimal as it does not consider the heterogeneity of products. It seems likely that the authors should have considered more appropriate baselines as mentioned in Section 2, or at least given justifications on why other approaches are not appropriate baselines.\n\nSee below questions for my other concerns."}, "questions": {"value": "1) The paper does not mention learning-based approaches on pricing bundles. Have the authors made literature review on this topic? Or is it the case that this topic remains blank in literature? (Although I believe the latter is quite unlikely.)\n2) The GCN structure is designed with feature engineering without mathematical justifications. A simple MLP (with a post-processing sigmoid) may also work. Have the authors considered MLPs before GCN? Could the authors provide explanations on why GCN might be more appropriate than MLP? (Note that Ockham's Razor principle suggests that GCN is an overkill if it can be replaced with a simpler MLP without loss.)\n3) The authors have emphasized that the $R _{kb}$ is non-additive in line 80-81. However, since there are only finite possible outcomes, why the non-additive utilities provide more difficulties than additive utilities? It seems to me that the additivity or non-additivity does not matter so much as the problem itself is finite."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "hZh2FkGoOc", "forum": "Gytb40h5CW", "replyto": "Gytb40h5CW", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17922/Reviewer_uRPB"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17922/Reviewer_uRPB"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17922/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762585046770, "cdate": 1762585046770, "tmdate": 1762927735064, "mdate": 1762927735064, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
