This article constructs constrained diffusion models on a generic nonconvex feasible sets $\\Sigma$, by introducing a unified framework that simultaneously enforces both equality and inequality constraints throughout the diffusion process. Our theory and implementations encompass both overdamped and underdamped dynamics for the forward and backward sampling. The key algorithmic ingredient is a computationally efficient landing mechanism that replaces costly and not-always-well-defined projections onto $\\Sigma$, maintaining feasibility without Newton solves and avoiding projection failures. Leveraging underdamped dynamics whose faster mixing reduces the steps needed to reach the prior distribution, the commonly-believed unavoidable heavy forward simulation cost in the constrained diffusion is alleviated. Empirically, this reduces function evaluations, enabling more efficient inference and training while preserving sample quality and substantially lowering memory usage. On equality-only and mixed (equality and inequality) benchmarks, our method shows reasonable sample quality, while substantially reducing computational cost and function evaluations. These results indicate that landing-based enforcement combined with underdamped dynamics provides a practical and scalable recipe for constrained diffusion on nonconvex feasible sets.", "tldr": "We propose an unified constrained diffusion framework on nonconvex sets that enforces equality and inequality constraints via a projection-free landing step and exploits faster-mixing underdamped dynamics, enabling efficient inference and training.", "keywords": ["constrained diffusion models", "nonconvex manifold", "underdamped Langevin dynamics", "landing mechanism"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c64ca8d36db6533c2dc6041912d9867dcf4742b4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/36ad41205adde22a057ddbd2ff277a75602dc7e3.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a formulation to enforce constraints on diffusion models using the landing method. Diffusion models are viewed as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and the \"trajectory\" of the SDE is refined at each time step to guide the generative processes to respect both equality and inequality constraints. While many of the previous works \"project\" the dynamic trajectory onto the constraint manifold, the paper argues that the projections are costly and not-always-well-defined. Instead, they introduce the landing approach, which arguably is more computationally efficient, to replace projections. The key mathematical idea behind this approach is to introduce an additional term (landing term) that enforces exponential decay of constraint violation in the SDE. Assuming that the gradients from these constraints are linearly independent, the landing term can be explicitly computed via simple matrix operations. This idea is tested on multiple benchmark examples, including both equality-constrained and mixed (equality + inequality-constrained) scenarios."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "I find the landing term very interesting and novel, although I have to admit that I'm not fully familiar with the relevant literature.

I would appreciate some further clarification on why this assumption is typically valid in many real-world problems. Also, some discussion about the cases where gradients are (almost) dependent (aka when the assumption breaks).\n- The computation of the Jacobian and the (inverse of) Gram matrix sounds scary computationally. Would this be scalable to the cases where the dimension \"d\" is very large (e.g., generation of high-resolution micrographs of some material microstructures under some physical constraints)?\n- The fact that the proposed method does not fully outperform projection-based methods may not be the critical weakness, assuming the mathematical idea is indeed new (to which I'll rely on other reviewers' assessment). However, it would still be valuable scientific knowledge to understand why that is the case. Is it because the additional term in the SDE adds more complexity in training optimization? Or that the constraint violation is penalized harder than the projection-based method? More analysis on the behavior of the proposed method, in comparison to other projection-based approaches, would make the paper a lot more interesting to read."}, "questions": {"value": "- I'm just curious: is the LICQ assumption a valid assumption in the context of generative modeling? Using the generation of physics data as a hypothetical example, wouldn't there be a situation where gradients from different constraints may end up being collinear (linearly dependent) due to some sort of coupled effect? I can't think of a specific counterexample, though. Obviously, the authors have thought this through, so I would like their thoughts on this.\n- Also, along the same line of thought, if the stacked Jacobian does not have a full rank or the matrix is ill-conditioned due to some \"almost dependent\" gradient vectors, how would the performance of the algorithm change?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "kN0ak6zqdD", "forum": "hfPUieLcQw", "replyto": "hfPUieLcQw", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23119/Reviewer_F33C"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23119/Reviewer_F33C"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23119/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761681139782, "cdate": 1761681139782, "tmdate": 1762942518749, "mdate": 1762942518749, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces landing-based constrained diffusion, an approach for generating from a constrained distributions.
