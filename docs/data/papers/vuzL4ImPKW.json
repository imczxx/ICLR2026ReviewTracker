However, significant challenges remain in effectively modeling the multi-level dependencies among time points, sequences, and channels. Existing methods often struggle to fully capture the hierarchical relationships between these three aspects or face efficiency issues. To address this, we propose HyperTime: Hyperbolic space hierarchical constraints for multivariate Time series forecasting. This method initially segments the time series into patches and then extracts temporal dependencies to obtain representations for each channel. It subsequently derives interrelationships among multiple channels based on these representations, encoding time patches, individual channels, and multi-channel series into a unified hyperbolic representation space. By imposing hyperbolic hierarchy and entailment constraints on the encoded representations, the method leverages relationships from local to global among the three levels, ensuring sufficient interactions among point, intra- and inter-channel information. We evaluated HyperTime on several commonly used multivariate time series forecasting datasets and compared it with previously top-performing models. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HyperTime, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only linear complexity. This highlights its proficiency in capturing complex temporal dependencies and interrelationships among channels. Our code is included in the supplemental material and will be released open-source.", "tldr": "We encode time patches, individual channel and multi-channel sequences into a unified hyperbolic representation space to better learn the complex hierarchical relationships of them.", "keywords": ["Multivariate Time Series Forecasting", "Hyperbolic Representation Learning", "Deep Neural Network"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7242052676ec48adcbe9fb56e38282ab9f97c66a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c115542c4df78149039b7cb3d8fa7e317f437b0c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces Hyperbolic Space Hierarchical Constraints to enhance the representation of multivariate time series.

The approach, motivated by presumed hierarchy, would benefit greatly from a more directly empirical or formal characterization (e.g., quantifying or visualizing the presence of such hierarchies in standard datasets before and after applying hyperbolic constraints).\nFigure 2 offers schematic illustration only; a more formal theoretical or empirical analysis justifying the claim that patches, single channels, and multi-channels indeed follow a strict hierarchy in these real-world benchmarks would significantly bolster the work.\nAmbiguity and Under-specification in Mathematical Formulations:\n\n**W2 Several notational inconsistencies, ambiguities, and lack of detail pervade the key equations.** For example, in Section 3.3, the notation used in Equation 4 ($C^{j}=S_{i}^{1} \\circ S_{i+1}^{2} \\circ \\cdots$) is not sufficiently clarified—specifically, what objects are being concatenated, and along which axes? Similarly, “Repeat” in the representation fusion block is not defined (Page 5, Equation following “Representation Fusion”), potentially confusing the exact operational semantics in high-dimensional embeddings.\nThe formal description of angle ($\\mathfrak{A}$) and distance ($\\mathfrak{D}$) in hyperbolic space (Section 3.1) might cause confusion: the role of temperature/scaling parameters, referencing of “root,” and practical computation are under-specified.\nHyperparameters such as $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and threshold $t$ in the loss functions (Equations 8–9) are not justified. The reader is left in the dark as to how they are chosen, how sensitive results are to their values, or whether these values generalize. This point is underscored by the limited sensitivity analysis on these hyperbolic-specific hyperparameters, in contrast to standard neural setup (Figure 5).\n\n**W3 Insufficient evidence proves that the method is really useful:** This paper only evaluates on a limited number of traditional benchmarks. It is recommended to test on more benchmarks to effectively demonstrate the model's performance, such as GIFT-EVAL, FEV-Bench, and TFB.
