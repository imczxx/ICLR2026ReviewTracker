Although effective, the state-of-the-art PU learning methods focus on coarse-grained separation between positive and negative classes. In real-world datasets, however, $\\textit{hidden stratification}$ frequently occurs, where the positive class comprises multiple fine-grained subclasses with varying prevalence. \nIgnoring these latent subclasses biases PU classifiers toward dominant subclasses of the positive class, leading to systematic misclassification of rare subclasses. To address this challenge, we propose a subclass-aware PU learning method that first discovers the hidden subclasses through a fully automatic and adaptive graph-based approach. It then leverages the hidden subclasses to select the potential negative examples from the unlabeled set. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the method consistently outperforms the existing PU learning methods on a range of datasets under various distributional settings of the subclasses. A noteworthy property of the proposed method is that it does not require any input about the number of hidden subclasses, thereby making it remarkably robust. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first which addresses the hidden subclass issue in PU learning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["PU learning", "hidden stratitification", "binary classification"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2c7482da05688e1986841ef2e5aecb11173106ac.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the hidden stratification problem in Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning by proposing the PU-ScRR-CC method, which automatically discovers fine-grained subclass structures within the positive class through similarity graph-based connected component analysis and leverages this subclass information to improve potential negative selection and classifier training.

It attributes hidden stratification to the PU learning paradigm itself, when it is actually an engineering artifact resulting from artificial dataset construction rather than an inherent problem of PU learning. Moreover, while the motivation emphasizes real-world application scenarios such as medical imaging, the experiments rely entirely on artificially constructed benchmark datasets and lack validation on real hidden stratification data. This raises a critical question that does the problem definition itself have inherent issues?\n(2) The core methodology essentially employs confidence-weighted loss with regularization, which represents standard techniques in semi-supervised learning, thus lacking innovation. Additionally, using 1-NN to construct graphs and extract connected components is a classical clustering approach. The paper fails to adequately justify its advantages over mature clustering methods such as spectral clustering or DBSCAN.\n(3) The experimental results indicate that in numerous scenarios, PU-ScRR-CC's performance is comparable to or even inferior to PU-ScRR.\n(4) This paper provides no theoretical analysis and relies solely on empirical validation to support its claims.
