Existing methods, such as offline or transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g., collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data, making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "single-to-multi RL"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/507a2cb07b2ed9e4ea144f4687f0779a1c5e419e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces \"Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo)\", a framework designed to leverage single-agent (solo) demonstrations to accelerate multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative settings.

The premise is well-motivated.. it is often easier to obtain solo demos than multi-agent demos. However, solo demos do not show any cooperation even if they do have signals on how each agent should act. The key technical challenge is how to determine when to mimic the solo demos and when to learn to cooperate. The method first trains a shared solo policy via imitation learning, then during multi-agent training decomposes each agent’s local observation into multiple solo-compatible views and reuses the pretrained policy to generate candidate actions. These candidates are fused through a learnable module consisting of a gating selector (for resolving ambiguity and selecting a solo action) and an action editor (which applies residual corrections to adapt to cooperative dynamics).\n\nThe method is evaluated in simulation comparing two MARL algorithms with and without SoCo.

In fact, it seems that PegMARL would be a more general version since it can handle both single agent as well as multi-agent demonstrations (Sec 5.2).

The paper cites PegMARL (Yu et al., 2025), which is incorrectly characterized. According to its abstract, PegMARL utilizes \"personalized expert demonstrations\" that are \"tailored for each individual agent\" and \"solely pertain to single-agent behaviors without encompassing any cooperative elements,\" which is functionally identical to what this paper calls \"solo demonstrations.\" This is an important baseline that should be compared experimentally.\n\n2. The approach requires \"well-defined, structured, and decomposable\" observations (page 4, lines 189-193), which can be restricted: it cannot handle unstructured observations (e.g., raw images, point clouds) and requires manual design of decomposition rules for each environment. Additionally, the method requires tasks to be decomposable into solo subtasks. For example, in a multi-robot box-lifting task, even if observations are decomposable, the task itself is not—a single robot cannot meaningfully lift the box alone. How can solo demonstrations be collected for such fundamentally non-decomposable tasks?\n\n3. The gating selector is defined as g^i_φ : O_i → R^{G_i} (Section 3.3.1, line 220), where G_i is the number of solo views for agent i. However, Gumbel-Softmax requires a fixed output dimension. If different local observations o^i_t correspond to different numbers of solo views, how does the gating selector handle variable output dimensions?\n\n4. Does SoCo only support continuous action spaces? The action editor performs residual adjustments (Equation 4-5), which only makes sense for continuous actions; and all experimental environments seem to use continuous action spaces. If so, this is a significant limitation that should be explicitly stated. If not, how does it work for discrete action spaces?\n\n5. Inference appears computationally expensive, requiring: (1) local observation decomposition, (2) solo policy forward pass, and (3) policy fusion (gating + action editor), rather than a traditional single forward pass through a policy network.\n\n6. The training curves appear to compare only the joint training phase. However, SoCo uses 1M transition samples to pretrain the solo policy, while MATD3 and HATD3 train from scratch. If this pretraining cost is considered, the performance gaps in Figures 2d-2i may not be significant enough.\n\n7. The evaluation environments seem to be relatively simple, mainly particle environments and multi-agent MuJoCo.
