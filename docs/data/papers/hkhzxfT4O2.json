This article examines three main approaches to the analysis of patent information: 1) a clustering-based approach; 2) a resource-based approach; 3) a machine learning approach. Each approach is considered in terms of its advantages, flaws and potential for use in predicting the emergence of new technologies. The article proposes new methods for constructing a patent landscape and predictive models, as well as a method for assessing development directions in technological areas. The article also considers the problem of visualizing the results of analysis and forecasting of technological trends. To solve this problem, the authors propose a visualization subsystem that allows graphical demonstration of the changes in the patent landscape over time. The article presents the results of experiments demonstrating the system's ability to make correct predictions of technological trends.", "tldr": "The article presents new methods for constructing a patent landscape model, a method for assessing development directions in technological areas, and a subsystem for visualizing the results of analysis and forecasting of technological trends.", "keywords": ["clustering", "machine learning", "patent analysis", "trend forecasting"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5c3af3d6b3289791b10e4cbb764207b96eed3f8c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an automated framework for patent landscape modeling and predictive analysis aimed at identifying technological evolution patterns. The authors utilize PatentBERT to extract semantic representations from patent texts and apply DBSCAN clustering to group related patents into topics. They claim to optimize clustering parameters by maximizing the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and use UMAP and LDA for visualization and topic interpretation. By comparing clusters across different time periods, the paper attempts to infer potential trends of technological merging, diversification, or decline. Experiments are conducted on several IPC subclasses, with evaluation relying primarily on expert assessments of prediction accuracy.\n\nOverall, the study tackles a practically meaningful problem and presents a coherent end-to-end pipeline for semantic analysis of patent data. However, the work mainly combines existing components without introducing substantial theoretical or methodological novelty, and its experimental evaluation lacks rigor and objectivity."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- **Practical relevance**: The paper focuses on an application domain with significant real-world impact — patent analytics and technology forecasting. The proposed goal of modeling technology evolution through large-scale patent data is valuable and well-motivated.\n- **Framework coherence**: The pipeline integrates text representation, clustering, visualization, and predictive interpretation into a unified workflow. This end-to-end design provides a clear logical structure from data processing to insight generation.\n- **Method integration**: While not fundamentally innovative, the combination of pretrained language models with clustering-based patent landscape analysis represents a reasonable and potentially useful exploration for applied research."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **Novelty**: The paper lacks a clear methodological contribution. The proposed pipeline is largely a sequential composition of well-known techniques (PatentBERT, DBSCAN, UMAP, LDA) without new algorithmic innovation. The claimed “gradient-based optimization of DBSCAN parameters via ARI maximization” is mathematically unsupported, as ARI is non-differentiable, and no surrogate or black-box optimization strategy is presented.\n- **Methodology and soundness**: Several methodological issues undermine the technical soundness. The optimization procedure described for DBSCAN is not theoretically feasible, and the “predictive model” is conceptually vague — it seems to rely on comparing cluster similarity across time rather than performing genuine forecasting. This weakens the paper’s central claim of predictive capability.\n- **Experimentation and evaluation**: The experimental setup lacks statistical rigor and objectivity. Evaluation depends on a small-scale expert survey, without standardized quantitative metrics, significance testing, or confidence intervals. No comparisons are made against strong baselines such as dynamic topic models or time-aware embeddings, making it difficult to assess effectiveness. Ablation studies are also missing, and the results remain largely qualitative.\n- **Presentation and academic rigor**: The paper suffers from inconsistencies and minor scholarly errors. Several references contain incorrect years or misspelled author names, and figures are not sufficiently labeled or quantified. The writing overemphasizes “multimodal” analysis, yet the methodology and experiments rely solely on text data, leading to a mismatch between the claimed scope and actual implementation."}, "questions": {"value": "- **Method feasibility**: How is the ARI-based gradient descent optimization for DBSCAN implemented in practice? What is the defined objective function, and how is differentiability handled? Have you considered alternative optimization methods such as Bayesian or grid search?\n- **Definition and evaluation of prediction**: Please clarify what exactly constitutes “prediction accuracy” in this context. What is being predicted, and how is the temporal split between training and evaluation periods defined to avoid information leakage\n- **Objectivity of evaluation**: Were the expert assessments conducted under blind conditions? Was inter-rater agreement measured? Could you complement the expert evaluation with objective metrics, such as recall of emerging patents or citation-growth prediction?\n- **Baselines and ablation studies**: Have you compared against alternative clustering algorithms (e.g., HDBSCAN, KMeans) or text encoders (e.g., PatentSBERTa)? How sensitive are your results to hyperparameters such as `eps` and `min_samples`?\n- **Consistency with multimodal claims**: The paper repeatedly emphasizes “multimodal” analysis, yet only textual data are used.
