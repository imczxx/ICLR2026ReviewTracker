We challenge this perspective by demonstrating that controlled quantum noise can be an implicit regularizer for latent diffusion models.  We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical latent diffusion architecture where quantum error channels are injected between parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) layers in the latent space during the forward pass. We maintain classical backward pass to enable training efficiency on current quantum hardware. Theoretically, we prove these quantum channels control the model’s Lipschitz constant with depth and shrink the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), yielding flatter minima within the loss landscape and hence tighter PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds. We conduct extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10, comparing our model with existing baselines. Our noise-regularized models improve the Frechet inception distance (FID) by 18.7% over noiseless baselines while maintaining superior robustness under adversarial attacks and parameter perturbations. To our knowledge, this work is among the first to systematically study transforming unavoidable quantum noise into a leverage for robust generative models.", "tldr": "We propose a quantum latent diffusion process framework with quantum forward process and Gaussian reverse process, where the quantum noise implicitly regularize the training process for improved robustness and generalization.", "keywords": ["latent diffusion process", "quantum machine learning", "quantum noise", "implicit regularization"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f26c024d2666f7b22233ad4ec3c6e489685ce3ee.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a hybrid quantum-classical latent diffusion model where quantum noise is deliberately introduced during the forward diffusion process.

The paper ignores prior works that use quantum noise for diffusion and GANs (e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12013, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01886, https://src.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/src/2025/jason-han.pdf). These works have already explored using quantum noise as a constructive element in diffusion models. That omission weakens its positioning, as these works have presented similar ideas and even shown preliminary results on real data. Without citing or comparing against that work, the paper’s novelty appears overstated, and it becomes unclear how this contribution advances the field in either theory or experimentation.\n\nThe theoretical discussion on Lipschitz contraction and QFIM shrinkage is interesting but loosely connected to real training behavior. The arguments rely on broad properties of CPTP maps rather than more problem-specific insight, making the results feel formal but not particularly revealing. The paper also doesn’t clearly explain how the proposed effects hold under realistic circuit depths or noisy conditions.\n\nAlso, the lack of ablations and sensitivity results weakens the empirical case. Without exploring how results vary with circuit depth, noise strength, or hyperparameters, it’s hard to separate genuine quantum effects from standard smoothing. Overall, the paper’s idea of embracing noise is also not novel or creative, but the evaluation is also narrow, and the theory is high-level."}, "questions": {"value": "Compare against other relevant works.

Section 3.3 explicitly states the forward process is achieved by \"repeatedly applying a quantum map $\\Phi_p$ for T steps, as specified by the relation $\\rho_t = \\Phi_p(\\rho_{t-1})$.\n\n**Actual Method (Algorithm 1, Page 14)**: Algorithm 1 reveals that this is **not** what is done. The $L$-layer PQC is used as a one-shot noisy encoder to map the initial latent $z_0$ to a new latent $\\tilde{z}$ (Lines 6-13). The actual diffusion process is then applied to $\\tilde{z}$ using the standard classical Gaussian forward process: $z_t \\leftarrow \\sqrt{\\overline{\\alpha}_t}\\tilde{z} + \\sqrt{1-\\overline{\\alpha}_t}\\epsilon$ (Line 16).\n\nThus the reviewer doubts that this is not a \"quantum forward diffusion process.\" It is a classical latent diffusion model with a VAE-PQC encoder. The \"quantum noise\" is simply a regularizer within the encoder, not the diffusion mechanism itself. This disconnect undermines the paper's entire premise and novelty.\n\nBesides, Algorithm 1 which details the core training loop, contains severe inconsistencies and omissions that make the proposed method non-functional as written: 1) The decoder $D_{\\psi}$ is listed as a required component, and its parameters $\\psi$ are initialized and updated. However, $D_{\\psi}$ is never called within the algorithm. This makes the reconstruction loss $L_{recon} = ||x_0 - \\hat{x}||^{2}$ (Line 29) invalid, as the reconstructed image $\\hat{x}$ is never defined. 2) The denoised output $z_{den}$ is then completely ignored; it is not used in $L_{score}$, $L_{recon}$, or any other part of the loop.\n\nThe authors are required to revise the core algorithm 1 and it should be positioned within the main text rather than appendix. \n\nEven if one were to ignore the contradiction above and analyze the paper as written (i.e., assuming a $T$-step quantum forward process), reviewer also thinks the proposed model is fundamentally incoherent. \n\nThe paper's proposed quantum forward process (Eq. 1) would result in a highly complex, non-Gaussian noise distribution $p(z_T|z_0)$ after measurement. However, the paper's reverse process (Eq. 3) $z_{t-1}=z_{t}-\\delta_{t}S_{\\psi}(z_{t},t)+\\sqrt{2\\delta_{t}}\\epsilon$ and its associated score-matching objective are specifically derived to invert a Gaussian forward process. The authors provide no justification for why a reverse process designed for Gaussian noise would be capable of inverting their complex, parameterized quantum forward process. The reviewer has reason to doubt that this could be a flaw in the model's design (and likely why the authors resorted to the classical implementation in Algorithm 1)."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "iVEcHuwYxk", "forum": "NqTeVoz36v", "replyto": "NqTeVoz36v", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20775/Reviewer_Boqy"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20775/Reviewer_Boqy"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20775/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761422517203, "cdate": 1761422517203, "tmdate": 1762934474851, "mdate": 1762934474851, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a hybrid quantum-classical latent diffusion model that leverages controlled quantum noise as an implicit regularizer rather than a detrimental factor.
