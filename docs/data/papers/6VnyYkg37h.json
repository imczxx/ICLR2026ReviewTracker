To resolve this, we introduce the Causal Disentanglement World Model (CDWM), which learns the necessary \\textit{interventional} model by imposing a structural causal assumption. Our dual-path architecture decomposes state transitions into an uncontrollable Environment Pathway and a controllable Intervention Pathway, making causal effects identifiable from observational data.

The authors should clarify whether the stated research objectives are indeed achievable.\n\n2. Concerns regarding core formula (Equation 3): In reinforcement learning, the state transition at time t+1 is determined by the current state and action according to the MDP framework. This formula does not appear to model transitions from the perspective of RL. Additionally, it is unclear what “Autonomous Dynamics” refers to, and how the “Interventional Effect” differs from the standard effect of taking an action—what is the role of the intervention here?\n\n3. The paper mentions modeling via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), but it is not clear how the SCM is learned. How are the nodes and edges in the SCM designed? This section requires a more detailed explanation, and the authors could refer to relevant works on causal dynamics learning[1], IFactor[2].\n\n4. Agentic reward design: The proposed agentic reward is not novel, as similar designs appear in works such as causal curiosity reward [3], causal efficiency [4] and ECL[5]. The authors should clarify the differences. Moreover, it is questionable whether simply introducing a single reward signal can truly improve policy generalization or interpretability. The method section should provide a clear and detailed explanation, from SCM modeling to the concrete Implementation of the algorithm.\n\n5.

The experimental evaluation on Atari looks solid."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Here I list the weaknesses and questions together, as many of them are closely related or overlapping.\n\nW1: I think the most fundamental issue is the validity of Eq. (3), where you assume an additive decomposition of the dynamics. As far as I understand, if the goal is to get identifiability of the causal model, then even under more general post-nonlinear state dynamics [1] or with extra signals such as actions inducing significant state changes [2–3], identifiability is still possible in prior work. Here, however, the strict additive form seems stronger than what real dynamics (in RL) would satisfy, so there’s a gap between the assumption and what actually holds in practice.\n\nW2: Echoing the above point, there seem to be several gaps. For instance, if $a_t$ affects $s_{1,t}$ and $s_{2,t-1}$ also influences $s_{1,t}$ you cannot simply model them additively, as this would violate the compounding effect of the physical dependencies both causes to the target. Since here you separate these effects into two independent networks, it is unclear how the compounded or interacting effects are actually captured or combined in the implementation.\n\nW3: For the model, do you assume there is no temporal correlation between the noise factors? In many RL settings, the noise inherently carries information, e.g., environmental effects like wind changes are temporally correlated but may not be explicitly represented in the states. To properly capture the underlying causal process [4], I believe this aspect should also be taken into account.\n\nW4: Here, regarding the “intervention” path, it seems more like an action-dynamics network rather than a true intervention. You are not actually intervening on specific state variables in the system — the action is sampled from the policy, not applied as a do-operator in the causal sense as suggested in Eq. (1), right?\n\nW5: For the MCTS part, it’s a bit unclear what the causal model or function $g$ you mentioned (the one being queried) actually refers to. I assume it represents the entire dynamics model, but it would be good to clarify this explicitly.\n\nW6: For the reward shaping term, it feels quite similar to curiosity-based or ensemble-error methods [5–6], since both aim to find actions that cause large state changes. Although the mathematical form here is different, the underlying idea seems related. In that case, what is the actual connection to the notion of causality in this work?\n\nW7: In the experiments, it would also be more rigorous to add the same reward-shaping term to the baselines to check whether they can benefit from it as well.\n\nW8: I checked the appendix, and it seems you are using a different architecture for the latent dynamics than Dreamer (I mean the RNN part, not the disentanglement). It would be more rigorous to align the architectures for a fair comparison. Also, since different world models now use quite different backbones, especially transformer-based ones, it would be helpful to include a version with such an architecture to show that your framework is generic, easy to integrate, and architecture-agnostic. \n\nW9: What’s the necessity for using MCTS here? Why not align more closely with Dreamer by directly learning a policy and using the learned model to imagine additional data for training? It’s not clear what unique benefit MCTS brings in this setup compared to standard policy optimization with imagination-based rollouts.\n\nW9: For ablation, better to consider more types of intrinsic motivations as reward shaping terms, such as [5-6]. \n\n[1] Uemura, Kento, et al. \"A multivariate causal discovery based on post-nonlinear model.\" Conference on Causal Learning and Reasoning.

The problem is clearer formulated and well motivated. The paper articulates the distinction between observational and interventional distributions precisely and motivates why causal confounding undermines planning under policy shifts. The framing is pedagogically clear.\n\n2. CDWM provides a simple and interpretable architectural constraint. The hard constraint $f_{\\text{env}}(s_t) \\perp a_t \\mid s_t$ is elegant and minimal. It provides a concrete inductive bias that is easy to implement and reason about.\n\n3. The authors provide strong task-specific ablation evidence as show in Figure 3 where pathway ablations are particularly compelling. When the agent pathway is removed, performance collapses on \\emph{control-dominant} games (Pong, QBert, Boxing) where precise actions drive success. When the environment pathway is removed, \\emph{environment-dominant} games (Seaquest, Kangaroo, Frostbite) with strong autonomous dynamics degrade sharply. If the decomposition were arbitrary, removing either branch would cause roughly uniform degradation. Instead, the failure modes align exactly with task structure, demonstrating that the model has learned to \\emph{allocate explanatory power to the correct causal mechanism}. The two pathways are not redundant---each captures a distinct, functionally meaningful process. This is strong empirical evidence for causal disentanglement within the learned representation.\n\n4. They provide emergent representation disentanglement as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4's t-SNE visualizations show that $f_{\\text{env}}$ and $f_{\\text{agent}}$ representations are entangled early in training but progressively separate into distinct clusters. This self-organization occurs \\emph{without explicit disentanglement losses}, suggesting the architectural constraint alone provides sufficient inductive bias. The late-stage separation validates that the model is learning the intended factorization.\n\n5. The authors provide a principled exploration with self-annealing behavior. The Agency Bonus (Figure 5, bottom panel) exhibits the signature of a causal-influence measure: it peaks early when the policy probes causally potent actions, then naturally decays as those effects become predictable. This self-annealing property distinguishes it from noise-driven curiosity signals and aligns with the theoretical motivation. The top panels show that this translates to faster learning and broader state coverage.\n\n6. They demonstrate SOTA results, achieving top aggregate performance on Atari-100k (Table 1: 2.81\\% mean, 1.24\\% median vs.\\ EZ-V2's 2.69\\%/1.23\\%) with computational cost comparable to DreamerV3 ($\\sim$11.7 V100 hours, Table~6).\n\n7. The Limitations section (Appendix E) explicitly discusses when the additive assumption fails (mode-switching, light switch examples). Fixed hyperparameters across all 26 games, detailed architectures (Tables~2--5), and a commitment to release code facilitate replication. This transparency is appreciated."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The additive assumption is fundamentally restrictive. The core equation $s_{t+1} = s_t + f_{\\text{env}}(s_t) + f_{\\text{agent}}(s_t,a_t) + \\epsilon$ is acknowledged as a \"first-order approximation\" (Appendix E), but I believe this undersells the severity of the limitation. The authors prove (Appendix~B.1.3) that under mode-switching dynamics, where actions alter the environment's evolution, the learned $f_{\\text{agent}}$ becomes confounded with environmental state changes, yielding systematic counterfactual bias. More importantly, no quantitative evidence is provided for when/where additivity holds. The ablations demonstrate the decomposition works within Atari's discrete action space, but many realistic dynamics involve multiplicative interactions (friction $\\propto$ velocity, lighting changes, contact forces), threshold effects, or compositional structure that fundamentally violate linear superposition. The honest discussion of this limitation is appreciated, but it constrains the generalizability of the approach. Without evidence that the additive assumption is broadly valid, or an extension to handle non-additive interactions, the causal claims remain domain-specific. \n\n2. They present observational training without interventional validation. The model is trained exclusively on transitions $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$ sampled under behavior policies, standard supervised learning with architectural constraints. While Appendix B.1.3 provides theoretical analysis of counterfactual error under mode-switching, there are no empirical intervention experiments where actions are externally imposed and $f_{\\text{agent}}$'s predictions verified against ground-truth $P(s'|s,\\text{do}(a))$. Recent work in causal RL includes such validation, as seen in language-grounded causal world models[1], where they report 1-step and N-step intervention accuracy independently of task returns. Additionally, [2] provides generalization error bounds and validates the learned causal structure via conditional independence tests. While the ablations provide strong functional evidence, direct interventional metrics would more conclusively demonstrate that $f_{\\text{agent}}$ captures $P(s'|s,\\text{do}(a))$.\n\n3. All results are confined to Atari-100k; a single domain with discrete actions and frame-based observations. The paper claims to address a general problem in world modeling (e.g., causal confounding) yet provides evidence only within Atari's narrow context. The additive assumption that works for pixel-based discrete actions may catastrophically fail in continuous control with contact dynamics, articulated robots, or fluid interactions. Recent work in causal world modeling [2] demonstrates generalization across robotics domains (Meta-World) with compositional transfer. CDWM provides no such evidence.  Without multi-domain validation, the contribution reads as ``a factorization trick that improves Atari scores.''\n\n4. The paper's language, promises causal inference. What is delivered is an architectural factorization that demonstrably organizes representations but lacks interventional validation. This gap manifests in several ways: (1) Identifiability claims are architectural, not causal. The proof (Appendix F) requires strong domain-specific assumptions: (i) null action existence (NOOP), (ii) full support, (iii) universal approximation, (iv) global optimization. It establishes parameter identification under the assumed additive structure, but not that the structure itself is causally correct. \n\n5. The Agency Bonus $r^i_t = \\sigma\\big((\\|f_{\\text{agent}}\\|_2 - \\mu)/\\sigma\\big)$ rewards large interventions. While the self-annealing behavior (Fig. 5) is encouraging, the derivation is heuristic rather than principled.
