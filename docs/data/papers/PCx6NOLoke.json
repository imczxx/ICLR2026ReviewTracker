Machine unlearning is introduced to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.  However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore, we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests, effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.", "tldr": "An LLM continuous unlearning method using rotation Angle to quantify and control the degree of unlearning.", "keywords": ["LLM", "Unlearning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ade9e00e06e8431ffcbea0f7b16524d892129ae3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), a novel approach for continual machine unlearning in Large Language Models that addresses two major challenges: Cumulative utility degradation across multiple unlearning requests and a Lack of precise control and quantification over the unlearning process.

Fine-grained Control over Unlearning Intensity:**\n\nThe paper introduces a novel perspective by modeling the unlearning strength as a controllable variable through rotational scaling. This design allows the model to precisely adjust the degree of forgetting at a fine-grained level. Such a mechanism provides more flexibility and interpretability for selective and controlled unlearning.\n\n**2. Theoretical Novelty through the Cognitive Rotation Space:**\n\nThe proposed Cognitive Rotation Space offers a strong theoretical contribution. By formulating unlearning as a spectral-space rotation governed by skew-symmetric transformations, the authors connect geometric orthogonality with cognitive forgetting behavior. This framework is both conceptually elegant and mathematically grounded, bringing a fresh theoretical lens to the study of machine unlearning.\n\n**3. Strong Empirical Performance and Robustness:**\n\nThe experimental results are impressive; the method demonstrates consistently strong unlearning performance across two benchmarks while significantly alleviating cumulative catastrophic utility loss in continual unlearning settings. The comprehensive evaluation convincingly shows that the proposed approach achieves an excellent balance between forgetting precision and retention stability."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**1. Limited Orthogonality Scope:**\n\nThe current design of the orthogonal rotation loss \\mathcal{L}_o appears to only enforce pairwise orthogonality between the current and the immediately preceding rotation axes. However, it does not ensure global orthogonality across all historical rotations. As the number of unlearning requests T grows, earlier forgetting directions may be reprojected onto new ones, potentially leading to knowledge leakage or cumulative utility degradation. Have the authors considered enforcing global orthogonality, and is it necessary for maintaining long-term stability in continual unlearning?\n\n**2. Granularity of the Rotational Salience Weight $\\beta$:**\n\nIn the RCU algorithm, is the $\\beta$ obtained through the OOD detection and Distributional Shift Compensator shared among all forget data within one unlearning process, or is a separate $\\beta$ computed individually for each data sample?\n\n**3.Computational Overhead and Efficiency Concerns:**\n\nSince the proposed approach relies on OOD detection to obtain a sample-dependent $\\beta$ value, it seems that an additional forward pass through the OOD module may be required for each input during inference. Will this introduce noticeable latency? Moreover, during training, the optimization process involves multiple components and loss terms, which might increase computational complexity and training time. A more detailed discussion or empirical analysis of the computational overhead would strengthen the paper.\n\n**4. Results Not Consistent with Prior Baselines.**\n\nAfter reviewing the O³ paper, I notice that the two papers report identical numbers for the other baselines, but this paper’s results are worse than those reported in O³ specifically for the O³ method itself.

Most importantly, why can we quantify the degree of unlearning using rotation angle? This paper does not provide conceptual, empirical, or mathematical justification for why unlearning itself should correspond to a rotation angle in rotation space. Also, the writing needs significant improvement. Many times throughout the paper, the authors use a term extensively without explanations (for example, the cognitive rotation space, what is that?) The authors should explain some of these terms in the preliminary section. The current preliminary section is essentially a ‘related work’ section. The method section also reads as a list of techniques without explaining why they are needed or how they relate to the core problem of unlearning. Overall, the paper does not convincingly argue that RCU is an effective or principled approach to unlearning."}, "questions": {"value": "I also have concerns regarding experiments. Moving into 2026, this setting feels too limited to demonstrate practical relevance. The authors should try larger models on way more unlearning requests to prove effectiveness of their methods.Also, the evaluation metrics are not well justified and not properly defined. For the TOFU task, why not use the eval metrics provided by the original authors? For example, the p-value statistical test and the average of Rouge, Answer Probability, and Truth Ratio? The authors should provide more contexts about these evaluations and justify their choices. \n\nWhile [1] is a recent work, [1] has achieved ideal unlearning by masking out the training signal of TOFU in their corpus. According to [1] results, an ideally unlearned model will achieve ideal forget quality vs utility trade-off. Also, forgetting ROUGE isn’t always better. This translates to the authors choice of SU and DU, where the authors are claiming that lower is always better. I strongly recommend the authors to use TOFU’s eval metrics and compare their results with LMLM from [1].  Also, the authors should compare computational costs, since we do want a simple and efficient algorithm for unlearning. \n\nLastly,  [2] has pointed out that unlearning isn’t always robust. More experiments on the robustness of their methods should be presented in the paper.\n\n[1] Zhao, L., Zalouk, S., Belardi, C. K., Lovelace, J., Zhou, J. P., Weinberger, K. Q., ... & Sun, J. J.
