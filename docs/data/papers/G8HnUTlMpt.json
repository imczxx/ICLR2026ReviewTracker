Yet, this flexibility also makes them vulnerable to malicious prompts designed to produce unsafe content, raising critical safety concerns. Existing defenses either rely on blacklist filters, which are easily circumvented, or on heavy classifier-based systems, both of which are costly and fragile under embedding-level attacks.\nWe address these challenges with two complementary components: Hyperbolic Prompt Espial (HyPE) and Hyperbolic Prompt Sanitization (HyPS). HyPE is a lightweight anomaly detector that leverages the structured geometry of hyperbolic space to model benign prompts and detect harmful ones as outliers. HyPS builds on this detection by applying explainable attribution methods to identify and selectively modify harmful words, neutralizing unsafe intent while preserving the original semantics of user prompts.\nThrough extensive experiments across multiple datasets and adversarial scenarios, we prove that our framework consistently outperforms prior defenses in both detection accuracy and robustness. Together, HyPE and HyPS offer an efficient, interpretable, and resilient approach to safeguarding VLMs against malicious prompt misuse.", "tldr": "HyPE detects harmful prompts by modeling benign prompts in hyperbolic space.

Is the expectation that the malicious/benign label represents the top level of the hierarchy?  \n\nThe underlying assumption appears to be that malicious prompts will be outliers in this learned space- have you stress-tested your approach using OOD benign images?\n\nMinor notation issue in Eq 1: if x is n+1 dimensional then the Lorentzian inner product should only sum up to n (the elements of x are indexed 0 to n, comprising n+1 elements).\n\nFor HyPS: How do you make the decision about what words to replace (is it a hard threshold or more adaptive method)?\n\nSuggest blurring the offensive image in Fig 1- readers will trust your claim that it is offensive.\n\nDetection is trained using HySAC embeddings but attribution appears to be applied using CLIP embeddings and I'm curious to better understand the implications. Aside from empirical validation, can you support the claim that the two embedding spaces can be distinct? Is it difficult to implement LIG against the HySAC encoder?\n\nPresentation: Table 1 misrepresents HyPE as the winning method in the Precision column for adv-MMA (should be GuardT2I).
