One of the primary factors behind the advancement of speech technology is self-supervised learning. Most self-supervised learning algorithms are designed with full utterance assumption and compromises have to made if partial utterances are presented, which are common in the streaming applications.  In this work, we propose a chunk based self-supervised learning (Chunk SSL) algorithm as an unified  solution for both streaming and offline speech pre-training.  Chunk SSL is optimized with the masked prediction loss and \nan acoustic encoder is encouraged to restore indices of those masked speech frames with help from unmasked frames in the same chunk and preceding chunks.  A copy and append data augmentation approach is proposed to conduct efficient chunk based pre-training.\nChunk SSL utilizes a finite scalar quantization (FSQ) module to discretize input speech features and our study shows a high resolution FSQ codebook, i.e., a codebook with vocabulary size up to a few millions, is beneficial to transfer knowledge from the pre-training task to the downstream tasks.   A group masked prediction loss is employed during pre-training to alleviate the high memory and computation cost introduced by the large codebook. The proposed approach is examined in two speech to text tasks, i.e., speech recognition and speech translation. Experimental results on the \\textsc{Librispeech} and \\textsc{Must-C} datasets show that the proposed method could achieve\nvery competitive results for speech to text tasks at both streaming and offline modes.", "tldr": "This work proposes a chunkwise self-supervised training based on high resolution finite scalar quantization and achieve competitive results for speech to text tasks.", "keywords": ["Self-supervised Learning", "Finite Scalar Quantization", "Speech Recognition", "Speech Translation"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/28ed9f7e135f6103a1e8d8c11d3e2684f2557a11.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a chunk-based self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that masks both future chunk information and sampled frames within each chunk.

The text appears to apply masks by multiplying masked positions by **0** rather than using large negative values before the softmax (or otherwise excluding them from the attention denominator). If true, this would leave nonzero attention weights on masked/future positions (the softmax denominator still includes those entries), allowing the model to attend to information that should be hidden. This is a fundamental concern that could invalidate the reported results. Please clarify precisely how masking is implemented (include equations), and provide an ablation that compares the current implementation with a standard masked-attention formulation (e.g., add −∞ or a large negative constant before softmax) to show the effect on performance and verify correctness.\n\n* **Limited novelty and missing literature context for multi-label representations:**\n  The multi-label / codec-like representation component echoes several recent works on discrete and multi-label audio representations (for example, MMM and other codec-inspired SSL approaches).

Please expand the related-work discussion to cover recent multi-label and codec-based representation studies, and clarify what is new here (algorithmic change, efficiency, empirical regime, etc.).

However, phoneme purity alone favors larger codebook / vocabulary sizes and does not capture clustering compactness or redundancy trade-offs. The paper should include additional probing analyses based on **cluster purity**, and report trade-offs between vocabulary size, cluster purity, and downstream performance.

Since FSQ quantizes each channel independently, it is reminiscent of the approach in dMel: Speech Tokenization Made Simple. However, it seems plausible that continuous mel-filterbank features could suffice for training. A direct comparison between models predicting continuous mel-filterbank features and those using FSQ targets would be necessary to justify the added complexity of introducing an FSQ encoder.\n\n2. As shown in Figure 2(b), it is unclear why the “1st chunk” is not appended as well. Assigning zero attention scores to the 'full context 1st chunk' to the 'appended 1st chunk' should work.\n\n3.

You should define the transformation from X to X′ (the CADA-augmented utterance) more precisely and carefully. \n\n[Q1-6] Figure 2-(b) is confusing.

We can have the first half of the batch unmasked and have the look-ahead causal chunked attention masks, while the second half (also copied from the first half) partially masked and having the corresponding causal chunked mask that is equivalent to CADA's design.
