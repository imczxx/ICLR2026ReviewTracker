Despite its significance, generally how LLM performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical framework, we further show how to model the entire training trajectory. This framework allows quantifying the capability limit of self-improvement by fitting the theoretical model to the experiment results. We validate the effectiveness of the theoretical framework on various LLMs and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which accords with the empirical observations.", "tldr": "This paper presents a physics-inspired model where the solver-verifier gap drives self-improvement, yielding an exponential capability convergence that accords with empirical observations on various LLMs and datasets.", "keywords": ["Training Dynamics", "Self-Improvement"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/24ed57e9b6115bbb42456d776768db112aab5c09.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper develops a physics-inspired theoretical framework to explain how large language models (LLMs) improve themselves without external data. It introduces the concept of a solver-verifier gap—the difference between an LLM’s ability to generate solutions (solver) and its ability to evaluate them (verifier)—as the main driver of self-improvement. The authors model training dynamics using coupled differential equations, showing that solver and verifier capabilities evolve exponentially toward limits determined by their initial gap. Experiments on Phi and Llama models across multiple datasets validate these exponential laws and confirm that verifiers consistently outperform solvers. The paper further extends the framework to cross-improvement, where limited external data enhance verifier capability; theoretical and empirical results show that the timing of using such data has minimal impact on final performance.

Some more ablations would be helpful to understand their effects.\n\nSome limiting behaviors are worthy of examination - such as how γ α and β would affect the convergence.\n\nIn EvoLM, model developers have found that base models that have undergone mid-training can be more easily adaptable using RL. The work should take into account such factors and see how this affects the self-improvement behaviors.
