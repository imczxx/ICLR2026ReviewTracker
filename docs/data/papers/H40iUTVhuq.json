Despite this progress, existing approaches still exhibit limitations of dependence on high-quality prompts and costly task-specific data, underscoring the need for more efficient and adaptable solutions. In this paper, we propose Progressive Reverse Understanding (\\textbf{PRU}), a novel training paradigm that incrementally enhances Text-to-SQL generation by encouraging models to reason in reverse: from SQL back to natural language. PRU decomposes the learning process into progressive stages where models first learn to construct user intents from structured SQL, and then iteratively refine the mapping between language and structured queries. This bidirectional learning enables deeper semantic alignment while alleviating reliance on prompt quality and reducing the need for additional large-scale task-specific data by leveraging the data pairs inherent in the dataset. Extensive experimental results on the Spider dataset with open-source language models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing Text-to-SQL performance. Moreover, ablation studies highlight the critical role of progressive reverse understanding in improving both syntactic correctness and semantic fidelity.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reverse Understanding", "text-to-sql"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ca2c030b96ca147b1d8440333d26529083f59c1e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/95459ffd9b258bbcb3f94b92f70871bf0db28993.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a training schedule for text-to-SQL called Progressive Reverse Understanding (PRU).

The evaluation scope is very limited; this will be the primary reason for recommending rejection. The paper evaluates only on the Spider dataset (released in 2018). There are widely recognized Spider variants (e.g., Spider-Syn, Spider-DK) and the more recent and important BIRD benchmark [1] for LLM-based text-to-SQL. A method claiming generality in an LLM setting should be validated in large-scale, real-world scenarios.\n\n2. The baseline comparison is insufficient. The authors should further review recent literature to provide fair and representative competing baselines [2]. In the public Spider leaderboard [3], many frameworks— including PLM-based systems—outperform the proposed PRU.\n\n3. The description of the reverse understanding component lacks clarity. The reverse task trains 𝑦→𝑥 using the original question 𝑥 as the target. If the reverse task simply reconstructs the paired natural language question, it risks being a trivial inverse mapping of the dataset rather than promoting robust abstraction (e.g., recovering intent instead of replicating surface form). It is also unclear whether paraphrasing, schema verbalization, or value normalization are applied to encourage generalization beyond copying. Relatedly, the reverse objective conditions on (𝑦, 𝑆). How 𝑆 is injected, and whether reverse training improves schema linking in the forward direction, are not sufficiently explained.\n\n4. The error analysis is limited. Although overall performance improves, there is no qualitative or category-level error investigation. The claim that PRU improves syntactic and semantic fidelity would be stronger with finer-grained diagnostics.\n\n[1] Jinyang Li, et al. \"Can LLM Already Serve as A Database Interface?

Novel and Well-Motivated Methodology: The proposed PRU framework is genuinely innovative. It moves beyond standard forward-only fine-tuning by incorporating a curriculum of reverse reasoning (SQL-to-Text), inspired by human learning processes. The progressive scheduling strategy, which gradually phases out reverse data in favor of forward data, is a thoughtful design that mitigates error propagation and provides a smooth learning curve, strengthening the model's structural comprehension.\n\n2. Extensive and Rigorous Experimental Validation: The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation on the standard Spider benchmark. The results are compelling, showing state-of-the-art performance, particularly a significant improvement in Exact Match accuracy. Furthermore, the authors go beyond a simple comparison by including a thorough ablation study and sensitive analyses on critical hyperparameters (e.g., M1 duration, curriculum shape, residual reverse ratio). This systematically validates the contribution of each component of their proposed framework.\n\n3. Significant and Meaningful Performance Improvement: The method achieves a top-tier Execution Accuracy (75.8% EX) and a notably higher Exact Match accuracy (70.6% EM) than the strongest baseline. The substantial lead in EM is particularly important, as it indicates the model is generating more syntactically precise and semantically faithful SQL queries, not just queries that happen to execute to the correct result. This demonstrates a qualitative improvement in the model's understanding."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Computational Inefficiency and Training Complexity: The proposed progressive training strategy involves multiple sequential fine-tuning stages (M1 to Mn). While the use of LoRA makes this feasible, the multi-stage process is inherently more complex and computationally intensive than single-stage fine-tuning. The paper does not discuss the total training time or resource cost compared to baselines, which could be a practical limitation for adoption in resource-constrained environments.\n\n2. Limited Generalization and Scalability Assessment: The empirical validation is conducted exclusively on the Spider dataset. The generalizability of the PRU method to other Text-to-SQL benchmarks with different characteristics (e.g., WikiSQL for simplicity, BIRD for handling large, noisy real-world databases) remains unverified. Additionally, the approach is demonstrated primarily on the Llama-3.1-8B model; its effectiveness across other model architectures or sizes is not explored.\n\n3. Insufficient Theoretical and Mechanistic Explanation: While the concept of \"reverse understanding\" is intuitively appealing and motivated by human cognition, the paper lacks a deep investigation into why and how it works so effectively. There is no analysis of how the model's internal representations change during the progressive stages or which specific aspects of SQL semantics and syntax are improved by the reverse training. A deeper dive into the mechanistic underpinnings would strengthen the theoretical contribution."}, "questions": {"value": "1. some papers, e.g., [1],  have shown that sql-to-text is not necessarily helpful for text-to-sql.
