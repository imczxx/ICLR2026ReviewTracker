To this end, we present PepGen (Potential Energy Perspective for Generalized dynamics Generation), a framework that seamlessly integrates rigid body, articulated body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-5\nagnostic system. PepGen operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors, covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PepGen robustly unifies diverse simulation paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich scenarios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["dynamics generation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/84c403a10cd0c062077742b1357b6c11507ce260.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d95a35d331ae06c514a28a365bc8a2fa9aae6fcf.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Gen-3, a unified, geometry-agnostic dynamics framework that extends classical elastodynamics with directional (anisotropic) stiffness, aiming to cover soft, rigid, articulated, and discontinuous behaviors within one potential-energy–based formulation.
