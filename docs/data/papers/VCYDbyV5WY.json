A watermark is a statistical signal hidden inside text that can be detected by anyone with access to a secret key but is intended to not distort the quality of text, thus remaining undetectable to observers without access to a secret key. Many schemes have been instantiated for autoregressive models by modifying the sampling procedure of models, with a prominent such scheme being the green list approach, where a hash function looks at the recent context and returns a pseudorandom subset of the vocabulary to upweight in generation. While this has proven effective in autoregressive models, it is not immediate how to instantiate this scheme with masked diffusion models.  This paper suggests two approaches to solving this problem.  First, it suggests considering a bidirectional hashing scheme where the has depends both on the previous token and/or the subsequent token, thereby improving the likelihood that a given token has the watermark applied.  Second, the paper proposes infilling tokens with the greedy approach as a 'prediction' that is then used to construct the hash.  Assuming that the final token sampled in that position is indeed this greedy token, this results in greater detectability.  The authors then empirically evaluate their approach and find it superior to the naive baseline of applying the autoregressive approach whenever a preceding token exists."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "This paper identifies a clear problem with the well known greenlist approach to watermarking autoregressive language models when applied to diffusion models and proposes a solution that is empirically effective relative to the naive baseline."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "There are several weaknesses with this paper.  First, I think that the several papers including Synth-ID and *GaussMark: A Practical Approach for Structural Watermarking of Language Models* demonstrate that perplexity is a weak proxy of text quality.  Have the authors tested how their approach affects other measures like winrate in AlpacaEval or some other proxy for text quality?\n\nSecond, I think that the paper could benefit from further comparison with existing baselines.  There exist watermarking approaches that embed the watermark directly in the weights of a model, with *GaussMark: A Practical Approach for Structural Watermarking of Language Models* being an example; it seems like such an approach could directly translate into diffusion models and potentially be competitive as it does not rely on the autoregressive nature of distribution.  Can the authors comment on this?\n\nThird, I wonder what the increase in sampling time is for this approach over the unwatermarked model?\n\nFourth, I am a bit confused by the theory behind the predictive approach.  For these kinds of watermarking schemes, many prior works have identified sequence entropy as a key quantity allowing for watermark detectability without a hit in quality, but in higher entropy situations, the predictive approach should be worse.   I understand the ablation that suggests that this is useful in practice, but it would be good for the authors to comment on this?\n\nFifth, I think that the writing and rigor of the presentation could be improved, e.g., what is the maximum over in equations (7) and (10)?"}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "TEDHCy6g6d", "forum": "VCYDbyV5WY", "replyto": "VCYDbyV5WY", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4262/Reviewer_VNpz"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4262/Reviewer_VNpz"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4262/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761284167446, "cdate": 1761284167446, "tmdate": 1762917261007, "mdate": 1762917261007, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents DMark, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for diffusion large language models (dLLMs).
