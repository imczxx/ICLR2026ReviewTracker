Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce $\\texttt{StarEmbed}$, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. $\\texttt{StarEmbed}$ integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding $\\sim$40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs ($\\texttt{Moirai}$, $\\texttt{Chronos}$, $\\texttt{Chronos-Bolt}$) and a domain-specific transformer ($\\texttt{Astromer}$) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the $\\texttt{Chronos}$ models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.", "tldr": "We propose the first benchmark for time series foundation model on stellar time series observations.", "keywords": ["benchmark", "astrophysics", "light curve", "photometrics", "ZTF", "periodic variables", "time series foundation models", "embedding models", "classifcation"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e3d6f4df023b1945ddc2e43888bfd3e8603c428f.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/5ed8901a09a1b3dc28ac0f6f0e210397b6085140.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper evaluates the performance of time series foundation models in astronomy science.
