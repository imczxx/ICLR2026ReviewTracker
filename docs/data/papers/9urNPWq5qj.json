This paper introduces **StyleBrush**, a training-free stylization framework grounded in Riemannian geometry, which resolves this tension through a principled, dual-control optimization. Our core theoretical contribution is to reframe style transfer as a geodesic path-finding problem on a latent manifold. By leveraging the pullback metric, we establish a local isometry that validates optimizing a path’s energy in the embedding space as a means to approximate true geodesics, providing a rigorous foundation for style interpolation. This geometric framework is uniquely applied at two critical stages of the diffusion process: first, for interpolating content and style latents to ensure a semantically continuous fusion, and second, for modulating query features in self-attention layers to dynamically control stylization intensity. The unification of these two control mechanisms under a single geometric principle constitutes the primary novelty of our approach, enabling fine-grained and theoretically-grounded stylization control without any model training. Empirical validation on standard benchmarks confirms that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across a suite of quantitative and qualitative metrics.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Face Style Transfer", "Point Interpolation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5302ed7efbb9f6f463677b9331c11db6e246a9d6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents StyleBrush, a training-free framework for facial image stylization based on Riemannian geometry.
