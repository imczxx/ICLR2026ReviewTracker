Unlike existing approaches that often rely on a central controller or impose stringent behavior requirements on agents, we propose a fully decentralized method using reward machines (RMs) that can learn an optimal policy for temporally extended tasks. We introduce a belief-based Byzantine detection mechanism for discrete-time multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL), where defender (non-Byzantine) agents iteratively update probabilistic suspicions of peers using observed actions and rewards. RMs allow us to encode the temporal dependencies in the reward structure of the task and guide the learning process. Our methods introduce tabular Q-learning and actor-critic algorithms with reward machines to learn a robust consensus mechanism to isolate the influence of Byzantine agents, in order to ensure effective learning by defender agents. We establish theoretical guarantees, demonstrating that our algorithms converge to an optimal policy. We further evaluate our method against baselines in two case studies to show its effectiveness and performance.", "tldr": "Decentralized Reinforcement Learning for Learning Resilient Policies against Adversarial Agents in Temporally Extended Tasks", "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning", "Multi-agent systems", "Adversarial agents"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9fc73b3147931f09d61be7ccedfcae3b52412c2a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/61931f3e4c910f997c4e20e04c8576f92a9089a0.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper provides decentralized Byzantine-robust MARL with reward machines.

The adversarial model considered in the paper is not properly described or explained. While the authors claim that they consider a Byzantine adversary model, it should be noted that in such a model, each adversarial or malicious agent can send arbitrary information to its neighbors in a multi-agent system (e.g., https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/chen23b/chen23b.pdf). However, this does not seem to be the case that the authors actually consider in the paper. For example, in the paragraph starting from line 135, the authors describe a specific way for the adversarial agent to alter/modify the original information and send it to the neighbor (rather than sending arbitrary information to the neighbors). Whether the adversarial model considered in the paper is a Byzantine model needs further clarification.\n2. The consideration of the problem setup with labeled MDP model and reward machine is not well motivated or justified.

This theoretical grounding is a positive aspect, as it provides assurance about the algorithms' behavior under the stated assumptions."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Fundamental Flaw in the Belief Mechanism: The proposed belief update rule (Equation 2) relies on a critical and impractical assumption: that an agent $i$ can compute the optimal action for another agent $j$. In a decentralized, partially observable setting where agents do not know each other's policies or full state, determining $a_k^{*,j}$ is fundamentally infeasible. If agent $i$ computes this using its own Q-function $Q^i$, it implicitly assumes all agents have identical optimal policies, a very strong and often invalid assumption, especially in heterogeneous tasks or during early learning. This flaw undermines the core detection mechanism and its practical applicability.\n\n- Weak and Limited Empirical Evaluation: The experimental section is a major weakness. (1) Scale and Complexity: The evaluation is conducted only on a small grid-world with 3 agents, which does not demonstrate scalability. (2) Baseline Comparison: The baselines are not inherently designed for Byzantine resilience or temporal abstraction via RMs. Outperforming them is an expected result, not a strong validation. (3) Lack of Analysis: There is no analysis of the belief mechanism itself (e.g., precision/recall of detection). The provided figures only show cumulative reward.\n\n- Unconvincing Practicality and Assumptions: The practicality of the approach is questionable. Assumption 1 is very restrictive. Furthermore, the assumption that defenders have a fixed policy against the Byzantine policy (Assumption 3) seems to contradict the learning process.
