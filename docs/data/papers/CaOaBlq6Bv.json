We present Stochastic Additive No-mulT Attention (SANTA), a drop-in inference-time replacement that eliminates these value-stage multiplications. For each query, SANTA samples from the post-softmax distribution, gathers and sums selected values, and applies a single bit-shift normalization, with no expensive multipliers on the value path. SANTA’s compute scales as $O(n_{queries} \\cdot S \\cdot d_k)$: linear in the number of queries during prefill and linear in the sample budget $S$ during decode, while exhibiting sparse, index-based memory access. SANTA is an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator of dense attention and is orthogonal to upstream efficiency techniques (ternary quantization, low-rank kernels, sparsity, pruning). Combined with existing 1-bit/ternary quantizers, SANTA moves Transformers toward fully multiplier-free, energy-efficient inference.", "tldr": "SANTA: an unbiased post-softmax estimator that swaps the value-stage matmul for sampled gather-add + bit-shift, with compute O(n_queries·S·d_k) (linear in prefill, linear in S at decode) and sparse reads—toward multiplier-free LLM inference.", "keywords": ["efficient attention", "Monte Carlo attention", "transformer inference", "energy-efficiency", "sampling", "multiplier-free", "memory bandwidth", "KV-cache", "edge devices", "large language models", "hardware-aware ML"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/05d373e7a4050caa7e2378cee8b7eeb27261d409.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3f9971b336d358355c1023d8fd8ca7506a6e0fcc.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces SANTA, an additive attention variant that serves as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism.

Unlike BitNet, SANTA is applied at inference time, and its implications to training are not explored. Furthermore, the authors hint at potential synergy of the method with BitNet-like architectures in order to fully get rid of multiplications in the forward calculation, but this is not backed by any experimental data (i.e., it is not clear if the method would work well with these architectures) — a demonstration of a fully multiplication-free transformer would benefit this argument.\n\n- The underlying sampling idea is not new, and has been used in previous work to approximate attention (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16179)\n- The paper does not provide any practical measurements on effective speed-ups that could be achieved.
