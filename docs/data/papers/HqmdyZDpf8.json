Existing methods leveraging electron density for \\textit{de novo} molecule generation employ a two-stage process: generating hypothetical binder electron densities within a pocket, then interpreting them into molecules. While mitigating bias from binders pre-existing in the pocket, these approaches' two-stage nature can lead to error accumulation. Furthermore, these methods are limited by rigid pocket assumptions, which may compromise the diversity of the generated electron density. These limitations often result in drug-like molecules lacking favorable three-dimensional (3D) conformations or conversely, 3D conformations without assured drug-likeness. We introduce EDMolGPT, a novel decoder-only framework that directly synthesizes molecules from the low-resolution electron density point cloud derived from an existing binder. By leveraging this existing binder’s low-resolution electron density and avoiding explicit pocket structures, our strategy effectively mitigates bias, circumvents two-stage error, and negates rigid pocket limitations. EDMolGPT's autoregressive decoder-only architecture, guided by robust low-resolution electron density, efficiently generates binding molecules with high drug-likeness and favorable 3D conformations. Rigorous validation across 101 biological targets underscores its potential to accelerate novel therapeutic agent discovery.", "tldr": "We propose EDMolGPT, a decoder-only generative framework designed to produce 3D ligand molecules in an autoregressive manner via electron density.", "keywords": ["Drug design", "Electronic density"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6a38f4c938dd714e20b760af953d3e23e72e172a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a drug design model based on the electron density representation of known ligands, employing an autoregressive Transformer architecture and introducing the FSMILES representation to achieve 3D molecular generation.

Besides, the paper lacks controlled comparisons to demonstrate that the proposed representation is superior to those used in ED2Mol or ECloudGen.\n- Presentation: Several main claims are not rigorously supported.\n    - Error accumulation: The proposed point cloud representation itself still contains errors, which may arise from multiple sources — including binding pose, electron density calculation, h bond annotation, and discretization precision loss. Although the authors claim that their approach reduces error accumulation compared to two-stage methods, the representation they use is also error-prone, and the paper does not report any quantitative error analysis.\n    - Flexibility: The claimed advantage of not requiring explicit pocket structures is actually a common feature of LBDD, rather than a unique contribution of this work. Moreover, since the point cloud is derived from a single ligand conformation, it cannot capture pocket flexibility.\n    - Minor points: The paper lacks a clear demonstration or ablation of FSMILES effectiveness, and the biological activity metric ECFP4 Tanimoto similarity (TS) is not clearly explained.\n    - Docking score: How is the initial binding pose determined when calculating min score? Can you provide the experiment affinity or docking scores for reference ligands?\n- Method:\n    - Sorting point clouds purely by coordinate order may disrupt spatial locality.\n    - The paper does not explain how positional embeddings — a critical component of Transformer architectures — are implemented in this context.\n- Experiment:\n    - Table 1 does not report the average molecular weight of each model. ED2Mol tends to generate smaller molecules, which typically exhibit lower docking scores, lower strain energy, and higher drug-likeness. The paper only reports ED2Mol’s molecular weight, but ED2Mol performs weakly overall (Table 1). The authors should have compared against stronger baselines.\n    - Table 1 also omits important metrics such as diversity and novelty. Furthermore, Figure 6 only verifies that there is no data leakage between training and test sets, but does not confirm that the generated molecules are novel relative to the training data. Intuitively, for certain small molecules, using 199 points may provide excessive information about the reference ligand, effectively making the ligand-based design task easier. The authors need to demonstrate that their method can generate molecules that are significantly different from the reference ligand, rather than merely reproducing or slightly modifying it."}, "questions": {"value": "see weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "XpvxLdSenx", "forum": "HqmdyZDpf8", "replyto": "HqmdyZDpf8", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4236/Reviewer_ApF4"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4236/Reviewer_ApF4"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4236/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761881992550, "cdate": 1761881992550, "tmdate": 1762917247888, "mdate": 1762917247888, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes EDMolGPT, a decoder-only (GPT-style) autoregressive model for structure-based drug design (SBDD) that generates 3D ligand molecules directly from low-resolution electron-density (ED) point clouds.\n\nUnlike conventional SBDD approaches that condition on atom-level protein pocket structures or two-stage “ED→pocket→ligand” pipelines, EDMolGPT takes a 3D ED point cloud as the sole condition.
