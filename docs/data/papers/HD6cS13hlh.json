Human communication is inherently multimodal; however, existing approaches in video summarization either rely solely on visual features or rudimentary text-visual combinations, neglecting critical audio prosodic patterns and their interactions. Crucially, the synchronous behavioural signals that convey emotional expression and communicative intent are not considered entirely. In this paper, we present a behaviour-aware multimodal framework for video summarization that explicitly models synchronized behavioural cues across visual, audio, and textual modalities through a transformer-based architecture with cross-modal attention mechanisms. Our approach integrates CLIP visual embeddings enhanced with facial movement detection and emotional transitions, HuBERT audio features enriched with prosodic patterns including pitch variations and voice quality measures, and RoBERTa textual embeddings that preserve narrative flow and discourse structure. We employ heuristic-based behavioural cue detection methods combined with large language model-guided extractive summarization to generate pseudo-ground truth references that capture both semantic importance and behavioural salience. Extensive evaluations on the ChaLearn First Impressions dataset demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 33.2% increase in F1-score over CLIP-It and 7.3% over recent multimodal approaches. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of behavioural cue integration, with each modality contributing complementary insights for capturing communicatively significant moments in interview-style videos.", "tldr": "We combine traditional behavioural cue detection with transformer-based multimodal fusion to create video summaries that capture human communicative intent across visual, audio, and textual modalities.", "keywords": ["multimodal video summarization", "behavioural cues detection", "computer vision", "natural language processing", "audio and speech processing", "multimedia content creation", "human-centric videos"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2266f9095da04f26c96981c19545c62469bbfad8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/5cf8f454cd6550fe4a421d8e299293bc957d517b.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a transformer-based multimodal video summarization framework that explicitly models synchronized behavioural cues (facial movements, prosodic patterns, gestures) across visual, audio, and textual modalities for human-centric interview videos.

The concatenation of detected behavioural features with foundation model embeddings (CLIP, HuBERT) is straightforward yet effective.\n\n- The three-stream processing pipeline with modality-specific encoders (video, audio, text) and cross-modal attention mechanism provides a principled approach to feature integration. The autoregressive decoding strategy addresses temporal coherence better than frame-level classification approaches.\n\n- The two-stage approach combining heuristic behavioural cue detection with LLM-guided summarization addresses the lack of annotated data pragmatically. The validation showing 93% coverage and 0.83 Jaccard similarity across independent generations demonstrates reasonable stability."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Evaluation exclusively on ChaLearn First Impressions (single-speaker, controlled interview setting) raises significant concerns about generalizability. The framework's applicability to multi-speaker scenarios, conversational videos, educational lectures, or unstructured content remains unvalidated. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide evidence of cross-domain robustness.\n\n- Heuristic-based behavioural detection lacks justification: The choice of thresholds for behavioural cue detection (μ + 1.5σ for head movement, Z-score ±1.2 for pitch, top 20% TF-IDF) appears arbitrary without principled justification or sensitivity analysis. The adaptive thresholds may not generalize across different video characteristics, speaker styles, or recording conditions.\n\n- Using LLM-generated summaries as evaluation references introduces potential circularity, as the framework is optimized against these same LLM-derived targets. While the authors demonstrate inter-summary agreement, the fundamental question of alignment with human preferences remains unaddressed. The 93% coverage metric does not validate whether detected cues correspond to human-perceived importance.\n\n- Despite claims of temporal coherence, Kendall's τ (0.6473) and Spearman's ρ (0.6466) remain moderate, suggesting the framework still struggles to fully preserve narrative structure. The paper does not sufficiently analyze why these correlations plateau or what architectural modifications might improve them.\n\n- While cross-modal attention is central to the approach, the paper provides limited insight into what the attention mechanism learns. There are no attention weight visualizations, analysis of modality dominance patterns, or investigation of how attention distributions vary across different video types or behavioural contexts."}, "questions": {"value": "- How does the framework perform on fundamentally different video types such as multi-speaker panel discussions, casual vlogs, classroom lectures, or documentary-style content?

Have you conducted systematic sensitivity analysis varying these parameters (e.g., σ multipliers from 1.0 to 2.0, Z-score thresholds from ±1.0 to ±1.5)? Could these thresholds be learned rather than hand-specified?\n\n- Given the reliance on LLM-generated pseudo-ground truth, how well do your summaries align with human-annotated preferences? Have you considered conducting human evaluation studies with metrics like informativeness, coherence, and behavioural salience ratings? What percentage of frames deemed important by your model would humans also rate as significant?\n\n- What patterns does the cross-modal attention mechanism learn?
