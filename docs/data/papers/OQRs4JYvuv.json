However, when the learned dynamics model is inaccurate, these synthetic rollouts can introduce bias and deteriorate performance. Fortunately, many domains exhibit symmetries that can serve as powerful inductive biases, enabling the learned models to generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we exploit these inherent symmetries in MBRL and formally define equivariant MBRL for POMDPs. Building on this formulation, we introduce EquiDreamer, a framework that integrates symmetry into both world modeling and policy learning through an equivariant latent dynamics architecture. Experiments on visual continuous control tasks demonstrate that our equivariant MBRL method outperforms both model-based and model-free baselines, achieving strong results with substantially fewer environment interactions.", "tldr": "We combine model-based reinforcement learning with equivariant neural networks to achieve better generalization and solving tasks with fewer environment interactions.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Model-based Reinforcement Learning", "World models", "Equivariance"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4902eadd8d49e2b74c51a029f2784dce1bfaa43b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/8d33d1becd13da087566e07211e0ca49b02cf3b7.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies equivariance in model-based reinforcement learning under POMDPs.

The method assumes prior knowledge of the symmetry groups. It would be valuable to explore whether the approach could be extended to learn these symmetries automatically, as in [2,3].\n\n2. Additionally, the method cannot handle approximate symmetries, and this limitation is not discussed. Addressing both these points could significantly strengthen the contribution and impact of the work.\n\n3. I identified potential issues with Proposition 1 and its proof that questions soundness of the paper: Proposition 1 is derived from Equation (3), which in turn is taken from [1], an unpublished paper. Given the central role of this equation, the authors should better justify its validity rather than assuming it holds, especially since [1] has not undergone peer review and appears to be an informal note.\n\n4. The proof relies on two strong and arguably unrealistic assumptions: (1) the dynamics model perfectly approximates the true transition dynamics, and (2) the symmetries are exact and perfectly generalizable. These assumptions are almost impossible to hold in neural network-based models and, importantly, prevent the method from being applicable to environments with approximate symmetries.\n\n5. Results are reported on only four DMC environments out of more than twenty available. The selected tasks are all 2D with small action spaces, despite the method being motivated as generally applicable to 3D symmetries. This raises questions about scalability to more complex environments.\n\n6. The reported baseline results, particularly for DrQ-v2, are inconsistent with the original paper, where the method performs much better. Here, DrQ-v2 fails to learn in nearly all environments, suggesting potential issues with implementation or hyperparameter choices. If different settings were used, the authors should clarify this. In any case, the authors need to provide a proper representation of the baseline, particularly if the baseline is well-established in the community and has a high reproducibility.\n\n7. The paper is missing various baselines from equivariant representation learning algorithms. The method is only compared against Dreamer and DRQ-v2. At least one baseline from each of the following families should be included:\n    * Model-free equivariant methods: Deep homomorphic policy gradient [2], or EQR [3]. \n    * Model-based equivariant methods:  EDGI [4], equivariant MuZero [5], SEN [7], or [8].\n\n8. The contributions appear incremental compared to prior work on equivariant model-based RL. The paper does not cite or compare against some key methods in this area, such as [4] and [5].\n\nGiven the above methodological, theoretical, and empirical limitations, as well as concerns regarding the validity of the main proposition, I do not believe the paper meets the standard of this venue. Nonetheless, this is a promising research direction, and I encourage the authors to address these issues in future revisions.\n\n### References\n[1] Jiang, Nan. \"A note on loss functions and error compounding in model-based reinforcement learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.09946 (2024).\n\n[2] Rezaei-Shoshtari, Sahand, et al. \"Continuous mdp homomorphisms and homomorphic policy gradient.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 20189-20204.\n\n[3] Mondal, Arnab Kumar, et al. \"Eqr: Equivariant representations for data-efficient reinforcement learning.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
