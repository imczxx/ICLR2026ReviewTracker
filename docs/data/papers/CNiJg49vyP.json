However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server. \nSimilarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data, i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy.\nHowever, existing methods adopt this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to settings where such data is unavailable.\nIn this paper, we propose H+, a novel similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL systems without any clean data.\nSpecifically, H+ randomly selects $r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data. Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an analytical time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of clients and $Kr \\ll p$.\nComprehensive experiments validate H+ as a state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios and benchmark datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Federated lerning", "Byzantine attack."], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d5bf6e041038a82bb01429a9ea1655cc6c128b78.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/68a6945a3a8c48dd968623a9f72c914bfe50edc6.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes H+, a similarity-aware aggregation method aimed at improving the robustness of federated learning (FL) against Byzantine attacks.

The paper introduces a new similarity check function H, but does not explain its underlying intuition or provide insight into why it performs better than standard similarity metrics such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Without a clear theoretical or empirical justification, it is difficult to assess the significance of this design choice.\n\n3. All evaluated attacks are from 2020 or earlier, which limits the relevance of the experimental results. Considering the submission aims for ICLR 2026, the absence of more recent and adaptive attack baselines is surprising and weakens the claimed effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n4. The paper provides no theoretical discussion or analysis regarding the effectiveness of the similarity function H or the potential impact of the proposed defense on model convergence. Such analysis would be critical to support the soundness and stability of the approach.\n\n5. It remains unclear whether the proposed method generalizes to modern model architectures such as Vision Transformers (ViT). Given the growing dominance of ViTs in vision-related FL tasks, this omission limits the scope and practical relevance of the work.\n\n6. As highlighted by Back to the Drawing Board: A Critical Evaluation of Poisoning Attacks on Production Federated Learning (IEEE S&P 2022), the proportion of malicious clients in real-world federated deployments is typically below 1%.

In cases where clean data is unavailable, which is common in real-world federated learning since obtaining clean data is often difficult, the proposed H+ method cannot extend the robustness boundary of the underlying aggregation rule. It only enhances performance when the base method (for example, Krum, GM, or Median) already provides some level of resilience. However, when the base method fails under strong attacks, H+ also fails. This greatly limits its effectiveness. For instance, as shown in [a], the Krum aggregation rule is inherently vulnerable to the Krum attack, meaning that Krum provides no robustness under such attack. In this situation, the H+ method will also fail.\n\n2. When clean data is unavailable, H+ can only improve performance if the base method already offers partial robustness. This idea has already been explored in paper [b], which also focuses on improving the robustness of existing aggregation methods such as GM and Median. The authors should clearly explain how their method differs from [b] and include a direct experimental comparison.\n\n3. The attacks considered in this paper are relatively weak.

The ablation study only explores scenarios with ±10% deviations in the number of benign clients, which barely tests robustness to practical uncertainty. \n\n+ Following the previous point, the paper lacks evaluation in benign conditions, i.e., when there are no attackers. This is important as we cannot assess whether H+ introduces any degradation, noise, or training instability when all clients are honest and we only select a subset of N clients at each training iteration. In this sense, a robust aggregation method should aim to keep the baseline model’s accuracy in the absence of attacks. \n\n+ The similarity metric in equation (10) is not well justified and discussed. Why is this metric appropriate compared to other existing similarity metrics, like, for example, the cosine similarity. Is there any advantage in using a non-symmetric similarity metric like the one in (10), compared to symmetric similarity metrics? I think this point would make the paper sounder. \n\n + There is a relevant dependence with respect to the different hyperparameters of the method.

Computational Efficiency: By employing random sampling of low-dimensional vector segments (where 𝑟 ≪ 𝑝) for similarity computation, H+ significantly reduces the computational cost compared to traditional cosine-similarity-based aggregation, making it well-suited for large-scale models.\n3. Empirical Robustness: The experimental results demonstrate that H+ consistently enhances test accuracy and resilience against a variety of Byzantine attack types including Gaussian, Sign-flip, LIE, and FoE across a broad range of attack ratios. It often achieves substantial performance gains over existing robust aggregators such as Median, Krum, GM, MCA, CClip, FLTrust, and Zeno++.\n4.
