In this work, we analyze the identifiability of such sparse and local latent intermediate variables, which we call motifs.

Additionally, we provide the Sparling algorithm, which uses a new kind of informational bottleneck that enforces levels of activation sparsity unachievable using other techniques. We find that extreme sparsity is necessary to achieve good intermediate state modeling empirically.
