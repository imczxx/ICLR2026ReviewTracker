We formulate phasing as a binary, overlapping node clustering problem on unitig graphs where nodes represent contiguous, non-branching DNA sequence fragments and different edge types capture sequence overlaps as well as Hi-C proximity information. To solve this problem, we design a contrastive learning framework with custom objective functions and train a graph-transformer-based model termed grapHiC to distinguish nodes with paternal, maternal, or homozygous haplotypes. We show that grapHiC significantly outperforms other node clustering methods on genome-sized datasets and that grapHiC’s predictions can successfully guide de novo genome assembly, producing well-phased assemblies across diverse human genome assembly graphs using the DipGNNome assembler. Our code, trained model, and dataset are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/graphic_iclr-688D/ (repository anonymized for peer review).", "tldr": "We present the first deep learning tool for Hi-C-based phasing, and the first method to perform phasing at the unitig level.", "keywords": ["Genome Assembly", "Geometric Deep Learning", "Contrastive Learning", "Clustering", "Graph"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/17a4d42a14d2df6c5094b66a87bbc984b9df3d28.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a graph-transformer model, grahpHiC for de novo haplotype phasing in de novo genome assembly.

Additionally, the application of graph transformers to the alignment-free setting appears to be a novel contribution.\n\nI would also like to acknowledge the effort made by the authors to provide the reader with some biological background in the introduction and related work sections; this is particularly important for the manuscript to be self-contained and understandable by a reader lacking the requisite background in computational biology."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "There are several clear weaknesses in this paper in its current form. Firstly, the paper initially positions graphic as a de novo genome assembler, but it is effectively only learning untig values to be assembled by some other method (DipGNNome in this paper). This has to be clarified and raises other potential questions, such as whether alternative clustering methods could be effective at assembling genomes after learning the node values.\n\nMoreover, the current landscape of haplotype phasing and de novo genome assembly is somewhat misrepresented. Examples of this are listed below.\n\n1.\tHifaism is not mentioned as a method for phased de novo genome assembly despite being used as a benchmark later.\n2.\tIn the paragraph starting at line 173, the authors state that reference-based haplotype phasing methods have been evaluated on much smaller datasets than is typical of real eukaryotic genomes. However, CAECSeq and XHap (Consul et al, 2023) both demonstrate haplotype assembly on real chromosomal data.\n\nThis work also raises a conceptual question – the loss function necessitates the presence of ground-truth labels as it is a supervised loss function. These labels are obtained by virtue of the training data being simulated. With a motivation for the proposed work being that reference-based haplotype assembly methods are biased towards the chosen reference, it is not obvious that the use of simulated data when training grapHiC does not implicitly also introduce a bias towards the reference from which the training data is generated. \n\nFinally, the shortfall of performance of grapHiC vs. Hifaism raises the question of whether the use of machine learning (graph transformer) brings about any tangible benefit in tackling the problem of haplotype-phased de novo genome assembly."}, "questions": {"value": "**Questions:**\n\n1.\tONT reads typically have much higher rates than HiFi reads. How does the performance of the proposed approach vary when ONT reads are used in place of HiFi reads?\n2.\tWhat are heterographs (line 106)?\n3.\tWhy is the acronym of “Supervised Contrastive Pair” loss taken to be “SBP”? Should it not be “SCP”?\n4.\tOn line 156, the authors state the this is “the first method capable of phasing raw untig graphs”. As per my understanding, most de novo genome assemblers entail the construction of assembly graphs (k-mers or untigs). How is the described setting different from that of these other works?\n5.\tWhy were other haplotype-phased de novo genome assemblers, such as Hifaism, Falcon-Unzip and HiCanu omitted when describing related work?\n6.\tIs the random sampling used in the global and local SBP losses fixed across epochs?\n7.\tWhat are the parameters used to simulate reads using PBSim3? Also, PBSim3 does not generate HiFi reads; rather, it generates CLR reads that have to be passed to PacBio CSS to generate HiFi reads.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n1.\tThe summary of contributions (lines 155-160) is fairly repetitive as points 2 and 3 are accomplished as part of the first point.\n2.\tThe model architecture in Section 5 would be better described through a pictorial representation.
