Compared with literature, Conv-CoA addresses three major challenges: (i) unfaithful hallucination that is inconsistent with real-time or domain facts, (ii) weak reasoning performance in conversational scenarios, and (iii) unsatisfying performance in conversational information retrieval. Our key contribution is a dynamic reasoning-retrieval mechanism that extracts the intent of the question and decomposes it into a reasoning chain to be solved via systematic prompting, pre-designed actions, updating the Contextual Knowledge Set (CKS), and a novel Hopfield-based retriever. Methodologically, we propose a resource-efficient Hopfield retriever to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of conversational information retrieval within our actions. Additionally, we propose a conversational-multi-reference faith score (Conv-MRFS) to verify and resolve conflicts between retrieved knowledge and answers in conversations. Empirically, we conduct comparisons between our framework and 23 state-of-the-art methods across five different research directions and two public benchmarks. These comparisons demonstrate that our Conv-CoA outperforms other methods in both the accuracy and efficiency dimensions.", "tldr": "A hopfield-based retriever augmented conversational question answering", "keywords": ["question answering", "information retrieval", "modern hopfield network"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8a8cdacf5e3d245fa9338cfdbaaa64731c2787ac.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e6414af56c4a3d85415c38417a8461e6e866ef72.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a new system for multi-turn conversational question answering.

The CoA is generated using a large language model (LLM) prompted with the conversation history and previous CoA steps.

These days LLMs are being used extensively in multiturn educational setups, customer support etc., which makes conversational QA an important research area.\n\n2. The paper has an interesting idea to use Hopfield networks for efficient retrieval."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Baselines and experimental setup is quite outdated**: The paper currently uses GPT3.5 as a backbone, which is a model from 2022. LLMs have gotten a lot better since then, with significant improvements in zero-shot factuality, long-context, and reasoning with thinking tokens. Given this, I'm not very sure the loss patterns being tackled in the paper are valid anymore with SoTA models, and I expect they will do a lot better. Similarly, the retriever uses BERT encoders as backbones, which is a model from 2018.\n\n2. **Paper would be stronger with evaluation on more recent / popular benchmarks**: The two datasets used in the paper (QReCC, TopicOCQA) are both quite old and not as popular as QuAC / CoQA in conversational QA. The paper would be much stronger with evaluation on recent multiturn LLM benchmarks like Scale's MultiChallenge (https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17399) which is more reflective of current LLM users. Similarly, the hopfield retriever should be evaluated on MTEB (https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb).\n\n3. **The method seems overly complicated, and I'm a bit confused by some design decisions**: There are several moving parts in the proposed algorithm, and many of these may not be needed with a stronger LLM backbone like GPT5. I was also not able to understand Section 3.3/3.4.2 and how it fits into Fig 1. Why is alignment detection needed between guessed answer and context? Can't all the results be directly fed into long context of the model to avoid a guesswork stage? The only reason I can see is L261: \"avoid unnecessary post-processing of retrieval and reduce the hallucinations.\", but I don't see modern LLMs which use thinking tokens making such errors. Similarly why is summarization of the snippeted needed in Section 3.4.1.\n\n4. **The paper is lacking in qualitative examples and analysis**: Currently, it's a bit hard to understand the exact types of problems the proposed methodology is tackling, and type of prompts the model gets better at using this system. The paper would be a lot stronger with a qualitative analysis of wins and losses between Conv-CoA and vanilla RAG baselines.\n\n5. Minor: I think the Hopfield network needs more justification. How does Hopfield compare to simpler methods like FAISS on dense embeddings which also save inference time? Why is retriever training time a bottleneck when it's <2 hrs?"}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses ^"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ClZLyJG1tT", "forum": "IrFXMNOK4f", "replyto": "IrFXMNOK4f", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8020/Reviewer_LcLE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8020/Reviewer_LcLE"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8020/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761798867395, "cdate": 1761798867395, "tmdate": 1762920021627, "mdate": 1762920021627, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}, "comment": {"value": "Dear AC, SAC, PC, and Reviewers,\n\nThank you all for taking the time to carefully review our manuscript.
