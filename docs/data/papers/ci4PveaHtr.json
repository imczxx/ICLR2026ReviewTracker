On the other hand, neural MTPPs models forego this interpretability in favor of absolute predictive performance. In this work, we present a new family MTPP models: the _hyper Hawkes process_ (HHP), which aims to be as flexible and performant as neural MTPPs, while retaining interpretable aspects. To achieve this, the HHP extends the classical Hawkes process to increase its expressivity by first expanding the dimension of the process into a latent space, and then introducing a hypernetwork to allow time and data dynamics. These extensions define a highly performant MTPP family, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmark tasks and metrics. Furthermore, by retaining the now-conditionally linear recurrence, the HHP also retains much of the structure of the original Hawkes process, which we exploit to create direct probes into _how_ the model creates predictions. HHP models therefore offer both state-of-the-art predictions, while also providing an opportunity to ``open the box'' and inspect how predictions were generated.", "tldr": "We present an efficient SotA neural MTPP that allows key event-level interpretability to be directly extracted.", "keywords": ["Marked temporal point processes", "interpretability", "probabilistic methods"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ff6f6c7df09b97a40918790b9655dac81dcd508c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/85b5691a29a8b6a57894c4394561c85f4a851f10.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces the Hyper Hawkes Process (HHP), a novel marked temporal point process model that combines the interpretability of classical Hawkes processes with the expressivity of neural MTPPs.
