Specifically, we consider a semi-random model where $n$ points from an unknown $k$-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ ($k \\ll d$) are perturbed by zero-mean $d$-dimensional Gaussian noise with variance $\\sigma^2$ on each coordinate. Without loss of generality, we may assume the nearest neighbor is at distance $1$ from the query, and that all other points are at distance at least $1+\\varepsilon$. We assume we are given only the noisy data and are required to find NN of the uncorrupted data. We prove the following results:\n\n1. For $\\sigma \\in O(1/k^{1/4})$, we show that simply performing SVD denoises the data; namely, we provably recover accurate NN of uncorrupted data (Theorem 1.1).\n2. For $\\sigma \\gg 1/k^{1/4}$, NN in uncorrupted data is not even {\\bf identifiable} from the noisy data in general. This is a matching lower bound on $\\sigma$ with the above result, demonstrating the necessity of this threshold for NNS (Lemma 3.1).\n3. For $\\sigma \\gg 1/\\sqrt k$, the noise magnitude ($\\sigma \\sqrt{d}$) is significantly exceeds the inter-point distances in the unperturbed data. Moreover, NN in noisy data is different from NN in the uncorrupted data in general.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nNote that (1) and (3) together imply SVD identifies correct NN in uncorrupted data even in a regime\nwhere it is different from NN in noisy data. This was not the case in existing literature (see e.g. (Abdullah et al., 2014)). Another comparison with (Abdullah et al., 2014) is that it requires $\\sigma$ to be at least an inverse polynomial in the ambient dimension $d$. The proof of (1) above uses upper bounds on perturbations of singular spaces of matrices as well as concentration and spherical symmetry of Gaussians. We thus give theoretical justification for the performance of spectral methods in practice. We also provide empirical results on real datasets to corroborate our findings.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["nearest neighbor", "planted models"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/20466bd8fec14cac659e1ec71fef4b89effe70ca.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) problem where data points, originating from an unknown $k$-dimensional subspace within a $d$-dimensional space ($k \\ll d$), are corrupted by Gaussian noise .

The primary contribution is a proof that this method successfully recovers the true nearest neighbor even when the noise variance $\\sigma$ is as large as $O(1/k^{1/4})$ .

The main strength is the substantial improvement over prior SOTA (e.g., Abdullah et al., 2014), which required the noise level $\\sigma$ to be bounded by an inverse polynomial in the *ambient* dimension $d$. This work's bound of $\\sigma = O(1/k^{1/4})$ depends only on the intrinsic dimension $k$, which is a major advancement for $k \\ll d$ scenarios .\n\nThe work extends our understanding of this problem and identifies critical thresholds for $\\sigma$ and providing both an algorithmic upper bound and a matching lower bound. This comprehensive analysis is a key strength. Another significant contribution is showing that the algorithm works even when the noise is large enough ($\\sigma \\gg 1/\\sqrt{k}$) to change the identity of the nearest neighbor in the observed data, a regime not handled by previous work.\n\nThe algorithm itself is simple and clearly explained.

The analysis appears to rely on standard matrix perturbation bounds (like Davis-Kahan and Wedin) and concentration inequalities. The authors do not clearly articulate what new analytical techniques or core technical innovation enables them to achieve the $O(1/k^{1/4})$ bound, which is the paper's central improvement. It is unclear if the novelty lies simply in the data-splitting algorithm design, which simplifies independence arguments.\n\nThis new bound comes at the cost of a dependency on $s_k(B)$, the $k$-th singular value of the unperturbed data matrix. Prior work did not require this assumption. While the authors argue in Section 2.3 that $s_k(B)/\\sqrt{n}$ is likely a non-zero constant for \"well-conditioned\" data, this is a significant trade-off, especially when data is approximately embedded in a subspace (which is one core motivation of the model considered in this paper); see the question below about overspecification. \n\nThe experimental comparison is made against a naive baseline, not against the (Abdullah et al., 2014) algorithm that serves as the main theoretical comparator. The authors state this was due to the implementation infeasibility of the prior work, but this omission makes it difficult to empirically assess the practical performance gain over the previous state-of-the-art.\n\nFinally, some typos and clarity suggestions\n* \"weel-known\" instead of \"well-known\".\n* In Section 3.1, the query point $\\tilde{q}$ is missing from the problem description (Line 062), which makes the notation for $q$ confusing."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  Could you please clarify the core technical novelty of your analysis? The data-splitting trick  simplifies the probabilistic argument, but is this the key element that allows you to break the dependency on the ambient dimension $d$ and achieve the $O(1/k^{1/4})$ bound? Or is there a new, non-standard bound or analytical step being used?\n\n2.  The discussion in Section 2.3 regarding the requirement to know $k$ is confusing . You state that using a \"larger dimensional SVD subspace projection\" (i.e., overspecifying $k$) \"may be of use if we want to work with weaker assumptions\" . This seems counter-intuitive. Your bounds in Theorem 1.1 depend on $s_k(B)$. If the true rank is $k$ and you use a $k' > k$, the $k'$-th singular value $s_{k'}(B)$ would be zero. This would make your noise bound infinitely restrictive, not weaker.
