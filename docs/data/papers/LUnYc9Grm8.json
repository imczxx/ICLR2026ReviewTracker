However, existing SNNs rely on fixed time steps for training and inference, which leads to buffering requirements and mismatches with neuromorphic hardware, thus neglecting the potential for early recognition using partial event streams. In neuromorphic computing, ideal dynamic visual perception should be event-driven, with models continuously updating states based on incoming events and producing results as soon as confidence criteria are met. To address this, we propose the Spiking Incremental Recognition Network (SIREN), an incremental inference architecture designed to approximate this ideal paradigm. During training, the model processes event streams in fixed steps, while at inference it processes event frames step by step, updating states continuously and making dynamic decisions. SIREN integrates multiple spiking neuron types and a Spiking State-Space Model (S-SSM) to capture multiscale temporal dependencies. It also combines Causal Time Self-Attention (CTSA) with early-exit strategies for efficient termination. We evaluate our approach on three Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in recognition tasks, including SL-Animals-DVS, DVS128-Gesture and the THU-EACT-50 subset, with accuracies of 93.33%, 97.92% and 100% respectively.

Although the authors introduced the proposed S-SSM, C-STSA, and the early exit mechanism, Figure 2 indicates that their method also uses SpatialFormer and TemporalFormer, which are not described. Additionally, the author refers to the proposed method as SIREN. What, then, is ChronoSpikFormer in Figure 2? There is also no textual description of its overall architecture.\n\n2. **High complexity**. The proposed S-SSM is significantly more complex than the commonly used LIF neuron, which makes the proposed method difficult to implement. Additionally, Equation (14) shows that C-STSA introduces real-valued multiplication operations that are incompatible with the spike-driven characteristics of SNNs. Therefore, the advantages of the proposed method are still only theoretical.\n\n3. **Insufficient experiments**. \n\n* The performance reported in this paper on the three datasets is nearly saturated.
