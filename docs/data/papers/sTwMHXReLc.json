Please provide more detailed motivation.\n\n- While the authors mention that the benchmark is similar to an “IQ-test” and doesn’t directly have relevance in terms of task utility, it would be valuable to include a few tasks that are more meaningful or demonstrate that performance on these tasks is correlated with performance on more meaningful tasks so that practitioners are more motivated to use the benchmark.\n\n- Responding to out-of-distribution prompts or instructions is not always desirable and can raise concerns of safety and model alignment. It would be good for the paper to discuss this concern and describe a way to balance the need for model alignment (e.g. not responding to toxic or harmful queries) and model flexibility (responding in OOD formats). How can we measure that a model strikes this balance?\n\n- section 2.5: Please clarify how the 88% and 98% accuracy is computed? and on what dataset and sample size?\n\n- section 2.5: Using LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation on the benchmark is useful, but getting human annotations on a subset of tasks/questions would make these results stronger.\n\n- section 3.1: Overall these findings are not too surprising or insightful. It is intuitive that thinking models or larger models would tend to perform better with OOD formats. It is a bit surprising that instruction-tuned models tend to perform worse as this stage should make the model more prompt or formatting agnostic. Including a discussion / analysis on why this is + results on a base model and its corresponding instruction tuned version would be helpful.\n\n- section 3.2.1: Some more analysis on why thinking improves performance on the benchmark would be valuable. \n\n- section 3.2.2: This comparison of performance across instruction types also feels cursory.

The paper’s emphasis on Large Language Models (LLMs)’ ability to comply with adversarial instructions that conflict with training inertia fills the gap in the existing LLM evaluation landscape regarding the \"unconventional instruction-following\" dimension. It further complements instruction-following benchmarks of the IFEval category, and to some extent, provides a `lower bound' for instruction-following capability assessment. Additionally, several experimental findings are particularly insightful: for instance, instruction-finetuned models exhibit a decline in long-tail instruction-following capability, which can be attributed to their overfitting to the paradigms of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Even though the paper provides a critical extension to instruction following evaluation, there are some aspects that I think the paper can further improve on. \n\nFirstly, the relevance between the benchmark’s tasks and real-world scenarios requires enhancement. Some counterintuitive instructions designed in the work are overly extreme and not aligned with actual user long-tail needs (e.g., deliberately generating texts with a fixed number of typos), which may lead to a discrepancy where models performing well on the benchmark still struggle to address practical unconventional requirements.\n\nThen, the analysis of the root causes of models’ cognitive inertia is insufficient. The paper only observes surface phenomena—such as the underperformance of fine-tuned models and the superiority of thinking models—but fails to delve into how core factors (e.g., supervised fine-tuning data scale, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) feedback types, or model architectural characteristics) shape cognitive inertia, making it difficult to fundamentally explain the mechanisms behind the observed performance differences.\n\nThirdly, the error analysis could be improved with in-depth analysis. While the paper presents isolated error cases of several representative models (e.g., Claude-4-Opus, Doubao-1.6-Thinking), it does not summarize common error patterns across different instruction types or explore cross-linguistic error regularities, limiting the insights into models’ systematic weaknesses in counterintuitive instruction-following.\n\nAdditionally, if the pos training phase integrates counterintuitive instruction training into their development pipelines, would the current 8 task types in Inverse IFEval lose their ability to effectively discriminate model capabilities?
