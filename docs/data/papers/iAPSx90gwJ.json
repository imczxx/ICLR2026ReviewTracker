It claims three main contributions: (i) existence proofs that transformers can implement (via in context learning -ICL-) least-squares AR regression on univariate series and—via MOIRAI’s “any-variate” mechanism—extend to multivariate AR with an arbitrary number of covariates; (ii) generalization bounds for pretraining under Dobrushin’s condition, yielding error decaying on the order of (1/$\\sqrt{nT}$); and (iii) experiments (synthetic + some real-world) showing prediction error decreases with longer lookbacks, consistent with the theory.

The paper gives a fresh, concrete theory for TS transformers by showing a transformer can do least-squares AR via in-context gradient descent and by explaining how MOIRAI’s any-variate attention builds per-variate lag histories to support multivariate AR, extending prior ICL views to time series with unknown lags. MOIRAI is a perfect paper in my view, and I am happy that a team is working on it. The technical core is strong, and the theory is then stress-tested on real data. The paper also defines the attention variants and the MOIRAI transformer cleanly and keeps the flow from setup easy to follow. Finally, the authors unify why MOIRAI-style FMs work in forecasting, give a generalization story for non-IID series, and show practical gains over tuned AR baselines on ETTh1/ETTm1, so the results matter both for theory and for building stronger pretrained TS models."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "While I really enjoyed reading the methodology and approaches that the authors followed, I'd like to raise some weaknesses that came to my mind, and I'm looking forward to a nice discussion on these with the authors. \n\n(1) From my understanding, the theory and constructions use a ReLU-based attention, and not softmax, so I'm curious to know if the authors are willing to either extend the proofs or add tests showing the key claims still hold with softmax MOIRAI. \n\n(2) Another point is that the pretraining bounds hinge on Dobrushin's condition, so I was wondering if the authors could report a practical check for this on ETTh1/ETTm1 or at least share their thoughts on it.\n\n(3) Additionally, I found the real-data study a bit narrow because only ETTh1/ETTm1 and comparisons only to AT models were discussed, so maybe adding another domain and strong time series foundation model baselines would make the empirical case much stronger. Do the authors have any thoughts on it?

How should we expect the model to behave when test-time d or q exceed these limits, and can we anticipate meaningful degradation vs sharp failure from the construction? Would be good to know the answer to it\n\n(2) Any-variate attention uses a block matrix U with fixed block size T, so I was wondering how the framework handles irregular sampling or missing timestamps across covariates where a clean block structure does not exist and what time encoding is implied in that case? \n\nThanks again for your hard work."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "N4OP8DTsy3", "forum": "iAPSx90gwJ", "replyto": "iAPSx90gwJ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20122/Reviewer_Fmb5"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20122/Reviewer_Fmb5"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20122/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761963986560, "cdate": 1761963986560, "tmdate": 1762933017861, "mdate": 1762933017861, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper provides a theoretical analysis of how transformers can perform well for time series forecasting, focusing particularly on the set of time series modeled by AR processes.

I can follow the paper, but there are quite a few typos here and there, and even in the title “Time Seires” should be “Time Series”,\n- I think the following description of iTransformer might be a bit misleading: “iTransformer (Liu et al., 2023) propose to use a pooling technique to reshape arbitrary number of covariates into a unified size.”\n- Line 298-299: “.” instead of “,”. For each time series, we encode it with any-variate encoding into an input matrix denoted asH ∈ RD×N , 1 We define each pretraining sample as zj := (Hj , yj ), where yj = x1T j . \n- This seems to be an overstatement. I believe there are other transformer models, or TSFMs that can handle an arbitrary number of covariates. “Note that in the multi-variate case, we only focus on MOIRAI as it is the only transformer-based model that is compatible with arbitrary number of covariates.”\n- Move Figure 1 closer to the experiment section.\n- Line 143, w* = (w1, ..., wj ) \\in R^{qd} should be  (w1, ..., wd )?\n2. The proof on approximating any AR model with a transformer seems to be a straightforward application of the proof in Bai et al., as the main difference is the construction of the feature and label pairs.

I don’t think the setting in Appendix F6 EVALUATION ON REAL-WORLD DATASETS is appropriate. The window size seems to be too small for ETTm1 and ETTh1 to cover a whole period of time series. This might be the reason that MSE increases along with window size in Figure 3 left, which is counter-intuitive.\n2. Line 80: \"We impose periodic boundary conditions for the negative index, i.e., x−1 = xT.\" Why do we need this? It seems unconventional.\n3. A recent paper \"Why Do Transformers Fail to Forecast Time Series In-Context?\" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09776) argues that a simple linear model has direct access to the full history of the time series, while an LSA-based model must compress this entire history into the fixed-dimensions in the Q/K/V matrices. Based on this observation, they show that for any AR(p) process, an optimally parameterized LSA model cannot achieve a lower expected MSE than the classical optimal linear predictor. Can you compare your analysis with theirs, and share your thoughts on why your findings are different?\n4. Section 4 is a bit difficult to follow.
