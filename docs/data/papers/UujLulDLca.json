We are encouraged that they recognized the merits of our work. Reviewers highlighted the strength of our method, noting its \"**strong performance**\" [huDo], \"**robustness**\" [huDo], and that SAINT \"**takes an important step**\" toward principled reasoning in combinatorial action spaces [yLKc]. They further emphasized that our evaluation is \"**thorough and convincing**\" [yLKc], \"**extensive and compelling**\" [yLKc], and that our approach \"**consistently outperforms baselines on diverse tasks**\" [yLKc]. We also appreciate the remarks on the presentation quality, noting \"**outstanding clarity, making the problem, prior work, and the proposed method very easy to understand**\" [vT94]. Finally, reviewers noted that we \"**correctly identify a key limitation of existing approaches**\" [vT94] and that our use of a permutation-equivariant architecture is an \"**elegant and principled**\" way to model sub-action interactions [vT94].\n\nReviewers raised several important points, which we address comprehensively in our point-by-point responses. In this general remark, we summarize the new experiments and clarifications included in the revised manuscript.\n\nBased on the reviewers' feedback, we conducted a **new set of experiments** and made **additional clarifications** to:\n\n* **Precisely delineate the scope of SAINT's inductive bias**, clarifying when permutation-equivariant structure is appropriate.\n* **Evaluate SAINT in high-dimensional, non-symmetric control domains**, adding new results on discretized variants of the `humanoid` and `dog` environments.\n* **Demonstrate SAINT's applicability in offline RL**, by integrating SAINT into standard offline algorithms on the discretized DM Control `medium-expert` benchmark.\n\nThese additions further strengthen our confidence in SAINT's effectiveness.\n\nWe revised the manuscript to address the main themes raised by the reviewers:\n\n* We clarify that SAINT's core contribution is a principled framework for learning representations over unordered sets of interacting sub-actions, and explain how permutation-equivariance over indices —rather than semantics — applies when sub-action indexing is arbitrary or only weakly meaningful [huDo, yLKc, vT94].\n* We provide substantial new results demonstrating SAINT's generality and robustness: our offline RL experiments on complex, high-dimensional control tasks directly address requests for broader empirical validation and show that SAINT is effective across a broad range of settings. [yLKc, vT94].\n* We clarify the computational characteristics of SAINT's architecture, emphasizing that embedding width is independent of action-space size, FiLM does not increase dimensionality or add attention projections, and SAINT naturally supports dynamic sub-action sets and standard offline RL methods [huDo, yLKc].\n\n### Notes to reviewers\n\nPlease note that we use W# to address weaknesses and Q# to address questions in our point-by-point responses. All line numbers refer to the updated manuscript submitted with the rebuttal.\n\nWe again thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback.
