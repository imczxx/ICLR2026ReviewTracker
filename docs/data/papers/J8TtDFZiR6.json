Existing constraint-based methods often rely heavily on conditional independence tests that degrade for limited data samples and complex distributions, while score-based methods impose strong statistical assumptions. Recent methods address special cases such as change point detection or distribution shifts, but struggle to provide a unified solution. We propose the Transformer Integrated Temporal Causal Discovery (TTCD) Framework, a novel end-to-end approach that learns contemporaneous and lagged causal relations from non-stationary time series. TTCD introduces a Non-Stationary Feature Learner integrating temporal and frequency-domain attention with dynamic non-stationarity profiling, and a custom Causal Structure Learner. A key innovation is reconstruction-guided causal signal distillation, to distill essential causal signals through the reconstruction process of the transformer decoder, which mitigates noise and spurious correlations while preserving meaningful dependencies. The Causal Structure Learner operates on distilled reconstructed signals to infer the underlying causal graph without restrictive assumptions on noise distributions or data generation processes. Experiments on synthetic, benchmark, and real world datasets show that TTCD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and consistency with domain knowledge, demonstrating the approach’s effectiveness for causal discovery in challenging real world contexts.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Causal Learning", "Causal Discovery", "Time-Series", "Non-Stationary Transformer"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/aaa6da69292487b8dfca7adf581bf4b61d26402c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a novel architecture for causal discovery from nonstationary time series data.

Insufficient and Unclear Empirical Evaluation (Major Weakness):**\n\nIn the absence of theoretical support, the burden falls on the empirical evaluation to be exceptionally thorough and convincing.\nHowever, the empirical evaluation is the most critical weakness of the paper and is not currently at the standard required for ICLR.  \n\n*   **Lack of Reproducibility and Detail:** The methodology for hyperparameter selection is opaque. The authors state that baseline hyperparameters were \"carefully selected,\" which is insufficient. Neither the process for this selection nor the search space is described. Critically, there is no information provided on how hyperparameters for the proposed model were chosen (e.g., Number of Layers, Optimizer, and encoding dimensions), which prevents reproducibility and fair comparison.\n*   **Limited Scale and Scope:** The evaluation is conducted on only five individual time series. This is too limited a sample to draw generalizable conclusions about the method's effectiveness, as it does not allow for robust performance metrics and standard deviations. Especially for synthetic data, the reason to evaluate on only 2 SCMs is unclear.\n*   **Training stability:**  How stable is the proposed approach across training runs? The reported results appear mixed, with the proposed method sometimes performing strikingly better and other times not. Is this consistent between runs?\n*   **Ambiguous Ground Truth:** For the real-world datasets (Arctic sea ice, fMRI), the ground truth causal relationships are not specified or justified. This makes it impossible for a reader to independently assess the correctness of the discovered graphs.\n*   **Missed Opportunity for Standardized Benchmarking:** The authors are encouraged to consider evaluating their method on recent established public benchmarks for causal discovery from time series [1, 2, 3]. This would enable a more rigorous, standardized, and directly comparable evaluation against a wider range of methods and allow for proper quantification of robustness.\n\n**2. Architectural Ambiguity and Lack of Clarity:**\n\nSeveral key aspects of the proposed architecture and its motivation are not clearly explained.\n\n*   **Vague Figures:** Figure 1, which depicts the architecture, is ambiguous and underutilized. The specific function of the \"Decoder layers\" is not labeled and can only be inferred from the text. Given the white space, these components could be further annotated.\n\n*   **Unexplained Design Choices:** Key design choices lack justification. For instance:\n    *   How are the three separate input paths to the decoder combined or processed?\n    *   What is the motivation for using two distinct loss terms related to the predicted `X` at different stages of the model? A clear ablation study or theoretical justification for this design is needed.\n    *   Basic architectural details, such as the number of layers deployed in each component, are missing.\n\n**3. Presentation and Formatting Issues:**\n\nThe manuscript suffers from several formatting and presentation issues that detract from its professionalism and readability.\n\n*   **Typesetting:** The tables frequently overflow the page margins, both vertically and horizontally. Figure 1 appears to have excessive white space that could be used more effectively.\n*   **Missing Citations:** Key claims or statements (e.g., in Line 96 and Line 125) lack necessary citations to support them.\n*   **Broken References:** A reference on Page 2 breaks to page 3. \n*   **Lack of Precision:** The core assumptions of the model (e.g., \"The general assumption\") should be stated with greater mathematical precision."}, "questions": {"value": "Some Questions that could be discussed:\n\n1.

In the beginning of the paper, it states that the paper proposed a causal discovery method \"without any noise or data distribution assumptions\". While appreciating the ambition, could you provide more demonstration on how the proposed methods unify or relax the assumptions for identifiability? For example, consider the following time series: $$X_t \\mid Y_t=y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(y,1) \\quad Y_t \\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$ with the true causal graph $Y_t \\rightarrow X_t$.  This toy example satisfies the assumptions listed in section 3, however, to the best of my knowledge, it is not identifiable. Therefore, some inherent assumptions, perhaps about the non-stationarity, are missing in the current manuscript. \n- The hyper-parameter specification may be complex. The number of parameters can be significantly large when stacking more layers in the decoder and encoder. It would be much better to provide an ablations on the layers, kernel size, etc..\n- Some minor concerns on baselines. \n\t- For synthetic dataset 1, it can be seen as applying (soft) interventions on $X^2_t$ and $X^4_t$.  For synthetic dataset 2, it can be seen as applying (soft) interventions on $X^1_t$. Therefore, setting $E=1$ may not be suitable for the LIN method.\n\t- For time-lag methods, they inherently employ a prior between variables. For example, $X_t \\rightarrow X_{t-1}$ is impossible.

Although the paper discusses identifiability of the causal graph, the discussion does not align with the proposed model. There is a gap between the IFMOC framework (Peters et al., 2011; 2013) and what is assumed here. Specifically, the main paper does not state that its applicability is restricted to additive-noise models, and it does not apply assumptions on the data-generating process and on the noise distribution. In Definition 1, it does not require independence between the noise term and the variables, nor i.i.d. noise. A further concern is nonstationarity: Peters et al. (2013) note that some results require stationarity and/or α-mixing or geometric ergodicity (see, e.g., Chu and Glymour, 2008).\n\n2. The novelty of each module is unclear.
