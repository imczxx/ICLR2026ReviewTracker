Mobile graphic user interface (GUI) agents, designed to perform tasks on mobile devices, represent a promising application of this technology. However, a significant gap persists in mobile GUI agent evaluation, where existing benchmarks predominantly rely on either static frame assessments such as AndroidControl or offline static apps such as AndroidWorld and thus fail to capture agent performance in dynamic, real-world online mobile applications. To address this gap, we present Android Agent Arena (A3), a novel evaluation system for mobile GUI agents. Unlike existing dynamic evaluation systems, A3 introduces a benchmark of 100 tasks derived from 20 widely-used, online apps across 20 distinct categories from the Google Play Store, ensuring evaluation comprehension. A3 also presents a novel \"essential-state\" based evaluation method that leverages MLLMs (either commercial or open-source models) as reward models to progressively verify task completion and process achievement. This automated evaluation approach significantly reduces the reliance on manual labor and coding expertise compared with traditional evaluation methods such as in AndroidWorld. Furthermore, A3 includes a toolkit and an evaluator to streamline Android device interaction and facilitate data collection from both human and agent demonstrations. The complete A3 system, including the benchmark and pipeline, will be publicly released to provide a robust foundation for future research and development in mobile GUI agents.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["mobile GUI agent", "benchmark", "reward model"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4ddf5464dbe7b8c0e55c86dba5ff026f62448cc6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces **Android Agent Arena (A3)** — a new benchmark and evaluation framework for **mobile GUI agents**.

Even though *AndroidWorld* uses what the authors describe as a “static” evaluation approach, its **rule-based validation produces convincing and reproducible results** that reliably reflect model capability. For example, *UI-Venus* achieves **49%[1]**, *GUI-Owl* **66.4%**[2]**,** and *UI-TARS-1.5* **64.2% [3]** on AndroidWorld — a ranking that aligns well with their expected strengths. However, in this paper, the relative order of these models changes dramatically. This discrepancy **casts serious doubt on the credibility and validity of A3’s evaluation methodology**, suggesting that its MLLM-based judging process may not correlate with genuine agent competence\n    \n3. **No human validation:**\n    \n    The claim that A3RM is “human-aligned” is unsubstantiated without **comparison with human evaluators.** Since A3RM is fine-tuned partially using Gemini’s evaluations, comparing A3RM against Gemini and finding alignment could simply indicate **self-consistency**, not real-world validity. \n    \n4. **Speculative analysis without ablation:**\n    \n    The statement that “the capabilities of the base model appear to be a dominant factor” is **not experimentally verified**.

Evaluation system: The authors present a novel mechanism to evaluate agents in dynamic, online applications. The introduced evaluation method has two features: incorporation of critical states, use of MLLM, which I believe is highly beneficial in many cases. By using critical states, the users/agents can get more fine-grained signals upon success. Also, using MLLM allows the evaluation design to be scalable without necessitating human experts.\n2. Comprehensive results: Results across diverse agents are presented, which potentially provide a meaningful reference point for future work."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Above all, while this work presents noticeable strengths, the main weakness lies in the ambiguity of the contribution compared to existing work. I list specific weaknesses/questions/suggestions regarding this work.\n1. Motivation: While the authors emphasize that this work allows evaluation of the online apps, the reason behind why we need to evaluate online apps is not presented thoroughly. I am not fully convinced whether such a feature is highly demanded by the community. Gemini-2.5-pro, achieving around 55 task success rates, also reveals that this benchmark does not provide enough headroom for improvements. More elaboration on what the users can benefit from by evaluating this benchmark (as well as online apps) should be provided.\n2. Specification of essential state: The detailed explanations of the process for defining essential states for each task are missing. What criteria are used to define the number and content of essential states for each task?\n3. Use of essential-states for RL: While it is out of scope as a benchmark, as it is currently illustrated, the dense signal of essential-state evaluation can be useful for RL. I do think that investigating AR3M to RL and comparing with existing reward mechanisms can be a valuable study for the community, as adopting RL for GUI agents is gaining interest [1,2].\n4. More analysis on the agents' behaviors: Although the authors present analysis of the agents' behavior in Appendix 5.2, the observations are already known to the community (very similar observations are already present in the work presented in the related work; for example, the lack of ability to accurately ground the intended action is widely studied [3,4]). As a reader, I want to know more about failure modes strongly correlated to the focus of this paper (e.g., the dynamic nature of online apps).\n\n---\n\nReferences\n\n[1] “Digi-q: Learning q-value functions for training device-control agents.”\n\n[2] “UI-TARS: Pioneering Automated GUI Interaction with Native Agents”\n\n[3] “GPT-4V(ision) is a Generalist Web Agent, if Grounded”\n\n[4] “GUI-Bee: Align GUI Action Grounding to Novel Environments via Autonomous Exploration”"}, "questions": {"value": "(Questions/suggestions are included in the above section)"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "vs3vmmXv64", "forum": "zE2tVigoub", "replyto": "zE2tVigoub", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8635/Reviewer_sVzZ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8635/Reviewer_sVzZ"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8635/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761964599874, "cdate": 1761964599874, "tmdate": 1762920462566, "mdate": 1762920462566, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new benchmark and evaluation framework for testing mobile GUI agents in realistic, dynamic environments.

To make such apps evaluable, the authors introduce an essential-state evaluation: each task is decomposed into several key milestones (e.g. “search X”, “open first item”, “answer author”), and a MLLM-based judge (Gemini or a distilled model A3RM) checks, via a sliding window over the trajectory, whether each essential state has been achieved.

Despite improvements, A3RM still has ~10% error rate (89.9% F1). The paper documents persistent failure modes (visual hallucination, semantic misinterpretation) but doesn't adequately address whether this error rate is acceptable for benchmark validity. More critically, there's no analysis of whether these errors systematically favor certain agents.\n\n2. Essential states are manually created without inter-annotator agreement metrics or user studies validating that they appropriately decompose tasks. The claim that they provide \"uniform granularity\" lacks empirical support.\n\n3. The paper claims A3 is superior to SPA-bench because A3 allows for \"reliable and programmatic resets\" while SPA-bench suffers from \"severe environmental instability and difficult resets\". This is a critical claim, as SPA-bench also uses online apps. However, this claim is never substantiated. The paper provides no details on its \"programmatic reset\" mechanism for dynamic apps nor any direct comparison to prove A3 is more stable. Without this, A3's novelty over SPA-bench is unclear.\n\n4. The entire framework hinges on the quality of the manually defined \"essential-states\". The process for defining these is opaque. The paper states they were created to have \"uniform granularity\", but this seems subjective. The work would be much stronger if it detailed the rubric or principles for defining these states and how consistency was maintained across 100 tasks.\n\n5. While API costs are mentioned, there's no full cost-benefit analysis comparing manual evaluation, function-based evaluation, and MLLM-based evaluation across dimensions like accuracy, development time, and maintenance burden.\n\n6.
