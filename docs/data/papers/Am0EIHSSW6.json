A finite state machine (FSM) governs behavior switching, enabling agents to adapt to local congestion and blockages. The system integrates centralized evolution strategies to optimize reflex parameters and role assignments. Experiments on grid-based maps demonstrate enhanced scalability, real-time performance, and reduced collision rates compared to baseline reactive and learning-based methods.

Using an FSM alone is unlikely to achieve competitive results. Still, outperforming PRIMAL on some maps is commendable.\n\nW2: The related work section lacks coverage of existing baselines. I recommend consulting the recent review on ML for MAPF [1] and the POGEMA benchmark [2]. Similar to centralized approaches, there are many strong baselines (e.g., LaCAM* [3], LNS2+RL [4]), along with high-speed decentralized non-learnable solvers (e.g., PIBT [5]).\n\nW3: Likewise, the paper omits comparisons with many modern decentralized learnable approaches. I recommend considering baselines discussed in the recent MAPF-GPT paper [6]. A comparison with PIBT would also be highly valuable. Comparing only with discrete ORCA, CBS, and PRIMAL is not sufficient.\n\nW4: The paper does not provide any code and omits the reproducibility checklist. Anyone attempting to reproduce the results would face significant difficulties.\n\nW5: The experimental results are hard to follow. Both the scenarios and algorithms are abbreviated (e.g., PR for PRIMAL, WM for Warehouse Map). I suggest that the authors include full names or at least move the abbreviations’ explanations to the table descriptions.\n\nW6: I found no solid support for the claim that the approach can operate in real time, as stated several times in the paper. I’m not sure whether subsection 5.4 (Scalability Test) fully addresses this question. Moreover, for modern learnable approaches, handling hundreds of agents in a single map is common, so evaluating only up to 200 agents seems insufficient.\n\n[1] Alkazzi JM, Okumura K.

The bio-inspired framing of multi-agent pathfinding through neural reflexes and FSM-based behavior modulation is creative. While reflex-based local control has precedents in robotics, integrating it with CMA-ES parameter search and distributed role-switching for MAPF is novel. The idea of combining biological realism with evolutionary tuning for decentralized scalability is particularly fresh and well-motivated.\n\nQuality is good. The paper is technically coherent, clearly describing the components—vector fields, FSM, and CMA-ES optimization. Experiments are extensive: multiple maps, baselines (CBS, ORCA, PRIMAL), ablation analysis, scalability up to 200 agents, and robustness tests under noise. Results consistently show superior performance across metrics such as success rate, conflicts, idle steps, and backtracking, which supports the claimed advantages. However, there is no statistical significance analysis (no variance/error bars), runtime comparisons focus on planning time but not total computation or scalability trends beyond 200 agents, and there is no real-world validation (simulation only). Still, the methodology is sound and well-executed for a conference paper.\n\nClarity is above average. The paper is logically structured, with clear sectioning and consistent mathematical notation, and its figures—including the FSM diagram and heatmaps—effectively illustrate key ideas. Nonetheless, there are areas for improvement: figure quality could be enhanced (particularly in resolution and labeling); furthermore, summarizing the FSM transition rules and role-switching heuristics in pseudocode would boost clarity; and while the acronym \"BINR-MAPF\" is somewhat cumbersome, maintaining consistent use of it would improve overall readability.\n\nSignificance is high. The problem—scalable decentralized MAPF under communication constraints—is timely and relevant to swarm robotics and distributed AI. The presented method offers a lightweight alternative to learning-heavy or communication-heavy approaches.\nIts robustness, simplicity, and generalization without retraining make it attractive for real-world deployments (e.g., warehouse robots, UAV swarms).
