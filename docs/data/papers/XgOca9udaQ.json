We argue that building robust agents requires the rigor of control engineering, rather than relying on empirical prompt engineering. Drawing inspiration from predictive control in vessel maneuvering, we reframe agent design as a formal control systems problem. We first establish a baseline Multi-Agent System (MAS) where a Guard Agent acts as a simple reactive feedback controller, correcting a primary Execution Agent's errors after they occur. However, this reactive approach is fundamentally limited. Our core contribution, termed Profile-Aware Maneuvering, elevates this to a predictive control architecture. Through an automated offline 'System Identification' process, we generate an explicit, text-based 'performance fingerprint' modeling the Execution Agent's characteristic failure modes. Armed with this fingerprint, the Guard Agent evolves from a reactive critic into a predictive controller. It implements a feed-forward strategy to preemptively counteract errors before they derail the reasoning process. Experiments across a spectrum of benchmarks, including GAIA, HLE, and GPQA Diamond, validate our approach. The final Profile-Aware MAS demonstrates the hallmarks of a well-controlled system: it dramatically reduces performance variance while simultaneously boosting accuracy, and it minimizes the gap between its potential and single-pass performance. This superior performance and stability culminated in our system achieving a score of over 81 on the GAIA leaderboard. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift: from the empirical art of prompt engineering to the principled science of control theory for designing predictable and trustworthy intelligent agents.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Dynamic Multi-Agent System", "Runtime", "Stability", "Maneuvering", "System Identification"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/13858d30787984c7d30e72a688fb73749325ae52.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a control theoretic framework for building robust multi agent systems.

The paper would benefit from bounds that reflect the mismatch between the learned fingerprint and the true plant, along with conditions under which feed forward control can degrade performance.\n    - Minor: The quotation marks are not typeset correctly.
