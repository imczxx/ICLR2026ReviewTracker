Additionally, the inaccurate camera pose will also exacerbate these issues. Therefore, we present a novel geometric enhancement framework for 3DGS including geometric regularization and multi-view consistency enforcement to fundamentally address these limitations. Specifically, our approach is composed of three key components: Side-view Inconsistency Filtering (SIF) at initialization, Local Depth Regularization (LDR), and Anisotropy-aware Shape Regularization (ASR) at training. The SIF module mainly leverages multi-view information to eliminate geometrically inconsistent points, which aims to reduce floating artifacts and improve surface coherence. LDR enforces spatial consistency by identifying and penalizing regions with high geometric uncertainty through patch-based depth correlation analysis. By controlling the opacity and scale ratio, ASR can constrain Gaussian primitives to geometrically plausible shapes, preventing degenerate elongated structures. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our geometric enhancement when compared to pose-free methods and even pose-known baselines.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Geometric Enhancement", "3DGS", "Sparse-view Scene Reconstruction"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2ceed93ffc325a2f3601543378d8e3245e676a28.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/da308aeaeee165ef9e25e671bb0d9b328dee82b3.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses pose-free sparse-view 3D reconstruction with Gaussian splatting, where the lack of camera poses and limited views cause floating artifacts, missing surfaces, and shape degeneracy.

The authors identify key limitations in existing pose-free 3DGS pipelines such as geometric inconsistency, floating artifacts, and degenerate Gaussian shapes, and propose three complementary modules to address these issues: 1) Side-view Inconsistency Filtering (SIF) — a preprocessing step that removes geometrically inconsistent points via cross-view depth comparison. 2) Local Depth Regularization (LDR) — a training-time regularization that enhances local geometric coherence by penalizing regions with low depth correlation. 3) Anisotropy-aware Shape Regularization (ASR) — a geometric prior linking Gaussian opacity and shape anisotropy to prevent elongated, implausible primitives. Extensive experiments on Tanks and Temples and MVImgNet demonstrate that GEGS outperforms the pose-free baseline InstantSplat, and in some cases achieves comparable or superior results to pose-known methods such as COLMAP+3DGS and FSGS.

Each of the three modules (SIF, LDR, ASR) builds upon well-established ideas: multi-view geometric filtering, local depth correlation, and anisotropy regularization.  While the combination is practical and empirically beneficial, the individual techniques are incremental rather than fundamentally new.\n2. The idea of ASR lacks detailed theoretical justification. The motivation behind coupling opacity and anisotropy in ASR is intuitive but lacks rigorous analysis. The choice of sigmoid weighting and hyperparameter settings (e.g., τ, T) appears empirical, with little discussion of their geometric interpretation or stability.\n3. The evaluation scope is narrow. Although the paper presents results on two datasets, both are relatively standard for 3DGS evaluation. Additional experiments on real-world uncalibrated datasets (e.g., LLFF or ScanNet subsets) could better validate pose-free robustness.\n4. While Table 3 shows that combining all modules yields the best results, the analysis does not clarify why LDR contributes more than ASR or whether SIF occasionally discards useful geometry. Quantitative evidence on how each component alters point density or Gaussian stability would strengthen the claims.\n5. The method adds several regularization terms and filtering steps. However, no runtime, memory, or convergence analysis is provided to demonstrate that the geometric enhancements do not significantly slow down optimization compared to InstantSplat."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Role of SIF in initialization: The paper claims that SIF removes geometrically inconsistent points, but how is δ = 0.1 chosen? Could overly aggressive filtering remove correct but occluded structures? A quantitative measure of remaining point density before and after SIF would help.\n2. Since LDR depends on monocular depth priors (Depth Anything V2), how sensitive is the method to inaccurate depth estimation? Have the authors tried training without any external depth predictor to evaluate robustness?\n3. The opacity–anisotropy coupling seems heuristic. Could you provide visualizations of how αi evolves for Gaussians with high anisotropy ratio during training? Does this penalty risk over-smoothing fine details?\n4.
