However, these rely on large-scale paired noisy–clean datasets, which limits their practical deployment in clinical settings where clean references are rarely available. Self-supervised methods mitigate this issue but typically depend on multi-volume data or temporal consistency, making them unsuitable for single 3D volume data like magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). \nWe propose a novel self-supervised denoising framework for single noisy volume that leverages spatial coherence across adjacent slices to construct training pairs without clean labels or repeated scans. At its core is a conditional denoising diffusion model with expectation-only sampling, enabling robust signal recovery. To further enhance anatomical fidelity, we introduce a patch-wise adaptive post-processing module that refines spatially localized features to better preserve anatomical accuracy. Validated on 7T and 3T time-of-flight MRA datasets, our method significantly improves vessel visibility while suppressing noise, offering a clinically practical denoising approach tailored to real-world imaging workflows.", "tldr": "We propose a self-supervised diffusion-based denoising framework for single 3D MRA volumes that enhances anatomical structures without requiring clean labels or multi-view data.", "keywords": ["Denoising", "Self-Supervised Learning", "Diffusion Models", "MR Angiography"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/41f340ebd24f84c2eadc54e16c533057213e2680.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e8ba5ce7aa7f2825d373c28b80ca98fdd084fe29.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Di-Flow, a self-supervised denoising framework tailored for single-volume magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).\nUnlike existing approaches that require clean–noisy pairs or multiple acquisitions, Di-Flow exploits intra-volume structural coherence across adjacent slices to construct pseudo-training pairs.\n\nThe model integrates three main components:\n\n- Multi-Slice Averaging (MSA), which builds pseudo clean/noisy pairs from neighboring slices, enabling self-supervised training.\n\n- Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model (CDDM), a two-branch diffusion framework that uses contextual priors during denoising.\n\n- Patch-wise Adaptive Post-processing (PAP), a heuristic patch-level correction for residual artifacts.\n\nThe method is evaluated on 7T and 3T TOF-MRA datasets, showing quantitative and qualitative improvements over supervised, self-supervised, and diffusion-based baselines."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The paper addresses a real clinical bottleneck: lack of clean labels or repeated acquisitions for supervised denoising.

The so-called “patch-wise adaptive post-processing” is essentially a soft-thresholding operation, which raises questions about novelty and necessity. The need for this correction suggests the diffusion model may be missing a residual skip connection or is miscalibrated in intensity. The authors should verify whether the residual output has zero mean, as this could eliminate the need for manual intensity correction. Importantly, this step is crucial yet not properly ablated. A quantitative table showing results with vs. without PAP for all studied methods would be essential to assess its impact. Improving these ablations would strongly clarify the contribution, and I'd gladly increase my score when this point is clarified.\n2. More generally, the ablation studies are insufficient. Showing a few visual samples cannot substitute for numerical analysis. The authors should provide quantitative metrics (even relative ones) to support their design choices. \n3. Reference-free image quality metric is a rich and vast research domain, but the metrics chosen by the authors are unknown to the community. The authors should at least add other another metric (e.g. NIQE or MUSIQ).\n\nMinor concerns:\n1. Equation (4) is presented without sufficient context or justification. The proposed “expectation-only sampling” is reminiscent of deterministic diffusion or flow-matching approaches, yet the connection is never discussed. The authors should explain how their formulation relates to recent methods, and whether similar non-stochastic sampling schemes have been proposed before.\n2. Line 192: I think that the interpretation of $\\alpha$ and $1-\\alpha$ is inverted: $1-\\alpha$ controls the cumulative noise strength, meaning that larger $\\alpha$, corresponds to less noise (and not the opposite).\n3. Section 3.2.2 (misnamed “J-invariant”) does not clearly justify the use of the J-invariance principle. Conceptually, J-invariance is less about enforcing an optimal predictor and more about constructing IID noisy samples of the same image to mimic a noise2noise setting. The current justification in appendix is not satisfying and could be removed without removing interest to the paper. Lastly as currently written, section 3.2.2 could be merged into the main text; it does not warrant a separate heading."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
