This morphology can be regarded as an $SE(3)$-invariant, denoised volumetric representation of subvolumes extracted from tomograms. Inferring morphology is therefore an inverse problem of estimating both a template morphology and its SE(3) transformation. Existing maximum likelihood–based solution to this problem often miss rare but important morphologies and require extensive manual hyperparameter tuning. Addressing this issue, we present a disentangled deep representation learning framework that separates SE(3) transformations from morphological content in the representation space. The framework includes a novel multi-choice learning module that enables this disentanglement for highly noisy cryo-ET data, and the learned morphological content is used to generate template morphologies. Experiments on simulated and real cryo-ET datasets demonstrate clear improvements over prior methods, including the discovery of previously unidentified macromolecular morphologies.", "tldr": "A novel SE(3) disentanglement method enabling macromolecular morphology identification", "keywords": ["Disentangled Representation Learning", "SE(3) Estimation", "Inverse Problems", "Cryo-ET"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2824c70a978de2fbac1fc76c40a8aa1e5447790a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/bd4cb2a95e8ad874f41dc7982e2d10d949fafd51.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning framework for inferring macromolecular morphology from cryo-ET data.

The proposed model inherits almost the entire architecture and loss design from Harmony (CVPR 2022) and Multi-Choice Learning (Guzman-Rivera 2012; Kohl 2018). The paper provides no new theoretical analysis of SE(3) disentanglement or identifiable latent factors. Equations (4)–(7) merely restate known forms with SE(3) transforms substituted for generic transformations. There is no formal proof that the new objective achieves rotation- or translation-invariant representations, nor any mathematical link between MCL and reduced latent-space entanglement. Consequently, the method reads more as an engineering adaptation of Harmony to volumetric cryo-ET data rather than a conceptual advance in disentanglement theory.\n\n2. Missing modern baselines – no comparison to CryoDRGN-ET (2024) [1], CryoSPIN (2024) [2], or DISCO-ET (2023) [3]. The paper evaluates only against RELION and Harmony3D, both of which predate recent breakthroughs in deep cryo-ET analysis. Newer baselines such as CryoDRGN-ET ( Rangan et al., Nature Methods 2024 ), CryoSPIN ( Shekarforoush et al., NeurIPS 2024 ), and DISCO-ET ( Zeng et al., PNAS 2023 ) provide neural or hybrid Bayesian formulations capable of capturing continuous conformations and pose distributions—precisely the challenges this paper claims to address. Without head-to-head quantitative comparisons, it is impossible to assess whether the proposed approach actually advances the state of the art or merely improves upon legacy maximum-likelihood methods. Given that CryoDRGN-ET and CryoSPIN already demonstrate SE(3)-aware latent modeling with significantly higher AUC-FSC and visual quality, the omission seriously undermines the empirical credibility of the claims.\n\n3. Weak quantitative results on real data – evaluation remains descriptive. Although Table 1 shows substantial gains on synthetic benchmarks, the real-data evaluation (Fig. 3) is largely qualitative. The reported AUC-FSC values (< 0.3) indicate coarse reconstructions that fall short of practical interpretability in structural biology. There are no statistical tests, confidence intervals, or multiple-run variances to demonstrate robustness. Moreover, the claimed “discovery” of novel morphologies is supported only by visual inspection without independent biological validation or cross-dataset reproducibility. In high-impact imaging applications, descriptive results are insufficient; quantitative verification using expert annotations or known templates is necessary.\n\n4. High data requirement – dependence on thousands of subtomograms limits practicality. The method’s training pipeline relies on tens of thousands of subtomograms to stably estimate SE(3) latent factors. This dependence severely limits usability in many biological contexts, where obtaining even hundreds of particles is challenging due to experimental constraints. The authors mention no strategies for data-efficiency, pretraining, or transfer learning. In contrast, modern probabilistic approaches such as CryoDRGN-ET can operate effectively with one or two orders of magnitude fewer examples by leveraging pose amortization. Thus, while the model performs well in controlled simulations, it remains unrealistic for many real-world cryo-ET studies.\n\n5. No latent-space disentanglement metrics – rotation/translation invariance not numerically verified.  The paper’s central claim is SE(3) disentanglement, yet it provides no direct quantitative evidence. There is no metric assessing how invariant latent representations remain under known rotations or translations. Standard evaluations—e.g., mutual-information reduction between pose and content variables, linear-probe predictability of rotation angles, or equivariance correlation tests—are entirely absent. Without such analysis, it is unclear whether the latent space truly isolates morphology from pose, or if improved clustering simply arises from data augmentation. This omission weakens the paper’s main theoretical claim and leaves the effectiveness of the proposed representation ambiguous.\n\n[1] CryoDRGN-ET: Deep reconstructing generative networks for visualizing dynamic biomolecules inside cells.
