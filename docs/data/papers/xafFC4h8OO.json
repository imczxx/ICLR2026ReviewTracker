We first propose the Dynamic Grasp Suite (DGS), a unified platform for dynamic grasp evaluation, and Dyana-12M, a large-scale benchmark with 12M frames of human-hand dynamic grasp trajectories. Dyana-12M represents target motion with three interpretable trajectories: straight-line, circular-arc, and simple-harmonic, which compose into arbitrarily complex trajectories. DGS standardizes interfaces and protocols, supporting the evaluation of three major model zoo: vision–language–action (VLA) agents, diffusion policies, and vision–language models (VLMs). \nTogether, DGS and Dyana-12M establish a new paradigm for dynamic grasping, shifting evaluation from static scenes to motion-aware, temporally aligned assessment at scale.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Dynamic hand grasping", "Benchmark"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/965af76a135a97fa97c6f3ea4992ca0d30d88bd5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/34597d8cd716795ceb87fd93e6edf25f5fae3bea.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces an evaluation framework for dynamic hand–object interaction and a large-scale dataset DYANA of human-hand grasp trajectories with targets following three interpretable motion primitives (line, arc, simple harmonic).

For example, typically the objects are static w.r.t the environment before grasping. For this dynamic grasping benchmark, it is unclear how the benchmark performance will correlate to the real-life performance. The setting is novel but It is unclear in what specific robotics scenario we will need to grasp moving objects.\n\n# Ambiguous Definition of Valid Grasps\n\nThe evaluation is centring around the successful  grasp, described in Line 348. However, the definition of “a valid grasp” is unclear. \nDoes a valid grasp account for objects sliding along fingers? Does it account for objects with non-uniform mass distribution? How are the forces evaluated? \nSince the objects are in motion, what happens when a moving object hits the hand? Does the object bounce on the hand? \n\nIn real life, human will assess above questions before performing a successful grasp of a moving object. However, these factors are not considered in the proposed benchmark. \n\n# Pre-grasp vs Grasping\n\nThe proposed evaluation metrics in Sec. 4.2 are primarily focusing on the pre-grasp stage: how fast the hand reaches the object, how smooth are the trajectory during reaching, whether the hand can locate above the objects. The only metric for grasping is the \"Grasping success rate\". It seems that this paper assume that the grasping is a solved problem once the hand is above the object, which I disagree. \n\nIn addition, \"Grasping error\" measures the distance between fingertips and the object surfaces at a successful grasp; this suggest that the validness of a grasp might merely be distance-based. However, a valid grasp is more than distance-based contact: \"force closure\" is another important factor affecting a grasp, and how forces interact with the object moving speed is not considered in the evaluation."}, "questions": {"value": "I find this paper not easy to follow. Below are a few examples: \n\nLine 49-53  the current evaluations are limited to static objects, but then the authors say “the blind spot … whether models can anticipate motion”.

What does this sentence mean? \n\n\nIn addition, I aslo found that this paper focuses on evaluating zero-shot methods, that is why VLA, DIffusion and VLMs are adopted for testing. \nIf the evaluation methods are not limited to zero-shot methods, we would expect a more traditional multi-stage method to work. By \"traditional multi-stage\" I mean training a depth estimator, a motion predictor and an explicit hand action model that output the global wrist and local finger poses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "80ARvtFGXR", "forum": "xafFC4h8OO", "replyto": "xafFC4h8OO", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7141/Reviewer_K9ER"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7141/Reviewer_K9ER"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7141/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761736519199, "cdate": 1761736519199, "tmdate": 1762919305718, "mdate": 1762919305718, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper aims to address the limitations of existing benchmarks that focus on static objects and introduce a new framework for benchmarking dynamic hand intelligence.

The camera setup is described as providing \"egocentric RGB images... from a fixed camera\" (line 158). These terms are mutually exclusive. An egocentric camera moves with the agent, while a fixed camera does not. Figure 1 contains two separate axes with different values labeled \"Grasp Deviation,\" making the chart ambiguous and difficult to interpret. Key acronyms are used without definition. For instance, \"HOI\" is used multiple times before it is ever defined, forcing the reader to guess its meaning (Hand-Object Interaction).\n- The paper fails to provide a formal definition of the task and does not adequately justify key modeling assumptions. The task of \"Dynamic Localization & Grasping\" is never formally defined. The paper lacks a clear mathematical formulation (e.g., as a POMDP) specifying the state, action, observation spaces, and the objective function. This makes it difficult to understand the precise problem the models are supposed to solve. Moreover, the benchmark assumes a \"free-floating (hand-centric) embodiment\". This abstracts away the robot arm, which is a major source of kinematic and dynamic constraints in any real-world application. This assumption is not discussed or justified, and it raises concerns about the practical relevance of the benchmark, as some evaluated trajectories (e.g., Fig. 2) might be physically unrealizable for a robot.\n- Key design choices for the simulation environment and trajectory representation are not well-defended. The paper states that DGS is implemented in the Unity engine, but provides no justification for this choice over other simulators like Isaac Sim or MuJoCo, which are more common in robotics research and often offer better physics fidelity and sim-to-real support. The motivation for using linear, arc, and harmonic motion primitives is brief. The claim that these \"compose into arbitrarily complex trajectories\" is very strong and not sufficiently supported. Details about \"For models from different ... through lightweight adaptation\" (lines 201-204) are also not discussed.\n- The paper relies exclusively on quantitative tables and charts, providing no visual examples of the generated trajectories. For a paper introducing a new benchmark and simulation environment, showing visual examples of success and failure cases is critical to demonstrate the nuances and challenges of the task."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ffcaVz7c4U", "forum": "xafFC4h8OO", "replyto": "xafFC4h8OO", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7141/Reviewer_YqX9"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7141/Reviewer_YqX9"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7141/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761773075897, "cdate": 1761773075897, "tmdate": 1762919304616, "mdate": 1762919304616, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a benchmark for hand grasping for dynamic objects, which can capture dynamic, real-world scenarios where the grasp targets are dynamic -- in contrast to prior hand grasping benchmarks focused on static objects.
