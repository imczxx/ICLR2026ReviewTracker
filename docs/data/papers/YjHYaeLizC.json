While effective, these modules introduce significant architectural complexity and computational overhead. Recent studies suggest that plain Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders, when scaled with sufficient capacity and large-scale pre-training, can conduct accurate image segmentation without requiring such specialized components. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Video Encoder-only Mask Transformer (VidEoMT), a simple encoder-only video segmentation model that eliminates the need for dedicated tracking modules. To enable temporal modeling in an encoder-only ViT, VidEoMT introduces a lightweight query fusion mechanism that merges queries from the previous frame with temporally-agnostic learned queries, enabling information propagation across frames while preserving adaptability to new content. As a result, VidEoMT attains the benefits of a tracker without added complexity and achieves competitive accuracy, while being 5-10x faster, running at up to 160 FPS with a ViT-L backbone. Code will be made public upon acceptance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Vision Transformer", "Efficient Video Segmentation", "Encoder-only Mask Transformer", "Video Segmentation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5f532cbdc3b826aaf93461b29e975c8ad150340b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "Vl8gKJC2So", "forum": "YjHYaeLizC", "replyto": "YjHYaeLizC", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7949/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7949/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761576385769, "cdate": 1761576385769, "tmdate": 1761576385769, "mdate": 1761576385769, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
