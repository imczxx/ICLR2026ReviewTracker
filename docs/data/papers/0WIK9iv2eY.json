This domain encompasses multi-subject referencing, portrait synthesis, and scene guidance. To address this gap, we introduce Prism, a unified architecture designed to generate coherent images that satisfy all input conditions, even in the absence of textual prompts. Prism excels at maintaining identity and facial characteristics while aligning with specified backgrounds.\nAddressing the scarcity of aligned reference and target image sets, we developed a dedicated pipeline, termed {HMS-Dataset}, to construct a large-scale training dataset from single images containing individuals. Building upon this, Prism first encodes facial identity, pertinent clothing elements, and background context into sequences. These sequences are subsequently fused via a novel MM-Attention mechanism.\nFurthermore, we propose a Compositional Consistency Losses (CCL) strategy to incorporate facial similarity, clothing feature preservation, and background consistency, which are specifically designed to boost facial fidelity, retain intricate clothing details, and enhance overall background coherence.\nSubsequently, guided by the Minimum Variance Distortionless Response criterion, we propose a Unified Gradient Optimization (UGO) update strategy, which enables fair perceptual optimization for multi-objective optimization problems.\nUltimately, Prism demonstrates robust identity preservation and seamless human-environment interaction.\nEvaluated on our proposed PrismBench, Prism achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and controllability, significantly advancing practical applications in character editing and customizable scene synthesis.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["image generation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b3d0f24c65947177aa3fc2cc8fa83863ddb805ca.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper works on multi-subject conditioned person generation.

Many details are missing in the current manuscript. Key components are under-specified, hindering reproducibility: the source(s) of single-image data used for dataset construction; exact evaluation metrics and their computation; how semantic correspondence between the conditional background and generated image is derived for BCAL; and full user-study protocol (participant pool, instructions, interfaces, measures, and statistical tests).\n2. How are the proposed losses applied to the denoising framework is unclear.  It is well known that at early steps, the latent would be noisy and make it difficult to estimate a reliable $z_0$. The arcface network used in face identity loss function should be difficult to produce reliable gradients.\n3. The manuscript lacks discussion of closely related, contemporaneous methods e.g., [1], and does not clearly position the proposed approach against these in terms of objectives, architecture, and trade-offs.\n4. Limited result analysis. It would be interesting to probe performance changes as the number of conditioned subjects increases. Curves or tables stratified by 1/2/3+ subjects would clarify scalability and failure modes in comparison with other models.\n5. Several visual results are too small/compressed to judge identity fidelity, garment detail, or background consistency. Higher-resolution figures with consistent layouts and zoom-ins are needed.\n6. The visualization is limited. More visualizations are expected in the refinement.\n7. In table 2, it would be helpful to also put the baseline results with only standard denoising loss for comparison.\n\n[1] TokenVerse: Versatile Multi-concept Personalization in Token Modulation Space.

The reviewer is not convinced that the \"person-centric multi-conditional generation\" task, as defined, is new. Many previous works explore this or a highly similar multi-condition person image synthesis task, such as Magic Clothing [1], AnyFit [2], DreamFit [3], AnyDressing [4], IMAGDressing-v1 [5], and Parts2Whole [6]. The proposed model architecture also appears highly similar to the pipelines in these methods. The manuscript fails to adequately differentiate itself from this large body of existing work, so this task definition cannot be recognized as a novel contribution.\n\n2. The dataset is fully synthetic; the inputs (garments, background) are generated by another image editing model (Kontext). Although the extracted components are filtered by VLMs, two problems arise: (1) The AI-generated components may still be inconsistent with the final composed ground-truth image. (2) Since all inputs are purely synthetic, the model may be learning to compose these artifacts rather than real-world, noisy images. The model has not been evaluated on its ability to generalize to real garment or background images, only on the synthetic PrismBench. The authors should evaluate the trained model with more real-world images.\n\n3. The explanation for the proposed \"Compositional Consistency Losses\" is lacking. There is almost no explanation for the Background Correspondence Attention Loss, and the notation in Eq. (9) is unclear, making it difficult to understand. Moreover, the ablation results (Table 2) show confusing cross-effects. For example, removing the face loss (w/o FIDL) also causes the garment (G&ASim) and background (BackSim) consistency scores to decrease. Why does this happen? If each loss is purely regional and designed to be disentangled, it should primarily affect only its corresponding region. This behavior is not explained.\n\n4. The evaluation is not comprehensive. Given the large number of existing works on this task (as cited in point 1), the authors should have compared against them to truly demonstrate superiority. The current SOTA claim is weak as it only compares against general-purpose multi-subject models, not specialized virtual try-on or person synthesis models. \n\n[1] Magic Clothing: Controllable Garment-Driven Image Synthesis\n\n[2] AnyFit: Controllable Virtual Try-on for Any Combination of Attire Across Any Scenario\n\n[3] DreamFit: Garment-Centric Human Generation via a Lightweight Anything-Dressing Encoder\n\n[4] AnyDressing: Customizable Multi-Garment Virtual Dressing via Latent Diffusion Models\n\n[5] IMAGDressing-v1: Customizable Virtual Dressing\n\n[6] From Parts to Whole: A Unified Reference Framework for Controllable Human Image Generation."}, "questions": {"value": "The manuscript should be further improved by: (1) Clearly stating the novelty and differences compared to the numerous existing methods in this domain.
