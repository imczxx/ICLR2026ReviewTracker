In PLL, each training instance is typically associated with multiple candidate labels, among which only one is the ground truth. To simulate the process of label degradation, we introduce noise into the labels through forward diffusion to simulate candidate labels, and then perform reverse denoising to recover the true labels in a probabilistic sense. Unlike in conventional image generation tasks, we present the Mutual Information Guided Diffusion Model for Partial Label Learning (MDMPLL), which adapts diffusion models to weakly supervised learning and incorporates MI estimation to strengthen the consistency between denoised labels and data features, thereby improving label disambiguation. Furthermore, Dual-Path Attention Feature Fusion (DAFF) strategy is employed to enhance data representation, enabling more effective label disambiguation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art PLL approaches on multiple datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Partial Label Learning;Diffusion Model;Mutual Information"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/80e08068442e9067b3d626870c70bfbb1c1f4187.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the problem of partial-label learning.

For example: “On the one hand, label ambiguity and the complex relationships among candidate labels make it difficult for some methods to achieve stable disambiguation in a single pass, leading to limited robustness.” Nearly all PLL methods aim to address precisely this issue, so this statement does not accurately pinpoint the concrete shortcomings of prior work.\n2.\tRegarding “On the other hand, label disambiguation and feature learning are often decoupled, and lack mechanisms that effectively associate labels with the semantic content of images.” The intended claim seems to be that disambiguation and representation learning are decoupled and lack a mechanism to link them for stable, mutually reinforcing training. However, the proposed DAFF targets only representation learning and does not provide a joint mechanism. Moreover, many existing PLL approaches already consider disambiguation and representation learning jointly rather than as two separate stages.\n3.\tThe paper does not explain why diffusion models are suitable for label disambiguation in PLL, which is crucial. Since the label information fed into the diffusion model is noisy, if the denoising process outputs a noisy label at each step, can it ultimately recover the true label? This justification is missing."}, "questions": {"value": "1.\tAre there any fundamental issues with applying diffusion models to partial-label learning? Why is $Y_0$ initialized via disambiguation from similar examples (KNN), and how can label information that is still noisy be used as input to a diffusion model? In image denoising, the diffusion model’s initial input is a clean, fully observed image. When applying diffusion to PLL, the input labels are noisy. Why does using KNN-based initialization improve the stability of disambiguation? What problems arise if it is not used?\n2.\tThe proposed DAFF module appears to act only on representation learning and does not resolve the decoupling between disambiguation and representation learning found in prior methods.\n3.\tFrom the ablation results, the contributions of components D and F are modest, yet the overall gain over existing methods is large. This suggests the diffusion model itself contributes substantially. It would be better to show ablations across multiple datasets.\n4.\tAfter training, can the model use the diffusion denoising process to directly predict labels for unseen examples?\n5.\tIn Eq.
