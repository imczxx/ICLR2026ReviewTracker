Although spatial multi-scale modeling of the coupled ocean-atmosphere climate system is a promising direction for seasonal forecasting, two key challenges limit it further development: \n(1) Feature entanglement across scales and variables not only hinders the disentangling and learning of multi-scale features but also introduces heterogeneous interference.\n(2) Hierarchical error propagation causes errors to accumulate at the final forecasting scale, compromising the forecast skill. To this end, we propose Multi-scale Multi-task Residual Network (MMRN) for seasonal climate forecasting. Specifically, to mitigate the feature entanglement, a group-wise variables embedder module is first introduced to independently embed the ocean and atmosphere variables, then a residual multi-scale feature extractor module is designed to extract disentangled multi-scale features. These features are then modeled to generate forecast at each scale. In addition, a multi-task learning mechanism is employed in the learning process by imposing scale-specific supervision to curb the hierarchical error propagation. Extensive experiments on the reanalysis dataset demonstrate that MMRN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the advanced deep-learning based models.

In the Introduction section, the authors devote an excessive amount of space to describing *seasonal climate forecasting*, while the actual core theme of the paper is seasonal climate forecasting in the coupled ocean–atmosphere system. This core focus is only mentioned in the latter part of the Introduction, making it difficult for readers to grasp the paper’s motivation and research objective.\n2. The authors’ motivation is not clearly articulated. They propose two challenges—*Feature Entanglement* and *Hierarchical Error Propagation*. However, in the discussion of Feature Entanglement, the authors first emphasize the issue of scale, which could easily be categorized under Hierarchical Error Propagation.\n3. In the Introduction, the problems identified are all discussed in the context of general *seasonal climate forecasting*, whereas the central topic of the paper specifically concerns the *coupled ocean–atmosphere system*. This lack of alignment undermines the thematic consistency of the paper.\n4. In the Introduction, the *multi-task learning mechanism* appears abruptly without any conceptual buildup or motivation. The introduction of this mechanism is unclear. Moreover, claiming that defining separate predictions for different scales constitutes multi-task learning is an overstatement.\n5. At line 120, the authors define the variable *X*, but they redefine *X* again at line 188, using different variable symbols (*C* and *V*). This results in a redundant and inconsistent definition of variables.\n6. Although the multi-task learning setup (Eqn. for $\\mathcal{L}_{MT}$) is well-motivated, the effect of different weighting strategies ($\\lambda_s$) is checked only empirically (Table 3). There is no principled guidance or a sensitivity analysis in varied data regimes (e.g., if S is larger or if data is more spatially heterogeneous). As spectral bias and error propagation are fundamental to the paper’s argument, the absence of deeper analysis here is a missed opportunity for conceptual impact."}, "questions": {"value": "The same as weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "VdABHv9mxw", "forum": "drSqKrJelq", "replyto": "drSqKrJelq", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11352/Reviewer_HeCm"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11352/Reviewer_HeCm"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11352/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761551153948, "cdate": 1761551153948, "tmdate": 1762922486505, "mdate": 1762922486505, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a Multi-scale Multi-task Residual Network (MMRN) for seasonal climate forecasting, addressing predictions 3-6 months ahead using coupled ocean-atmosphere data.

The 5.625° resolution is generally too coarse to represent local weather dynamics. Thus, the claimed multi-scale framework is not convincing since the resolutions are all coarse. Instead of incorporating these techniques, an empirical solution is to increase the data resolution, which is totally feasible. As a reference, the spatial resolutions of NeuralGCM are 2.8°, 1.4°, and 0.7°. The remaining technical issues are as follows:\n\n* Given the already coarse spatial resolution of the input data, the model could sufficiently operate at the original scale without introducing multi-scale processing, raising questions about the necessity of downsampling to even coarser resolutions followed by upsampling.\n* Equation 4, which defines the iterative residual feature extraction via downsampling and upsampling, lacks clear motivation. Why this specific formulation is superior to directly applying a standard CNN or other feature extraction approaches remains unexplained.\n* In line 62, how do you define the model’s ability to disentangle and learn multiscale features? The reference is not related.\n* Writing issues, including overly verbose and non-concise mathematical notations in the method section, the absence of mathematical formulas to describe the ViT-based Predictor (relying instead on textual explanations), and the creation of unnecessary concepts that complicate understanding, for example, the Group-wise Variable Embedder (GVE) module appears to simply partition and embed ocean and atmosphere variables independently using separate linear layers.\n\nOverall, the MMRN model designs lack deep insights into the underlying mechanisms of seasonal climate forecasting.\n\n**Results**\n-------------------------------\n\nFor experiments, I have the following questions:\n* The authors do not provide sufficient specifics on how baselines such as GraphCast and PanguWeather are adapted to the paper's coarser resolution. Critical adaptations, including how the icosahedral mesh is constructed or coarsened for GraphCast's graph neural network message passing, and how the input grid is tokenized into patches for PanguWeather's Vision Transformer, are entirely omitted.\n* OneForecast, Pangu, ClimaX, and GraphCast are not initially designed for seasonal forecasting. An important baseline is NeuralGCM. The authors miss the comparison as well as the citation.\n* The authors do not compare the model performance against a standard climatology baseline. The climatology method serves as a simple \"no-skill\" benchmark, where predictions for a given month or season are based on the long-term historical average (typically computed over a 30-year baseline period) of meteorological variables from reanalysis or observational data. This baseline is important because it represents the fundamental level of predictability inherent in the climate system's seasonal patterns; any advanced model must outperform it to demonstrate genuine skill."}, "questions": {"value": "* Could the model operate effectively on the high-resolution data?\n* What are the insights behind the model designs?\n* Please provide the implementation details of baselines.\n* Why was NeuralGCM, a more relevant baseline for this task, omitted from the comparison, and is not cited?\n* What is the performance of the climatology baseline?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A."}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Qma9k2D1Fa", "forum": "drSqKrJelq", "replyto": "drSqKrJelq", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11352/Reviewer_VENE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11352/Reviewer_VENE"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11352/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761578519502, "cdate": 1761578519502, "tmdate": 1762922485398, "mdate": 1762922485398, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a new method for seasonal climate forecasting of weather variables.

This is akin to a reverse skip connection method: instead of adding information to the downscaled feature map, the feature map is upscaled and removes information from the original map. This seems very interesting and could have implications for other environmental applications, where multi-scale processes are highly relevant."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I am less convinced by the GVE module.

It would be good to have table 2 in percent of improvement over baseline in order to more easily compare the methods.\nI understand the logic and reasoning behind GVE, and I do think the feature entanglement is something to be worry of, but I do not think the proposed method is an answer to that.\nSplitting the variables into those two groups seems somewhat arbitrary, and more driven by the data source than other logics. The remaining features in each group are probably as entangled as the features between groups would be.\nI think this weakens the paper a bit, as the reasoning for GVE isn't reflected in the execution (although the paper remains very good).

The seasonal forecasting is not within the scope of climate prediction. Climate forecasting targets for multi-year prediction.\n2. This work lacks novelty. From my view, the proposed architecture is a simple combination of some common methods. For instance, ResMFE is similar to [1]. And this paper doesn’t demonstrate ResMFE can learning different scales of physical fields. The authors does not clearly define what a multi-scale physical field is. Although simple upsampling and downsampling can theoretically extract features from different scales, the authors don’t provide a clear analysis. And Multi-task Learning Mechanism is very simple in computer vision. Further, the so called coupled ocean-atmosphere model is just the the stacking of variables.\n\n3.  The data used in this work is too coarse. 5.6 degree (32✖️64) only composes large-scale features, and lacks details (corresponding to small-scale features). If the authors intent to improve this work, the resolution is at least 0.25 degree (721✖️1440), a common resolution used by previous work, such as Fengwu, Fuxi, Graphcast, and Pangu.\n\n4. The baselines are unfair. OneForecast, Pangu, and Graphcast are designed for medium-range weather forecasting, rather than long-term forecasting. For long-term forecasting, CirT [2], ORCA_DL [3], Fuxi-S2S [4]should be added. Further, a coupled ocean-atmosphere model [5] should be added for comparison.\n\n5. The overall architecture is a dual-branch network. Modules such as GVE may not have played a role in improving the paper.
