Unlike sequence-to-sequence forecasting, spatial diag-\nnostics demand high spatial fidelity, robustness to intermit-\ntency, and interpretability—especially under extreme weather\nconditions. In this study, we propose a deep learning frame-\nwork that operates entirely in the spatial domain, without re-\nlying on temporal encoding. The model begins with a pseudo\nspectral-space transformation to reorganize spatial modes,\nfollowed by cluster-wise attention that enables localized,\nstructure-aware feature fusion. A sparse channel selection\nmodule further improves compactness and generalization. We\ntrain and evaluate our method on ensemble forecast fields\nand corresponding daily precipitation observations from 2010\nto 2018, focusing on daily accumulated precipitation. Com-\npared to strong baselines including LetNet, UNet with SSIM\nloss, FourCastNet, and SwinUnet, our method achieves con-\nsistently superior performance across standard metrics such\nas RMSE, R², Pearson correlation, Hanssen–Kuipers (HK)\nscore, and multi-threshold Equitable Threat Score (ETS). No-\ntably, the model demonstrates improved skill in detecting\nextreme precipitation events. Spatial and per-sample analy-\nses further confirm its accuracy and robustness. These re-\nsults highlight the promise of structure-aware spatial models\nfor operational precipitation diagnostics and post-processing\ntasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Weather forecast; Precipitation diagnose;"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
