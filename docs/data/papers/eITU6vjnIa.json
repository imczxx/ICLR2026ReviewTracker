Unlike existing embeddings—such as persistence images, landscapes, or kernel methods—persistence spheres provide a bi-continuous mapping: they are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance and admit a continuous inverse on their image. This ensures, in a theoretically optimal way, both stability and geometric fidelity, making persistence spheres the representation that most closely mirrors the Wasserstein geometry of PDs in linear space. \nWe derive explicit formulas for persistence spheres, showing that they can be computed efficiently and parallelized with minimal overhead. Empirically, we evaluate them on diverse regression and classification tasks involving functional data, time series, graphs, meshes, and point clouds. Across these benchmarks, persistence spheres consistently deliver state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to persistence images, persistence landscapes, and the sliced Wasserstein kernel.", "tldr": "We propose a novel functional representation of persistence diagrams that is bi-continuous: it is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance and admits a continuous inverse on its image.", "keywords": ["topological data analysis", "topological machine learning", "linearization", "lift zonoid"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2278ba7ee3d0576cf0988836ebb7cf923f7d5c35.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6300ad26ae49b5e1dd052372da36129aeb064375.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a bi-continuous representation (with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance) of Persistence Diagrams (PDs) via the restricted support of lift zonoids, i.e. Persistence Sphere (PS).

The experimental part demonstrates the efficiency of this vectorization technique on various classification problems, by comparing it to many other known methods.\nNB: the unweighted vectorization scheme was proposed in the literature, and the paper contains the appropriate references and attribution; the actual contribution of the paper is weighted case, its theoretical properties and experimental evaluation."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- The paper is rather well-written and very clear, being also practically self-contained.\n- The properties that the embedding needs are certainly important, not just from a theoretical viewpoint, but also practically.
