However, it often struggles in capturing multi-scale, time-sensitive patterns. Although the Wavelet Transform (WT) can capture these patterns through frequency decomposition, its coefficients are insensitive to abrupt changes in the time series, leading to suboptimal modeling. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the multi-order Wavelet Derivative Transform (WDT) grounded in the WT, enabling the extraction of time-aware patterns  spanning both the overall trend and subtle fluctuations. Compared with the standard FT and WT, which model the raw series, WDT operates on the derivative of the series, selectively magnifying rate-of-change cues and exposing abrupt regime shifts that are particularly informative for time series modeling. Practically, we embed the WDT into a multi-branch framework named **WaveTS**, which decomposes the input series into multi-scale time-frequency coefficients, refines them via linear layers, and reconstructs them into the time domain via the inverse WDT. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that WaveTS achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while retaining high computational efficiency.", "tldr": "This paper proposes WaveTS, a multi-branch model that applies a multi-order Wavelet Derivative Transform to highlight both trends and abrupt changes, delivering state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy with high efficiency on ten benchmark datasets.", "keywords": ["Time Series Forecasting", "Deep Learning", "Wavelet Transform", "Frequency Derivative Learning"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b95d57c42d540e0437d218daf30ab07ca12a9c3a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes the Wavelet Derivative Transform (WDT) based on the Wavelet Transform.

It fails to clarify the difficulty of the problem being addressed, the significance of the contribution, or the approach taken to solve it. If the proofs are indeed as important as I understand them to be, the authors should have summarized their challenges and implications right in the introduction. Otherwise, readers less familiar with the field will struggle to grasp the significance of these results, even if they read the conclusions of the proofs.\n\n2. When X is a discrete sequence, is directly computing its derivative inherently difficult? Do WDT and IWDT (Inverse Wavelet Derivative Transform) address this challenge?\n\n3. Is it difficult to construct a basis that possesses the inverse transform property? What is the practical or theoretical significance of having an inverse transform?\n\n4. What is the meaning (or required properties) of wavelet basis functions? Does WDT satisfy these properties? Does WDT offer additional desirable properties beyond those of conventional wavelet transforms?\n\n5. The paper employs $\\psi^{(n)} $ (the n-th derivative of the mother wavelet $\\psi$ ), yet for many mother wavelets $\\psi$ , computing such derivatives is nontrivial.
