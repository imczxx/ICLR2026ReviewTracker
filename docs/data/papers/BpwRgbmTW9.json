However, its geometric accuracy often lags behind its visual fidelity. Existing methods to improve geometry typically constrain the 3D Gaussians directly, compromising their volumetric nature. We introduce DRGSplat, a novel depth-regularization approach for 3D Gaussian Splatting that enhances geometric accuracy without direct modifications of the Gaussian primitives. DRGSplat regularizes the rendered depth maps during training with three key losses: a monocular depth loss enforcing global consistency, a surface normal loss refining local detail, and a new uncertainty-aware curvature loss that selectively penalizes high-gradient regions while avoiding the gradient instabilities common to direct curvature constraints. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that DRGSplat keeps the strong photometric quality of Gaussian Splatting while substantially improving geometric accuracy and outperforming state-of-the-art geometry-focused methods. On the ETH3D dataset, DRGSplat improves reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and F1 scores of 3DGS by 15, 25, and 17 percentage points, respectively.

As shown in the ablation of Table 5, the most important regularization of the proposed method is the monodepth loss. However, there has been numerous prior works which apply depth regularization during training, such as in [1,2,3] (see references listed below). As the proposed monodepth regularization follows the pipeline of computing scale and shift values also done in [1,2,3], it seems that the performance improvement mainly comes from the strong off-the-shelf geometry estimator (Metric3Dv2) rather than a technical contribution done in this work. Based on the lack of novelty of the monocular depth regularization loss alone, I think it is important to emphasize the importance of the two other proposed regularizations (normal loss, curvature loss), where I did not find enough emphasis in the current version of the manuscript.\n\n### Minor Weakness\n\n- **Reliance to off-the-shelf network:** As shown in Table 6, the proposed method largely depends on the performance of the off-the-shelf network’s estimation quality. Although the authors leverage the confidence value from the off-the-shelf module,  it would be better to analyze more on how robust the proposed method is when the off-the-shelf estimates are highly noisy.\n- **Analysis on computation overhead:** As this model requires the usage of large foundation models for geometry estimation, it would be nice to analyze the required computation for this method.\n- **Analysis on overall optimization time:** When comparing with previous methods such as 2D Gaussian Splatting and Sugar, it would be nice to compare the overall training time to reconstruct the scenes to better highlight the advantage or contribution of the proposed method.\n\n### References\n\n---\n\n[1] Zhang, Qilin, et al. \"CDGS: Confidence-Aware Depth Regularization for 3D Gaussian Splatting.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2502.14684 (2025).\n\n[2] Huang, Zexu, Min Xu, and Stuart Perry. \"DET-GS: Depth-and Edge-Aware Regularization for High-Fidelity 3D Gaussian Splatting.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2508.04099 (2025).\n\n[3] Chung, Jaeyoung, Jeongtaek Oh, and Kyoung Mu Lee. \"Depth-regularized optimization for 3d gaussian splatting in few-shot images.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2024."}, "questions": {"value": "Q1. Could the authors provide insights into how the proposed method differs from previous monocular depth regularization methods? \n\nQ2. Could the authors provide additional analysis of the newly proposed normal loss and curvature loss on the final performance? Other than the quantitative comparison in Table 5, it would be better to add some qualitative comparisons after adding each regularization. Also, could the authors provide quantitative tables of the benefits of the newly formulated normal loss, which is directly computed on top of the predicted depth map, compared to prior works that utilize normal regularizations by directly calculating the normal from the 3D Gaussians?\n\nQ3.

The method seems to be heavily influenced by the pre-trained monocular depth model. Although the paper includes an ablation of this, it seems like there are more to be explored.\n- Since the method utilizes both the predicted depth and its uncertainty from a pre-trained depth model, it would be interesting to see whether the method is benefitting from high-quality depth predictions, or better uncertainty prediction. A more detailed case study, where each of the losses are ablated for different depth models, would provide a better understanding.\n- Furthermore, an additional ablation with compared methods, such as DN-Splatter, with identical depth backbone seems to be required to rule out that the model is simply benefitting from a stronger depth model.\n\n2. The paper is missing some details and explanation.\n- Although the rendered depth is the most important component, the equation for obtaining it is not defined in the manuscript. The reviewer is aware of how depth is normally obtained in 3DGS, but it still seems crucial to explicitly have this as there are some works that alter the depth rendering strategy for depth regularization.\n- How is $C\\_{predict}$ obtained?
