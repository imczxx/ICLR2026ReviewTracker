We propose a novel optimization framework that incorporates a topology-informed regularization term to extract persistent structural patterns from time-series price data. Our method leverages topological alignment between markets to construct robust index-mimicking portfolios without requiring constituent-level information. We further introduce a cost-aware formulation that accounts for transaction costs and their compounding effects. Empirical results on real-world data show notable gains over traditional tracking methods in both accuracy and robustness. Our approach holds broader potential for general time-series decomposition and synthesis.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Topological Data Analysis", "Time-series synthesis", "Time-Series Featurization", "Quantitative Finance", "Mimicking Portfolio"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b9773ff71fe2d30973cafe3edd861b2bde84c3bc.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f41ffb0c951ea6d88c3dcf43240eaecf7509571a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a topology-informed regularization framework that integrates topological data analysis into index tracking, with theoretical results on consistency and convergence and an available optimization algorithm.

Could the authors confirm which formulation is used?\n3. Line 425 mentions the RM method but does not sufficiently explain how it works. Could the authors provide a clearer introduction or reference for this method?\n4. Regarding line 236, the procedure for selecting parameters $\\tau$ and $m$ is described as the default method implemented via the tseriesChaos R package. What is the practical guidance or implication of this choice for the experiment? The authors later say “$m$: fixed at 2 for simplicity” in the appendix—how do these statements align?\n5. Continuing on this point: according to Takens’ embedding theorem, $m$ is related to the dimension of the underlying topological space. Simply fixing $m = 2$ (line 926) may not capture the correct structure. Would it be possible to add an experiment varying $m$ to test whether the results are robust or provide a brief discussion on whether $m = 2$ is sufficient?\n6. Line 925 indicates a grid search over $\\tau$ values {2, 5, 8}. Yet the main text (line 240) says “we adopt a hybrid of grid and random search for $\\tau$ similar to Kim et al. (2020).” Where does the “random” component come in? The current experiment appears to be a simple grid search—could the authors clarify or expand on this search strategy?\n7. The paper provides a theoretical proof of the statistical convergence rate of the proposed model. Could the authors include a synthetic experiment to empirically verify this convergence behavior?\n8.

It omits more modern deep learning–based index tracking, such as Kim & Kim (2020, Quantitative Finance), and other time-series representation learning approaches (e.g., TS2VEC, Equity2Vec, SimStock). Without such comparisons, it is difficult to evaluate whether topology offers advantages over other nonlinear representation methods rather than just classical models.\n\n2.
