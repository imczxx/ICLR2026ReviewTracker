A Non-deterministic FQDP (NFQDP) is equivalent to a general PDA (Corollary 17).\n\n* Result 4 (Memory/Retrieval): The RQDP, which adds a mechanism to retrieve from an unbounded history, is Turing complete (Theorem 4).

A formal framework could help identify potential improvements in how such agentic systems should be constructed and facilitate the community's discussion of these decisions in a principled manner."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "# Clarity\n\n\n## Abstract \n\n\nOverall, the abstract is fairly vague and could be improved. For example:\n\n> \"Theoretically, we demonstrate that these models form a hierarchy of computational power corresponding to key levels of the formal language hierarchy.\" \n\n>  \"We then analyze the practical efficiency of each model by simulating task dependencies in computation graphs, revealing that this\ntheoretical hierarchy translates to significant performance trade-offs\". \n\n(1) Please describe your findings directly, such as \"We demonstrate that, given certain constraints, reference augmentation is necessary for an agentic system to be Turing complete\" or \"We show that reference-augmented systems have a better CG complexity than non-reference augmented decision processes.\". Adapt accordingly.\n\n(2) The reviewer disagrees that the paper is analysing \"practical efficiency\", as the computation graphs (MCGs) are still more of a theoretical construct than any decision process an agentic system might see in common agentic benchmarks. Under \"practical efficiency\", the reviewer would have expected a wall-clock time comparison on a popular agentic benchmark with the expected theoretical complexity, e.g., a reference augmented agentic system is faster on MLEBench than a non-reference augmented system. \n\n## Main Text\n### References\n> Language models (LMs) lie at the core of these systems, serving as the primary decision-making module that processes language in a manner analogous to human cognition (Felin & Holweg (2024)). (line 28)\n\n(3) Could you clarify how the Felin & Holweg citation motivates your statement of \"analogous\"? At least their abstract seems to disagree that any analogy is particularly meaningful when it comes to reasoning patterns and cognition:\n\n> Scholars argue that artificial intelligence (AI) can generate genuine novelty and new knowledge and, in turn, that AI and computational models of cognition will replace human decision making under uncertainty. We disagree. We argue that AI’s data-based prediction is different from human theory-based causal logic and reasoning.\n\nIn general, I found the many references to human cognition distracting. For example, while the reviewer appreciates that the authors draw inspiration from cognitive science, stating that they were inspired by a theory of the hippocampus' mechanism (line 249), without providing further detail about what aspects of that theory inspired them, seems like unnecessary detail. Is it the fact that brains have long-term memory retrieval? \n\nAlso on line 328\n> By keeping track of a location in the reference space, this mechanism functions analogously to cognitive maps in the hippocampus.\n\nOn what level does this analogy work? Where does this analogy break down? It appears to be a questionable scientific practice to make such broad statements, especially if the paper's principal contribution does not address human cognition and makes no effort to validate these statements empirically.\n\n(4) The reviewer would prefer that these references be either solidified or left out completely, but is open to the author's opinions.\n\n### Section 5\n(5) The reviewer found Section 5 quite hard to follow; the explanation of the retrieve action could potentially be visualised, like in Figure 2.\n\n(6) Similarly, could you please clarify the following paragraph (line 273)?\n> Therefore, the reference-generating function must be allowed to vary per quest to ensure sufficient\ncapacity. Crucially, this design does not violate the agent’s stateless assumption. The reference graph\nand its unbounded history are managed by the Quest Graph, while the agent function itself remains a\nstatic, finite-context component unaware of this underlying complexity.\n\n It was not clear to the reviewer why the reference-generating function \"must\" be allowed to vary per quest.\n\n# Significance and Originality\nThe reviewer found it challenging to grasp the significance and originality of the proposed framework fully. Most citations of contemporary work in the paper are methods applied to agentic systems. The citations are used to motivate the paper's design decisions. There are very few citations for related work that compare and contrast this paper with their academic \"siblings\". It's quickly mentioned that other \"unconventional models\" exist in the literature, but no effort was made to explain how or if they differ. Furthermore, as the authors point out, formally, a QDP is a variant of a POMDP. Sequence models, such as RNNs, and even feedforward neural networks, have been utilised in POMDPs for a considerable time. \n\n(7) Could the authors clarify if there are any comparable frameworks for complexity analysis on POMDPs? What makes this analysis unique to LMs? Do they consider state-space models and LSTMs also as LMs, or is this work mostly focused on transformer-based architectures?\n\nFurthermore, the authors state that,\n> The standard model of an LM treats the decision-making module and the context buffer as a single,\nmonolithic entity. We propose decoupling these components, presenting the reasoning module as a\npure function that operates on an external memory structure. This separation offers both practical and\ntheoretical advantages. On a practical level, it aligns with modern, stateless architectures recognized\nfor their scalability and testability (Fielding (2000)).\n\n(8) Could the authors please clarify what that means for the transferability of their framework to practical usage of agentic systems? Moreover, Fielding (2000) appears to discuss stateless architectures of network-based systems in the context of the World Wide Web. Could you clarify the connection to LM-based agentic systems?\n\nMoreover, without any empirical results, it's hard to agree that the design choices for action spaces and retrieval augmentation are genuinely meaningful. While the proofs appear sound, given the action space design, it remains unclear whether this framework is predictive of the actual computational complexity of LM-based agentic systems in the end. The design choices were mostly motivated by citing some related method, but it's unclear if that motivation is sufficient. \n\n(9) Would the authors be willing to include empirical results, such as comparing different agentic systems (matching their proposed decision processes) on a single, simple agentic, even if contrived, benchmark? While probably out of scope, work like [1] compares AIDE and AIRA as agentic systems with different node selection techniques on MLEBench. Would it be feasible to make predictions about the performance of these systems with your framework?\n\n(10) Alternatively to (9), could the authors further motivate how their choices for the action space are necessary and sufficient to represent agentic systems? While intuitive, it is hard to grasp why, e.g., the agent function in Section 3.1 only has the 3 subactions\n\n\n[1] AI Research Agents for Machine Learning: Search, Exploration, and Generalization in MLE-bench, Toledo et al. 2025,"}, "questions": {"value": "The reviewer listed all questions in the Weakness section, enumerated.
