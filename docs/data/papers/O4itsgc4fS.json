Classical system identification relies on fixed models of predictable behavior, while modern neural forecasting often sacrifices structure for flexibility. KIND operates at their intersection: it decomposes time series into components governed by stationary (model-driven) and transient (attention-driven) dynamics. These components are modeled independently via Koopman operators acting on lifted embeddings and fused through a Kalman-inspired, uncertainty-weighted blending mechanism. Crucially, KIND learns to estimate its own predictive confidence, enabling it to identify unfamiliar dynamics, adapt its forecasts, and express when its outputs can be trusted. A physics-informed pretraining strategy further strengthens its stationary pathway, encouraging robust separation of dynamic modes. Across both real-world and benchmark datasets - including superconducting radio frequency cavity measurements and electricity load forecasting - KIND demonstrates competitive accuracy, interpretable uncertainty, and resilience to distributional shifts, outperforming classical methods like Online DMD and competing neural models such as Koopa.", "tldr": "KIND leverages Koopman operators and uncertainty-weighted blending to forecast nonstationary time series with interpretable confidence scores.", "keywords": ["Koopman operator", "operator learning", "hybrid models", "time series forecasting", "uncertainty-aware prediction", "dynamical systems", "scientific machine learning"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/80e1e814d7bb3d7b0f19056dea4ed4103b06844d.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/aeea2f87136a464939bcd235f7dce9a2e79b2303.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes KIND (Kalman-Inspired Neural Decomposition), a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates Koopman operator theory with uncertainty-aware neural modeling.

The paper introduces a novel hybrid forecasting framework, KIND, that explicitly blends stationary and transient dynamics through a Koopman-operator-based structure with learned uncertainty weighting. While Koopman models and Transformer forecasters have been studied independently, their integration via a Kalman-inspired uncertainty-driven fusion is both conceptually elegant and practically innovative. The idea of treating uncertainty as a control variable for model blending represents a creative extension of operator-theoretic learning.\n2. The paper is clearly structured and easy to follow. Conceptual diagrams (e.g., Figure 1) effectively communicate the model architecture and blending process. The authors maintain a coherent narrative throughout, explaining each design choice with intuition grounded in system identification and control theory. The writing is precise and avoids unnecessary complexity despite the technical depth of the topic.\n3. KIND addresses a practically important and underexplored gap in time-series forecasting—how to jointly model interpretable stationary dynamics and adaptive transient behaviors under uncertainty. The approach has strong implications for physics-informed machine learning, control systems, and nonstationary signal forecasting. By demonstrating competitive accuracy alongside interpretable uncertainty quantification, the paper advances the field toward more trustworthy and adaptive operator-theoretic models."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The experimental validation of the paper is somewhat limited. The authors compare KIND only against Koopa and Online DMD, which does not provide a sufficiently comprehensive evaluation. To convincingly demonstrate the model’s advantages, the paper should include comparisons with more recent Koopman-based approaches such as SKOLR [1] and Koopman Neural Forecaster (KNF) [3], as well as state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models from the broader literature, such as iTransformer [2]. Moreover, the experimental datasets—ETTh2, TESLA cavity, and M4 Hourly—are too few and domain-specific. Evaluations on a wider variety of datasets (e.g., weather, traffic, or financial time series) would make the empirical evidence more robust and generalizable.\n2. Although the paper’s motivation and title emphasize forecasting under non-stationary dynamics, there is no quantitative measurement of non-stationarity to support the claims. Without such metrics, it is difficult to assess whether KIND indeed performs better on highly non-stationary data. Incorporating statistical indicators such as the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test or related non-stationarity measures, and reporting performance across varying degrees of non-stationarity, would strengthen the empirical argument.\n3. The related work section is not sufficiently comprehensive. The discussion omits several relevant advances in both general time-series forecasting (e.g., iTransformer [2]) and Koopman-based modeling (e.g., KNF [3], SKOLR [1]). A more systematic comparison to these recent methods would help clarify the novelty and positioning of KIND within the broader landscape of operator-theoretic and neural forecasting models.\n4. The paper provides too few visual comparisons. The qualitative results primarily focus on Online DMD, while omitting visual comparisons with Koopa or other baselines. Including more visual case studies, especially in complex or transient regimes, would make the interpretability and uncertainty-awareness claims more convincing. Richer qualitative analysis—e.g., uncertainty evolution plots, regime transitions, and multi-model overlays—would substantially enhance the clarity and impact of the experimental section.\n\n[1] SKOLR: Structured Koopman Operator Linear RNN for Time-Series Forecasting\n\n[2] iTransformer: Inverted Transformers Are Effective for Time Series Forecasting\n\n[3] Koopman Neural Forecaster for Time Series with Temporal Distribution Shifts"}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "fMpzzD5BsE", "forum": "O4itsgc4fS", "replyto": "O4itsgc4fS", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7274/Reviewer_bYUX"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7274/Reviewer_bYUX"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7274/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761203546581, "cdate": 1761203546581, "tmdate": 1762919402282, "mdate": 1762919402282, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose KIND, a hybrid forecasting architecture that generates uncertainty-aware predictions by integrating stationary and transient dynamics through Koopman operators.
