Intuitively, different problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a ``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm offers valuable insights for future work.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Audio Language Model", "Reinforcement Learning", "Difficulty-aware Reasoning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ce72dcefb9fd142af1f6601d1f7c056ad6d96521.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents Think Smart, Not Hard, a reinforcement-learning framework that enables difficulty-adaptive reasoning for Large Audio Language Models (LALMs). The key insight is that current LALMs, trained via SFT or GRPO, apply uniform reasoning depth regardless of question difficulty—causing redundant “overthinking” for easy tasks and shallow reasoning for complex ones.\nTo address this, the authors propose two difficulty-adaptive, length-based reward functions: (1) Group Ratio Difficulty Reward (GRDR), which estimates difficulty from the correctness ratio of sampled rollouts, and (2) Group Audio-Attention Difficulty Reward (GA2DR), which derives difficulty from attention-entropy over audio tokens. These rewards dynamically link reasoning length to model-perceived difficulty, encouraging concise reasoning for simple inputs and deeper reasoning for challenging ones.
