Existing studies typically explore a wide range of pretraining strategies with heterogeneous corpora and directly unify these tasks through mixture training to enhance the generalization of GUI agents. However, the direct unification of existing pretraining strategies leads to inconsistent training objectives and data heterogeneity, preventing the full potential of each pretraining task from being realized. In this paper, we present a unified framework, \\textbf{M}asked \\textbf{T}rajectory \\textbf{P}rediction (MTP), which consolidates diverse pretraining strategies into a consistent training objective via a masking-based manner. Specifically, we collect open-source GUI corpora that encompass a broad range of logical and semantic coherence, including randomly generated action–screenshot pairs, GUI tutorial data, and human-annotated datasets. Then, MTP models each GUI multi-interaction as a trajectory and defines pretraining objectives through component masking and prediction. Furthermore, to handle the heterogeneity across open-source corpora, we design a role-aware adapter learning module that dynamically routes each token to an appropriate optimization path. Extensive experiments on four representative GUI navigation benchmarks (AndroidControl, GUI-Odyssey, AITZ, and Mind2Web) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework. By unifying existing pretraining objectives, MTP significantly outperforms prior methods and achieves SOTA results. The code and dataset will be publicly released.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["GUI Agent"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/721a39f364eca28d51f3a09b6b1cdade0e40ef9e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/04bab707c33487fa08078c9f1f000b0eccd5220c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes MTP, a framework for the unified modeling of GUI data.

Through masked trajectory prediction and a role-aware adapter learning module, the model learns effectively from diverse types of training data.\n2. **Clever Adapter Design:** The role-aware adapter learning module ingeniously trains multiple LoRA adapters to create a routing mechanism, which helps to further mitigate the negative impacts of data heterogeneity."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Unified Modeling May Not Address Core Data Heterogeneity:** The idea of unified trajectory modeling is interesting but may not solve the fundamental problem of data heterogeneity. The authors classify GUI data into STP, ACP, and MP. While this classification is reasonable from a data format perspective, it doesn't delve into the essential capabilities of a GUI agent. A truly capable GUI agent requires domain knowledge, environmental awareness, and GUI reasoning. A training approach that starts from these core capabilities would be more meaningful than one that merely unifies data formats. A brute-force unification cannot resolve the skewed data distribution for each required capability, especially given that the distribution of open-source GUI agent data is severely imbalanced (e.g., abundant grounding data at 50-100M samples vs. scarce trajectory data around 100K). This introduces deeper issues related to data balancing and quality. For related perspectives, see the UI-Tars series[1,2] and OpenCUA[3].\n2. **Misclassification of OS-Genesis Data:** Having thoroughly studied the OS-Genesis paper and its data, I am certain that its synthetic trajectories contain high-level instructions. According to this paper's own definitions, these should be classified as \"semantically coherent trajectories.\" However, they are classified as \"logically coherent trajectories,\" which is clearly incorrect.\n3. **Lack of Online Benchmark Evaluation:** The experiments are missing an evaluation on online benchmarks, such as AndroidWorld. A GUI agent's true utility can only be proven by its performance in real-world, dynamic environments.\n4. **Typo in Figure 2:** There is a drawing error in Figure 2. In the text portion, the components in $a_2m_3[Mask]$ are not separated by commas.\n\n[1] Qin Y, Ye Y, Fang J, et al.

I understand some actions can be generalized, but how can the model cover the desktop action space without fundamental actions like `click`, `rightClick`, and `scroll`?\n2. **Benchmark Coverage:** Following the previous question, if the data covers five operating systems, the evaluation should also include benchmarks from these different platforms. The current benchmarks are almost all for Android (AndroidControl, GUI-Odyssey, AITZ), with only one for the web (Mind2Web). There is a complete lack of desktop benchmarks. Perhaps the authors could evaluate on an offline desktop benchmark like AGENTNETBENCH[1]? This would be more convenient than online benchmarks like OSWorld or WAA, although an online desktop evaluation would be a more powerful response.\n3. **Gains from Role-Aware Adapter Learning:** My understanding is that the role-aware adapter learning module is intended to route heterogeneous data on top of the unified model to further mitigate performance degradation from data diversity. The idea is good, but the experimental results do not show a significant gain. What could be the potential reasons for this?\n4. **Suggestions for Figure 2:** I suggest improving Figure 2 by explicitly illustrating the different trajectory types. The formulas can be removed from the figure as they are already present in the text. Additionally, making the visual representations for inst, m, r, and a more distinct would improve clarity.\n5. **Clarification on \"m\":** Perhaps I missed it, but I could not find a clear definition for the component labeled 'm'. Is it intended to represent the screenshot?\n6. **Clarification on Lines 264-266:** I do not fully understand the statement in lines 264-266: \"trajectories can contain up to six components but often include only a subset.\" What do these six components specifically represent? Neither the text nor Figure 3 provides a clear explanation.\n\n[1] Wang X, Wang B, Lu D, et al.
