While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92$\\times$ FLOPs and 1.48$\\times$ latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40$\\times$ FLOPs and 1.35$\\times$ latency speedup for high-res video generation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Video Generation", "Sparse Attention", "Training Acceleration", "MoBA"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/578df830f9336fa03e3db92b32451e31dfeb7890.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper examines the quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms and proposes a novel and efficient sparse attention mechanism for video diffusion models.

This is not a trivial adaptation as the paper performs insightful analysis to draw the useful conclusions. \n\nThe paper performs the analysis on a full attention DiT model and observe that different layers may have its own focus on spatial, temporal and its combination with respect to different layers. This put forwards the idea of layerwise block partition for 1-2-3D. This types of pattern distinction seem not be widely confirmed in the previous video diffusion models. \n\nRegarding the global block selection, the paper also makes a good observation by identifying the limitation of query-independent selection. For each attention head, all the queries are grouped to perform the block section. To determine the number of blocks selected, the paper adopts a threshold-based Block Selection to determine the number of selected blocks dynamically. This strength might not be that significant compared to the other two."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The paper also shows several weakness that requires further attentions. The paper uses Wan 2.1 1.3B as the base model and implements the proposed idea. All assumptions such as the 1-2-3D attention patterns were derived from such full attention DiT. It is unclear whether this VMoBA can also be adapted to other video diffusion models based on full attention DiT. This needs to be further validated with other full attention DiT models. This could be the main weakness of this paper so far. \n\nThe paper could better lay out the performances for the proposed method compared to the others listed in Tables. The paper uses the highlighted color to indicate the performance from the proposed method. However, it is better to indicate which metric the proposed algorithm performs the best, similar to other used baselines. After all, based on the given tables results, the proposed method does not perform the best among all the metrics. This could present some confusions. \n\nThe assumption about heads having different concentration levels motivate the design threshold-based block selection. This assumption also relies on some empirical observation where 30% and 50% cutoff lines for each head was used. These numbers could be different across different models. It will be nice to have a more generalized treatment of these selections. \n\nThe paper shows some interesting results on training longer sequences, which is critical in video diffusion models.
