Existing studies mostly address relatively benign scenarios, namely benchmark datasets with (a) high-dimensional but sparse node features and (b) incomplete data generated under Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanisms. For (a), we theoretically prove that high sparsity substantially limits the information loss caused by missingness, making all models appear robust and preventing a meaningful comparison of their performance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce one synthetic and three real-world datasets with dense, semantically meaningful features. For (b), we move beyond MCAR and design evaluation protocols with more realistic missingness mechanisms. Moreover, we provide a theoretical background to state explicit assumptions on the missingness process and analyze their implications for different methods. Building on this analysis, we propose GNNmim, a simple yet effective approach for node classification with incomplete feature data. Experiments show that GNNmim consistently outperforms specialized architectures across diverse datasets and missingness regimes.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Missing Features", "Graph Neural Networks", "Missing Data Mechanisms"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dd7f6e27313fa79e11ca8487327fbea9d0ec40e5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/61bbb656b77828fcd7849731af69e166c4bc46ca.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper identifies two key challenges with existing datasets to evaluate missing feature-based GNNs: a) High-dimensional but sparse node features where most values are zero, b) Uniform MCAR: a missing mechanism applied to generate incomplete or missing features, which the authors claim to be overly simplistic. Moreover, they identify a more realistic missing setting where the missing feature distribution is different during training and testing.\n\nTo establish these challenges, authors first theoretically show that when feature sparsity is high, a large amount of missingness is required to degrade the model quality and produce meaningful loss of information. The author introduces 1 synthetic and 3 real-world datasets to establish a better benchmark.\n\nThen they establish multiple missingness mechanisms for evaluating and benchmarking the methods and datasets. Namely, they introduce label-dependent MCAR, feature-dependent MNAR, and class-dependent MNAR.\n\nFinally, they introduce from their theory, the Missing Indicator Method (NIM) to model missing features in graph machine learning, GNNmin, where they concatenate the missing feature mask as additional input to GNN.\n\nThe authors show that this simplistic method performs robustly across all datasets and various missing conditions."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "Authors have identified a relevant problem for industry-level deployments of GNNs.
