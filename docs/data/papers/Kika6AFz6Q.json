Recent research has extended graph prompt methods to Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), aiming to improve their cross-domain generalisability from source domains to an unseen target domain by tuning auxiliary prompts using few-shot samples. Despite their progress, most existing GFM prompt methods embed domain-specific information from source domains into prompts, which serve either as input to GFMs or encoded during the GFM pre-training process. This entanglement of prompts with specific source domains and particular GFM pre-training strategy restricts their generalisability to target domains and different GFMs. Furthermore, existing methods merely rely on few-shot data for prompt tuning, neglecting the rich information in unlabelled target domain test data. Motivated by these insights, this paper aims to empower GFMs with a pre-training-agnostic test-time graph prompt tuning framework, named GFMate. GFMate introduces a centroid prompt and a layer prompt applied after pre-training on target domains, avoiding entanglement with the source domains and model pre-training. In addition, a test-time complementary learning objective is devised to exploit both labelled and unlabelled target domain data for effective test-time prompt tuning. Extensive experiments on 12 benchmark datasets across diverse domains demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of GFMate, achieving improvements of up to 30.63\\%.

Conceptual novelty is overstated. The claimed “pre-training-agnostic” feature is somewhat misleading: most existing few-shot or prompt-based GFM methods (e.g., SAMGPT, MDGPT) also freeze the backbone and do not require coupling with pre-training. The difference between few-shot fine-tuning and test-time tuning is incremental.\n\n2. The paper repeatedly asserts that prior prompts are “pre-training-entangled” but does not empirically demonstrate that this entanglement actually harms transferability.\n\n3. The theoretical contribution (the “Excess Risk Bound”) offers no genuine insight into the TGCL mechanism. It restates a generic Rademacher complexity bound without linking assumptions to the graph setting or validating them empirically.\n\n4. The role of complementary labeling is weakly justified. The entropy-based pivot-layer strategy is heuristic, and there is no analysis comparing it with pseudo-labeling or entropy minimization baselines.\n\n5. Some comparisons seem selective: BRIDGE (ICML 2025), a closely related multi-domain GFM with generalization guarantees, is discussed in related work but not included in experiments, which undermines the completeness of evaluation.\n\n6.

Intuitively, if the design of test-time graph complementary learning can remove one wrong answer (by pushing the centroid away from the most dissimilar class), the performance improvement in the binary class task can be greatly improved compared with the 5-class classification task.\n2. The experimental setup is not quite clear. See question below.\n3. In the introduction, the authors claim that existing GFM prompt designs are generally entangled with pre-training on source domains and cannot easily generalize to unseen target domains. This statement seems overstated, as several existing methods have incorporated mechanisms to adapt to target domains. For instance, MDGPT [1] introduces dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to enable adaptation to target domains by leveraging both unified multi-domain knowledge and tailored mixtures of domain-specific knowledge. Then, the authors assert that the domain-specific information learned in the prompts cannot be effectively transferred from source to target domains due to substantial differences in structural and feature patterns. If figure 3 is used to validate the claim, the authors should visualize both the source graph and the target graphs by GFM prompts methods **explicitly**. However, current version of figure 3 fail to convey the misalignment between test distribution and the training distribution. This makes the first challenge less important.\n4. Although the paper presents a generalization bound, the authors do not provide any substantive discussion or interpretation of the theoretical analysis. It remains unclear how the derived gap contributes to understanding the model’s generalization capability, particularly under domain shift or prompt adaptation scenarios. The absence of theoretical insights, such as which factors (e.g., number of classes?) most influence the gap, makes this analysis appear superficial. Without further explanation or empirical validation linking the theoretical findings to observed performance, the inclusion of the generalization gap offers limited theoretical or practical value to the paper’s overall contribution.\n5.

The theoretical support for the idea that this \"entanglement\" is harmful is currently insufficient, which makes the core premise confusing, even in light of the strong experimental results.\n2. The authors attempt to elaborate on the problem in the PRELIMINARY section, but the explanation remains unclear. It is axiomatic that node behaviors differ across domains, which necessitates the injection of domain-related information. The paper would be strengthened if the authors could emphasize **the distinction between injecting domain information at *pre-training time* versus *test-time*.** A thorough discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach is needed.\n\n3.
