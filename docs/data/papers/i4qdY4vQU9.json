In this work, we reveal that a simple training-free propagation operator PROP achieves competitive results over dedicatedly designed GCL methods across diverse node classification benchmarks. We elucidate PROP’s effectiveness by drawing connections with established graph learning algorithms. By decoupling the propagation and transformation phases of graph neural networks, we find that the transformation weights are inadequately learned in GCL and perform no better than random. When the contrastive and downstream objects are misaligned, the attendance of transformation causes the overfitting to the contrastive loss and harms downstream performance. In light of these insights, we remove the transformation entirely and introduce an efficient GCL method termed PROPGCL. We provide theoretical guarantees for PROPGCL and demonstrate its effectiveness through a comprehensive evaluation of node classification tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph Contrastive Learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0d2c37dbe9538764d5d64590d7d436244bb49c54.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3555809f9632ebfb24135e8f23211e4fca067b23.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates simple propagation operators in graph contrastive learning.

Thm. 6.1 provides theoretical guarantees for PROPGCL's advantage when contrastive and downstream objectives are misaligned. These additions address major theoretical gaps from prior versions.\n\n3. The ablation studies in sec. 5.2 are particularly convincing. Tab. 3 shows that (1) GCL struggles to learn effective transformation weights even with optimal propagation coefficients, and (2) GCL can learn informative propagation coefficients when paired with well-trained transformation weights. This provides clear evidence for the main claims.\n\n3.

The title and narrative discuss \"graph contrastive learning\" broadly, but the method focuses on node classification. App. B shows a 2.82% performance gap on graph classification tasks. This suggests fundamental limitations when global graph representations are needed. The paper should either narrow the title and claims to node-level tasks, or provide deeper analysis of why propagation works for node classification but not graph classification.\n\n2. Thm. 6.1 assumes the downstream-relevant component corresponds to low-frequency signals with smoothness. However, heterophilic graphs violate this assumption since connected nodes have different labels. Yet PROPGCL shows its strongest improvements on exactly these datasets. The paper should discuss when these assumptions hold and provide empirical validation of the decomposition in def. 6.1.\n\n3. The paper frames PROP as performing implicit alignment in contrastive learning (thm. 4.2). Yet PROP requires no negative samples and no learned parameters. This blurs what constitutes contrastive learning versus effective preprocessing. Is the finding that simple propagation works well a contribution to GCL methodology, or evidence that the GCL paradigm is unnecessary? The paper should address this more explicitly."}, "questions": {"value": "1.Fig. 2 shows training loss rapidly approaching zero for GCL with transformation.

The experimental results on PROP is very strange. In table 1, PROP, a pure $A^kX$, can perfrom extremely well on heterophilic graphs. The authors explained this that $A^kX$ can smooth all k-hop neighbors. That's ture, but we know Dirichlet energy $H^TLH=\\sum A_{ij}||h_i-h_j||^2$. For $A^k$, it becomes to $\\sum A^k_{ij}||h_i-h_j||^2$. Therefore, minimizing Dirichelet norm just equals to make all nodes within k-hops have similar embeddings. This is against the fact that we have to differentiate neighbor nodes embeddings to work on heterophilic graphs. From graph spectrum, $A^kX$ is a definitely a low-pass filter, while only high-pass filter can perform well on heterophilic graphs.\n\n2.
