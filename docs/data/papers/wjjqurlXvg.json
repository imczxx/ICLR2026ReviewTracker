To evaluate the paraphrases, authors use different metrics, such as whether it is possible to extract the sentence from the answer/or whether it follows the scheme from the prompts (\"sentence production rate\"), whether the meaning of the sentence is preserved, and diversity calculated as Levenshtein or Jaccard distance between the sentences."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "The authors focus on different models, including both fine-tuned smaller versions as well as larger language models used through prompting -- not focusing only on prompting with LLMs leads to a more comprehensive comparison"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Limited novelty of the paper**\n\nOverall the main contribution of the paper is comparing different LLMs in their capability of generating the paraphrases and finding that using larger generation penaly leads to parahphrases that are more diverse -- which is kind of an expected observation, as it forces the model to not reuse the words that already appeared and so generate some wild sentences with larger vocabulary. Similarly, using the metrics such as edit distance does not really tell that much regarding the paraphrases, just that more words from the vocabulary is used -- if we would consider simple paraphrase generation methods, such as word swap or word insertion, these would also achieve high scores in these metrics, while also preserving the meaning (which seems to be problematic for different models) [3].\n\nAt the same time, there are already multiple papers that consider paraphrase generation and increasing their diversity/usefulness (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to name a few) which, in my opinion, go beyond the experiments in this paper. As such, I believe the paper does not bring anything new of value to the conferences of this rank. To be considered, I would expect there to be either significantly larger set of experiments (more models, strategies, approaches, etc.) or introduction of completely different way to evaluate or improve the paraphrasing quality.\n\n**Choice of metrics**\n\nThe choice of metrics for evaluating the quality of paraphrasing is a bit questionable. In essence, there is only evaluation of whether the generated sentence corresponds to the format (or in other words, whether it can be \"extracted\" from the generated text), whether it preserves the meaning (by measuring perplexity using a method introduced in different paper) and the edit distance, which can be easily high even for very similar sentences (using word swaps, inserts, etc.) or by using very niche words. However, I do not believe this provides any information about the quality of the paraphrases -- especially by penalising the generation, the sentences quickly become very strange or even incoherent for humans and are not really useful for any downstream task. Have you checked the generated sentences to check for this?\n\n\n**Missing related work**\n\nThere are already multiple papers that deal with paraphrasing. However, there is almost no mention of previous works (and the paper is completely missing the Related Work section) that would deal with the different problems -- such as the diversity of the paraphrases and how to increase it, other approaches for improving paraphrase generation, or even approaches that use non-LLM approaches (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]). As the focus of the paper is an empirical study of paraphrasing, I would expect there would be a larger number of approaches that are compared with the metrics in the paper.\n\n\n**Readability of the figures/paper as a whole**\n\nThe figures in the paper are hard to interpret. The radar plots use large amount of abbreviations which provides difficulties when interpreting it, while at the same time the choice of colours (and the number of models) do not really help (especially for Figure 2, where there are 3 very similar colours). \n\nAt the same time there are details missing for some of the metrics. For example, Figure 3 represents the \"mean edit/Jaccard distance\". However, most of the models achieve score of 0.6 -- should I interpret it that by changing only less than 1 character I can get to the paraphrase? I would suggest better explaining how this \"mean edit distance\" is calculated and/or normalised -- as it appears to be in the 0-1 interval it would help with interpreting the figures if one can understand what achieving score of 1 means.\n\nFinally, there is a lot of fluff introductory sentences in different sections (e.g., \"Let’s look toward the...\") and grammatical mistakes that make the paper harder to read.\n\n**References**\n1.

The evaluation results demonstrate that adding a starting word or template prefix to the input significantly improves adherence to the output format, while introducing a repetition penalty consistently enhances lexical diversity, thereby increasing diversity. While few-shot prompts can guide the model's learning of the task pattern to some extent, they unexpectedly lead to a more concentrated lexical output in multiple scenarios, reducing diversity.

The comparative experiments covered 1,456 source sentences from four recent corpora, with a unified evaluation process. The results are highly valuable. In terms of experimental design, the authors proposed a \"continuous generation\" approach, which guides model generation by presetting initial words, ensuring consistency in the format of candidate interpretations. This strategy is concise, effective, and easily reusable in engineering practice. Furthermore, the study found that under certain circumstances, few-sample prompts can reduce the lexical diversity of generated results. This negative finding is also significant, serving as a warning against the currently popular \"in-context\" learning approach. This finding is clearly demonstrated through distribution plots and mean tables."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "First, the paper's experimental design for \"multiple generation\" is logically inconsistent. The authors claim that sampling is not used to ensure reproducibility, and that greedy or fixed-beam decoding is used. However, the paper also states that each imperative model generates ten candidate results for the same sentence, repeating the process under different prompt templates and decoding parameters, resulting in 10 outputs per sentence. Under strict fixed-beam settings, the same input should not produce diverse outputs. The authors need to clearly explain the source of the randomness of these ten generation attempts, such as whether random scoring, random seeds, beam grouping perturbations, or input noise injection are involved. Otherwise, these samples are not statistically independent, and subsequent significance analysis will lose its basis. \n\nSecond, the construction of the overall indicators 𝐻_{𝑚, 𝑝, 𝑑} lacks theoretical support. In formula (1), semantic fidelity and format adherence are given equal weights, while edit distance and Jaccard coefficient related to lexical diversity are each included with half weight. The paper does not explain the rationale for this weighting, nor does it perform dimensional normalization or sensitivity analysis. The authors are advised to standardize each sub-metric, such as using z-score or min-max normalization, and report the changes in results under different weighting combinations to verify the robustness of the composite metric. They should also clarify why \"format conformance\" and \"semantically equivalent interpretations\" are given equal weight, and why diversity is assessed separately rather than combined.\n\nFor the semantic fidelity assessment, the paper relies entirely on the LLM judge, ParaPLUIE, which introduces potential common bias. Although the authors have added regularization checking and language detection modules, ParaPLUIE itself belongs to a similar language model system and is prone to similar biases as the tested model when faced with sensitive topics (such as questions related to climate change). The authors are advised to include three human reviewers on a subset of samples to calibrate ParaPLUIE's accuracy and supplement it with multiple heterogeneous metrics for cross-validation, such as STS-B, BLEURT, or a calibrated BARTScore. Furthermore, metrics and threshold sweep curves could be reported separately for both highly controversial and common registers to verify the consistency of the model's judgments.\n\nThe conclusion that \"few-shot prompts reduce diversity\" also needs to be interpreted with caution. The current experiment strictly prohibits sampling and imposes a strong repetition penalty. Under this setting, the examples presented in the few-shot prompts can form a significant style prior, causing the model output to approach the linguistic neighborhood of the example template. This may be an artifact of the setting. It is recommended that the authors introduce slight temperature or top-p sampling as a control, without compromising the overall control conditions, to verify the robustness of this conclusion. Furthermore, the authors could compare the \"constrained decoding\" and \"prefix start token\" control methods and report length-normalized diversity metrics to eliminate the influence of sentence length on edit distance and Jaccard.\n\nThe LLM dataset used in the paper is potentially contaminated. The authors acknowledge that the LLM corpus is derived from PAWS and MRPC, and this data is likely present in the training corpus of some models. To ensure the fairness of the evaluation, the overlapping parts should be further detected, such as by using n-gram or MinHash to remove duplicate statistics, and the performance of the model on seen samples and unseen samples should be reported separately. In addition, the version number and release time of each model should be clearly stated to avoid misleading results caused by the overlap of training and evaluation data in time.\n\nFinally, it is suggested that there is an inherent coupling problem between the template and the format adherence rate. Since the \"continuous generation\" method itself imposes an output pattern in the input, the \"format adherence rate\" indicator partially reflects the constraint effect of the template design rather than the model's own compliance ability. It is recommended that the author report this indicator separately when not using continuous generation to remove the bias caused by the control measures.\n\nThere are still some details that need to be improved in terms of charts and expressions. The field naming and typesetting of Tables 3 and 4 are not standardized, Figures 1 to 3 lack confidence intervals or significance marks, and the symbols in Formula (1) are not systematically explained in the text. Overall, the clarity of the charts and symbols needs to be improved so that readers can accurately understand the experimental design and results.\n\nThe current version ignores research on unsupervised, search-based paraphrasing, making the article's methodological comparison incomplete. The authors are advised to supplement their discussion of this area in the revision and clarify the differences and connections between this paper and unsupervised methods based on global search, such as Unsupervised Paraphrasing by Simulated Annealing."}, "questions": {"value": "(1) Under the premise of no-sampling, how to obtain diverse candidates of \"10 times per sentence\"?

Overall the study feels incremental - building on an already existing paper [1]. In other words, the paper seems to mainly follow the framework and settings of [1] but explores a couple of hyperparameter variations. The results are also not particularly surprising - such as repetition penalty can increase diversity. \n\n2. Terminology seems inconsistent - especially in evaluation. For example: in the beginning \"Sentence production rate\" and \"Meaning preservation\" is mentioned. The later section mentions the use of ParaPLUIE. Then this is not mentioned anymore. Harmonic score mentions \"Para\" and \"Scheme\" without clearly linking back to whether it is talking about ParaPLUIE and sentence production rate. \n\n3. Unclear how well the proposed harmonic overall score reflects human judgment.\n\n4. Scheme adherence evaluation seems a bit superfluous. It seems like mainly a matter of adhering to a format like \"x) [paraphrase]\". This doesn't really seem like a real problem for modern LLMs and tools, as one can do structured generation using outlines/instructor etc. and/or use retries. But in this case, it's not even clear if adherance to structure is all necessary here.\n\n5. I am unclear on the effectiveness or meaningfulness in using an LLM-generated paraphrase corpora in evaluating LLMs for paraphrasing. If we are at the point where LLM-generated corpus can be treated as ground truth - shouldn't this be considered essentially a solved problem? What's a selling point here? We can just use the same strategy as was used for generating the ground truth in practice then. \n\n6. Unclear why no penalty setting uses beam size 1, and others beam size 5. Saying decoding strategy as greedy and beam size as 5 sounds like a contradiction because greedy decoding is beam size with 1 effectively. Moreover, the study seems to miss out the most basic strategy for increasing diversity - i.e using some temperature. Beam decoding is known for lower diversity, and greedy search is effectively temperature 0. \n\n[1] Paraphrase Generation Evaluation Powered by an LLM:\nA Semantic Metric, Not a Lexical One"}, "questions": {"value": "Why use different beam size for no penalty vs small/high penalty?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "xXncurJ26n", "forum": "wjjqurlXvg", "replyto": "wjjqurlXvg", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19083/Reviewer_dJea"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19083/Reviewer_dJea"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19083/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761558291204, "cdate": 1761558291204, "tmdate": 1762931105748, "mdate": 1762931105748, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "**Review Summary of 'Few-Shot Paraphrase Generation with LLMs: An Empirical Study of Models and Hyperparameters'**\n\nThis paper offers a detailed empirical evaluation of LLMs on paraphrase generation, with a particular focus on maximizing lexical diversity while maintaining meaning. It compares two types of models: small fine-tuned paraphrasers (e.g., BART, T5) and medium-sized instruction-tuned chat models (3B–8B), tested across four curated datasets. Each model is evaluated with varying prompting schemes (zero-, one-, and four-shot), two prompt styles (standard vs. vulgar), and two output formats (free vs. continuation-style). A total of 10 prompting templates are defined.\n\nThe decoding strategy uses beam search only, with three penalty settings (none, small, huge) to promote diversity, notably omitting stochastic sampling. Evaluation spans three axes: format adherence, semantic fidelity (via ParaPLUIE), and lexical diversity (edit and Jaccard distance).\n\nKey findings include: (1) prefix-guided output formatting significantly boosts adherence, (2) diversity penalties increase lexical diversity without heavily sacrificing meaning, and (3) few-shot prompting often reduces diversity—likely due to overfitting to example styles.
