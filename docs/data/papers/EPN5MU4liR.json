While recent works extend Gaussians with learnable textures to enrich visual appearance, existing approaches allocate a fixed square texture per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability. In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats. This design significantly improves texture efficiency, reducing memory consumption while enhancing image quality. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that A$^2$TG consistently outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Computer Vision;Novel View Synthesis:Neural Rendering;3D Gaussian Splatting"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/23e3e324c258f6116f09b1aa4867fbed4ccd9121.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper targets the inefficiency of assigning uniformly sized, square per-primitive textures in Gaussian-splatting pipelines.

This limitation arises from their restricted texture representation, which uses only a single color from a fixed viewpoint. Textured Gaussians, such as GStex, HDGS, Billboard Splatting, and SuperGaussians, represent significant advancements in this domain, enhancing Gaussian splatting with textures for improved 3D reconstruction. However, these methods do not account for the adaptive control of GS textures, leading to inefficiencies, as different primitives require varying levels of texture detail. Building on this insight, this paper introduces adaptive textures for GS, enabling variable resolutions for each primitive and along different axes. This approach is both innovative and practical.\n\n- The results are impressive and highly satisfactory. As demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 2, A^2GS achieves superior performance with reduced storage requirements thanks to its adaptive control of GS texture resolutions. Additionally, Figure 3 highlights the method’s superiority in reconstructing fine details."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The first weakness lies in the methodology and is quite fundamental. The paper does not clarify how textures are fetched based on UV coordinates. Is it through bilinear interpolation or nearest neighbor? If bilinear interpolation is used, Equation 6 omits the terms \\(\\frac{\\partial c_l(x_j)}{\\partial \\mu_{i,x}}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial c_l(x_j)}{\\partial \\mu_{i,y}}\\), as \\(c_l(x_j)\\) is linearly related to the UV coordinates. On the other hand, if bilinear interpolation is not used, the optimization process and model capability are constrained. Since the positions of Gaussian splats (GS) are jointly optimized, if the gradients of textures are not related to the intersection coordinates, the texture map gradients cannot effectively guide GS movements for better fitting. Furthermore, using nearest neighbor (NN) queries results in discontinuous textures, which could reduce overall quality.\n\nThe second weakness concerns the experiments. The paper does not evaluate rendering speed, an essential aspect of the approach. Because GS textures have varying resolutions, the indexing of each GS texture is non-uniform. As a result, within each CUDA grid, it is impossible to define a fixed-length shared array for threads within the grid and move the data in parallel from the global to the shared. Consequently, textures must be fetched from the global CUDA memory, which is slower. Additionally, calculating the cumulative sum of each GS texture resolution to obtain the global base index for each GS texture adds computational overhead. These factors likely impact rendering speed and should be evaluated to demonstrate the tradeoff between performance and speed. While a reduction in speed is acceptable to an extent, maintaining real-time performance (>30 FPS) is crucial. If the speed drops below this threshold, the limitation should be explicitly acknowledged as a significant constraint.\n\nThe third weakness pertains to the conclusion section. A visible but minor limitation is that the method does not address reducing texture resolution dynamically. For instance, if a GS is optimized to have finer textures during an incorrect stage of the process but later becomes smaller or moves to textureless regions, the high-resolution texture may no longer be necessary. Addressing this issue could further improve efficiency. Additionally, while the proposed method makes substantial contributions to GS textures, it raises the possibility of combining adaptive textures with flexible 2D primitives, such as Deformable Radial Kernel Splatting. This combination could enable both flexible boundary shapes and sharpness while preserving richer texture representations. These two points should be considered as limitations and opportunities for future work."}, "questions": {"value": "My suggestions are as follows: (1) provide a detailed explanation of the texture color query process using UV coordinates; (2) include an evaluation of the rendering speed; and (3) revise the conclusion section. I believe addressing these points will significantly enhance the quality of the paper, and I would be inclined to raise the score. While I acknowledge the novelty and contribution of the paper, improving these aspects is essential to further strengthen its overall quality."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "xbq8qqGkdQ", "forum": "EPN5MU4liR", "replyto": "EPN5MU4liR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23301/Reviewer_GiPV"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23301/Reviewer_GiPV"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23301/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761973445522, "cdate": 1761973445522, "tmdate": 1762942596656, "mdate": 1762942596656, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
