High spatial and temporal resolution, coupled with a strong signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), has made 7-Tesla (7T) blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) an invaluable tool for understanding how the brain processes visual stimuli. However, the limited availability of 7T MRI systems means that most research relies on 3-Tesla (3T) scans, which offer lower spatial and temporal resolution and SNR. This naturally raises the question: Can we enhance the spatiotemporal resolution and SNR of 3T BOLD fMRI data to approximate 7T quality? In this study, we propose a novel framework that aligns 7T and 3T fMRI data from different subjects and datasets in a shared parametric domain. We then apply an unpaired Brain Disk Schrödinger Bridge (BDSB) diffusion model to enhance the spatiotemporal resolution and SNR of the 3T data. Our approach addresses the challenge of limited 7T data by improving the 3T scan quality. We demonstrate its effectiveness by testing it on three distinct public fMRI retinotopy datasets (one 7T, one 3T, and one paired 3T/7T), as well as synthetic data. The results show that our method significantly improves the SNR and goodness-of-fit of the population receptive field (pRF) retinotopic decoding in the enhanced 3T data, making it comparable to 7T quality.

The primary issue with this submission lies in its scientific rigor and validation design. The authors claim that BOLD signals obtained from 7T MRI can be effectively mapped to or synchronized with evolving time series from 3T scanners. However, this assumption is not convincingly supported. It remains highly questionable whether (1) temporal synchronization between 3T and 7T acquisitions can be achieved with sufficient precision, and (2) whether the spatial correspondence of voxel- or surface-level activations can be meaningfully aligned across different field strengths. From a machine learning standpoint, however, the 3T and 7T datasets should ideally be paired or co-registered at the subject level to enable cross-modality learning. Without a clear justification or evidence supporting this assumption, the technical soundness of the proposed framework is undermined.\n\n2) **Projection Method**. The use of 2D conformal mapping to reduce fMRI data complexity is conceptually interesting, yet it raises serious concerns about potential information loss during the projection from high-dimensional cortical surfaces to a 2D representation. This approach may oversimplify the spatial geometry of the brain and distort the topological structure of functional activations. The authors should consider or at least discuss alternative representations, such as spherical harmonics (see the well-established approach by Anderson et al., NeuroImage, 2010), which preserve surface geometry while enabling efficient spectral decomposition.\n\n3) **Replicability and Test-Retest Validation.** Given that this is a neuroimaging study, replicability testing is a crucial standard for evaluating robustness. The current manuscript lacks experiments on test–retest datasets, which are commonly used to assess the reliability of functional signals and model generalization. The authors should include such analyses or provide clear justification for their omission.\n\n4) **Temporal Resolution Limitation**. Finally, the authors should acknowledge the inherent limitation that the proposed method primarily enhances spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but does not address the true temporal resolution gap in fMRI. The fundamental challenge remains the coarse temporal sampling (on the order of 1 s) compared to neuronal timescales (milliseconds). The paper would be stronger if it explicitly discussed this limitation and clarified whether the proposed method could, in principle, be extended to improve temporal fidelity.\n\n5) **Limited novelties**. This work is a combination of existing components such as conformal mapping and Schrodinger bridge model."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The paper projects the cortical surface into a 2D disk before applying the Schrödinger bridge model. How much geometric distortion is introduced by this mapping, and how might it affect spatial correspondence between the 3T and 7T fMRI data?\n2. Why was a 2D conformal mapping chosen instead of a spherical or spectral representation (e.g., spherical harmonics)? Would the latter preserve global topology more faithfully?\n3. How are the boundary conditions handled in the 2D disk representation, given that cortical manifolds are not naturally disk-like?\n4. The model learns a flow between 3T and 7T BOLD signals, but are these data temporally synchronized or spatially paired? Without strict pairing, how can the model distinguish physiological differences from scanner-induced variability?\n5. How does the model ensure that synthesized 7T fMRI signals retain biologically meaningful temporal and spectral properties (e.g., frequency content, signal-to-noise ratio)?\n6. Although an ablation study is presented (Table 3), it primarily focuses on different surface mapping strategies and regularization terms. Was any ablation performed to isolate the contribution of the Schrödinger bridge formulation itself—e.g., by comparing with a baseline model without the bridge constraint or with a standard flow-based mapping?\n7. The model is trained on a small dataset of paired 3T–7T scans. Can it generalize to other sites, scanners, or acquisition protocols?\n8.
