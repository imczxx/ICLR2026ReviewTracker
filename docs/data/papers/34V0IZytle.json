In this work, we propose an alternative perspective: their success arises from implicitly learning the data manifold rather than the full distribution. Our claim is based on a novel analysis of scores in the small-$\\sigma$ regime that reveals a sharp separation of scales: information about the data manifold is $\\Theta(\\sigma^{-2})$ stronger than information about the distribution. We argue that this insight suggests a paradigm shift from the less practical goal of distributional learning to the more attainable task of geometric learning, which provably tolerates $O(\\sigma^{-2})$ larger errors in score approximation. We illustrate this perspective through three consequences: i) in diffusion models, concentration on data support can be achieved with a score error of $o(\\sigma^{-2})$, whereas recovering the specific data distribution requires a much stricter $o(1)$ error; ii) more surprisingly, learning the uniform distribution on the manifold—an especially structured and useful object—is also $O(\\sigma^{-2})$ easier; and iii) in Bayesian inverse problems, the maximum entropy prior is $O(\\sigma^{-2})$ more robust to score errors than generic priors.

The authors go on to argue that from a methodological perspective, the aim should be to estimate the manifold rather than the distribution since this task can be done successfully even with larger errors in the score estimation; in this sense, geometric learning is easier than distribution learning. Additionally, the authors propose a sampling algorithm to sample from the uniform distribution on the manifold given a score function estimator.

It also seems natural to me from a generalization perspective that the manifold ought to be the target. It is also quite nice that a simple (one-line!) modification to the sampling dynamics can tolerate higher score errors and give uniformly distributed samples on the manifold. The paper is written very clearly and the authors provide good exposition. The experiments indeed show better diversity as one expects from targeting the manifold rather than the data generating distribution."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1) The result of Theorem 4.1 requires an $L^\\infty$ bound on the score estimation error. This is quite stringent and undesirable, especially since diffusion models are typically trained via score matching which is an $L^2$ loss. Furthermore, there is some empirical evidence that $L^\\infty$ assumptions are not typically satisfied in practice (e.g. see Section 3.1 of \"Fast Sampling of Diffusion Models with Exponential Integrator\", Zhang & Chen 2023). The authors do note this in their Limitations section, but it is a weakness nonetheless. \n\n2) The results in Theorem 3.1 are somewhat qualitative (i.e. consistency results and weak convergence), and it would be a stronger paper if quantitative rates in some distance (e.g. Wasserstein distance) were available. For example, if E(\\sigma) = o(1), is it meaningfully easier to estimate the uniform distribution on $M$ rather than the true $p_{\\text{data}}$? If it is not, then perhaps the justification for geometric learning becomes weaker. \n\n3) I'm confused about the justification for learning the uniform distribution from the Bayesian Inverse problem perspective. I agree that choosing it as the uniform yields a weaker score estimation condition for correct posterior sampling. But I'm not convinced this is by itself a good enough reason. There is strong information that is being lost by switching to the uniform distribution which might have resulted in a \"better\" posterior distribution but harder to sample from. It's not obviously clear why this is less desirable than a less informed prior with easier sampling requirements."}, "questions": {"value": "1) Can the authors discuss regularity conditions on $p_{\\text{data}}$? It seems that learning the uniform distribution on the manifold can get quite difficult if there are meaningful regions on $M$ where $p_{\\text{data}}$ is very small. But this doesn't seem to be reflected in any of the results. Is this due to the qualitative nature of Theorem 3.1? It would be very clarifying if the authors could discuss this point in some detail.\n\n2) Can the authors provide some high-level discussion on sample complexity? With finite data, is it the case that learning the uniform distribution on $M$ is only going to be feasible when $p_{\\text{data}}$ is bounded above and below by a constant on its support (i.e. there's enough mass everywhere on the manifold)?\n\n3) What are the difficulties in getting a quantitative version of Theorem 3.1 (say in Wasserstein distance or something else)?

The analysis is performed towards the stationary distributions of the various score function, rather than the distributions obtained from the denoising dynamics (i.e. reverse ODE / SDE) as in score-based generative models. Hence it is unclear to what extent the theoretical insights derived for the former idealized setting also hold for the latter (even in the continuous-time setup). In the latter case, for example, even small deviations in the score function can cause the final distribution to be supported beyond the manifold.\n\n2. In particular, I wonder whether it tends to take longer for the TS dynamics to converge to the stationary distribution than the (untempered) Langevin dynamics. Intuitively I suspect this is the case since the drift is reduced with $\\alpha > 0$. As the theoretical analysis is concerned only with the stationary distributions, the results are unable to address questions regarding the rate of convergence, which are nevertheless quite relevant for practice.\n\n3. In the paragraph after Theorem 5.2, the authors claim that the TS scheme helps with recovering \"the uniform distribution on the data manifold from samples of $p_{data}$\", but I don't see a justification of this by the theoretical results. In fact, all the main theoretical results require the regularity assumption (Assumption 2.2) that the noiseless distribution $p_{data}$ has a continuously differentiable density on the manifold, which does not hold in the case of empirical distributions of finite samples.\n\n4. In Remark 4.1 on Page 5, the authors claim that the assumption of a compact support of the limiting distribution is reasonable because \"many diffusion models apply clipping to generated samples\". I think this is a bit misleading - applying clipping as a post-processing step after sampling doesn't affect the properties of the stationary distributions of the score functions, about which the assumptions are stated.\n\nTypos:\n1.
