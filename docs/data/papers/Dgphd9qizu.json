However, the resource-intensive nature of fMRI acquisition limits the availability of high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often remain challenging in replicating their inherent non-stationarity, intricate spatiotemporal dynamics, and physiological variations of raw BOLD signals. To address these challenges, we propose Dual-Spectral Flow Matching (DSFM), a novel fMRI generative framework that cascades dual frequency representation of BOLD signals with spectral flow matching. Specifically, our framework first converts BOLD signals into a wavelet decomposition map via a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to capture globalized transient and multi-scale variations, and projects into the discrete cosine transform (DCT) space across brain regions and time to exploit localized energy compaction of low-frequency dominant BOLD coefficients. Subsequently, a spectral flow matching model is trained to generate class-conditioned cosine-frequency representation. The generated samples are reconstructed through inverse DCT and inverse DWT operations to recover physiologically plausible time-domain BOLD signals. This dual-transform approach imposes structured frequency priors and preserves key physiological brain dynamics. Ultimately, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through improved downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Generative Models", "Time Series", "Flow Matching"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0df799362818be4ea544040027aa7b13931eac45.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f8fbdfb964ba59b288287fcae89c4660414c30f6.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a method to generate fMRI time-series data. The authors propose a three-step process.\nThe first step computes a time-frequency representation from the training data using a wavelet transform. Then the transformed signals are then transformed using a 2D Discrete Cosine Transform to further localize the low-frequency BOLD spectral components. Then they use a flow-matching approach that operates in the DCT space that relies on an image generation model (U-ViT) to parameterize and train the model that minimizes the \"spectral flow-matching loss\" to learn velocity fields in this space. This process further allows to sample the DCT coefficients by integrating the velocity flow, which is then inverse-transformed (both DCT and wavelet) to generate the reconstructed fMRI signals.

Most approaches have tackled synthetic data generation in modalities such as ECG, EKG, etc., but fMRI time-series generation is complex and thus still remains challenging. Thus this paper makes a good contribution to this problem. \n\nWhile the DCT and DWT (more so for time-series) have been applied to fMRI time-series data individually, they have been done so primarily for filtering, preprocessing, noise/motion removal etc type applications. To my knowledge, the joint approach, i.e. first perform DWT for time-frequency analysis and then low-frequency signal compaction using DCT is new, especially for fMRI time-series application.\n\nThe idea of recasting flow-matching in the spectral domain instead of relying on diffusion models is somewhat novel. This is especially important for fMRI applications, as 4D time-series data is huge and the deterministic ODE-based flow matching idea is magnitudes in order more efficient than diffusion modeling. \n\nThe authors present a method for learning the velocity fields of probability flows directly in the DCT space. They derive the spectral flow-matching loss by diagonalizing the Laplacian operator and then propose the probability flow in the DCT space (proposition 1). This is novel. \n\nThe authors have provided the code for their method including experimental results and validation. This is a strength. However, also see the Questions below."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The main weaknesses in the paper are in the experimental results and aspects related to evaluation of the method on BOLD fMRI time-series applications. \n\nThe generated fMRI signals are not validated using any physiological or neuroscientific basis. They are simply validated by context FID scores. Thus the validation is relying on comparing data distributions where the synthetic data is supposed to have come from. This is weak. \n\nFurthermore, using classification accuracy as a metric to discriminate HC against MDD is a complex high-level application, which may mask underlying subtleties of scanner, population, processing methods etc. Thus it is hard to make any judgement on the actual reconstructed time-series signals.\n\nAblation study is performed on omitting wavelet sub-bands. However, the authors don't comment on the dual-formulation advantage. I.e. is the real gain coming from the spectral representation itself or from flow-matching process, generating the velocity fields in the DCT space. \n\nOnly a single dataset (REST-MDD) is used. The dataset contains 250 Healthy Controls (HC) subjects and 227 individuals diagnosed with MDD. This is a much limited dataset to test the method on. \n\nThe claim \"brain disorder identification\" is both pretty general and strong. One could at best say, the method showed improved performance in classification after using the synthetic time-series on the MDD dataset. On that note, the authors don't mention what MDD is. It is supposed to stand for major depressive disorder. Instead they wrongly use the acronym MDD to denote a general brain disorder. Line 88 says: Our results show that DSFM demonstrates strong performance on unconditional and conditional spectral image synthesis, and achieves improvement in brain disorder (MDD) classification. This is an incorrect terminology. \n\nThe paper visualizes the average connectivity patterns of real and synthetic connectivity patterns. Without knowing the error bars or any quantitative tests, it is difficult to tell if the synthetic data generation method has worked. Visually, one can see differences in anatomical locations in the connectivity patterns from real and synthetic data and even in their differences. Thus the method is not as accurate, but it is not clear by how much. \n\nFor validation purposes, the method does not comment on frequency bands (LF vs HF) that are captured or accurately reflected in the synthetic data. Absence of such low-level measures makes the experimental impact of the contribution, difficult to judge. \n\nThe method is compared to several state of the art time-series generation methods. But comparisons to the more recent rectified-flow matching methods are missing.

It would strengthen the work if the authors could elaborate on what “efficiency” specifically refers to (e.g., faster sampling, fewer function evaluations, or reduced computational cost) and provide quantitative comparisons to substantiate this point.\n\n3. The paper does not include experiments that clarify whether transforming fMRI signals into the frequency domain is strictly necessary. A direct comparison with a latent-space flow matching baseline, i.e., encoding fMRI ROI time series into latent embeddings with transformer encoder without explicit DWT/DCT transforms, would help determine whether the spectral transforms genuinely contribute to the observed improvements in performance or efficiency, or if similar gains could be achieved through compact latent representations.\n\n4. The authors note that their primary goal is not to achieve the best sample quality metrics but rather to improve cFID and conditional modeling of spatiotemporal patterns. However, this statement seems to suggest that the proposed DSFM does not outperform recent baselines (e.g., Diffusion-TS) in unconditional generation quality (Table 1).

Metrics such as power spectral density (PSD) alignment, hemodynamic response function (HRF) consistency, or spatiotemporal smoothness are not evaluated. Including these analyses would substantially strengthen the physiological credibility of the proposed approach. In essence, DSFM produces spectrally and statistically plausible fMRI-like time series rather than neurodynamically meaningful brain processes.

Apart from the diagonalization of the Laplacian and the simpler truncation it enables, why introduce a second spectral projection and why this one?\n\n2/ If B is too large, it will squash multiple ROIs into a single patch, which in turn will make it impossible for the flow to learn the interactions between those ROIs (since they are collapsed).
