For instance, Table 3 shows CsLLM (ALL) performs worse than CsEAE on RAMS (51.84 vs 52.3 Arg-C), but the explanation that \"structural relationships are hard to encode effectively via prompts\" is vague. The paper would benefit from concrete failure case analysis and quantitative measurements of what proportion of errors stem from co-occurrence ambiguity versus noise, and how many of these errors are actually resolved by the proposed modules.\n  - The structure-aware module's design heavily depends on the observation that over 94% (WikiEvents), 82% (RAMS), and 99% (MLEE) of arguments appear in the same sentence as triggers. However, this assumption may not generalize to other document-level EAE scenarios or domains where arguments are more dispersed. The paper does not discuss the lower bound of this locality assumption - at what percentage would the structure-aware attention mechanism become ineffective? Additionally, the distance-based analysis in Figure 4 shows performance drops for arguments far from triggers (d≥15 or d≤-15), which questions the robustness of this locality-based design.\n  - The prompt design for CsLLM lacks detailed justification and ablation. While the paper states that co-occurrence awareness is achieved by \"explicitly annotating all event triggers\" and structure awareness by \"marking the entire sentence that contains the target trigger,\" there is no systematic study of alternative prompt designs. Would different marking strategies (e.g., highlighting only relevant sentences rather than entire sentences, or using different marker tokens) affect performance? The paper also does not compare against more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques or discuss how sensitive the model is to prompt variations.\n  - The zero-shot transfer experiments in Appendix H reveal that CsLLM fails dramatically compared to GPT-4o (20.72 vs 35.69 Arg-C on GENEVA), with the explanation that \"domain confusion\" occurs. This suggests the multi-dataset training approach may overfit to the specific datasets and prompt templates used during training, limiting the model's true generalization capability. The paper attributes MLEE's better zero-shot performance to \"unique medical terms that act as implicit anchors,\" but does not explore whether similar domain-specific features could be systematically incorporated into the prompt design to improve zero-shot transfer more broadly.

Fairness of LLM comparisons. In Table 8 and related discussion, GPT-4o/4o-mini and GPT-3.5 are evaluated in ICL, whereas Llama-3 variants are fine-tuned (and CsLLM is fine-tuned on multiple datasets), making several cross-model claims hard to interpret. Supervised fine-tuning and multi-dataset training confer clear advantages that are not available to closed models, so apples-to-apples takeaways are limited. Please provide controlled comparisons under identical regimes (e.g., ICL-only, or SFT for open-weights models with similar parameter counts; alternatively, a compute-matched data-budget comparison).\n\n2. Risk of over-specializing to trigger-sentence locality. The structure mask forces all non-trigger sentences to attend only to themselves and the trigger sentence, while the trigger sentence can attend to all. This strong inductive bias is justified with locality statistics (e.g., 94%/82%/99% same-sentence arguments), yet the approach could degrade for cross-sentence arguments with long-range dependencies, or for domains where locality is weaker. The paper includes a D=0/D≠0 table on RAMS, but broader robustness testing is thin.\n\n3. Evaluation framing and claims need tightening. Some claims verge on over-interpretation without stronger controls—for example, attributing “exceptional generalization” of CsLLM in one-shot transfer and exceeding GPT-4o on MLEE, while regimes differ (SFT vs ICL) and dataset/domain gaps are substantial. Clarify claims as within-regime or under comparable data/compute.\n\n4. Positioning vs. most relevant recent work could be deeper. The related-work section lists strong, modern baselines (e.g., HMPEAE, HD-LoA, TabEAE), but the paper could better articulate why CsEAE’s prefix-generation differs from/extends recent prefix-based or template-rich approaches and where it may fail (e.g., template quality, noisy co-event detection). A short failure-case analysis would help.\n\n5. Several suggestions: (1) Sensitivity and cost: Report sensitivity to 𝑙𝑒𝑛 (prefix length), number of prefix layers 𝑐, and the cost overhead (inference latency, memory). (2) Hard cases: Add a breakdown for documents with many co-events (where template concatenation becomes long) and for rare roles.

It further introduces CsLLM, a prompt‑based LLM variant that injects analogous co‑occurrence and structure markings and explores multi‑dataset finetuning. On RAMS/WikiEvents/MLEE, the authors report +2.1/+2.3/+3.2 Arg‑C over PAIE (Table 1), and also provide TextEE‑standardized 5‑split results (Table 2). They include ablation for CsEAE’s two modules, distance/overlap analysis, cross‑sentence results (Table 7), and one‑shot/zero‑shot analyses for CsLLM. \n\nRecommendation: Reject in its current form.\nDespite good engineering and helpful analyses, the contribution feels incremental relative to prior document‑level relational modeling, and the empirical gains are modest. More importantly, the paper lacks controlled prompt ablations for the structure added to prompting for CsLLM and efficiency profiling, and mixes evaluation settings across tables in a way that confuses top level claims of gain against PAIE.

Unclear toplevel gains: Table 1 supports +2.1/+2.3/+3.2 Arg‑C over PAIE, but Table 2 (5‑split TextEE) shows smaller gaps (e.g., +0.5 on WikiEvents). Authors should clarify a canonical setting and add statistical significance.\n2. No controlled prompt ablation for CsLLM. There is no variant with only co‑occurrence or only structure markings in the same training setup or with neither, making it hard to attribute CsLLM’s gains to the added graphical structure.\n3. Incremental novelty only: The paper’s contributions are limited in conceptual and empirical scope. The co-occurrence and structure-awareness ideas seem to be largely similar to previously explored relational-attention and sentence-graph concepts (e.g., GIT, GAI, DocEE, etc.). The LLM extension (CsLLM) also has minimal methodological innovation beyond prompt engineering and lacks evidence of distinct benefits from the graph components. Overall, this makes the contribution insufficient for wider ICLR community impact in the current form.\n4. Minimal qualitative analysis and no human evaluation: There is no intuitive evidence of how the two special modules specifically help (e.g., long-distance or coreferent arguments) by qualitative or larger scale human evaluation. The case study in appendix is a good step in this direction. Consider adding to it and analyzing for patterns. \n5.
