Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream, mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding (HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, Math500 +3.8) show that LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6×, making it a strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.", "tldr": "We propose Latent Refinement Decoding, a two-stage diffusion decoding framework that reduces information loss and improves accuracy with faster inference.", "keywords": ["Diffusion Language Models", "Latent Refinement Decoding", "Mixture Embedding"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/082ac7547377aff27fef1a4ba0b4f328c1fac081.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ae1f85e104154ccde1b2b09aa3b4a6d28b5999eb.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Latent Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage decoding framework for diffusion-based language models that addresses information loss from hard masking and inefficient convergence.

The paper correctly identifies two practical issues in current discrete diffusion decoding—information loss from hard remasking and premature commitment—and directly addresses both with a principled soft-to-hard schedule. The mechanics of mixing token and mask embeddings are described crisply and tied to entropy. \n- Method design is coherent. The KL-based stability monitor is a sensible criterion both for the phase switch and for early stopping; it connects the algorithm’s control flow to a measurable distributional convergence signal.\n- Empirical results are broad and consistent. Gains appear across two families (Dream-7B, LLaDA-8B/1.5), multiple lengths (256–1024), and both reasoning and coding. The tables show +1–6 points accuracy and sizable speedups, especially at long contexts.\n- Ablations are thoughtful.

It would be helpful to see a general-purpose generation benchmark (e.g., long-form QA, summarization) to test whether the latent mixing compromises stylistic fidelity or introduces artifacts in open-ended text.\n- Theoretical story is partial. The KL-monitor is motivated (and the hard-mask KL blow-up is a nice point), but the paper does not provide deeper convergence guarantees for the two-phase schedule beyond a qualitative justification. A simplified setting with a contraction argument or fixed-point analysis would strengthen the case.\n- Cost accounting and fairness.

How does LRD prevent/avoid \"mispredictions\"?\n\nLRD maintains the full density mixture over (top-p) token embedding and mask token embedding, and therefore, it is a not a hard masking/assignment. While it is very clear that hard assignment can potentially have an infinite $d_{KL}$ from the true posterior due to the lack of ability to correct for \"misspecification\" (line 48), it is not entirely clear to me how this soft assignment approach can prevent or avoid this issue. In other word, is there a guarantee (e.g., on the $d_{KL}$) on how close the convergence state is to the true posterior? I understand that a rigorous bound might be nontrivial to derive, but having some discussion (at least providing some intuition) could be very helpful.\n\n### 1. What are hyper-parameter setups that recover previous methods with hard assignments?\n\nIs there a way to use specific values of $(\\alpha, \\tau_{\\text{refine}}, \\tau_{\\text{decode}})$ to recover previous hard masking/assignment approaches? I can imagine when $\\alpha$ is set to 0, the mixture will be de-activated. Having this additional discussion (if feasible) can provide a clearer explanation of the relationship between LRD and previous approaches.\n\n### 1. (Minor issue) It might worth considering how to better phrase the second \"core limitation.\"\n\nIn Abstract, the second \"core limitation\" is \"premature commitment.\" In Introduction, the second limitation is \"inefficient convergence dynamics\" which may involve premature (when being aggressive) or overdue (when being conservative) commitments.
