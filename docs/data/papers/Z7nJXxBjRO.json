We introduce **Conformal Non-Coverage Risk Control (CNCRC)**, a framework that replaces coverage frequency with direct risk control. CNCRC guarantees an upper bound on catastrophic **non-coverage risk** while actively reducing **ambiguity risk**, providing prediction sets that are both safe and usable. This is achieved through a principled decomposition of decision risk and the design of risk-weighted nonconformity scores that balance robustness with efficiency. Experiments show that CNCRC reliably satisfies strict risk constraints in adversarial settings and outperforms all baselines on a large-scale clinical benchmark. By offering practitioners a choice between maximum robustness and maximum efficiency, CNCRC provides a practical and theoretically grounded toolkit for deploying genuinely risk-aware machine learning systems in safety-critical applications.", "tldr": "This paper introduces Conformal Non-Coverage Risk Control (CNCRC), a new framework that adapts Conformal Prediction for high-stakes applications by directly guaranteeing a cap on the risk from costly errors.", "keywords": ["Conformal Prediction", "Cost-Sensitive Learning", "Risk Control", "Uncertainty Quantification"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/13a7909ae69fdbe1061b4d593b0c14bfce74d4df.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/1038994225fee14a6d4b948ead5aa8000f54b35c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a conformal framework Conformal Non-Coverage Risk Control (CNCRC) that provides an upper bound on the non-coverage risk of a model.
