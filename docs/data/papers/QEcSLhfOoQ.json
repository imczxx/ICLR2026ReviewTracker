Prior works have established regret upper bounds of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T} + C^P)$, where $T$ is the number of episodes and $C^P$ quantifies the degree of adversarial change in the transition dynamics. This regret bound may scale as large as $\\mathcal{O}(T)$, leading to a linear regret. This raises a fundamental question: *Can sublinear regret be achieved under fully adversarial transition kernels?*  We answer this question affirmatively. First, we show that the optimal policy for MDPs with adversarial transition kernels must be history-dependent. We then design an algorithm of Adversarial Dynamics Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (AD-FTRL), and prove that it achieves a sublinear regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{(|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|)^K T})$, \nwhere  $K$ is the horizon length, $|\\mathcal{S}|$ is the number of states, and $|\\mathcal{A}|$ is the number of actions. Such a regret cannot be achieved by simply solving this problem as a contextual bandit. We further construct a hard MDP instance and prove a matching lower bound on the regret, which thereby demonstrates the **minimax optimality** of our algorithm.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["episodic MDPs; adversarial RL; minimax-optimal regret bound"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/60dc6a3bbe66c6595cbf0d2067fbc8d55eb8cd76.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RL) where both the transition kernel and the reward function exhibit adversarial dynamics across different episodes.

Even though the lower bound suggests that the regret is optimal, the regret bound has an exponential dependency on the size of the state-action space ($|S||A|$). Consequently, the regret bound is non-trivial only when the number of episodes ($T$) is sufficiently large (specifically, $T > |S||A|^k$). This exponential dependence significantly limits the framework's practical application to large-scale problems.\n\n2. Some claims regarding related work are improper. Specifically, concerning the Upper Bound Analysis, it is crucial to note that prior analyses for adversarial reinforcement learning or bandits operate in three distinct settings, each with a different regret definition. It is unfair to make a comparison without clearly stating these differences.\n\n(a). Fully Adversarial RL: This work falls into this setting (discussed in Lines 118-119), where there is no limitation on the adversarial dynamics, and regret is calculated against the best fixed policy across all episodes. Prior work in this setting did not consider a dynamic transition kernel.\n\n(b). Adversarial Corruption: This setting (Lines 128-129) focuses on corruption where a base reward function and transition kernel exist, and only a small corruption is added. Regret is calculated against the optimal policy in the base model and is efficient only when the total corruption level ($C$) is sublinear in the number of episodes.\n\n(c). Non-Stationary Environments: In this setting (Lines 134-135), the regret is measured against the optimal action in each episode (not fixed across episodes), making the guarantee strictly stronger than the guarantee in this paper. However, this comes at the cost of having a limitation on the cumulative dynamic.\n\nOverall, it is necessary to clarify the different settings to accurately establish the contribution of this work.\n\n3. The claim in Remark 1 is incorrect. There still exists a trivial method that treats each Markovian policy $\\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{H} \\to \\mathcal{A}$ as a distinct bandit arm or agent, which yields $|\\mathcal{A}|^{|\\mathcal{S}|H}$ different arms. Even though the result from this trivial method is non-optimal, the authors still need to clarify the mapping."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The preliminary discussion (\"WARM-UP\") primarily focuses on the adversarial transition kernel. While it is true that learning transitions in a stochastic environment is often harder than learning the reward function, the analysis should address the additional challenges and complexities that arise when combining adversarial rewards and adversarial transition kernels simultaneously. A deeper discussion on this interaction is warranted.\n\n2. The current framework assumes the action and state sets are non-overlapping across different stages, and, more specifically, assumes uniform sizes such as $|A^k|=|A|$ and $|S^k|=|S|$. What is the regret bound without these simplifying assumptions? The paper should discuss the impact of varying state and action space sizes across stages.\n\n3.
