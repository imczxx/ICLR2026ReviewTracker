To tackle this, the authors introduce a novel framework named Progressive Structure Adjustment for Homophily Shift (PSAHS). The core contributions of this work are:\n1.Motivation: The paper first derives a target domain error bound that explicitly decomposes the error into three main components: (1) the empirical source domain loss, (2) the discrepancy in homophily distributions across domains, and (3) the divergence in node representations.\n2.Progressive Structure Adjustment: To minimize this error bound, PSAHS proactively refines the graph structures in both domains.\nFor the source graph, it enhances the homophily of low-homophily nodes by modifying and adding edges, thereby reducing the source domain error.\nFor the target graph, where labels are absent, it leverages consistent pseudo-labels generated by a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to identify reliable nodes and performs similar adjustments to align its homophily distribution with that of the source.\n3.Joint Learning Framework: The framework integrates this structure adjustment process with domain-adversarial training in an iterative manner.

The manuscript does not provide time/space complexity bounds or runtime/memory comparisons; given the potentially expensive neighbor selection and edge updates, the paper should include complexity analysis and discuss how to scale to much larger graphs.\n\n4.
