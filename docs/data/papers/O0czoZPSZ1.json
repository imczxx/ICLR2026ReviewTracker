WaveVerse introduces a language-guided 4D world generator and a physics-based signal simulator that enables the realistic simulation of RF signals in diverse environments.

The work would be stronger with clearer methodological advances that are unique to RF simulation, for example through learned physical priors, adaptive ray selection, or a formal analysis of phase coherence that distinguishes it from prior generative or physics-based systems.\n\n- The idea is interesting and potentially impactful, yet the method inherently faces a fundamental limitation: it remains unclear how closely the simulated RF data align with real-world RF measurements. Because the 4D scene generation process creates entirely synthetic environments and motions that cannot be exactly replicated in the physical world, there is no definitive way to quantify the realism gap between simulated and real signals. Although the downstream case studies show encouraging performance gains, these results do not fully establish physical correspondence, leaving uncertainty about how faithfully WAVEVERSE captures real propagation characteristics.\n\n\n- The path-based motion conditioning, while scalable, lacks explicit temporal control, which may result in unrealistic motion timing or velocity patterns that undermine physical plausibility in dynamic scenes.

The current case study provides strong evidence of this. Based on this, I give a score of 6, and if the authors can address the weaknesses I have raised, I would be happy to increase it to 8 or higher.\n\n- Introducing of Large Models. For RF simulation, introducing large models is an easily conceivable idea, but how to effectively introduce large models to improve system performance is not easy. The paper's approach to introducing large models is quite innovative and indeed effective.\n\n- Signal Simulator. The newly designed signal generator demonstrates a certain degree of innovation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. My primary concern focuses on the RF baseline methods: As mentioned earlier, I believe the case study is very important. However, the current case study only demonstrates that the proposed method is effective compared to having no simulation data. But is it effective compared to data generated by other simulation methods? I suggest adding comparative experiments with data generated by other simulation methods.\n\n2. The paper should provide more evidence that the motions generated by the LLM are physically plausible in terms of dynamics; it only proves that the motions are semantically aligned. A motion that \"looks like slipping\" does not mean it is physically possible. Similarly, the dielectric properties assigned by the LLM based on semantics have not been physically validated. The \"realism\" foundation of this framework (LLM input) is semantics-based, while its simulator (ray tracing) is physics-based; the paper does not validate the \"physical realism\" gap between these two domains.\n\n3. There are some potentially overclaimed aspects in the paper:\n\n(1) How to define \"data-adequate.\" The paper claims to improve performance in data-adequate scenarios. Theoretically, when data is sufficient, the improvement from simulation data should be minimal. If the improvement is significant, then the data is not sufficient.\n\n(2) \"Data generation for RF imaging for the first time\" is also strange.
