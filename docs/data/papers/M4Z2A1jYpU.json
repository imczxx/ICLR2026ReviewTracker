Existing multi-modal fusion approaches assume uniform data quality or complete observability -- assumptions often violated in real-world applications. Current methods face three limitations: they treat causally-related variables independently, failing to exploit causal relationships; they cannot integrate multi-resolution observations effectively; and they lack theoretical frameworks for cascaded approximation errors. We introduce the Score-based Variational Graphical Diffusion Model (SVGD), which integrates score-based diffusion within causal graphical structures for inference under heterogeneous incomplete observations. SVGD introduces causal score decomposition enabling information propagation across causally-connected variables while preserving original observation characteristics. We provide theoretical analysis and demonstrate superior performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to relevant baselines.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Variational causal inference", "Probabilistic graphical models", "Multi-resolution observations", "Score-based diffusion models"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1e91c07410c32395740e80912864270ca3169cef.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the use of causally structured diffusion priors to integrate multi-resolution data.

If so why are there no comparisons to other multi-modal methods, e.g., multi-view VAEs?\n\n- The actual model structure is unclear. Are the $z_{p_l}$ variables in Section 3 referring to $z$ at $t=1$? Presumably $t=0$ indicates pure noise. But how can $p_0(z)$ factorise as the causal graph in Theorem 1? Please clarify. \n\n- Do we need to know the graphical structure a priori? How is this determined for the latent scale?\n\n- Do we need to infer the forward and backward maps $\\phi$? Do we run into identifiability issues in doing so?\n\n- In Theorem 1, I'm not sure an SDE with drift only influenced by parents preserves causal structure at all time points. Consider an ODE (i.e., degenerate SDE) and the graph $z_1 \\to z_2 \\to z_3$ with independent initial condition $p_0(z)$. Then, as we propogate dynamics, even though $z_1$ is not a parent of $z_3$, the indirect effect gives a dependence and the factorisation will be $p_t(z) = p_t(z_1)p_t(z_2 | z_1) p_t(z_3| z_2, z_1)$ which is not the original graph structure. This can be shown with change-of-variables, i.e., the Jacobian of the implied flow has a non-zero term $J_{1,3}$. Could the authors double check this? \n\n- The authors write that (l99) PGMs fail to model variables with different resolutions or noise levels. I don't see why this has to be the case?
