During charge and discharge cycles, the intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions between the cathode and anode involve complex multi-physics coupling processes. Traditional numerical methods often suffer from low computational efficiency when simulating such dynamic systems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel deep learning framework that directly incorporates the dynamic evolution of the system into the neural network architecture. Our approach ensures reliable parameter estimation and voltage reconstruction while significantly improving computational inference efficiency.
