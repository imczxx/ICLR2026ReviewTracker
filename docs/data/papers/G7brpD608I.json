However, choosing optimal quantum circuits that efficiently solve a given VQA problem is a non-trivial task. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms enable automatic generation of quantum circuits tailored to the provided problem. Existing QAS approaches typically adapt classical neural architecture search techniques, training machine learning models to sample relevant circuits, but often overlook the inherent quantum nature of the circuits they produce. By reformulating QAS from a quantum perspective, we propose a sampling-free differentiable QAS algorithm that models the search process as the evolution of a quantum mixed state, which emerges from the search space of quantum circuits. The mixed state formulation also enables our method to incorporate generic noise models, for example the depolarizing channel, which cannot be modeled by state vector simulation. We validate our method by finding circuits for state initialization and Hamiltonian optimization tasks, namely the variational quantum eigensolver and the unweighted max-cut problems. We show our approach to be comparable to, if not outperform, existing QAS techniques while requiring significantly fewer quantum simulations during training, and also show improved robustness levels to noise.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["quantum computing", "quantum architecture search", "neural architecture search", "quantum machine learning"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ae57affaec12650ccd60226c2428e144c8655ab5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/bedb4460cc3aa3908cfabb1fbc89aad95d4f27fc.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces $\\rho$DARTS, a differentiable quantum architecture search (QAS) algorithm based on the density matrix formalism. The authors' motivation stems from a theoretical observation: the original DARTS \"relaxation\" (a probabilistic sum of operations) is physically invalid for quantum state vectors. While prior work (e.g., qDARTS) addressed this by using Gumbel-Softmax to enable differentiable sampling, this paper proposes an alternative. It returns to the original DARTS \"summation\" idea by using density matrices, where a probabilistic sum (convex combination) is physically valid. This allows $\\rho$DARTS to create a single mixed state representing the entire search ensemble, enabling a \"sampling-free\" optimization. A key benefit of this formalism is the natural ability to incorporate arbitrary noise models, such as the depolarizing channel. The authors present experiments on state initialization, VQE, and Max-Cut to demonstrate their method's efficacy."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. Theoretically Sound Formulation: The core premise of the paper is well-founded. It correctly identifies that the density matrix formalism is the quantum-mechanically proper way to execute the original DARTS-style \"relaxation\" (i.e., a weighted summation over all possible operations), which is not possible with state vectors. This \"sampling-free\" approach is a clean and logical alternative to the sampling-based path taken by methods like qDARTS.\n\n2. Native Noise-Aware Search Capability: A significant and practical advantage of the density matrix approach is the ability to naturally incorporate arbitrary quantum noise channels (as defined in Eq. 1). This is a clear benefit over state-vector-based methods, which cannot easily model incoherent, non-unitary noise like the depolarizing channel. The noise-robustness experiments (Fig. 5) are a strong point of the paper."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The Discretization Gap: The method optimizes the parameters $(\\alpha, \\theta)$ of a mixed state $\\rho'$, which represents a probabilistic ensemble of all circuits. However, to obtain the final architecture, it applies a \"hard\" argmax operation (Algorithm 1, line 14) after training. This creates a \"discretization gap\" common to DARTS-like methods. There is no guarantee that the performance of the final, discrete circuit $\\mathcal{A}^*$ will match the optimized performance of the mixed state $\\rho'$.\n2. Highly Incremental Contribution: The paper's methodological novelty is limited. It heavily borrows its entire experimental framework, including the \"macro search\" and \"micro search\" concepts, directly from prior work (qDARTS, Wu et al., 2023). The only substantial change is the replacement of the Gumbel-Softmax sampling component with the density matrix summation component. While this change is logical, it makes the paper feel highly derivative and more like an incremental follow-up rather than a novel contribution.\n3. Failure to Address the Core QAS Challenge: The quantum computing field has evolved significantly since 2023. The core, unresolved challenge for all simulation-based QAS is the $O(2^n)$ exponential scaling wall, which restricts them to classically-trivial problems. The QAS field now needs fundamental breakthroughs that solve this scaling problem. This paper, while theoretically neat, fails to provide this. In fact, it regresses on the most critical axis by introducing an $O(4^n)$ computational cost, making it less scalable than its predecessors. This work does not fundamentally change the game for QAS, making it less attractive for the general ML community."}, "questions": {"value": "No questions."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "bsx8BtWITw", "forum": "G7brpD608I", "replyto": "G7brpD608I", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4021/Reviewer_51Km"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4021/Reviewer_51Km"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4021/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761890263497, "cdate": 1761890263497, "tmdate": 1762917137925, "mdate": 1762917137925, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The author extended the qDARTS which is doing differentiable architecture search over noiseless unitary circuits, to search over density matrix.
