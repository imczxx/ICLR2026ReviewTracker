Within chaotic systems, significant mixing and entanglement occur between different time-varying modes. Given that time series exhibit distinctly different patterns at various sampling scales, downsampling to extract multiscale features is a common approach. However, conventional downsampling causes high-frequency components in the original signal, those exceeding the new Nyquist frequency, to undergo spectral folding. This erroneously introduces spurious low-frequency patterns, perceived as low-frequency noise, thereby leading to the **aliasing problem**. To address this problem, we propose a Decomposition-Prevention-Fusion architecture framework called **DMANet**, which introduces the **D**ynamic **M**ultiscale **A**nti-Aliasing **Net**work. Specifically, DMANet comprises two key components: Multiscale Convolutional Downsampling, designed to capture temporal dependencies and inter-channel interactions, and an Anti-Aliasing Operation, which includes Pre-Sampling Anti-Aliasing Filtering and Post-Sampling Interpolation. These designs guarantee the fidelity of multiscale features before and after downsampling. We show that by mitigating the risk of aliasing, our proposed simple convolutional downsampling architecture achieves performance competitive with common baselines and larger Transformer-based models prevalent in existing studies across multiple benchmark datasets.

The authors argue that conventional downsampling operations in multiscale convolutional architectures can introduce aliasing, folding high-frequency components into low frequencies and degrading feature quality. To tackle this, they propose a Decomposition-Prevention-Fusion (DMANet) framework, which aims to mitigate aliasing during downsampling and better disentangle time-series features across scales.

Unclear problem motivation. The paper mixes up the concept of temporal patterns, which are normal structural features in time series (like trends, cycles, or sudden changes), with aliasing in chaotic systems. It treats the interaction among these patterns as some kind of “noise-like interference,” which is conceptually confusing. In chaotic systems, the complexity mainly comes from deterministic nonlinearity, not random aliasing.\n2. Limited novelty. The proposed DMANet architecture mainly relies on standard downsampling and upsampling operations. Using anti-aliasing (low-pass) filters before downsampling is a well-established practice in signal processing, not a new technical contribution. Overall, the design feels more like a reorganization of existing components than a fundamentally new method.\n3. Weak performance gains. The improvements over baselines are generally within 1% (e.g. ), which is quite marginal. Moreover, the results don’t include any statistical validation (mean ± variance or multiple runs), making it hard to judge robustness.\n4. Uninformative ablation study. The contributions of individual modules are not clearly distinguishable. The ablations do not convincingly show that the proposed design specifically addresses the claimed aliasing issue, so the experiments don’t strongly support the main claim.\n5 Inconsistent baselines.

This study’s labeling of the operation post-embedding as \"downsampling\" is debatable. Though the operation reduces temporal resolution (via stride-based convolution), it differs from traditional signal processing downsampling— which typically directly reduces sample points of raw signals. Here, the operation acts on embedded latent features (after Linear projection and normalization), blurring the line with \"feature dimension reduction\" rather than strict signal downsampling, lacking explicit clarification on this conceptual distinction .\n2. This study’s heavy reliance on frequency-domain MAE loss raises doubts about its method’s intrinsic effectiveness. Ablation shows removing this loss (using MSE instead) degrades performance significantly (e.g., Unemp dataset MAE rises from 0.146 to 0.166) .
