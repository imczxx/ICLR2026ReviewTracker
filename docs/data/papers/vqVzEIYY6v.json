However, modern RL methods still struggle with effective transferability across tasks and scenarios. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a generalized algorithm, FM-EAC, that integrates planning, acting, and learning for multi-task control in dynamic environments. FM-EAC combines the strengths of MBRL and MFRL and improves generalizability through the use of novel feature-based models and an enhanced actor-critic framework. Simulations in both urban and agricultural applications demonstrate that FM-EAC consistently outperforms many state-of-the-art MBRL and MFRL methods. More importantly, different sub-networks can be customized within FM-EAC according to user-specific requirements.", "tldr": "We propose a generalized algorithm, FM-EAC, that integrates planning, acting, and learning for multi-task control in dynamic environments.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Actor-Critic", "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9b72d7ee11e709c31b27925a43baa17c1c86bba4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/8d63d977a281ceda90a9792320546aeba004fe98.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes FM-EAC, a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines model-based and model-free approaches for multi-task UAV control in dynamic environments.

There is no genuine model-based component (no learned dynamics model, planning step, or synthetic rollout), contradicting the model-based claim. The \"enhanced\" actor-critic merely duplicates critics for primary/secondary tasks, which is a known trick from multi-objective and multi-head architectures.\n2. **Pedagogical rather than research-grade presentation** - Sections 1 and 2 read like an undergraduate tutorial on RL. Large parts restate textbook material from Sutton & Barto (2018) without adding insight. Much of Section 3 expands routine SAC equations in unconventional notation, obscuring rather than clarifying the method.\n3. **Factual inaccuracies and unsupported claims** - the introduction suggests that MBRL methods lack value functions, which is incorrect. The paper equates adding auxiliary features to \"model-based\" reasoning, which misrepresents the MBRL definition.\n4. **Methodological shortcomings**.\n    * Experiments are limited to only two tasks, both within narrow UAV simulations. No generalization across fundamentally different domains is shown.\n    * There is no evidence of statistical robustness. The number of random seeds is unspecified, yet tables report +- values without explanation\n    * The “ordinary actor-critic” baseline used in ablation (Sec. 4.3) performs implausibly poorly, suggesting either mis-tuning or inconsistent comparison.\n    * The feature-model ablation does not include standard baselines such as SAC + auxiliary GNN features, which would isolate the effect of the architecture.\n5. **Writing and clarity** - the text is verbose and repetitive and uses non-standard symbols throughout. e.g. Figure 1 is extremely cluttered and not easily interpretable.
