Previous works have revealed that the Channel-Independent (CI) strategy improves forecasting performance by modeling each channel individually, but it often suffers from poor generalization and overlooks meaningful inter-channel interactions. Conversely, Channel-Dependent (CD) strategies aggregate all channels, which may introduce irrelevant information and lead to oversmoothing. Despite recent progress, few existing methods offer the flexibility to adaptively balance CI and CD strategies in response to varying channel dependencies. To address this, we propose a generic plugin xCPD, that can adaptively model the channel-patch dependencies from the perspective of graph spectral decomposition. Specifically, xCPD first projects multivariate signals into the frequency domain using a shared graph Fourier basis, and groups patches into low-, mid-, and high-frequency bands based on their spectral energy responses. xCPD then applies a channel-adaptive routing mechanism that dynamically adjusts the degree of inter-channel interaction for each patch, enabling selective activation of frequency-specific experts. This facilitates fine-grained, input-aware modeling of smooth trends, local fluctuations, and abrupt transitions. xCPD can be seamlessly integrated on top of existing CI and CD forecasting models, consistently enhancing both accuracy and generalization across benchmarks.", "tldr": "We propose xCPD, a lightweight plugin that models channel-patch dependencies via spectral decomposition and routing, enabling accurate and generalizable forecasting with minimal overhead.", "keywords": ["Time Series Forecasting", "Channel Dependency", "Graph Learning"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8894276db7ad86df453bacef2695d191526024b9.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes xCPD, a lightweight plugin module designed to enhance multivariate time series forecasting by modeling fine-grained, frequency-aware channel-patch dependencies through graph spectral decomposition and adaptive routing. xCPD introduces spectral channel-patch embedding, frequency-based grouping, and a MoE routing mechanism.

Questionable novelty claim: The paper claims prior methods like TimeFilter [1] and CM [2] assume static inter-channel dependencies.

This undermines the motivation that xCPD uniquely addresses “time-varying” dependencies.\n2. The structure, especially the Channel-Patch Filtering with MoE, is highly reminiscent of TimeFilter’s[1] adaptive filtering mechanism. The main distinction—the spectral grouping—feels incremental rather than fundamentally novel.\n3. In Table 6, the MSE/MAE values are worse than those reported in the TimeFilter[1] paper on the same datasets and horizons.

While discussing existing methods, the paper claims that there are limitations in how existing multivariate time series forecasting methods handle cross-channel correlations. However, the paper mainly uses vague descriptions such as \"coarse-grained methods treat each channel as a monolithic unit, missing nuanced interactions between channel segments\", which could use some further explanation. There are also some claims that don't seem to be fully correct. For example, one claim that existing methods \"failing to capture how inter-channel dependencies evolve dynamically\", yet that doesn't seem to be the case for existing methods that dynamically calculate attention weights between channels. In conclusion, it is unintuitive to me why existing methods cannot effectively model correlations in multivariate time series.\n2. Similarly, the explanation of the motivation behind the proposed method can be improved. Right now it is unintuitive why the proposed method can effectively tackle the limitations faced by existing methods, and how it is fundamentally different from existing designs. For example, the fundamental difference between building a graph of patches versus existing methods that calculate attention weights between patches (which essentially is a fully-connected graph)."}, "questions": {"value": "Can the authors further explain the motivation of this paper, so that the novelty of their proposed method is more intuitive?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ynvGiHKcpD", "forum": "uIPAuyno4Z", "replyto": "uIPAuyno4Z", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7855/Reviewer_7esN"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7855/Reviewer_7esN"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7855/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761216274713, "cdate": 1761216274713, "tmdate": 1762919894995, "mdate": 1762919894995, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces xCPD, a generic plugin that adaptively routes channel-patch dependencies in multivariate time series forecasting through a graph spectral decomposition framework.
