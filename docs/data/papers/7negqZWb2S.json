RIoT spans more than 200 sensors and over 10 million measurements across multiple modalities, including HVAC usage, energy consumption, and air quality, and captured at high temporal resolution with semantic and spatial annotations.

Limited anomaly-detection baselines: The paper evaluates anomaly detection using only three lightweight baselines—Z-score, SH-ESD, and a simple LSTM (AUROC 0.83–0.91 for rate-of-change anomalies). These are appropriate for demonstrating dataset utility but do not represent state-of-the-art multivariate or deep temporal models (e.g., OmniAnomaly, TranAD, MSCRED). Including such baselines, or at least discussing their relevance, would strengthen the empirical section and showcase RIoT’s potential for complex temporal reasoning.\n2. Minor text inconsistencies: The paper includes small typographical and phrasing issues — e.g., “higer” (L118), “Firmare” (L328), and a potential ambiguity between “six-year period” in the abstract and “82 site-months (≈ 6.8 years cumulative)” in Table 2.

To truly enable novelty understanding richer semantic labels are necssary.  For instance, this dataset offers no intervention logs, control states, maintenance records, or human behavior annotations.

No identification strategy proposed.\n5. Trivial use-cases. Detecting CO2 = 65,535 ppm is threshold checking with perfect separability, not an interesting ML problem. Rate-of-change anomaly detection is standard time-series work. Neither demonstrates novel capabilities enabled by this dataset.\n6. Large gap between claims (“intelligent systems,” “robust deployable solutions,” “closing the sense-actuate loop”) and actual demonstrations (basic anomaly detection on observational data). Steps 7-8 in Figure 5 remain missing despite being highlighted.\n7. No demonstration of what research questions require this dataset’s characteristics versus existing resources. Missing engagement with literature on causal inference, graph neural networks for sensor networks, or building energy modeling with uncertainty quantification.\n8.
