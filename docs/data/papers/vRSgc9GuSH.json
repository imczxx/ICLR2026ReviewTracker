While existing methods typically monitor changes in structural features\nto detect anomalies, they often fail to account for concept drift—where natu-\nral, gradual changes in network structure are incorrectly flagged as anomalies.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce Temporal Anomaly Detection NETwork\n(TAD-NET), a framework specifically designed to reduce the impact of concept\ndrift and improve anomalous node detection. TAD-NET consists of three main\ncomponents: (i) temporal feature extractor; (ii) reinforced anomaly generator;\nand (iii) wavelet-enhanced fusion predictor. The temporal feature extractor identi-\nfies changes in node features via dynamic behavior projection, distinguishing be-\ntween normal network evolution and true anomalies. Working in tandem with the\nanomaly detector, it leverages structural-difference attention to learn robust rep-\nresentations for abnormal node detection. To address limited labeled anomalies,\nthe reinforced anomaly augmenter generates synthetic anomalous samples using\nreinforced generative adversarial networks. The wavelet-enhanced fusion pre-\ndictor improves adaptability to structural changes by integrating high-frequency\nfeatures, maintaining anomaly sensitivity as the network evolves. Experiments\non real-world datasets show that TAD-NET outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving over 6% AUC improvement under concept drift.

The paper presents a rigid combination of existing techniques without substantial innovation. \n\n2. the \"reinforcement learning\" component is simply using the discriminator output as a reward signal—a technique already present in MAMF (Hong et al., 2025), which is cited as a baseline. The paper does not clearly articulate what is fundamentally different from MAMF's approach.\n\n3. Wavelet-Enhanced Fusion: DWT for anomaly detection is well-established (Lu & Ghorbani, 2008; Zhou et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). The fusion mechanism (Eq. 9) is a trivial weighted sum. EawT (Zhou et al., 2020), MWNet (Shang et al., 2024), and AutoWave (Liu et al., 2020) all use DWT more sophisticatedly for anomaly detection.\n\n4. The core issue is that these three modules address different aspects of the problem in isolation and are not organically integrated. The temporal extractor handles evolving features, the generator addresses sample scarcity, and the wavelet component captures high-frequency signals—but there is no principled framework unifying these components. They appear to be \"bolted together\" rather than designed as a coherent system.\n\n\n5. Reinforcement Learning Component:\nThe claim that this is \"reinforcement learning\" is overstated. Using the discriminator output as a reward (Eq. 6) without a proper MDP formulation, state transitions, or policy optimization framework is not true RL. This is essentially adversarial training with a reward-weighted objective, which has been done before (e.g., in energy-based GANs and various GAN variants).\n\n6. Assumption 4.1 assumes Lipschitz continuity of normal evolution (‖X_t - X_{t-1}‖_F ≤ L_X), but this is unrealistic in the presence of concept drift. Concept drift by definition violates smooth temporal evolution assumptions.\n\n7. The theoretical analysis assumes a clean decomposition v = s + a (Assumption F.3) where s is smooth and a is anomalous. This is overly simplistic; real anomalies may have both low- and high-frequency components.\n\n8.

This formulation is unconventional and confusing.\n\nW2. The ablation study in Section 5.3' analysis is superficial.  What does this \"flip\" imply about the nature of the datasets or the anomalies within them?

The method combines three existing ideas, the synergy between these specific parts could be argued more strongly.
