Inspired by recent advances in geometry problem solving that employ formal languages and symbolic solvers for enhanced correctness and interpretability, we propose GeoLoom, a novel framework for text-to-diagram generation in geometric domains. GeoLoom comprises two core components: an autoformalization module that translates natural language into a specifically designed generation-oriented formal language GeoLingua, and a coordinate solver that maps formal constraints to precise coordinates using the efficient Monte Carlo optimization. To support this framework, we introduce GeoNF, a dataset aligning natural language geometric descriptions with formal GeoLingua descriptions. We further propose a constraint-based evaluation metric that quantifies structural deviation, offering mathematically grounded supervision for iterative refinement. Empirical results demonstrate that GeoLoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in structural fidelity, providing a principled foundation for interpretable and scalable diagram generation.", "tldr": "We proposed the geometric formal language GeoLingua and dataset GeoNF,  developed the GeoLoom framework to achieve geometric diagrams generation through automatic formalization and coordinate solvers based on Monte Carlo algorithms.", "keywords": ["Text-to-Diagram Generation", "Text-to-Image Generation", "Large Language Models"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/15d67b2a30da865306401ca56761b4474610746b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b834600fe3192b98db500ec941a39b1674f98af3.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents GeoLoom, a novel two-stage framework for generating high-quality, geometrically accurate diagrams from natural language descriptions.

Instead of trying to force a single, end-to-end model to understand both language and geometry, the authors intelligently divide the problem. They use LLMs for what they excel at (structured language translation) and a dedicated optimization algorithm for what it excels at (constraint satisfaction). This is a much more robust and interpretable design than a black-box diffusion model.\n\n2. The design of a \"generation-oriented\" formal language is a key insight. Correctly identifying that languages for solving problems are not sufficient for generating them and encoding \"constructive dependencies\" (free vs. dependent points ) is a strong conceptual contribution.\n\n3. Creating a new, manually verified dataset of 4,730 paired examples is a substantial effort. This dataset will be essential for benchmarking future work in this domain.\n\n4. The visual comparisons in Figure 4 are definitive. GeoLoom produces clean, mathematically correct diagrams, while the state-of-the-art baselines produce unusable, garbled messes.

The entire pipeline's success hinges on the first step: correct autoformalization. However, the quantitative results in Table 1 show that the \"True\" accuracy (verified by manual examination) for the best fine-tuned model (Qwen2.5-7b) is only 85.34%. This implies that for ~15% of inputs, the formal language is incorrect from the start. If the GeoLingua representation is wrong, the coordinate solver will perfectly generate the wrong diagram. \n\n2. The paper repeatedly uses the term \"coordinate solver\". However, the method described is a stochastic optimization algorithm (Monte Carlo), not a deterministic solver (like a symbolic or constraint-based solver). This approximate method is sensitive to hyperparameters (T, Q)  and may not be guaranteed to find the true global optimum, especially for highly complex diagrams. It could get stuck in a local minimum where constraints are still violated.\n\n3. The current framework and solver are designed exclusively for 2D Euclidean geometry.

The authors correctly observe that general-purpose text-to-image models are unsuitable for domains requiring high structural and spatial accuracy, such as mathematical diagrams. An automated tool for this task would have clear applications in education, research, and engineering.\n- **Methodological Clarity:** The proposed two-stage, \"parse-then-solve\" pipeline is logical, interpretable, and well-structured. Separating the natural language understanding (autoformalization) from the geometric constraint satisfaction (coordinate solver) is a strong and principled design choice, drawing inspiration from advances in formal geometry problem-solving. The overall framework is clearly illustrated in Figure 2.\n- **Novel Contributions:** The paper provides two valuable resources to the community:\n  1.  **GeoLingua:** A formal language designed specifically for _generative_ tasks, which notably encodes constructive dependencies, not just static constraints.\n  2.  **GeoNF Dataset:** A new dataset of 4,730 paired natural language and formal language descriptions , which addresses a key bottleneck of high-quality data for this task.\n- **Strong Evaluation:** The authors perform a comprehensive evaluation, including:\n  - Quantitative metrics (LCI, ADI) derived directly from constraint violations .\n  - Manual verification of accuracy (\"True\" accuracy in Table 1).\n  - A qualitative comparison (Figure 4) that clearly shows the limitations of baselines.\n  - A human user study that measures both image quality and textual alignment."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Despite its strengths, the paper suffers from several weaknesses, primarily concerning the novelty of the paradigm, the scalability of the solver, and a lack of depth in key areas.\n\n- **Missing Comparison to Key Baselines:** The core idea of a text-to-diagram pipeline based on formal language and constraint-based optimization is not new. The related work discusses GANs/diffusion and vector graphics generation, but omits a critical category: constraint-based diagram generation systems. A well-known example is **Penrose** (Penrose: From Mathematical Notation to Beautiful Diagrams, SIGGRAPH 2020), which also uses a formal language and stochastic optimization to generate diagrams. A comparison to this and similar systems is essential to properly contextualize GeoLoom's novelty and performance.\n- **Scalability of the Monte Carlo Solver:** The choice of a Monte Carlo (MC) based solver raises significant concerns about scalability.\n  - **Efficiency:** MC methods are stochastic and can be very inefficient in high-dimensional or highly-constrained search spaces. The paper claims \"superior computational efficiency\" and shows that _most_ examples are solved in <10 seconds (Table 3), but this does not constitute a proper scalability analysis. The efficiency will likely degrade exponentially as the number of points and constraints increases.\n  - **Robustness:** The solver relies on probabilistically sampling to find a global optimum and avoid \"suboptimal configurations\". However, the paper provides no discussion of failure cases or an analysis of how often the solver gets stuck in a poor local minimum.\n- **Vagueness in Loss Function Details:** The paper defines five types of geometric constraints and a final objective function. It is not clear how these five distinct metrics, which have different forms (ratios, Iverson brackets), are normalized and combined into the single set used in the final loss. For instance, \"C_{lin\\\\_rel}\" does not appear to be normalized around 1. This lack of clarity hinders reproducibility.\n- **Oversimplified Evaluation Cases:** The examples shown in the qualitative evaluations (Fig. 4, 5, 9) are relatively simple geometric figures (triangles, quadrilaterals). The paper does not demonstrate that GeoLoom can handle highly complex problems with many interacting constraints, such as those found in geometry olympiads (e.g., IMO problems). This reinforces the concerns about the solver's scalability and robustness.\n- **Lack of Ablation on Autoformalization:** The system's quality is highly dependent on the correctness of the autoformalization step. The paper mentions a \"validation-based filter\" to ensure syntactic correctness, but it does not discuss how semantic errors (e.g., misinterpreting a complex relationship) would propagate and affect the final diagram."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  **Comparison to Penrose:** Could the authors elaborate on the novelty of GeoLoom compared to existing constraint-based diagram generation systems like Penrose, which also use a formal language and optimization-based solver?\n2.  **Solver Scalability:** How does the Monte Carlo solver's performance (both in time and accuracy) scale with an increasing number of points and constraints (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50 constraints)? The examples shown are simple; have the authors tested GeoLoom on more complex, \"olympiad-level\" geometry problems?\n3.  **Solver Robustness (Local Minima):** Could the authors provide examples of failure cases where the MC solver gets stuck in a poor local minimum and fails to satisfy all constraints? How frequently does this occur, and are there any mechanisms besides random restarts to handle it?\n4.  **Loss Function Clarification:** Could the authors please provide a more precise formulation of the objective function $\\mathcal{L}(S)\\_{max}$? Specifically, how are the five different constraint deviation metrics (e.g., \"C_{lin\\\\_rat}\" and \"C_{lin\\\\_rel}\" ) normalized and combined into the set $\\mathcal{C}$?\n5.  **Handling of Fully-Constrained Systems:** The solver is described as \"iteratively perturbs the coordinates of free points ($P_f$)\". What happens in the case of a diagram that is fully constrained or over-constrained and has no \"free points\" to perturb? How is the optimization initialized in such a case?\n6.  **Error Propagation:** What is the impact of semantic errors from the autoformalization module? If the LLM generates a syntactically valid but _semantically incorrect_ formal description (e.g., `Perpendicular` instead of `Parallel`), the solver would presumably generate a \"correct\" diagram for the _wrong_ problem.
