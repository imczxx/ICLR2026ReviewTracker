However, existing evaluations often focus on general-purpose or multimodal scenarios, leaving a gap in domain-specific benchmarks that assess tool-use capabilities in complex remote sensing use cases. We present ThinkGeo, an agentic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-driven agents on remote sensing tasks via structured tool use and multi-step planning. Inspired by tool-interaction paradigms, ThinkGeo includes human-curated queries spanning a wide range of real-world applications such as urban planning, disaster assessment and change analysis, environmental monitoring, transportation analysis, aviation monitoring, recreational infrastructure, and industrial site analysis. Queries are grounded in satellite or aerial imagery, including both optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, and require agents to reason through a diverse toolset. We implement a ReAct-style interaction loop and evaluate both open and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Qwen2.5) on 486 structured agentic tasks with 1,773 expert-verified reasoning steps. The benchmark reports both step-wise execution metrics and final answer correctness. Our analysis reveals notable disparities in tool accuracy and planning consistency across models. ThinkGeo provides the first extensive testbed for evaluating how tool-enabled LLMs handle spatial reasoning in remote sensing. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Agentic AI", "Remote sensing", "Multimodal reasoning", "LLM agents"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e507fc0bcda6033e1e04aa7a03b0f23ee2b1bd64.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/407caff2b91b40d85f888a09a2f6bd695832a8e6.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents ThinkGeo, a benchmark designed to evaluate *tool-augmented LLM agents* in remote sensing (RS) tasks. Unlike general-purpose benchmarks such as ToolBench, GAIA, or GTA, ThinkGeo emphasizes *spatial reasoning* grounded in satellite and aerial imagery, assessing how agents plan, invoke tools, and integrate perception, logic, and operation modules.\nThe benchmark covers 486 agentic tasks with 1,773 expert-verified reasoning steps across seven RS domains (urban planning, disaster assessment, environmental monitoring, transportation, aviation, recreation, and industry). It includes an executable tool suite (14 tools) and two evaluation modes (step-by-step and end-to-end). Experiments over diverse models (GPT-4o, Claude-3.7, Qwen2.5, LLaMA3, etc.) reveal large performance gaps in spatial grounding, argument formatting, and multi-step consistency."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. Novel application domain: ThinkGeo meaningfully extends agentic evaluation into remote sensing, an underexplored yet practically critical field.\n2. Comprehensive dataset design: 486 tasks annotated with fine-grained ReAct traces and human validation offer substantial scale and detail.\n3. Structured tool taxonomy: The integration of perception, logic, and operation tools (e.g., `ChangeDetection`, `SegmentObjectPixels`) provides a modular evaluation of spatial and reasoning ability.\n4. Clear methodology: The pipeline for query generation, validation, and dataset curation is carefully documented and reproducible.\n5. Empirical breadth: Covers a wide range of LLMs and provides both quantitative metrics (InstAcc, ToolAcc, ArgAcc) and qualitative analyses (failure examples, tool call errors)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Despite the impressive engineering effort, the paper mainly adapts existing ReAct-style benchmarks (e.g., GTA, ToolBench) to a new domain. It does not introduce fundamentally new evaluation principles or algorithms—its novelty lies primarily in the application context.\n2. The benchmark remains evaluation-oriented rather than analysis-oriented. While the authors present tool accuracy and reasoning consistency, there is minimal exploration of why models fail (e.g., visual grounding vs. reasoning gaps) or how agentic design can mitigate these issues.\n3. The benchmark’s query generation pipeline depends on human experts and semi-automated GPT scripting. This makes it difficult to replicate or extend without significant effort, and introduces potential annotator bias. A more data-driven or semi-synthetic generation strategy would enhance scalability.\n4. The benchmark evaluates models only on remote-sensing tasks but does not verify whether improvements transfer to non-RS domains. Without such comparison, it is unclear whether ThinkGeo assesses *general agentic reasoning* or simply *domain familiarity*.\n5. The design choices—such as the selected 14 tools, ReAct format, and evaluation metrics—are taken as fixed. There is no ablation on how task difficulty, tool diversity, or image modality (RGB vs. SAR) affect performance.\n6. The paper adopts “LLM-as-a-judge” evaluation for correctness but provides little evidence of its reliability. No inter-rater agreement or validation against human experts is reported. This weakens the credibility of reported accuracy metrics.\n7. Much of the main text reads like a technical report rather than an academic analysis. Figures and tables convey results clearly, but interpretive discussion (e.g., why GPT-4o outperforms open-source models, or what features drive performance) is limited."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Please quantify the reliability of your LLM-as-a-judge system. How consistent are its decisions with human evaluation? Reporting an inter-annotator agreement or accuracy over a labeled subset would strengthen the methodological validity.\n2. Conduct an ablation varying (a) the number of tools available and (b) the task difficulty (easy vs. hard). Does model performance degrade linearly with reasoning steps or tool diversity?\n3. Evaluate a small subset of models (e.g., GPT-4o, Qwen2.5) on cross-domain tool reasoning (such as GAIA or GTA tasks) to assess whether ThinkGeo captures domain-specific or general agentic competence.\n4. The qualitative failures in Fig. 7 are informative; please complement them with a quantitative breakdown by error type (argument errors, redundant steps, wrong bounding boxes, etc.) across all models.\n5. Appendix A.1 briefly reports SAR results but lacks discussion. Please analyze why optical-trained agents fail on SAR—e.g., due to missing spectral priors or inappropriate tool arguments."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "tegSC4tjT4", "forum": "qSs6tJ5RjC", "replyto": "qSs6tJ5RjC", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17567/Reviewer_xsCN"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17567/Reviewer_xsCN"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17567/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761878203372, "cdate": 1761878203372, "tmdate": 1762927427618, "mdate": 1762927427618, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "H1uvGD0FMt", "forum": "qSs6tJ5RjC", "replyto": "qSs6tJ5RjC", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17567/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17567/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763026717236, "cdate": 1763026717236, "tmdate": 1763026717236, "mdate": 1763026717236, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a benchmark for geospatial agents on remote sensing tasks.
