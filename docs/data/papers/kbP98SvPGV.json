However, the closed-source nature and scarcity of data for Industrial Control System (ICS) programming tasks cast fundamental challenges to utilize LLMs for generating verifiable industrial code (e.g., free of both syntactic and logical errors), which is of vital importance in industrial control applications.To address this critical gap, we introduce  PLC-Spec-Syn, the first evolutionary framework to generate high-fidelity PLC programming tasks. Each task consists of a detailed specification—a structured, natural language engineering document—and its corresponding verified PLC code.The core idea is to guide LLM-based task generation (specification–code pair) with practical industrial engineering principles through a multi-axis evolutionary process considering six dimensions:functionality, safety, performance, maintenance, interoperability, and contextual complication.To ensure data quality, each generated specification–code pair will undergo rigorous auditing including compilation check and formal verification of semantic consistency between the specification and the code.The whole process yields PLC-Spec-Code, the first large-scale corpus of 11,669 PLC programming tasks with strict quality control.Besides, PLC-Spec-Code has 84.3% syntactic diversity, substantially exceeding that of existing corpus like OSCAT (29.2%). Importantly, fine-tuning multiple (code) LLMs using our corpus improves their performance on verifiable PLC code generation in unseen tasks by an average of 16.4% compared to the previous models, confirming the effectiveness of our task generation approach and the practical usefulness of our corpus.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Industrial Control Systems", "Programmable Logic Controllers", "Data Augmentation", "Code Generation"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/25c47e1c9e59a1e68f68ee26aed08c51b748f46f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "They propose a principled, multi-axis evolution process for generating realistic industrial tasks.

In RQ1, the use of 89-token syntactic coverage metric may introduce a potential bias. The metric is derived from the IEC 61131-3 standard, which also serves as the foundation for the evolution rules.

The proposed framework solves this by modeling verification constraints as differentiable functions using smoothing surrogates (e.g., sigmoidal scores for type safety, product of sub-property checks for memory safety) and attention mechanisms for control-flow invariants, enabling gradient-based joint optimization of code generation and safety.\n\n\nThe framework has four core components: a differentiable verification layer converting discrete checks to continuous operations, a hierarchical policy (high-level AST skeleton generation, low-level token filling with verification guidance), bilevel optimization (inner loop minimizing KL divergence between exact and approximate verification, outer loop optimizing policy), and periodic hard-constraint injection to prevent surrogate drift.
