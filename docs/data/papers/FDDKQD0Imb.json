Existing unsupervised approaches typically train a neural radiance field and treat the network outputs as occupancy probabilities during evaluation, overlooking the inconsistency between training and evaluation protocols. Moreover, the prevalent use of 2D ground truth fails to reveal the inherent ambiguity in occluded regions caused by insufficient geometric constraints. To address these issues, this paper presents a reformulated benchmark for unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction. We first interpret the variables involved in the volume rendering process and identify the most physically consistent representation of the occupancy probability. Building on these analyses, we improve existing evaluation protocols by aligning the newly identified representation with voxel-wise 3D occupancy ground truth, thereby enabling unsupervised methods to be evaluated in a manner consistent with that of supervised approaches. Additionally, to impose explicit constraints in occluded regions, we introduce an occlusion-aware polarization mechanism that incorporates multi-view visual cues to enhance discrimination between occupied and free spaces in these regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches but also matches the performance of supervised ones. Our source code and evaluation protocol will be made available upon publication.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Occupancy Prediction", "Benchmark", "Autonomous Driving", "Neural Radiance Field", "Computer Vision", "Unsupervised Learning"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bb56fde022498c0a9a27de748d552e427aff403f.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a5483e702464d84ec22707803bb83f7a39505c84.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an interpretable, opacity-based occupancy representation and introduces a coordinate-transformed sampling algorithm to align predictions with 3D voxel annotations. \nFurthermore, it designs an occlusion-aware occupancy polarization mechanism that leverages multi-view color discrepancies to provide supervisory signals for occluded regions. \nExtensive experiments on KITTI-360 validate the proposed benchmark's rationality and demonstrate good performance, showing competitive results against supervised methods."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Further explanation is needed here since in rendering process, C is occluded by B and thus contributes less to the final result.\n2.

I also think this is unreasonable, but the paper should provide proper reference work here.\n3. In Line 198-200, the paper analyzes the correlation between sampling interval and density value based on the assumption that the rendering contributions of points B in densely sampled region and C in sparsely sampled region should be the same. However, I think the assumption is incorrect, since densely sampled region would have more individual samples and thus the contribution of a single point in such a region does not have to comparable to that of a point in the sparsely sampled region. After all, the rendering process is a integration along the line.\n4.
