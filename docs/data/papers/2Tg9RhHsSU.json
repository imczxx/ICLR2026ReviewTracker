Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting promising directions for future research.", "tldr": "In this paper, we propose LSPO, a length-based dynamic sampling algorithm that can be combined with existing reinforcement learning algorithms to improve the learning efficiency and effectiveness.", "keywords": ["Large Language Model", "Reasoning", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/37432e0edb5d5b533e43adcd8a1b40258201f682.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/43a95380ef7d539a5c21db0863dbc0ddd8f42e7f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces LSPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm aimed at enhancing reasoning in LLMs. Motivated by the overthinking issue in LLMs, LSPO uses dynamic sampling based on response length to improve model effectiveness.

However, this key assumption is never empirically validated. The ablation study shows that training only on intermediate-length responses yields lower performance, but this does not imply that including them in a full-data setting harms learning—yet the filtering strategy is justified precisely on that implicit premise. Without evidence that intermediate-length samples actively degrade training (e.g., via gradient conflict analysis, noise estimation, or ablation with full-data vs. filtered-data under matched compute), the rationale for discarding them remains speculative. Moreover, the paper does not clearly articulate what concrete learning problem LSPO solves: Is it combating overthinking? Improving sample efficiency? Enhancing generalization on hard examples? The lack of a well-defined objective makes it difficult to assess whether LSPO meaningfully advances the field or merely implements a heuristic with marginal gains.\n- Insufficient comparison with prior dynamic sampling methods: The paper claims that existing dynamic sampling approaches (e.g., GRESO, PODS) only improve efficiency, not final model effectiveness, yet provides no experimental evidence to support this assertion. A direct comparison of LSPO against these methods in terms of final accuracy is missing.\n- Marginal gains relative to overhead: The reported improvements are small, while LSPO incurs nontrivial rollout overhead. The cost-benefit trade-off is not convincingly justified.\n- Incomplete empirical validation: Training curves are only shown for GSPO + LSPO vs. GSPO. Curves for GRPO and DAPO (the other two base algorithms) are absent, making it difficult to assess whether LSPO consistently accelerates learning or merely shifts the final performance slightly.\n- Incomplete training dynamics analysis: The paper presents training curves for only two specific configurations: (1) Qwen-2.5-Math-7B with GSPO on Olympiad-bench, and (2) Llama-3.2-4B-Instruct with DAPO on MATH. However, the main results in Table 1 span two models, three base algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), and three evaluation benchmarks (AIME25, Olympiad, Minerva). Without training curves for other combinations—e.g., GRPO+LSPO on AIME25 or DAPO+LSPO on Minerva—it is unclear whether LSPO consistently accelerates learning or merely yields small final gains under favorable conditions. Given the marginal absolute improvements (often ≤1%), this omission weakens the evidence for LSPO’s general effectiveness.\n- Lack of theoretical justification: There is no analysis or proof suggesting that filtering by response length should improve convergence or generalization. The heuristic is plausible but not grounded in optimization or learning theory.\n- Technical error in formulation: Equation (3) defining average response length $L(q) := \\frac{1}{G} |o_i|$ lacks a summation which is ill-formed."}, "questions": {"value": "- Problem clarity: The paper claims LSPO improves “final effectiveness” unlike prior dynamic sampling methods, but never specifies what concrete learning problem it solves—e.g., mitigating overthinking, improving hard-example generalization, or accelerating convergence. What is the precise objective that justifies filtering by length?\n- Core assumption: The method assumes intermediate-length responses are “less informative,” yet the ablation only shows that training exclusively on them performs poorly. This does not prove they harm full-data training. Can the authors provide evidence (e.g., with matched compute) that excluding them actually helps?\n- Gap Justification: Could the authors clarify what specific prior works in RLVR they consider as “dynamic sampling for efficiency only”? Are there no existing methods that use data selection to improve final accuracy? If such methods exist, how does LSPO differ in objective or mechanism?\n\n- Theoretical Grounding: Is there any theoretical rationale (e.g., based on gradient variance, signal-to-noise ratio, or curriculum learning) that explains why filtering by response length extremes should improve policy optimization?\n\n- Experimental Results: \n  - Baseline comparison: The claim that methods like GRESO “do not improve effectiveness” is unsupported by experiments. Given LSPO’s marginal gains (often ≤1%), a direct comparison against GRESO/PODS in final accuracy is essential to validate its novelty.\n  - The paper states that “other dynamic sampling methods such as GRESO do not improve effectiveness.” Is this claim supported by experiments? If not, could the authors include a direct comparison of LSPO against GRESO, PODS, or similar methods in terms of final test accuracy?\n  - Training curve coverage: Training curves are shown only for two specific (model, algorithm, dataset) combinations.

LSPO aims to improve training effectiveness (final accuracy) rather than efficiency. Experiments and reported results show modest accuracy improvements over baselines. \n\n1. The core idea of filtering samples based on response length is heuristic rather than theoretically grounded. Can the authors provide more intuition on why this is important? \n2. Prior works such already explored length-aware optimisation, including direct regularisation of response length. LSPO’s novelty lies mainly in applying this as a data sampling heuristic, not as a new RL algorithm. The contribution feels incremental, more like a training trick than a principled new method.\n3. Reported improvements are marginal. This makes me ask if such gains are within normal RL variance and could be due to stochasticity rather than the method itself. Can the authors conduct statistical significance tests to understand if those are actual gains? \n4. Can the authors report results beyond math reasoning datasets? There are other reasoning domains; would we see such gains there as well? \n5. I am not sure if 24 hrs is actually enough time for RL convergence.

I wouldn't agree that this is the first paper to study the length-aware setup. I believe other algorithms have considered this already during optimisation. \n8. The plots need to include variances.
