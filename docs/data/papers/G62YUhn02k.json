This inverse process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly challenging, especially under sparse transmitter setups, e.g., with only one transmitter. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it requires time-consuming case-specific optimization and fails under sparse transmitter setups. To address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a data-driven perspective. The scarcity of transmitters leads to an insufficient amount of measured data, which fails to capture adequate physical information for stable inversion. Built on this insight, we propose a fully end-to-end and data-driven framework that predicts the relative permittivity of scatterers from measured fields, leveraging data distribution priors to compensate for the lack of physical information. This design enables data-driven training and feed-forward prediction of relative permittivity while maintaining strong robustness to transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy and robustness. Notably, it achieves high-quality results even with a single transmitter, a setting where previous methods consistently fail. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical solutions for electromagnetic imaging.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Inverse scattering"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e93fab84d4d93883e5399b350391feb665b6f679.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/59dfe19eee52534d17d39cf1691f3f944aee76f5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem (EISP) under the extremely sparse measurement condition — specifically, the single-transmitter setting.

This feed-forward model directly learns the mapping from scattered fields to permittivity by leveraging data distribution priors, which represents a clear paradigm shift from conventional approaches.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation:** The authors conduct extensive experiments against a wide array of SOTA baselines (both traditional and learning-based) on multiple standard datasets, including synthetic and real-world data.

The proposed method is presented in a straightforward manner, and the figures are illustrative."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Unclear Methodological Innovation:** The methodology section is brief, making it difficult to identify the core technical contributions. From my reading, the approach appears to be a straightforward application of NeRF-like implicit neural representations to the electromagnetic imaging domain. Similar methods already exist in the literature (e.g., NeRF2: Neural Radio-Frequency Radiance Fields), which casts doubt on the novelty of this work. The authors need to clearly articulate what distinguishes their method from these existing approaches. What are the specific technical innovations beyond adapting an existing framework to a new application domain? Without this clarity, it is difficult to assess the paper's contribution to the field.\n\n2. **Insufficient Validation on Real-World Data:** While the paper includes experiments on multiple datasets, the validation on real-world data is unconvincing. Only Table 1 provides quantitative results on the real-world dataset, but critically, there are no qualitative results (e.g., reconstructed images) shown for real data. This is a significant omission, as qualitative visualizations are essential for assessing reconstruction quality and identifying potential artifacts or failure modes. The current results do not clearly demonstrate the proposed method's advantages on real-world data, which severely limits the persuasiveness of the claims about practical applicability. Given that real-world performance is crucial for a method positioned as a practical solution for electromagnetic imaging, this lack of comprehensive real-data validation is a major weakness.\n\n3. **Generalization Limitations:** The paper's most critical weakness is a fundamental limitation acknowledged by the authors: the model is trained for a fixed transmitter and receiver configuration and cannot generalize to different sensor locations. This severely restricts its practical deployment, where hardware setups often vary. For a method claiming to enable \"practical electromagnetic imaging,\" this inflexibility is a major concern. The paper would be significantly strengthened if it proposed concrete solutions or at least thoroughly discussed potential paths to overcome this, such as conditioning the network on sensor coordinates.\n\nIf the authors can clearly articulate the methodological innovations (Weakness #1) and provide comprehensive qualitative results on real-world data that convincingly demonstrate the method's advantages (Weakness #2), I would consider revising my assessment upward."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "vnhoYOcnqB", "forum": "G62YUhn02k", "replyto": "G62YUhn02k", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6805/Reviewer_V6S8"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6805/Reviewer_V6S8"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6805/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761910011782, "cdate": 1761910011782, "tmdate": 1762919074325, "mdate": 1762919074325, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
