These effects are crucial in conveying mood and creating aesthetic appeal.  However, controlling these effects in generative video models remains highly challenging, as most existing methods are restricted to camera motion control. In this paper, we propose CineCtrl, the first video cinematic editing framework that provides fine control over professional camera parameters (e.g., bokeh, shutter speed). \nWe introduce a decoupled cross-attention mechanism to disentangle camera motion from photographic inputs, allowing fine-grained, independent control without compromising scene consistency. To overcome the shortage of training data, we develop a comprehensive data generation strategy that leverages simulated photographic effects with a dedicated real-world collection pipeline, enabling the construction of a large-scale dataset for robust model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates high-fidelity videos with precisely controlled, user-specified photographic camera effects.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["diffusion model", "video generative model", "photographic effect"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5423f63d8786bc2cabe4b5370b21308f35a01c47.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/04590d448bd41209b999268a9edcf75054bd173e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents CineCtrl, a video-to-video editing framework that enables fine-grained control over professional photographic parameters (bokeh, exposure, zoom, color temperature) alongside camera trajectories.

Overstated novelty and incomplete related work discussion.\nThe paper emphasizes its novelty but omits several closely related works, especially in the image domain (e.g., arXiv:2412.02168\n), which already demonstrate strong results on similar photographic controls. The paper briefly dismisses these methods as “text-conditioned,” but this difference seems superficial, since both textual and numerical conditions are ultimately embedded as vectors.

Limited methodological novelty.\nThe proposed decoupled cross-attention essentially extends existing camera trajectory conditioning by adding more camera-related dimensions. The design change seems incremental rather than fundamentally new. It would be helpful to clarify what unique insights or training challenges arise from including these additional camera parameters, and how they qualitatively differ from position parameters.\n\n3. Insufficient experimental validation.\na) Baselines. The comparison set is limited. Many related image-based methods could, in principle, be adapted to videos frame by frame, and should be included as baselines rather than only self-implemented ones.\nb) Ablations.

The effect on model complexity and parameter count should also be reported.\nc) Rationale vs. implementation.

The paper explores an under-addressed aspect of controllable video translation—photographic controls such as bokeh, exposure, color temperature, and focal length—rather than only camera trajectories. This significantly broadens the scope of controllable video translation.\n2. The data side is also non-trivial: physically inspired simulation for 4 kinds of photographic effects + a real-data curation pipeline so the model doesn’t overfit to synthetic depth or simple zooms.\n\n### Technical Quality\n1. The method is built on top of a strong, modern video diffusion backbone (DiT-based) and reuses a proven camera-control encoder (from ReCamMaster) for the trajectory branch, which makes the engineering story credible.\n2. Evaluation considers both: (i) effect accuracy (CorrCoef for bokeh/zoom/exposure/color) and (ii) scene/video consistency (LPIPS, CLIP-V, VBench metrics), which is appropriate.\n\n### Clarity\n1. The paper has a clear structure and is easy to read.\n2. Figure 2 very clearly shows where the two control streams enter the DiT block.\n\n### Significance\n1.

How fine is the actual control in practice? For instance, for the bokeh parameter, can users reliably perceive a difference between 0.3 and 0.35, or is the control effectively quantized into only a few visually distinct levels?\n\n3. **Design of Dual Encoders.**\n   The model employs two learnable encoders — one for camera extrinsics and another for other photographic parameters.
