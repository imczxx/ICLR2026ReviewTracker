While multi-source domain generalization (MDG) has shown promise in addressing this challenge by leveraging multiple source domains during training, its practical application is limited by the significant costs and difficulties associated with creating multi-domain datasets. To address this limitation, we propose pseudo multi-source domain generalization (PMDG), a novel framework that enables the application of sophisticated MDG algorithms in a more practical single-source domain generalization setting. PMDG generates multiple pseudo-domains from a single source domain through style transfer and data augmentation techniques, creating a synthetic multi-domain dataset that can be used with MDG algorithms. Through extensive experiments with PseudoDomainBed, our modified version of the DomainBed benchmark, we analyze the effectiveness of PMDG across multiple datasets and architectures. Our analysis reveals several key findings, including a positive correlation between MDG and PMDG performance and the potential of pseudo-domains to match or exceed actual multi-domain performance with sufficient data. These comprehensive empirical results provide valuable insights for future research in domain generalization.", "tldr": "We propose a new framework that generates pseudo multi-domain datasets and enables the application of multi-domain generalization algorithms to single-domain datasets.", "keywords": ["Domain Generalization", "Data Augmentation", "Style Transformation", "Computer Vision", "Deep Learning", "Benchmark"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/623599c69b3f5b9380f5a65e1c420e036beda6ed.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d664cfa26544cd0c7326cfa52c6b57bd7a493816.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Pseudo Multi-Source Domain Generalization (PMDG): generate multiple “pseudo-domains” from a single source by applying style transfer (AdaIN, CartoonGAN, edge maps) and data augmentations (MixUp, CutMix, RandAugment, AugMix, IPMix, RandConv, etc.), then plug any multi-source DG (MDG) algorithm from DomainBed to train on these transformed splits.

Core idea is largely a repackaging of well-trodden “domain expansion via augmentation.” Treating strong augmentations as different domains and training with MDG losses is conceptually aligned with years of SDG work on synthetic domain generation and adversarial/heuristic augmentations (e.g., MixStyle/RandConv/IPMix/OT/adversarial DA). PMDG’s “bridge” is effectively: apply known style/augmentation transforms, group by transform, and run existing MDG algorithms. This is incremental glue code rather than a new algorithmic principle. \n\n2. Benchmarking contribution is a modest DomainBed fork. PseudoDomainBed mainly standardizes how augmentations are applied at dataset/minibatch levels; otherwise, it inherits MDG methods unmodified. The paper emphasizes breadth of runs more than new methodology. \n\n\n3.

What is the substantive novelty beyond “augmentation-as-domains”?\nPlease delineate what PMDG adds algorithmically beyond grouping known transforms (style transfer, IPMix, RandConv, etc.) into K pseudo-domains and training with an off-the-shelf MDG loss. A precise contrast to “domain expansion” SDG prior art would help. \n\n\n2. Can you justify that these pseudo-domains are truly “domains”?\nAdd quantitative evidence (e.g., FID/LPIPS, covariance shift, spectral stats, Wasserstein distances) showing that (i) each pseudo-domain differs from the source and (ii) pseudo-domains are mutually distinct. Tie these distances to generalization gains (correlation or causal ablation). Your discussion mentions this gap; closing it would strengthen the claim. \n\n3.
