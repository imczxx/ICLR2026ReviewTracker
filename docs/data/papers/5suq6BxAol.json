While intuitive, this decoupled approach fails to incorporate key constraints essential for real-world clinical decision-making—such as subgroup size and propensity overlap. These constraints operate on fundamentally different axes than CATE estimation and are not naturally accommodated within existing frameworks, thereby limiting the practical applicability of these methods. We propose a unified optimization framework that directly solves the primal constrained optimization problem to identify optimal subgroups. Our key innovation is a reformulation of the constrained primal problem as an unconstrained differentiable min-max objective, solved via a gradient descent-ascent algorithm. We theoretically establish that our solution converges to a feasible and locally optimal solution. Unlike threshold-based CATE methods that apply constraints as post-hoc filters, our approach enforces them directly during optimization. The framework is model-agnostic, compatible with a wide range of CATE estimators, and extensible to additional constraints like cost limits or fairness criteria. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying high-benefit subgroups while maintaining better satisfaction of constraints.", "tldr": "We propose a framework for optimal subgroup identification under multiple constraints.", "keywords": ["causal inference", "heterogeneous treatment effect", "optimal subgroup identification", "constrained optimization"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e0684f84957b1e1d860cab891ef66bee64774a1f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes MOSIC, a model-agnostic optimization framework for treatment subgroup identification under multiple real world constraints, including minimum subgroup size, propensity score overlap, and optionally safety or fairness constraints.

The idea is elegant, and this kind of shift is decision-focused and real-world aware, aligning with the emerging trend in causal machine learning.\n\n**Theoretical Proof**\n\nI like that the paper provides several theoretical lemmas to support their algorithms, e.g., the strict local min–max point in Lemma 2. I didn't check the full details of the proof, but they seem correct (although I could be mistaken). The authors also provide experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to show the proposed method’s performance compared with baselines."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "My main concern is about the practical utility of the proposed methods. The reason why the standard two-stage CATE methods are widely accepted is because they are easy to understand, easy to use, and easy to interpret. While I appreciate the theoretical and empirical results that MOSIC presents in the paper, the key question is: is the gain worth the additional complexity?\n\n**Easy to understand?**\n\nThe idea is straightforward: shifting from estimation to optimization. However, the transition from Problem I to Problem IV sometimes feels reactive rather than intentional. Section 4 in particular reads like a narrated debugging process (“we tried X but it was unstable, so we added Y...”), rather than a clean forward design narrative. This hurts clarity, especially for theoretical readers.\n\n**Easy to use?**\n\nThere is no discussion of computational cost or efficiency. The two real-world datasets used have sample sizes of 13,361 and 6,516, but there is no reporting of runtime or resource overhead relative to simpler two-stage baselines. This omission limits the reader’s ability to judge whether the method is practical for real-time or large-scale deployment. And for many clinicians who may need to use this method, will it still be practical if they do not have sufficient computational resources?\n\n**Easy to interpret?**\n\nWhile the method supports decision-tree backbones in Section 5.3, the paper never shows a concrete learned subgroup rule. For example, a clinician might prefer an interpretable patient subgroup like: “patients aged > 60 should not take the drug.” But this kind of explicit rule is missing from the paper. For deployment and clinical trust, this is a significant gap."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Line 156: The paper claims that the method naturally accommodates more general linear and ratio-form constraints. Could the authors clarify what kinds of constraints can be naturally supported by MOSIC, and what kinds cannot? Additionally, how does the computational or optimization complexity scale as more constraints are added, does it grow linearly, or is there a risk of exponential blow-up? I also wonder would there be a finite-sample guarantees with constraints? \n\n2. I understand that strict local min–max is a standard target for nonconvex optimization. However, since we are dealing with patient data, robustness is a critical concern. You mention running experiments over 100 random train/test splits, but do you also evaluate stability across different random initialization seeds of the optimizer (not just different data splits)? In other words, do different seeds lead to meaningfully different subgroups being selected, even if the average ATE is similar? Is the identified subgroup S(x) stable across initializations?\n\n3. As mentioned in the weaknesses section, providing runtime and interpretability analysis would significantly strengthen the paper, particularly for clinical decision. Even an approximate runtime comparison against two-stage baselines, and at least one example of a human-readable decision-tree subgroup rule, would be very helpful."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "aWoMw5e3Xw", "forum": "5suq6BxAol", "replyto": "5suq6BxAol", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4219/Reviewer_puYb"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4219/Reviewer_puYb"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4219/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761602302277, "cdate": 1761602302277, "tmdate": 1762917234439, "mdate": 1762917234439, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MOSIC, a unified optimization framework for identifying optimal treatment subgroups under multiple practical constraints such as subgroup size and propensity overlap.

The largest concern is the limited baselines: the paper includes CAPITAL, causal trees, causal forests, and outcome-weighted learning, but exclude stronger HTE estimators such as DR-learner, R-learner, BART, and locally centered causal forests.

It would also be helpful to discuss recent constrained policy methods from off-policy evaluation, safe RL, and constrained contextual bandits that optimize under budgets or risk\n\n2. Experimental setup lacks robustness and diagnostic depth.\nThe evaluation relies on AIPTW without clear cross-fitting, which can bias subgroup ATEs when selection and estimation share nuisance models. The reliability metric is only the count of covariates with standardized mean difference>0.2 after IPTW, which is coarse and does not measure magnitude or joint imbalance. Overlap enforcement is only evaluated during training, not validated on test sets. \n\n3. Causal validity in ICU cohorts is not well supported.\nThe treatment window (10 hours before to 24 hours after ICU admission) risks immortal time bias if early deaths are excluded. Confounding from indication severity is possible, especially for steroids, yet no sensitivity analysis or negative control outcomes are reported. The added safety constraint on GCS is useful, but without external validation or clinician input, it’s unclear whether the selected subgroups are clinically meaningful or plausible."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
