The methodology section first introduces the new architecture to perform inference. It's hard to follow what aspects of the system are being explained where n the first part. For example, gating is introduced but it's not clear where that's used in the architecture in Figure 1. Also, it's not clear why the section is split up into three tasks in the first place. A motivating sentence or paragraph would greatly help orient the reader.\n\n**Methods**\n\nThe new dataset construction is confusing. I'm assuming it's an aggregate of db1, db2, and db3? The authors state that db2 comes from manually collected LLPS records, but what are those and how can we trust their veracity? It seems that their new dataset is mainly the new 'db2' dataset whereas the other two are from previous studies, so the naming convention is awkward that the newest one is db2.\n\nTask 2 in section 4 is straightforward but there is no explanation of which hyperparameters were used for their final loss function, which seems important to recreate their work.\n\nTask 3 is the most opaque and confusing section. The purpose was briefly mentioned in the introduction and summary of the paper. I don't exactly see the benefit of training latent diffusion on the model, nor the purpose of training both a conditional and unconditional model.\n\n**Experiments**\n\nAgain, a guiding paragraph would immensely help. Also, all experimental results would instill more confidence should they have standard error calculations. I see they show the mean value.\n\nWhy are the metrics for first experiment based on 50/50 train/test split? This seems arbitrary to me. \n\nThe second section evaluates MSE and $r^2$ metrics within a condition with the model. The $r^2$ seems poor for all of the conditions and I'm not sure how well Table 5 helps us in determining the accuracy of this method. Figure 3 states \"accepted\" is in green whereas I see blue. \n\nFor section 5.3, I think more analysis should be done. The authors show droplet-forming regions, but how do they quantify that? What chemical/physical features support those predictions? these look like interesting proteins but how do we know they are relevant and if the predictions are accurate?\n\nFinally, the authors address accuracy of their method but I highly encourage they also evaluate the calibration of their model. Having a measure of uncertainty in predictions would be very beneficial for this task."}, "questions": {"value": "Many questions are posed in the weaknesses section.

Hence, this work would be more appropriately evaluated in a life science–focused journal.\n\n- Tasks 1 (phase separation prediction) and 3 (protein generation) address general problems that have already been extensively studied, yet the paper compares its approach with only a subset of existing methods. The lack of systematic benchmarking against the latest state-of-the-art techniques makes it difficult to assess whether the proposed models truly outperform existing approaches.\n\n- The formulation of Task 3 appears highly dependent on the specific dataset used in this study, raising concerns about its general applicability.

Why is it necessary to develop a new method here? In particular, does the proposed approach incorporate any mechanisms that are specifically designed for modeling phase separation phenomena?\n\n- In Task 3, the claim that proteins can be generated from phase diagrams and experimental conditions seems to lack generality.

During such a process, molecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA start forming little clusters together and separate from their solutions. While remaining a liquid, the systems have distinct properties and dynamics compared to individual systems in solution. Notably, LLPS properties and dynamics are also significantly impacted by experimental conditions such as temperature and pH. All of this together makes LLPS a challenging area of study that has so far been largely overlooked.\n\nWithin the context of LLPS, the authors consider three major tasks: 1) Condition-aware phase outcome prediction, 2) Condition inference for phase systems, and 3) Phase system design. For all three problems, the authors discuss a concrete architecture and training objective to train the models to solve the tasks.\n\nIn the case of condition-aware phase outcome prediction, the authors train a large transformer-based embedding model which, combined with a simple classification or regression head, can predict the phase.\n\nFor condition inference, the authors propose training a VAE that encodes both the system and the experimental conditions into a latent space. Inference is then done by thresholding a reconstruction loss and a branched phase loss. This is a rather unusual construction in my opinion, and I have commented on it below in the weaknesses section.\n\nLastly, for phase-system design, the authors propose using a diffusion process, with both conditional and unconditional variants. This section, however, requires some further clarification, as the different approaches considered are not entirely clear. There is mention of two different design pipelines in Figure 2, but only one seems to be discussed in the text.\n\nTo train their models, the authors combine three small datasets, referred to as db1, db2, and db3, to form the “OpenPhase” dataset. The dataset is accompanied by a larger development framework that also includes access to methods for component and condition embeddings, predefined dataset splits, and a user-friendly interface.\n\nLastly, the authors evaluate their proposed approaches for the different tasks.

As stated, while I believe that the OpenPhase framework provides an important service to the community, due to primarily combining existing datasets the novelty is limited. Furthermore, while extensive in considering three different tasks within the LLPS domain, the proposed solutions have limited novelty. They primarily adjust existing methods from other domains to the specific problems at hand. While this is in itself interesting, I personally believe this to be more appropriate for a domain-specific journal/conference as opposed to ICLR.\n\nIt is for this reason that I believe the paper is not ready for acceptance to ICLR. However, I am open to hearing from the authors if they believe that I have missed or misunderstood important parts of their contribution. Outside of the significance and novelty issues, I would be happy to accept the paper, as the work is otherwise well executed.\n\nI have listed a few more points of weakness below, but I believe these can most likely all be addressed in small updates during the rebuttal and/or in the process of producing the camera-ready paper:\n- While the Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation domain that the work tackles is very interesting, the discussion of how it is fundamentally different from more conventionally studied domains needs further clarification. For a non-expert audience not intimately familiar with the biochemistry domain (i.e., the general ICLR audience), this is currently hard to follow. A clear illustration would benefit the paper a lot.\n- The paper has a few minor mistakes that are mostly the result of last-minute changes. These need to be flushed out in future versions. E.g., a small error on line 208, a weird overrun from the inline graphics on line 445, and, in general, some large overrun into the margins in Table 5.\n- Am I correct in understanding that the second task, condition inference, requires an exhaustive search over all possible c? If this is the case, I suspect this to be quite computationally expensive, and this should be clearly discussed in the paper.\n- While Conformer seems to provide a significant improvement over the two embedding methods it is compared to, it is unclear what computational cost this entails. It would be interesting if the authors could include a short study on this.\n- It is unclear how the different dataset splits are used. My assumption was that the different categories of splits would be used to make sure specific components are equally represented, but given the stated 50–50 train–test split, this does not seem to be the case."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "A2LlQZJLxK", "forum": "Bnkp8DUP7d", "replyto": "Bnkp8DUP7d", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7835/Reviewer_ujKR"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7835/Reviewer_ujKR"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7835/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762210113374, "cdate": 1762210113374, "tmdate": 1762919879164, "mdate": 1762919879164, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
