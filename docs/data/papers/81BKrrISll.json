For second-language (L2) learners, correct placement of syllable stress is a challenge, creating a strong need for automatic stress detection methods in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) systems. Existing methods, however, depend on syllable boundaries, which are costly to manually annotate and error-prone when generated automatically. To overcome this limitation, we propose a boundary-independent framework that learns syllable representations directly from speech and predicts their stress without explicit boundaries. The framework has three main components: (1) an Adaptive local Monotonic Attention (AMA) mechanism that captures syllable representations by enforcing the natural left-to-right order of syllables, (2) contrastive loss that drives stressed and unstressed syllables apart in the embedding space, and (3) an end-to-end encoder–decoder pipeline that integrates these two components to map speech frames to syllable representations and then decode them autoregressively into stress predictions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, we further conduct ablation studies by either removing AMA or contrastive loss, which validate their critical role in learning robust syllable representations. Experiments on the ISLE corpus of German and Italian learners of English show that our method outperforms boundary-dependent baselines, thereby overcoming the need for explicit boundaries in stress prediction.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Speech", "Syllable Representations", "AMA", "Contrastive Loss", "Automatic Syllable Stress Detection"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/40df9379009c55358abc24b26a161b297c3462ec.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes SRAMA, a boundary-independent framework for syllable stress detection in L2 speech, integrating Adaptive local Monotonic Attention (AMA), multi-stage contrastive loss, and an end-to-end autoregressive encoder-decoder.

Although not requiring syllable boundaries, from my understanding, the proposed method still requires knowing the total number of syllables in the input utterance beforehand, as indicated by $m$ and $n$ in equation 1. This will limit the usage in practice.\n2. In addition, the window length is controlled only be scalers $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, so essentially the window will be static across utterances. I suspect this formulation will negatively impact the generalization to different speakers, speaking rates, rhythm, etc, since in reality there are huge variation on speaking styles.\n3. The training and testing data is limited in size and coverage. It is not clear to me the proposed static windowing approach can work well on data in the wild.\n4. Overall, I think the technical innovation of this work is limited. This work's focus in narrow on a specific syllable stress prediction task, and the proposed technique AMA already exists.
