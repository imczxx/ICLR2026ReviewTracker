This study proposes the concept of latent space uniformization inspired by Coulomb's law, named ULatent. This concept provides a canonical representation of the latent space and facilitates sampling and aligning elements in both single-domain and cross-domain generative scenarios. Specifically, we model data points in a two-dimensional latent space as charged particles driven by Coulomb forces (electrostatic dynamics). The repulsive forces between them form a uniform distribution in the latent space, simulating the phenomenon where equally charged particles reach equilibrium. The uniformization of the original data enhances latent space structure, particularly by eliminating gaps between isolated clusters. For semantically overlapping clusters, pre-translation operations are required. By integrating geometric mapping techniques, we achieve precise alignment of uniformly distributed data across both single-modal and multi-modal domains, thereby simultaneously improving sampling efficiency and generation accuracy. All these conclusions are validated through multi-dataset experiments and ablation studies.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["latent space representation", "generation", "alignment", "transformation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4f9d40d8c4fe132d4a864f6dee798bea015d41e6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper maps latent codes into 2D, applies a Coulomb-inspired repulsion to make the space more uniform, and then maps back the shifts to high dimensions for generation.

It’s rare to see such a direct, physically inspired formulation in modern generative modeling. This originality reflects open and out-of-the-box thinking, and the field benefits from more attempts to connect physical intuition with geometric latent design.\n\n2. **Conceptually sound latent-space reasoning**  \n   The focus on operating in latent space, rather than image space, is a solid design decision. The canonical space representation and harmonic registration modules are conceptually coherent and help maintain semantic consistency across domains, which is supported by clear ablation evidence.\n\n3. **Demonstrated improvement over immediate baselines**  \n   Results show moderate but consistent quantitative and qualitative improvements over prior methods such as GMapLatent and CycleGAN. FID and accuracy metrics, as well as ablations, demonstrate that each module (canonical representation and harmonic registration) contributes meaningfully to better semantic alignment and smoother translations.\n\n4. **Coherent geometric interpolation mechanism**  \n   The curve-to-curve generation results effectively illustrate the intended advantage of smooth, continuous mappings through latent space. This geometric interpretation of interpolatio, particularly the spherical (Slerp-based) variant, successfully maintains semantic continuity and avoids abrupt mode changes during translation.\n\n5. **Avoiding 2d bottleneck is elegant**\nThe fact that uniformization happens in the 2d space, but that the 2d representations are not the actual representations but only proxies for the uniformization considerations is elegant. Mapping the change to the higher dim rather than mapping the representation itself is a good useful solution."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Fundamental non-scalability**  \n   The method by its own definition cannot scale.  \n   To be clear, this is not about the paper not showing higher-scale results. The algorithm itself depends on pairwise Coulomb-like repulsion and KD-tree construction in every iteration, with no batching or locality reduction.  \n   The complexity $O(T_{\\max}(N \\log N + kN))$ per cluster makes it fundamentally unsuitable for large datasets.   \n  \n2. **Reliance on small, predefined class counts**  \nThe paper never clarifies how clusters are obtained. From the description and examples, it appears that semantic labels are used directly, meaning the method is supervised rather than unsupervised. The method assumes a small number of semantic clusters that are known in advance. The angular sector layout and barycentric formulation both rely on these being fixed manually. This limits applicability to datasets with few discrete classes and cannot naturally extend to many or continuous domains. It seems there is a restriction allowing only annotated datasets. \n\n3. **Angular-only uniformization bias**  \n   The “uniformization” process equalizes only the angular component, leaving the radial distribution unbalanced. Because the area element in polar coordinates scales as $r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$, the resulting density grows roughly as $1/r$, producing a strong bias toward the center.  \n   This effect is visible even in the paper’s own illustrations, where samples appear clearly denser near the origin. I couldn't find any comment regarding this or even awareness. Basically this contradicts the premise of the paper because this is not uniform density, it is radial dependent density.\n\n4. **Complexity omissions**  \n   While the paper provides complexity expressions for the repulsion updates, it omits the cost of clustering (when applicable) and likely undercounts repeated KD-tree rebuilds per cluster. The analysis therefore understates the actual computational cost.\n\n5. **Presentation of Coulomb’s law**  \n   A very minor and friendly remark: “Theorem 3.1 (Coulomb’s Law)” is presented as if it were an original result.  \n   This is not how such known laws are usually included in ML papers—unless, of course, the author happens to be Charles-Augustin de Coulomb 🙂.  \n\n6. **Unclear definition of contributions**  \n   The “Contributions” paragraph does not clearly describe what was actually introduced or achieved relative to prior work.  \n   A contribution section should explicitly state what you did that was not done before. The current phrasing mixes broad intentions with unclear tasks, which makes it difficult for readers to identify the paper’s concrete novelty.  \n   I know this sounds picky, but here it was genuinely important for understanding what the authors consider their contribution.\n\n7. **Weak and outdated results**  \n   The reported FID scores are modest (around 13.7 for digits and 81 for animals) and the claimed improvements over prior work are marginal well within noise.  \n   Comparisons are limited to older GAN-based methods (CycleGAN, MUNIT, StarGAN) and to Zeng et al. (2025).  \n   No modern diffusion-based or transformer-based translation models are included, despite these being the true state of the art.  \n   Therefore, the claim of “state-of-the-art” performance is outdated and not substantiated. The evaluation also relies on small, low-resolution datasets with no variance analysis, further limiting credibility."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could you do it in batches? of course the nearest-neighbor would become weird but this should be a key direction towards a feasible method.\n\n\nI find the use of physics compelling, there is an elegant side of uniforming by density. \nHowever, this paper seems to not be ready. To my understanding, currently the method is not feasible beyond toy data. Comparisons are only to old works and it feels like the writing of the paper is not great.
