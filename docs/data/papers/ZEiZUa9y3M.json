As a data-driven method, L2O leverages neural networks to efficiently produce approximate solutions. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring both optimality and feasibility of neural network's output. To tackle this issue, we introduce Homeomorphic Polar Learning (HoP) to solve the hard-constrained optimization by embedding a homeomorphic mapping in neural networks. The bijective structure enables end-to-end training without extra penalty or correction. For performance evaluation, we evaluate HoP's performance across a variety of synthetic optimization tasks and real-world applications in wireless communications. Across synthetic and real tasks, HoP achieves zero violations while remaining competitive in optimality and significantly faster than classical solvers: on polygon-constrained sinusoidal QP it matches SLSQP within $16\\times$ speedup; on high-dimensional semi-unbounded problems it is tens of times faster than the optimizer with comparable or better objectives; and on QoS-MISO WSR it preserves $0\\%$ violations with $11\\times$ speedup over SCS+FP. These results demonstrate that HoP provides a practical, general, and strictly feasible alternative to penalty-based or projection-based L2O methods.", "tldr": "We propose a Homeomorphic Polar Learning (HoP) to solve the hard constrained optimization problem without extra correction", "keywords": ["Learn-to-optimize", "Polar Learning", "Hard Constraints"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1791c09df25eda71d1e25a43f02e5471afedb61a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Homeomorphic Polar Learning (HoP), an approach for solving hard-constrained optimization problems with feasibility guarantees.

Ambiguity in Interior Reference Point Computation: While the constraint sets are explicitly defined as input-dependent, the setting of the interior reference point remains unclear. If this point is designed to be input-invariant, this should be stated as an explicit assumption. Conversely, if it is input-dependent, the computational expense of recalculating it for each new input would be significant and warrants detailed efficiency analysis (computing the Chebyshev center for general convex constraints beyond a polytope is non-trivial), which is currently absent.

Subsequently, composition with an appropriate mapping (e.g., sigmoid or arctan) smoothly maps the feasible set to the entire domain.

I have reviewed a previous version of this paper, and while it has been moderately revised, many of the major concerns raised earlier remain unresolved.\n\n**(1) Contribution and Novelty:**  \nThe ideas presented in this paper appear closely related to Liang et al. (2023). Although the authors cite this prior work, the paper lacks an explicit and careful discussion of how their approach differs. The authors also do not cite the extended version of that paper ([https://jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-1577.html](https://jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-1577.html)). These omissions make it difficult to assess the originality and scope of this work’s contribution.\n\n**(2) Limitations:**  \nOne of the most challenging aspects of the proposed method seems to be the construction of the homeomorphism $H$, and specifically the term $R(v_\\theta, Y_x)$. Even in the 2D convex case, computing Equation (3) explicitly may be intractable for anything but the simplest sets (e.g., norm balls or polyhedra).  \nThe paper does not discuss the implementation details of $H$ (e.g., whether an analytical expression is required) beyond the examples shown. I find this construction questionable, especially in higher-dimensional or non-convex settings, where constructing such a homeomorphism may become impractical.\n\n**(3) Exposition, Organization, and Reproducibility:**  \nSections 3 and 4 provide a somewhat superficial description of the approach and experiments, making it difficult to follow key details. Many important points are deferred to the appendix, sometimes without sufficient context or cross-referencing. Even with the appendix, reproducing the proposed method for anything beyond basic problems would likely be difficult. The authors’ code does not appear to be available.  \nI also find the discussion in Section 3.2 hard to follow. Conceptually, it makes sense that optimization over highly distorted mappings (as can be expected for maps of an arbitrary set to the entire domain) may suffer from ill-conditioning, potentially leading to stagnation. However, the discussion lacks clarity and context. Moreover, this issue was also discussed in Liang et al. (2023), yet is not cited here, again making it difficult to assess the authors’ contributions.\n\n**(4) High Dimensions and Non-Convexity:**  \nThe generalization of the proposed approach to high-dimensional and non-convex constraints is mentioned throughout the paper somewhat superficially, even though such extensions present significant challenges. The appendices discuss several related issues (e.g., “Toward the Non-Convex Case”), but it is unclear whether these were implemented, for which problems, or how practical they are in more complex scenarios.  \nThe examples presented in the paper are relatively simple: for the non-convex $\\ell_p$-norm constraint, the set is star-convex with respect to the origin (Appendix D), effectively reducing it to a convex case under the mapping. The parabolic constraint appears effectively linear due to small quadratic terms (mentioned only in Appendix C.1.4).
