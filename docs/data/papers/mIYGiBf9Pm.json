Real-world travel planning exemplifies these challenges, evaluating agents’ abilities to handle constraints that are explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management, iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).", "tldr": "General multi-agent framework for real-world constrained travel planning with information search", "keywords": ["Multi-agent orchestration", "Real-world travel planning", "Constraints-aware planning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/82101c320080821d935f00a58ed9db8d702e3a56.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents ATLAS, a multi-agent framework designed to tackle travel planning, which requires reasoning under complex, evolving, and often implicit constraints.

It is worth noting that the experimental comparison in this paper does not include OpenAI's GPT models. Based on my own experiments with TravelPlanner, GPT-5 in sole-planning mode (i.e., planning under constraints as described in the paper) already achieves performance far exceeding the near-zero result reported for the original TravelPlanner, even approaching the performance of ALTAS in Table 2. Given that constraint extraction in TravelPlanner is relatively straightforward, the main challenge in a multi-agent system would still lie in planning under constraints. Therefore, I would be interested to see the results of ALTAS when integrated with GPT-5.  \n\n2. I agree that the insights and the framework proposed in this paper are generalizable to tasks like travel planning, which require both information gathering and strict constraint satisfaction to meet user needs. However, the validation in this work is limited to the travel planning scenario. Although the TravelPlanner benchmark has gained broad attention, its support for constraint satisfaction is confined to propositional logic, includes only a limited set of constraints, and the process of extracting constraints from its template-synthesized queries is relatively straightforward [1]. In real-world scenarios, users often express diverse needs that require first-order logic (FOL) for proper representation, thereby extending constraint extraction and validation into a combinatorial FOL space. From this perspective, if the authors intend to claim robust constraint satisfaction capability in the travel planning domain, it would be valuable to include evaluation on the ChinaTravel benchmark [2], which assesses first-order logic constraint satisfaction. \n\n[1].
