We introduce TigXMM, a cross-lingual, multilingual, and multimodal framework for Tigrigna sentiment analysis, along with the first multimodal sentiment dataset for this language. The dataset, collected from social media, integrates text, emojis, and meme content to capture real-world communication patterns. We benchmark widely used multilingual models, including mBERT, AfriBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa, XLNet, BLOOMZ, and LLaMA, and highlight their limitations in processing multimodal signals. To address these challenges, we design an LLM-based cross-lingual transfer model with multimodal adapters for text, emoji, and meme fusion using hybrid attention and additive–hierarchical strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves sentiment classification performance: from 78.4\\% accuracy on text-only inputs to 81.2\\% with emojis, 86.3\\% with memes, and 89.7\\% when combining all modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance for Tigrigna sentiment analysis.

The technical framework relies on standard, well-known techniques (LoRA, late fusion, multilingual transfer) without introducing new architectures or training objectives. Most of the improvements arise from fine-tuning and scaling rather than conceptual innovation.\n\n2 Outdated references and baselines. The paper still frames LLaMA and LLaMA-2 as “recent,” which is inaccurate in late 2025. Similarly, the baselines omit strong multilingual and multimodal SOTA models such as Mistral-8×7B, Qwen2-VL, Gemini 1.5, or Yi-VL, making the comparisons less meaningful.\n\n3 Weak data curation and transparency. The dataset construction process lacks examples, annotation details, and inter-annotator agreement scores. This undermines the reproducibility of the results and the credibility of the benchmark.\n\n4 Unclear cross-lingual rationale. The use of Amharic as a source language is not sufficiently justified. The authors should explain the linguistic or structural relationship between Amharic and Tigrigna and show ablations confirming its benefit.\n\n5 Insufficient scope for research questions. The second research question (RQ2) mixes cross-lingual and multimodal elements; it should instead focus exclusively on Tigrigna performance to match the paper’s stated aim.\n\n6 Presentation and formatting issues.
