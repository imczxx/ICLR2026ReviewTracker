Our work makes four major contributions: (i) On the Mid-Price Trend Prediction (MPTP) task, we assess state-of-the-art LOB models with a standardized full LOB feature set with time-sensitive features on two assets, equities (FI-2010) and cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), to probe cross-asset generalization under a common protocol. We further benchmark a common LOB feature taxonomy (basic, time-insensitive, time-sensitive) and conduct an ablation on FI-2010. (ii) We extend the study to Mid-Price Return Forecasting (MPRF), jointly evaluating LOB-specific architectures and top-tier general time-series predictors on FI-2010 with MSE, R2, and Pearson correlation. (iii) To enhance multivariate time series prediction models on LOB returns, we propose a lightweight Cross-Variate Mixing Layer (CVML) that plugs into existing models. Empirically, results show that the standardized full feature set yields robust MPTP performance across FI-2010 and Bitcoin while revealing asset-dependent ranking shifts. Besides, time-sensitive features provide sizable improvements on FI-2010, underscoring the importance of temporal signal modeling. Last but not least, our proposed CVML architecture substantially boosts general time series prediction models on MPRF, narrowing the gap to LOB models and advancing return forecasting on LOB data.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["limited order book", "time series prediction", "mid-price trend prediction", "mid-price return forecasting", "benchmark", "open source datasets"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/292bd887ed921f14022e2a342eb114d2c3e7e4d4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6ff1b3815ec8355a949164770d5d0150566ea576.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces LOBBen-TM, a comprehensive benchmark for deep learning on Limit Order Book data. It unifies evaluation across two tasks, multiple feature sets, and two asset types including FI-2010 equities and Bitcoin. The benchmark standardizes a full LOB feature taxonomy with basic, time-insensitive and time-sensitive categories. Time-sensitive features significantly improve performance on one task for FI-2010 equities. Cross-asset experiments show model rankings shift between equities and crypto, reflecting asset-specific dynamics. For the other task, LOB-specific models outperform general time-series architectures, emphasizing domain-specific inductive biases. To address this gap, the authors propose CVML, a lightweight plug-in that enhances multivariate signal mixing in general time-series models. CVML consistently boosts performance across metrics, reduces input noise and improves attention-based modeling of cross-variate and temporal dependencies."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.
