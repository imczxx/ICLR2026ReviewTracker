By learning the conditional distribution of the response variable through conditional normalizing flows and coupling it with a calibration procedure, CMR constructs prediction intervals that are both statistically valid and efficiently sized. Our approach trains a conditional flow model using a simulation-free training method, then employs a novel nonconformity score based on the shortest interval containing the true value among generated samples. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that CMR consistently produces narrower prediction intervals while maintaining the required coverage level and achieving superior tail coverage compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Conformal prediction", "conformal regression", "conditional flow matching"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fe485640f5f9aaad9b90ffd1a46ca8c40551b843.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The manuscript proposes Conditional Flow Matching for Conformal Regression (CMR), which first learns a conditional flow model via the conditional flow-matching objective and then constructs conformal prediction intervals by selecting the shortest continuous interval among samples generated from the learned conditional distribution.

The draft needs a clearer background on CHR -- what it is, its limitations, and why CMR addresses them. At present, the main text references differences from CHR without first defining that baseline. It would also help to expand the discussion of conditional flow matching (motivation, objective, and practical choices). \n2. Please fix notation inconsistencies -- for example, the source distribution shifts from $p_0(y)$ to $p_0(z)$, and $\\mu(y\\mid x)$ is introduced in Eq. 5 but immediately becomes $u_t(y\\mid x)$ in the very next line. Finally, verify dataset citations and include the necessary details to ensure correctness and reproducibility.\n3. The contributions naturally decompose into (1) CFM for quantile regression and (2) CMR for calibration. To substantiate these, the experiments should separately demonstrate: CFM vs. existing quantile regressors (NN, RF); CMR vs. other conformal methods; and the combined method vs. existing combinations. Table 1 adequately supports the third comparison, but Table 2 tries to cover the first two at once and remains incomplete. For instance, CFM with NN/RF baselines are missing. Consider disentangling these ablations so each contribution is evaluated cleanly.\n3. Relative to CHR (with NN or RF), the proposed method appears more computationally demanding. While this may not be a major drawback, please add a computational analysis -- including Big-O complexity and empirical runtimes -- for training, calibration, and inference.

Several indices are introduced ($j, k, s, m$), but it is unclear which quantities are fixed and which are being optimized or iterated over. For example, the algorithm selects the shortest interval containing at least $s$ samples, yet $s$ is never defined. Without a clear specification of these components, it is difficult to evaluate the method,\n\n\nThere is no theoretical justification or conceptual intuition given for why the proposed conformity score should yield more efficient (narrower) intervals than standard conformal methods. The paper argues for improved efficiency based on empirical results, but does not explain the mechanism or provide supporting analysis.\n\nThe proposed conformal prediction method only requires a conditional generative model for the outcome, yet the paper devotes substantial attention to normalizing flow matching. It is unclear why this modeling choice is emphasized, since the method does not introduce any new developments in flow matching and the theory does not appear to rely on this specific class of models.

In equation 5, what is mu(Y|X)?\nThere is no u_t in equation 5, yet is mentioned directly below it.\nWhat is p_t?\n\n2. Am I correct that Equation 6 means that y is normally distributed given x and z_0 with mean y_1 + (1-t)z_0 and variance sigma^2?

The calibration procedure (the main contribution of the paper) in Section 3.3 is not clearly specified. In particular, the quantity \\(s\\) in Step 3 is never defined: it is unclear whether \\(s\\) is fixed, varies with the desired coverage level, or is meant to be tuned or iterated over. The text suggests that $s$ determines how many sampled predictions must lie inside the interval, but this is never stated formally, and no guidance is given for how $s$ should be chosen. Algorithm~1 does not resolve this ambiguity, as $s$ does not appear as an input, output, or tunable parameter. As written, the calibration step is not reproducible: the paper does not explain how $s$ is selected and how it relates to the target miscoverage level $\\alpha$. What is s in the simulations?\n\n5. Similarly, what is j in  Section 3.3 I and Section 3.4? What is the minimization performed over in equation (13)? Is j and k varying?

The focus on using connected intervals and finding the shortest one may put too much attention on a not too important part of conformal prediction. Also, the examples and illustrations seem either unnatural (e.g. Figure 1, a clearly bimodal density of y) or not clearly explained, so the conclusions about the benefits of CMR are not very convincing.\n\n1. The writing can be much improved. Right now, the descriptions are redundant in some places and lack information in others. Below are a few examples.\n\n1.1 sec 3.1 is not clear enough. It should be written such that a reader with decent machine learning background can understand the idea without consulting the original Conditional flow matching paper. E.g., in equation (6), it's not clear why x and z_0 where conditioned upon in symbols, but not y_1, and please indicate t is the (time) index of the flow, and do you expect t to take on discrete or continuous values and in what range? For another example, it was not self-evident what a \"vector field\" means in this context.\n\n1.2 sec 3.3 step 3 description can be improved. It would be cleaner to give \"k-j+1\" its own symbol, say s, and say, for 2<=s<=m, consider intervals with end points y^(j) and y^(j+s-1) etc. I think steps 3 and 4 are trying to describe a rather simple and clear procedure to find the shortest interval that covers the true y and record the \"Length\" of that interval, and the steps can be made shorter and easier to grasp.\n\nMinor but hurts clarity: First paragragh of sec 4.2 Real data. What are the letter labelled data? What does it mean to \"rescale the response by the mean absolute value\"? What does it ment that the \"split has been validated\" in a cited paper? (BTW, in Latex, `` '' specifies a proper pair of quotation marks.)\n\nSec 4.3. Consider including a table listing all the names with short description of each. Here, the logic/terminology of the first two paragraphs confuses me:\nI thought CFM is the conformal part of CMR, what does it mean to \"demo how CFM and CMR joinly enhance efficiency...\". \n\n2. There are places where the statement lacks rigorosity:\n\n2.1 Theorem 1. It was not clearly stated what data was used to train the Conditional flow in CFM, and if that data is conditioned upon when stating the coverage property.\n\n2.2 When stating \"key difference from CHR\", note that CHR was not cited or defined until much later, and the author claimed \"CMR ... a method that theoretically yields smaller intervals compared CHR\". Given the intervals are random, more careful (probabilistic) statement about length comparison are likely needed. And I don't see this statement offically proved in the paper, including Appendix A.3.\n\nFigure 1, this example of the density of y is a rather extreme case with bimodal distribution, where connected interval is clearly not the go-to-choice for prediction region. This looks like a very artificial example to try to find an advantage of CMR over CHR.
