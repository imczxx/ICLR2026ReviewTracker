Recently, the trend for this task has been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human aesthetics and more explainable.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Layout Generation", "Multi-modal Large Language Models", "Relation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/68a5b427a05a9c5b95f6a8eff58391142b57c41d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an approach, ReLayout, to add layout constraints to an existing layout dataset.

Novelty of the proposed idea: This work tries to incorporate some low-level constraints (the relationships among the design elements, such as negative space, alignment, non-overlapping, and saliency) into graphic design layouts. This paper presents it in a way like it is never considered before. In fact, it is largely studied by existing works. For example, [1] explicitly models different types of layout constraints for graphic design; [2] considers the empty space (or negative space) and overlapping among design elements; and [3] considers saliency information in layout generation. This paper does not discuss what existing works have done.\n\n2. Problems with the Layout Relation-CoT construction method. First, I am not sure why the generation of relations is related to CoT. While the relations may be generated in a hierarchical manner, I do not see how it is a step-by-step generation. In fact, I am really confused how this method can even be remotely related to CoT. Second, the recovery of the relations among the design elements is actually rather straightforward. I do not see how this method is novel.\n\n3. Problems with the Layout Prototype Rebalance Sampler. First, by adjusting the sample distribution, I agree that less frequent samples will get sampled more frequently. However, would this also create a negative effect that popular designs become less popular while rare designs become popular? Second, why is the layout prototype rebalance sampler novel? Where is it novel? This is not discussed in the paper.\n\n\n[1] Peter O’Donovan, Aseem Agarwala, and Aaron Hertzmann. Learning Layouts for Single-Page Graphic Designs.

There is a gap between the motivation and the proposed method. The motivation of this paper is inspired by the Chain-of-thought (CoT) that progressively obtains element relations step by step. However, CoT belongs to an inference-time technique, while the proposed method belongs to data transformation for training. I am not sure how the stated relation-CoT is used in MLLM training and inference. The structure-level understanding and the high-level layout design concepts (L82-L84) should be illustrated more clearly.\n2. The technical contributions are relatively limited. The two mechanisms proposed by this paper, i.e., layout relation-CoT construction and prototype rebalance sampler, belong to dataset engineering works. First, the construction mechanism mainly uses several heuristic rules to decompose layout element relationships into a hierarchical structure. These rules have been thoroughly discussed in traditional graphic design works. Second, the rebalance sampler utilizes a simple clustering method to reconsider the effect of different layout clusters.\n3. Both quantitative and qualitative results cannot show a significant performance improvement between the proposed method and existing works. Based on the results in Table 1, compared to RALF and LayoutPrompter, the proposed method can only achieve comparable or slightly better results on the CGL dataset. Take the third column in Fig.6 as an example. The graphic design created by the proposed method also contains an alignment issue.\n4. The saliency map is derived from an existing Infrared Small Target Detection work (L691-L693). The choice of adopting object detection work here is questionable. In addition, visual saliency detection on natural images is different from that on graphic designs.\n5. The limitations stated on the last page are not very clear.

For example, as shown in Figure 1, due to the error alignment of the text boxes, PosterLlama produces distorted elements. It is not clear how this issue is addressed by introducing layout relation-CoT.\n- When predicting the elements, its style contains both the margin attributes and the bounding box information. In such formulation, each element have 5 attributes, which inevitably causes positioning conflicts. What is the motivation to use this output format? Are there any ablation studies on removing the margin attributes from the output?\n- The implementation details of the features $f_i^s$ and $f_i^r$ are not included in the paper.\n- Due to the rebalance sampling strategy, ReLayout appears to be inefficient.
