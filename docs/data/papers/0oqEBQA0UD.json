However, missing peaks are common in mass spectrometry-based \\emph{de novo} peptide sequencing and significantly influence the accuracy of peptide reconstruction. Existing methods mainly rely on the original mass-to-charge ratio and intensity of peaks, but fail to reconstruct a complete peptide sequence when key peaks are missing. To address this issue, we propose PeakNovo, a \\emph{de novo} peptide sequencing method that integrates candidate mass spectra search with masked self-distillation. To enhance the robustness of the mass spectrometry (MS) encoder in handling missing peaks, the Masked Self-distillation module feeds a masked local spectrum into the student branch and a complete global spectrum into the teacher branch for alignment. Enabling the encoder to learn consistent representations from local to global views, mitigating the effect of missing peaks. Meanwhile, PeakNovo employs an MS Fusion module to retrieve a set of candidate spectra similar to the input spectrum from the database. These candidate spectra are fused with the representation of the input spectrum to provide supplementary information for potentially missing peaks. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PeakNovo consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["de novo peptide sequencing"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1d0ad755abee81dd8caa5e61d0ee49f284475be2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work proposes a new method for de novo sequencing, called PeakNovo.

Indeed, my main critique of this work is that, although you claim to be solving the de novo sequencing problem, in practice you really aren't.  Instead, you are solving some new, closely related task where the input is a spectrum plus some (potentially huge) database of additional spectra, and the output is the amino acid sequence of the spectrum.  Where this database should come from or how to select its contents seems quite problematic.  In particular, there is a potential for a sort of leakage to occur here, since the auxiliary database may well contain multiple spectra that were generated from the same peptide that you are attempting to decode.\n\nI found the abstract confusing because in line 24 you suddenly start talking about a database, even though you are supposedly proposing a de novo sequencing method.  It was only at line 255 (on p. 5) that I finally figured out that you are talking about a database of spectra rather than peptides.  This is very confusing, because (for whatever reason), in MS/MS analysis, a collection of peptides is called a \"database\" whereas a collection of spectra (used in search) is called a \"library.\"  This database needs to be introduced and clearly explained much earlier.  In particular, it's important to indicate whether these are annotated spectra (i.e., spectra with associated peptides) or just spectra.  From the description, it sounds like it is the latter.\n\nGiven the concerns outlined above,  I was pretty shocked to see that you never even told us what spectrum database was used in the experiments reported in Section 4.4.  This makes the results impossible to reproduce, and it also makes it impossible to figure out whether there is a potential for leakage.\n\nMinor:\n\nLine 71: You should qualify the initial phrase a bit.  This claim only applies to recent deep learning models.\n\nLine 107: The charge distribution is not uniform. There are many more +2 charges than +1, for example.\n\nLine 132: InstaNovo's novelty does not lie in introducing a precursor encoder.\n\nAt around line 182, I think it would be sensible to provide a brief overview of how the model works, prior to diving into the details.  You need to explain that there are two encoders and how they related to the student and teacher modules.  As it is, the student and teacher are mentioned on line 195 without ever being introduced.\n\nLine 215: Typos (double comma, misspelled word)\n\nI don't understand how missing peaks can have \"unstable intensities\" (line 140).  A missing peak has no intensity.  I am guessing that you mean missing peaks AND unstable intensities (in the non-missing peaks).\n\nLine 297: It's important to clarify that the data from the InstaNovo paper consists of spectra (not peptides), and that those are real spectra derived from synthesized peptide sequences.\n\nLine 328: Doesn't Casanovo have actual version numbers associated with various releases of the software?  You should use those, rather than saying CasanovoV2.\n\nIn Section 4.3, you should make clear that you are simply using previously reported results for all methods except your own, and you should state where those results are being taken from."}, "questions": {"value": "Why is there no weighting parameter on the two terms in the loss function (Equation 8)?\n\nMaybe I missed it, but I don't think you ever explained what is the architecture of the self-distillation module.

The paper does not report key computational efficiency metrics of the MS Fusion module, including inference time per spectrum and memory usage during batch processing. In large-scale proteomics studies, researchers often need to analyze datasets containing millions of spectra, and computational efficiency is a critical factor for the practical adoption of a method. For example, if PeakNovo requires significantly more time or memory than baseline models like CasanovoV2, it may not be feasible for large-scale data analysis.\n3. Although the paper states that PeakNovo outperforms baselines in post-translational modification (PTM) identification, it does not specify which types of PTMs (e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation) were included in the experiments. Different PTMs have distinct chemical properties and abundances in biological samples, leading to varying detection difficulties—for instance, phosphorylation (a low-abundance but biologically critical PTM) is often harder to identify than acetylation. Additionally, the paper does not mention whether PeakNovo can handle complex PTM scenarios, such as multiple modifications on a single peptide."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can you supplement experimental results of PeakNovo on real-world clinical samples (e.g., tumor tissue-derived peptide samples) with naturally occurring missing peaks (rather than artificially dropped peaks)? Such results would help verify whether PeakNovo’s robustness to missing peaks translates to practical clinical proteomics scenarios, where MS data quality is often compromised by sample complexity?\n2. Could you provide specific computational efficiency data for PeakNovo, including inference time per spectrum and memory usage when processing batches of 32 (consistent with the training batch size), and compare these metrics with baseline models like CasanovoV2? This information is essential to assess whether PeakNovo can be applied to large-scale MS datasets commonly used in proteomics research.\n3. For the PTM identification experiments, please explicitly list all PTM types included in the evaluation (e.g., phosphorylation at serine/threonine, acetylation at lysine) and provide separate performance metrics (precision, recall) for each type. Additionally, can you clarify whether the experiments included peptides with multiple PTMs, and if so, how PeakNovo performs on these complex cases?\n4. Why was InstaNovo (a recent Transformer-based de novo sequencing model mentioned in the related work section that achieves strong performance on high-resolution MS data) not included as a baseline for comparison? If InstaNovo is added to the baseline set, does PeakNovo still maintain its performance advantages in terms of peptide-level precision and AUC?\n5. In the Masked Self-distillation module, you used a combination of random masking and contiguous neighborhood masking to simulate missing peaks. Have you conducted comparative experiments with other masking strategies, such as intensity-based masking (masking low-intensity peaks that are more likely to be missing in real MS data)? If yes, what were the results; if no, why was the current masking strategy chosen over alternatives?\n6. The paper mentions that the MS Fusion module retrieves candidate spectra using MatchMS with an initial mass tolerance window of ±20 Da, expanding by 10 Da increments if fewer than k candidates are found. Have you tested the impact of different initial mass tolerance windows (e.g., ±10 Da, ±30 Da) on PeakNovo’s performance?
