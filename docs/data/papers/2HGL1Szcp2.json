Among threats, \\textit{visual perturbation–based data poisoning} poses a severe risk, where tiny edits/perturbations are added to a small subset of training images and later trigger hallucinations on clean inputs. Despite their potency, effective defenses remain elusive. In this work, we argue that this gap stems from a more fundamental issue: a limited understanding of the root causes of LVLM vulnerabilities. To address this, we systematically study the fine-tuning process and, for the first time, identify data memorization as the key vulnerability: *LVLMs tend to over-memorize fine-tuning concepts, directly leading to hallucinations in fine-tuned models. Our finding overturns the usual story: the dominant driver is **over-memorization** of injected concepts, not the edits themselves.* Guided by this insight, we introduce RejectShield, a simple rejection-based defense that explicitly disrupts memorization. Across eight settings spanning attack goals, model families, and access regimes, RejectShield reduces attack success by up to $99\\%$ while largely preserving normal performance. Finally, we discuss broader implications of this memorization vulnerability, including evaluation methods that test concept replay and training practices that mitigate memorization pressure.

First of all it is commonly understood that memorization is the cause of data poisoning, otherwise such low percentages of poisoning will never lead to model being poisoned so effectively as demonstrated in this and several previous works. Therefore it is not the contribution of this paper to claim that memorization leads to data poisoning, it is kind of obvious. \n2. The claims about multimodal being more subject to data poisoning is also something previous papers have found, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09667. \n3. The approach RejectShield which should have been the main contribution of this paper if it is such an effective technique has been treated as second class citizen in the work, there is hardly any mention of how it works. The authors just say that they have built a technique that can detect if an image has adversarial perturbation. As far as my understanding of adversarial attacks in images goes, this is an unsolved problem in the image community since 2013 when adversarial attacks in images were first discovered and there exist no reliable classifiers that given an image can predict if the image has an adversarial attack or not. So I am very curious of the details of how the authors of this work were able to achieve that. Please provide more details of the training data, training procedure, and the robustness of this classifier. \n4. There are several possible errors in the paper. For example in line 180 (x_d, y_d) is not the benign image, it is the target pair, right? \n5. Another mistake is in line 211 where the authors state the model was trained on the benign counterparts x_d (and not x_p), if that is the case then how did the model learn any poison (like where did the 1% poison in Figure 2 come from)?

This paper shows that the effectiveness of Shadowcast does not come from the poisoned attack, but the hallucination of the model. I think this makes sense to me, as the injected images contain only a single class, which likely introduces strong data bias and induces hallucination. However, it remains unclear whether this limitation is unique to Shadowcast or shared across other poisoning setups. To support the claim that over-memorization, rather than poisoning, drives the observed effect, the authors should conduct additional experiments under varied training configurations and data distributions. Without such evidence, the generality of the conclusion remains uncertain. \n2. The paper only evaluates the Shadowcast attack. Including more advanced attack methods (e.g, [1]) could strengthen the robustness of the conclusion.\n\nOther Concerns\n1. The authors only evaluate the LLaVA v1.5 and MiniGPT-4 which are a little bit outdated right now.

The authors repeatedly state that \"backdoors are not successful because of the pixels\" but what does this even mean? \n- **Unsurprising Result in Figure 1** This result is unsurprising, as the pixel perturbations in backdoor attacks are meant to (1) enforce imperceptibility and (2) to prevent interference with other concepts that may exist in the finetuning dataset.  In the setting you have selected, the effect is likely observed due to their choice of concepts which are rare, low-overlap categories like engine lights naturally face little interference from clean data, making memorization-driven attacks appear stronger than they would for more common concepts.

The experiment results suggest the reason the ShadowCast attack appears to be not mitigated by just input purification defenses is that the target model cannot distinguish samples containing the destination concept and samples containing the origin concept, due to that the model is fine-tuned with an unbalanced amount of target samples. I think there are some open questions the paper does not address that make it unclear about how to interpret the results of the paper. For example, if under the controlled experiment or after input purification, the target model does not only respond the prompts about the origin concept with information about the destination, but also respond to prompts about some other similar concepts with information about the destination concept, then it suggests what is observed is hallucination as a side effect of the targeted attack, and the targeting itself has been mitigated.
