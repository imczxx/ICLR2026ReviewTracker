Yet despite the rapid development of molecular representation models, there is no comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their treatment of 3D conformational information.\nWe introduce 3DCS, the first benchmark for 3D Conformational Sensitivity in MRs. 3DCS evaluates whether representations within the same molecule (i) preserve geometric variation, (ii) capture chirality, and (iii) reflect the energy landscape. To enable this, we curate three large-scale datasets ($>$1M molecules, $\\sim$10M conformers) spanning relaxed torsional scans, chiral drug candidates, and AIMD trajectories, and propose a unified Geometry–Chirality–Energy (GCE) evaluation framework.\nEmpirical analysis reveals that while modern data-driven MRs are highly geometry-sensitive, they inconsistently handle chirality and poorly align with energy, which is often overlooked. 3DCS thus provides the first rigorous benchmark for developing physically grounded, functionally reliable 3D molecular representations.", "tldr": "3DCS: The first benchmark to rigorously evaluate how well molecular representations capture intra-molecular conformational sensitivity across geometry, chirality, and energy.", "keywords": ["Molecule Benchmark", "AI for Science"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3876a5c375cd21a98cc6b4f198e6c756fa55ec11.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces three datasets designed to benchmark molecular representations in their ability to capture 3D structural information.

The authors advocate a two-layer framework: (a) reference alignment between pairs of conformers that takes into account the discrepancy in atomic positions after alignment, fraction of mismatched stereocenters, and difference in potential energy; and (b) manifold consistency between local neighbourhoods. Five baselines, namely, E3FP (classical, non-neural 3D fingerprints), UniMol, MolAE, GemNet, and MolSpectra that encode 3D information are evaluated.

I'm not aware of other datasets for quantifying chirality in a meaningful way."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "--- One of the reasons that hinders the ability of molecular representations to reflect chirality properly is due to equivariance [1]. Specifically, E(3)-equivariant models provably struggle with chirality, while learning chirality-aware features under SE(3)-invariance has high complexity in terms of the number of atoms (O(N^4)).  The current experimental setup already includes the UniMol baseline which implements an SE(3)-equivariant transformer. It would strengthen the paper considerably if the benchmark indeed shows improved performance with a field-based model [1] that is designed to handle chirality better than the equivariant representations. \n\n---The authors claim in the discussion section that “Neural architecture such as SE(3)-equivariant transformers and message-passing networks (MPNNs) capture long-range dependencies and global structure.” I understand why this should hold for SE(3)-equivariant transformers, but do not see how MPNNs capture long-range dependencies and global structure. This is very counterintuitive and goes against conventional wisdom, since MPNNs have a strong inbuilt locality bias and are known to struggle with global properties such as the number of substructures (e.g., cycles) etc.\n\n--- It’s not clear whether/to what extent the estimated energy values pertaining to the geometry dataset obtained with relaxed scan are consistent with the ground truth in the absence of wetlab validation (in contrast to MD simulations, where DFT is employed for reasonably accurate estimates). \n\n--- The methods used for evaluation are not quite state of the art. For example, none of the best-performing methods for predicting energy and force of conformations in the molecular dynamics experiment (such as NequIP, TopNets, MACE) are included.  \n\n--- All three aspects (geometry, chirality, and energy) seem to have been evaluated in unconditional settings (i.e., absent protein targets). In practice, one really cares about target-specific sensitivity of molecular conformations. \n\n--- There seems to be a discrepancy in terms of the stated number of conformers at different parts of the paper. Specifically, in the introduction the authors mention that \"We curate three datasets that contain over 1M molecules and 110M conformers: (i) a relaxed scan dataset with∼1.5M molecules and almost 100 million conformers obtained by rotating an inter-ring bond and relaxing the rest\nof the structure;\".

Potential limitation in the geometry sensitivity assumption. The evaluation of geometry sensitivity relies on the assumption that _if two conformers have large atomic coordinate differences (high RMSD), their representation distance should also be large_. This assumption may not always hold physically: Two conformers with large RMSD can have very similar energies or functions. Conversely, small geometric differences can correspond to substantial energetic or functional changes. Thus, the current geometric metrics (Spearman/Kendall correlations with RMSD) may overemphasize purely geometric deviations without distinguishing physically meaningful conformational changes."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to my proposed weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "NKfVIJdWBI", "forum": "JAb0y8lkqL", "replyto": "JAb0y8lkqL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11768/Reviewer_bj3T"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11768/Reviewer_bj3T"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11768/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762018491431, "cdate": 1762018491431, "tmdate": 1762922791232, "mdate": 1762922791232, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
