While traditional fixed-time control methods are simple and infrastructure-efficient, they fail to adapt to complex and dynamic traffic patterns, particularly during peak periods or in the presence of emergency vehicles. In this paper, we address the emergency-vehicle-aware traffic signal control problem by proposing a decoupled policy fusion framework that separately optimizes control strategies for regular vehicles and emergency vehicles. The two policies are later combined into a global strategy with automatically learned weights, mitigating the negative impact of $Q$-function approximation errors. We further introduce SplitEMV, a novel multi-agent model that enhances inter-agent communication and decision efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves emergency vehicle response times while preserving efficiency of regular vehicles. The learned emergency vehicle prioritized policy also integrates seamlessly with existing traffic signal control methods in a zero-shot manner, supporting practical deployment.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Traffic Signal Control", "Reinforcement Learning", "Separable Policy Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/92735049c3fb708380f3796550c8dd792c62ef7d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Separable Policy Learning (SplitEMV) for emergency-vehicle-prioritized traffic signal control.

The proposed method assumes that the objectives of regular vehicles (RVs) and emergency vehicles (EMVs) can be fully separated into two independent Q-functions that are later linearly combined. However, in real traffic systems, the behaviors of RVs and EMVs are strongly coupled, priority signals for EMVs inevitably affect surrounding traffic flows. This independence assumption may therefore be unrealistic, and the linear combination $Q=Q_N=\\beta Q_E$ lacks theoretical justification under such interdependence. As a result, the optimality and stability of the decoupled strategy remain uncertain.\n\nQ2. Although the paper presents promising results on the Hangzhou and Jinan datasets, the experimental scope is relatively narrow. The evaluation lacks diversity in traffic conditions and network scales. Furthermore, the baselines are mostly classical MaxPressure-based reinforcement learning models, without comparisons to SOTA methods. This limited set of benchmarks and environments constrains the robustness and external validity of the reported improvements.\n\nQ3. While the paper attributes performance improvement to separable policy learning and adaptive strategy merging, the state representation and model architecture differ significantly from the baselines. SplitEMV uses fine-grained lane-level inputs with multiple features, including lane direction, signal phase, and emergency-vehicle indicators, and employs multi-head attention for inter-lane communication. In contrast, the baselines such as CoLight, PressLight, and MPLight rely primarily on aggregated vehicle counts. Without controlling for state complexity or citing related representation-learning studies, it is difficult to isolate whether the improvements stem from the proposed learning framework or from the enhanced feature design and network capacity."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5psc4sLpKS", "forum": "6W5YQcelrz", "replyto": "6W5YQcelrz", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13159/Reviewer_Y6mL"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13159/Reviewer_Y6mL"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13159/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761668207548, "cdate": 1761668207548, "tmdate": 1762923873061, "mdate": 1762923873061, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles emergency-vehicle-prioritized traffic signal control by proposing SplitEMV, a reinforcement learning framework that separately learns policies for regular and emergency vehicles, then merges them via an Adaptive Strategy Merging (ASM) mechanism.

All experiments are conducted in simulated SUMO environments. There is no field deployment or real-world validation to demonstrate robustness against sensor noise, communication delays, or unexpected vehicle behaviors.  Suggestion: It would be informative to evaluate performance in CityFlow or other simulation platforms with more realistic and heterogeneous traffic conditions.\n2. While SplitEMV outperforms EMVLight and several DRL baselines, it does not include comparisons with recent multi-agent or graph-based TSC systems, such as RobustLight (ICML 2025), DMBP, or DiffLight. The absence of these baselines makes the “state-of-the-art” claim somewhat overstated.\n3. Although the paper reports comparable runtime performance, the training process appears more complex due to: two independent Q-functions (QN, QE), multi-stage learning phases, and adaptive normalization (ASM) for β.  Moreover, no quantitative analysis of training time, convergence rate, or scalability is provided.\n4. The method assumes accurate and delay-free EMV state communication to all agents. In real-world urban networks, localization errors, sensor failures, or communication latency could cause incorrect priority assignments. These limitations are not discussed.\n5. The connection between ASM normalization and policy optimality remains largely qualitative. During training, the RV model (Q_N) and EMV model (Q_E) are trained independently, yet later considered equivalent in the joint stage. Similarly, rewards $r^n$ and $r^e$ are treated as identical, without justification. These components should instead be adjustable to environmental conditions."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The approach requires extensive manual tuning of β and other hyperparameters, making it labor-intensive and potentially difficult to replicate.\n2. Several recent and relevant baselines (e.g., RobustLight, DMBP, DiffLight) were not included, which limits the comprehensiveness of the comparative study.\n3. Although the paper criticizes fixed β, it still relies on empirical normalization constants. Despite dedicating significant space to discussing β’s effects, it fails to explain how ASM adapts dynamically to unseen traffic patterns. The automatic adaptive normalization mechanism for β remains unclear and potentially unstable.\n4. The training pipeline, particularly the adaptive strategy merging process shown in Figure 1, is insufficiently explained. A detailed algorithmic description or pseudocode should be provided to clarify the procedure.\n5. The claimed zero-shot generalization is effectively a linear policy fusion, not true zero-shot transfer to unseen tasks. Since the EMV policy requires offline pretraining on similar distributions, this claim could mislead readers.\n6. The method seems overfitting to training cities due to heavy reliance on tuned β values and validation-based hyperparameter adjustment.
