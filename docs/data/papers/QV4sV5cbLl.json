Past works, by segmenting and then performing various vectorized post-processing, usually sacrifice accuracy. Motivated by the recent huge success of auto-regressive visual-language modeling, we propose the first map foundational model: Map Auto-Regressor (MARS), that is capable of generating both multi-polyline road networks and polygon buildings in a unified manner. We collected by far the largest multi-class map dataset, MAP-3M, to support the robust training. Extensive benchmarks highlight the superiority of MARS against literature works.

The key idea is to treat maps as a foreign language: all vector primitives (points, polylines/roads, polygons/buildings) are serialized via a map-to-sequence procedure, and then a vision encoder + autoregressive transformer decodes the whole map token by token. On top of that, the authors introduce “Chat with MARS”, an interactive, human-in-the-loop decoding mode (start-/mid-/end-of-sequence interventions) that can fix missing or drifting map objects with 1–2 clicks. To support this, the paper also curates MAP-3M, which is the largest aerial-image + multi-class (roads + buildings) dataset so far (∼3M tiles, wide US coverage, NAIP imagery + Overture/OSM labels). Experiments on Cityscale, SpaceNet, and AICrowd show that the unified, class-agnostic, autoregressive model is competitive with or close to SOTA methods that are narrowly specialized."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "* Framing vectorized map generation as AR sequence modeling is elegant: one decoder, one vocabulary, one loss, multiple geometry types. This is nicer than the usual “segmentation → heuristic post-processing” pipeline.\n* Even though the current demos look a bit toy-ish, the idea of AR decoding + teacher forcing ⇒ promptability is solid, and the paper shows three concrete intervention modes (SOS/MOS/EOS) with quantitative gains. This is, in my view, the most future-facing part.\n* A 3M-tile, dual-class, US-wide, reasonably high-res dataset that already comes vectorized would be very valuable to the community, especially for people doing OSM updating, change detection, and AD map pretraining. This alone can justify publication if it’s really as large, clean, and diverse as stated.\n* On Cityscale / SpaceNet they get very reasonable TOPO F1s, sometimes higher recall than road-specialized models, which is non-trivial for a generic AR model."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* Right now the two main claims — “we have a 3M, dual-class, high-quality dataset” and “we have a working general AR map model” — cannot be verified. In the last year I have seen many papers claim “large-scale dataset” and the final release was (i) much smaller, (ii) missing one of the modalities, or (iii) under a restrictive license. So the impact is contingent on actual release.\n* The whole “maps as a sequence” story stands or falls with the correctness of the stroke decomposition at intersections, roundabouts, and T-junctions. If this step introduces topology errors or weird ordering, the model will happily learn those artifacts. This should be stress-tested more.\n* The 1-click / 2-click “Chat with MARS” is impressive, but in the current form it is still a single-object recovery tool. For real OSM editing or AD map maintenance, users will want multi-round constraints (e.g., “keep these 3 roads, regenerate everything north of x”), not only point hints.\n* I suggest citing some downstream application papers like P-MapNet: Far-seeing map generator enhanced by both SDMap and HDMap priors."}, "questions": {"value": "* Will MAP-3M be truly public, with both imagery and vector labels, or only labels?
