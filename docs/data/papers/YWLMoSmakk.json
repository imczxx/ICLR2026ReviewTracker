However, these models commonly produce redundant transformations in middle-to-deep layers. This manifests as transformations between the inputs and output in a layer containing pronounced linear correlation or near irrelevance components. This paper attributes its root cause to current training paradigms. These paradigms emphasize prediction accuracy while neglect the effectiveness of nonlinear transformations in model layers. Based on this observation, we propose criteria for identifying redundant transformations. To quantify the degree of redundancy, we further propose a Coherence-based Redundancy (CR) measure. Specifically, we treat the input and output of a model layer as sequence distributions. We leverage characteristic functions and Fourier transform to map the distributions to frequency-domain representations. Finally, we compute coherence in the complex plane and assess the effectiveness of transformations on a [0,1] coherence scale. To suppress redundant transformations at layer outputs, we propose two schemes: tree-structured residual paths and a coherence-based redundancy loss. These approaches guide middle-to-deep layers to produce effective transformations. At the same time, they supervise and regularize against redundant outputs. Our pre-training experiments on Llama3-130M with 12 layers demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce redundant transformations. With training settings held constant, we successfully make the 12-layer model outperform the 14-layer baseline.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Redundancy Identification", "Coherence-based Redundancy measure", "Redundancy Regularization"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/91c3857fdd5f850e1c9ee98e384c8d1956534b8e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tries to address the problem that layers in mid-to-deep layers don't do too much anymore.

That makes it easier to argue about.\n\nIn the def of L_CR, Coherence is not defined. Before, you define Coherence as a function of k, but here, it is not a function of k. What is it?\n\nAlso, in the def of L_CR, you should make proper use of Latex. Use `\\operatorname` or so.\n\nIn the def of L_CR, this is depending on the layer index L? (Btw, capital L is weird for layer index. Capital L is usually the num of layers.) But then, in the final loss, you also use L_CR, but there is no L anymore? So this does not fit together.\n\nLooking at Figure 4, it looks like most of the improvements are because of the tree-structured residual path, while the improvements from the new regularization is minimal?\n\nFigure 4 (a) and Figure 4 (c), why to have them separate and not in a single plot? They look like they should be together? Also, they look extremely similar anyway...\n\nWhat is the training speed overhead for the tree-structured residual path?

Also, train on larger models. Also, train on multiple different sizes, to better see the overall trends. Also, train with other model variants, e.g. Transformer++.\n\nAlso, don't just show perplexity. Do evaluation on some other benchmarks.\n\nThere could be more studies on variants of ways how to measure the coherence. There are many possible other ways how to measure it, e.g. any kind of similarity measure.\n\nFigure 1 (c) is a bit unclear. There is an outgoing arrow for E, 0 and 1. Where does it go? There is an incoming error for 0, 1 and 2. Where does it come from? Just connect all the arrows and don't let me guess on this. Also, I guess you also have the normal residual connections? Just make them all explicit. When you add them up, also make that explicit, by adding an \"+\" node in the graph.\n\nThe exact definition of the model with the tree-structured residual path is not clear for me.

But nowhere in the paper is a criteria for identifying redundant transformations clearly defined. Since this is one of the stated contributions it should be very clearly defined in the text somewhere.\n\nline 140: This sentence doesn't make sense, and should be rewritten: \"It is very high that the average cosine similarity of some middle-to-deep transformer layers, as shown in 1 (a).\"\n\nThe notion of redundancy as being indicated by high cosine similarity is imprecise. Even a high (but not 1.0) cosine similarity indicates some difference between the features. It may be that this small difference is useful, or even critical, in performing the task, to represent small but crucial bits of detail distinguishing one class from another. The paper needs to be more precise in specifying what cosine similarity level constitutes an irredeemable redundancy.\n\nline 222: \"Although prior research Men et al.

As shown in 1 (a) and 2 (a), in the baseline model the input–output coherence and the cosine similarity exhibit the same trend from 1 to 10 attention sub-layers\".

Why not just use cosine similarity to measure and control redundancy?"}, "questions": {"value": "It seems that what is not mentioned in this paper, which should be I think, is that layer redundancy also means that training time is being wasted. With large models taking very long times to train, resulting in high costs and resource usage, reducing training time or wasting less training time is an important consideration. I suggest the authors add this to the motivation for their method, as opposed to say pruning which reduces network size but does not reduce wasted training time.\nOf course, one counter-argument is that the issue is not inefficient training, but perhaps the redundancy is due to insufficient training. Would continued training, with new or augmented data force the network to reduce layer redundancy?\n\nLine 77: what proof or evidence is there that distributions are more easily separated in the complex plane?\n\nOn line 156: \"If the residual branch gradient term is too small, the derivative of this layer tends to approach the identity matrix\". But what evidence is there that this gradient term is actually too small? How small is too small?\n\nLine 183: \"this paper is devoted to accurately identifying redundant transformations\". How is accuracy defined here? Is there some ground truth for redundant transformations? If not, how can one talk about accuracy in this context?\n\nLine 237: \"And frequency-domain coherence is more analytical.\" What is meant by \"analytical\" here? With regard to complex signals, analytic refers to complex-valued signals with no negative frequency components.\n\nLine 286: \"Combined with the criteria for redundant transformations, it can be inferred as follows. When coherence approaches 0, it indicates invalid feature transformation. And when coherence approaches 1, it indicates insufficient nonlinear transformation between features.\".
