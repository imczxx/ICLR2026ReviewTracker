The conformal component is entirely standard (split conformal with top-k quantile calibration). There is no novel conformity score, no modified calibration rule, and no new theoretical insight about conformal validity under noisy labels. The main contribution is anchor identifiability, which belongs more to noisy-label learning or multi-annotator modeling rather than to conformal prediction.\n2. The paper assumes that coverage guarantees derived on anchor subsets transfer to general noisy test samples, but this is never justified.\n3. Exchangeability may not hold once anchors are selected via annotator agreement, so the claimed “distribution-free validity under noisy labels” is overstated.\n4. The anchor identifiability theorems are essentially restatements of existing results in label-noise learning (e.g., Xia et al., NeurIPS 2019) under multi-annotator independence assumptions. The conformal theorem is a trivial re-use of standard results from Shafer & Vovk (2008).\n5. Experiments are limited to two single-cell RNA-seq datasets; no controlled noise experiments, no cross-domain evaluation (e.g., image or NLP), and no comparison with other noise-aware or conformal baselines. Thus, the empirical evidence is insufficient to support claims of general “noise robustness”."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The paper mentions concepts without formally introducing them e.g, ‘top-k’ in the abstract and after that as well without explaining the notation; the definition of ‘anchor’ appears late in the paper. Additionally, the introduction is written as related work without appropriately motivating the paper, making the paper not as accessible generally.\n2. The paper has hallucinated citations e.g., ‘Anastasios N Angelopoulos et al. Conformal prediction for multi-label classification, ICML 2022’ – I don’t believe there exists any such paper. Additionally, the paper has cited incorrect papers on some instances e.g., p1 l49 ‘split conformal prediction’ – the correct citations for these include Lei et al. (2015); Papadopoulos et al. (2002) as can be seen from Lei et al. (2018). The references are also formatted inconsistently (Anastasios N Angelopoulos et al., 2022; Yaniv Romano et al., 2020 – some references are in this format which is unusual, while others mention all authors). If LLMs were used for generating citations and references, no such usage has been disclosed in the paper and I would like to flag this.\n3. Missing/insufficient baselines: The paper compares only with APS which is not expected to perform well in this setup. Not only do there exist score functions which produce smaller sets e.g., RAPS but comparison with methods that are more geared toward similar applications is required to establish benefits of the method.\n4. The paper doesn’t study pseudo-anchors or class imbalance and its implications in detail e.g., Plasma cell has 0 anchors (Table 1)."}, "questions": {"value": "Missing discussion and comparison with some relevant work:\n\nDavid Stutz, Abhijit Guha Roy, Tatiana Matejovicova, Patricia Strachan, Ali Taylan Cemgil, Arnaud Doucet.
