However, existing methods struggle to correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and measurement, and often failed to maximizing the consistency to the measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown noise. To address these issues, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that flexibly balances prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing approaches such as DDNM, TMPD, while generalizing to handle both known Gaussian noise and unknown or non-Gaussian noise types.

This paper proposes an adaptive parameter scheme with $\\eta_2 = ka_t / c_t$ to generalize approaches for linear inverse problems with diffusion models. This scheme seems to be heuristic.

There is no rigorous theoretical justification on the reason why $\\eta_2$ must be proportional to $a_t/c_t$.\n\n2. The reason why a negative $\\eta_1$ value leads to improvements is not well explained. It is not clear whether this is related to compensating for inherent biases in the pre-trained diffusion model or there is any geometric interpretation in the optimization objective (Equation (6)) that differs from the probabilistic model (e.g., as a super-linear interpolation between $m_{0|t}$ and the DDNM solution).\n\n3. Review on related works is limited. The paper claims to generalize approaches for linear inverse problems with diffusion models, but neglects related works with similar claims such as [R1]-[R3]. Discussion on the difference from these works and necessary comparison are required to clarify the contributions claimed in this paper.\n\n4. The caption of Table 4 explicitly states that the method requires manually setting different k values for different degradation tasks (e.g., k=1.0 for JPEG QF=5 and k=3.0 for QF=2). It appears to require the user to have prior knowledge of the degradation type to select an appropriate k. This undermines the ability to handle \"unknown\" noise as claimed in the paper.\n\n[R1] Yismaw N, Kamilov U S, Asif M S.
