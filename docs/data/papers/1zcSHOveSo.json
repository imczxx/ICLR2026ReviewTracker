We propose a neural field-based reformulation in which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variant produces more stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations.

Experiments on the 2D Kolmogorov flow model show measurable gains in both efficiency and accuracy over a conventional 4DVar baseline. The presentation is also very clear."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The paper is motivated by the claim that traditional 4DVar cannot be parallelized, and therefore proposes a parallelizable 4DVar assimilation algorithm. However, this claim is not accurate. The “4DVar” referred to in the paper is the strong-constraint 4DVar. There is also weak-constraint 4DVar [1] [2], which does allow parallel optimization of the state at different time levels, though it cannot strictly enforce temporal physical consistency—this is imposed only weakly via a penalty.\n\n  The formulation of weak-constraint 4DVar is very similar to the proposed PINN-4DVar. Its cost function (using the paper’s notation) is:\n  $$\n  L(u)=\\int\\_\\Omega\\sum\\_{i=0}^{T/\\Delta t-1}||\\mathcal{M}\\left(u(i\\Delta t,x)\\right)-u((i+1)\\Delta t, x)||\\_Q^2\\text{d}x + \\lambda\\_{data}\\sum\\_{k=0}^K\\left(H(u_k)-y_k\\right)^2\n  $$\n  This cost directly optimizes the entire sequence of fields. The first term represents the dynamical loss along the trajectory; $\\mathcal{M}$ is the operator that advances the field by $\\Delta t$ (i.e., the time-$\\Delta t$ solution operator of the PDE in the paper). This is essentially the same as the PINN loss used in the manuscript; the only difference is that weak-constraint 4DVar does not represent the full field as a neural field. Because weak-constraint 4DVar can also be parallelized, the paper’s central claim is substantially weakened. The authors should clearly discuss the advantages of PINN-4DVar over weak-constraint 4DVar and include experimental comparisons.\n\n- In addition, when discussing the drawbacks of Vanilla 4DVar, the paper attributes “spurious high-frequency perturbations” to the method. This seems to stem from the implementation omitting the background-error term $||u_0-u_b||_B^2$. In a complete Vanilla 4DVar, the $B$ matrix constrains the analysis increment $u_0 - u_b$ to a smoother subspace [3] [4]. Spurious high-frequency components would inflate the background term and therefore are strongly penalized during assimilation, making them unlikely to appear. Consequently, the claimed advantage attributed to the neural field on this point does not hold.\n\n[1] Fisher, Mike, et al. \"Weak-constraint and long-window 4DVar.\" *ECMWF Technical Memoranda* 655 (2011): 47.\n\n[2] Fablet, Ronan, et al. \"Learning variational data assimilation models and solvers.\" Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 13.10 (2021): e2021MS002572.\n\n[3] Bannister, Ross N. \"A review of forecast error covariance statistics in atmospheric variational data assimilation.

The authors claim the neural field's *spectral bias* acts as an implicit regularizer to prevent non-smooth solutions but this requires clearer justification and evidence. Empirically, it is unclear how the proposed method would compare to a properly regularized baseline.\n- The paper's validation is limited to a single benchmark (2D Kolmogorov flow). Including an additional benchmark with different physical properties, such as the shallow water equations, would be necessary to substantiate the claims of empirical performance and generality.\n- The paper’s best results come from HYBRID-4DVAR (PINN initialization + NEURAL-4DVAR refinement). This implies neither core method suffices alone: PINN-4DVAR is faster but weaker in rollout accuracy, while NEURAL-4DVAR improves accuracy but inherits the sequential bottleneck.
