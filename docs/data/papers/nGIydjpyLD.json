Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture, $\\textbf{A}$utoregressive $\\textbf{M}$ulti-$\\textbf{E}$mbedding $\\textbf{R}$etriever $(\\textbf{AMER})$. Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. \\model{} presents 6 and 16\\% relative gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on. Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other.

I think that overall it is true that you can in principle have a query matched to diverse documents, but there's a limit to that - if the set of documents is too diverse, then the query shouldn't retrieve all of them. So, I feel like there's no real insight gained from the synthetic data experiment.
