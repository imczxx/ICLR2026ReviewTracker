This paper's primary contributions are (1) replacing the VAE encoder from Latent-EnSF with an LSTM encoder and (2) replacing the full-space dynamics with an LDNet surrogate. While this is a successful *engineering* effort that yields speedups and imporved performances, the novlties in machine learning for DA is minimal. The paper does not provide sufficient theoretical justification for why this specific combination is fundamentally superior, beyond empirical performance.\n- The paper claims the latent representation addresses sparsity. However, the actual mechanism enabling the system to work is the \"*history-aware* LSTM encoder\". By processing a sequence of sparse observations $(y_{1:t})$, the LSTM is implicitly learning a time-delay embedding. It is a well-established concept (e.g., via Takens' embedding theorem [Takens et al. 1981; Noakes et al., 1991]). The paper does not discuss this mechanism entirely. And, It lacks a large and highly relevant recent advances of such works for DA, for example Gottwald et al., 2021; Tarumi et al, 2025; Yang et al, 2025.\n- Several key statements and claims regarding the method's motivation and mechanism are vague and require further clarification and justification, see Questions."}, "questions": {"value": "## Questions\n\n- In Line 47, what is meant by *score becomes ill-posed*? This phrasing is imprecise. Could you clarify? The term *ill-posed* refers to problems (typically inverse problems) that fail to meet one or more of the following criteria: a solution exists, the solution is unique, and the solution depends continuously on the data. There is no such definition for a function itself, e.g., score function. Do you mean the estimation of the score from sparse data is high-variance, or simply that the likelihood gradient is zero in unobserved dimensions? \n- The authors claim the latent representation itself addresses observation sparsity, e.g., Line 48-50. But no detailed justification. Could authors elabroate on: (1) How can the latent projection itself solve the sparsity problem, given that the input observation (y_t) is indeed sparse? A latent projection does not create information for that is not already present. (2) Should this capability not be attributed almost entirely to the \" LSTM Encoder\"? By processing a sequence of sparse observations, this encoder is implicitly learning a time-delay embedding. This concept has been used in data assimilation, yet this is not discussed and cited.\n- In Line 50, the authors state that \"*latent representations enable more informative gradients*\". Could you please explain what \"more informative gradients\" means in this context? How exactly does working in the latent space make the gradients better for handling sparse observations compared to working in the original space? \n- It is a valuable strength to handle the irregular grid observation data which is commen in DA. Could the author include a numerical case study demonstrating the method’s performance on irregular grids?\n- In Line 210, the author state the random projection $B$ is trianbale. However, in Random Fourier Features/positional encodings, $B$ is typically fixed [Tancik et al., 2020]; optimizing it can change the random feature distribution across update steps and making the training unstable. This is an unconventional choice and its benefits are not inituitive. Could authors provide justify the reason why set $B$ as trainable and provide an ablation study: fixed versus trainable $B$, including training loss curves and DA accuracy.\n\n\n## References\n- Takens, Floris. \"Detecting strange attractors in turbulence.\" Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Berlin Springer Verlag 898 (1981): 366.\n- Noakes, Lyle. \"The Takens embedding theorem.\" International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos 1.04 (1991): 867-872.\n- Gottwald, Georg A., and Sebastian Reich. \"Combining machine learning and data assimilation to forecast dynamical systems from noisy partial observations.\" Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science 31.10 (2021).\n- Tancik, Matthew, et al. \"Fourier features let networks learn high frequency functions in low dimensional domains.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 33 (2020): 7537-7547.\n- Si, Phillip, and Peng Chen. \"Latent-EnSF: A Latent Ensemble Score Filter for High-Dimensional Data Assimilation with Sparse Observation Data.\" The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (2025).\n- Tarumi, Yuta, Keisuke Fukuda, and Shin-ichi Maeda. \"Deep Bayesian Filter for Bayes-Faithful Data Assimilation.\" Forty-second International Conference on Machine Learning (2025).\n- Yang, Yiming, et al. \"Tensor-Var: Efficient Four-Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation.\" Forty-second International Conference on Machine Learning (2025)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Ef7NwBaorZ", "forum": "AWSVzzhbr7", "replyto": "AWSVzzhbr7", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15624/Reviewer_YcmD"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15624/Reviewer_YcmD"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15624/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761522578021, "cdate": 1761522578021, "tmdate": 1762925889785, "mdate": 1762925889785, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes LD-EnSF (Latent Dynamics Ensemble Score Filter), a novel data assimilation method designed for high-dimensional dynamical systems with extremely sparse and irregular observations.

By eliminating full-state simulations during filtering, LD-EnSF achieves massive speedups (e.g. 200,000× in one case), enabling applications (real-time forecasting, larger ensembles) that were previously infeasible. This practical improvement is highly valuable for the community.\n\nRobust Accuracy under Extreme Conditions: Empirical results show state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness. LD-EnSF outperforms LETKF, EnSF, and the prior Latent-EnSF by a clear margin in all tested scenarios. Notably, in an extremely sparse observation scenario (0.1% spatial and 0.2% temporal coverage with 10% noise), LD-EnSF attains about 5% RMSE, whereas LETKF and EnSF either diverge or fail to converge. The method also successfully estimates system parameters (e.g. Reynolds number, forcing amplitude) alongside the state, which is a strong plus.\n\nWell-Motivated Method Design: The integration of learned latent dynamics with score-based filtering is novel and well-justified. The authors identify the shortcomings of VAE-based latent filters (oscillatory latent trajectories, need to propagate in full space) and introduce targeted improvements. In particular, the improved LDNet architecture (with shifted initial latent state handling, two-stage training, and Fourier-featured ResNet decoder) yields a remarkably compact and smooth latent representation that outperforms both the original LDNet and a VAE+LSTM baseline in surrogate modeling accuracy. Similarly, the LSTM-based observation encoder is a sensible choice to capture temporal context and irregular spatial sampling, surpassing the static VAE encoder used in Latent-EnSF. Each design choice is supported by discussion or ablation (e.g. Table 1, Fig. 3 for LDNet vs VAE).\n\nThorough Experiments: The evaluation is comprehensive. The paper tests three diverse and complex systems, includes strong baseline comparisons (including a “Latent-EnSF-dyn” variant using a VAE-dynamics baseline), and reports detailed metrics. The authors also explore scenarios with varying observation noise (Appendix E.5) and demonstrate the method’s insensitivity to ensemble size (even a single-sample “ensemble” recovers reasonable estimates, akin to MAP). Such thoroughness increases confidence in the results.\n\nReproducibility: The inclusion of references to code for hyperparameter search (Weights & Biases) and discussion of computational setup (CPU/GPU times in Table 2) is appreciated."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Dependence on Offline Training and Generalization Limits: \nA potential concern is the heavy reliance on training a surrogate model (LDNet) on simulation data before deployment. Acquiring a comprehensive training dataset covering all relevant system behaviors and parameter ranges can be costly, and the method’s performance may degrade if the true system behavior deviates from the training distribution. The paper’s approach is essentially as good as its learned model – for scenarios with significant model uncertainty or evolving dynamics, one might need to frequently retrain or fine-tune the surrogate. This limitation is hinted at in the conclusion (need to retrain adaptively for long-term complex systems), but it remains a practical caveat: the method inherits the generalization limitations of data-driven surrogates.\n\nIncremental Novelty and Comparison with Variational Surrogate Approaches: \nWhile combining latent dynamics learning with score-based filtering is a creative and well-engineered contribution, the methodological novelty of LD-EnSF is largely incremental rather than foundational. The core components—EnKF/EnSF-style ensemble filtering, neural surrogate modeling (LDNet), and LSTM-based latent encoders—are all built upon established techniques. The innovation primarily lies in the system-level integration and practical realization of these elements, rather than in introducing fundamentally new theoretical insights or learning paradigms. Consequently, LD-EnSF may be viewed as an effective and elegant evolution of Latent-EnSF, replacing the VAE and full-state propagation with a better learned surrogate while maintaining the same overall Bayesian filtering framework.\n\nMoreover, when comparing LD-EnSF against variational methods such as 3D-Var or 4D-Var, it should be noted that those methods can also leverage surrogate models like LDNet to reduce computational cost, provided the surrogate is differentiable for adjoint-based optimization. Thus, the runtime advantage of LD-EnSF does not arise solely from operating in latent space, but also depends on whether comparable surrogates are incorporated into the variational baseline. Explicitly discussing this relationship would clarify that LD-EnSF’s main strength lies in its practical integration of latent surrogates with score-based filtering—an important step forward, but not a fundamentally new formulation of data assimilation.\n\nRelation to recent latent-space Bayesian filters:\nThe paper would benefit from discussing its relationship to other recent approaches that perform Bayesian filtering directly in learned latent spaces, such as the Deep Bayesian Filter (DBF, ICML 2025).\nWhile both LD-EnSF and DBF share the goal of combining learned latent dynamics with probabilistic filtering, they differ in philosophy: DBF integrates inference and dynamics in an end-to-end generative framework, whereas LD-EnSF decouples the surrogate dynamics learning (LDNet) from score-based filtering.\nPositioning LD-EnSF more explicitly within this broader family of latent-space Bayesian filters—highlighting differences in training objectives, inference mechanisms, and scalability—would clarify its contribution and increase its relevance to ongoing developments in this research area.\n\nComputational Complexity and Implementation Practicality: \nWhile the paper convincingly demonstrates that LD-EnSF achieves major runtime savings by performing data assimilation in a low-dimensional latent space, its computational efficiency still involves important trade-offs. Each assimilation cycle requires iterative reverse-time SDE integration for $N_e$ ensemble members over $T_{diff}$ diffusion steps, leading to a total cost of $O(N_e T_{diff} d_s)$. This iteration structure is conceptually analogous to the optimization loops in 3D-Var, with the distinction that LD-EnSF's iterations are fully parallelizable across ensemble members but sequential in diffusion time. Moreover, the ensemble size $N_e$ generally needs to grow with the latent dimension to maintain statistical accuracy, as analyzed in recent works (e.g., Oko et al., 2023). Discussing these trade-offs explicitly would help clarify when LD-EnSF offers practical computational advantages over variational baselines, especially since 3D-Var can also benefit from surrogate models such as LDNet if differentiable.\n\nIn terms of implementation, the overall pipeline remains quite complex: it integrates multiple neural components (latent dynamics network, reconstruction network, and LSTM-based observation encoder) with a non-trivial score-based assimilation algorithm. Implementing and tuning such a system—including hyperparameter searches, ensuring stable LDNet training, and discretizing the SDE solver—requires substantial expertise. While the methodology is sound, this complexity may pose barriers to adoption compared to simpler ensemble or variational filters. Providing open-source code or detailed pseudocode would greatly enhance reproducibility and accessibility for the community.\n\nLimitation and Clarity of Latent-State Initialization: \nThe paper initializes all latent trajectories with a fixed zero state ($s_{-1} = 0 $) and relies on the parameter input $u_t$ to encode differences among trajectories. While this design simplifies training and stabilizes the latent dynamics, it implicitly assumes that all variation in the initial conditions can be captured through the parameter space. In practice, however, many physical systems exhibit diverse and high-dimensional initial states that cannot be fully represented by a few parameters. As a result, this assumption may limit LD-EnSF’s generalization to systems with unseen or highly variable initial conditions.\n\nIn addition, the paper’s explanation of this mechanism is somewhat unclear. The statement that the initialization “flexibly accommodates varying initial conditions” is misleading, since all trajectories start from the same latent point. Figure 1 also omits how the initial latent state is introduced or how it connects to the LSTM encoder, which may confuse readers about how the model handles initial-state diversity. Clarifying this design choice—possibly with an explicit schematic or additional discussion—and considering a learned initial encoder (e.g., mapping initial full states to latent $s_{-1}$) would both improve clarity and broaden the applicability of LD-EnSF to more general dynamical regimes.\n\nEvaluation Scope: \nA minor weakness is that the experimental comparison could be broadened or analyzed further. The authors did not compare against particle filtering or variational methods (e.g., 4D-Var). It’s understandable given those struggle in such high-dimensional sparse settings, but discussing their expected performance or including them in a smaller-scale experiment would strengthen the positioning. Additionally, an ablation study on each novel component of LD-EnSF (for instance, using a static VAE-based encoder instead of LSTM, or using the ground truth dynamics vs. LDNet during assimilation) would isolate the contributions of each part. While the paper does compare LDNet vs VAE offline, it doesn’t explicitly show the effect of the LSTM encoder in the online phase versus a baseline. Such experiments (perhaps in an appendix) would provide deeper insight into how much each innovation (smooth latent dynamics, history encoder) contributes to the final performance.\n\nMinor Presentation Issues: \nThere are a few presentation details that could be improved. For example, the text’s statement of speedups (e.g. “$2\\times10^3$ times speedup”) seems slightly inconsistent with Table 2 values – clarifying these calculations would avoid confusion. Also, the results discussion could more explicitly highlight why LD-EnSF outperforms baselines (e.g., pointing out in text that EnSF fails due to vanishing likelihood gradients in unobserved dimensions, which LD-EnSF overcomes by using informative latent gradients). The figures are generally clear; still, adding a bit more explanation in the captions or main text for Figure 4 (e.g., explaining the behavior of “Latent-EnSF-dyn” curves, or noting that LETKF diverged in the hardest case) would be helpful. These are minor issues and easily addressable."}, "questions": {"value": "Generality to Out-of-Distribution Dynamics: How well would LD-EnSF handle scenarios where the true dynamics deviate from the training data? For instance, if the system experiences an unforeseen regime or a parameter outside the trained range, would the assimilation degrade gracefully, or could it diverge? Did you observe any cases where the learned LDNet struggled when the truth lay outside its training distribution?\n\nAblation on Observation Encoder: Have you evaluated the impact of the LSTM-based observation encoder versus a simpler or non-temporal encoder? For example, how would Latent-EnSF perform if augmented with your LDNet but still using the original VAE observation encoding at each time step (ignoring history)? This would isolate the benefit of the history-aware LSTM. Similarly, what happens if observations are on a fixed grid – does the LSTM still offer advantages over a time-independent encoder?\n\nParameter Estimation Performance: The method jointly assimilates state and parameters. Can you provide more insight into how accurately the uncertain parameters (Re, initial bump location, forcing amplitude/spread) were estimated in your experiments? It would be useful to know, for example, the final parameter RMSE or if the filter consistently converges to near-true parameter values. This would demonstrate the effectiveness of treating $(s_t, u_t)$ together in the state vector.\n\nEnsemble Size and Filter Stability: You mentioned that increasing ensemble size beyond a point had minimal impact on LD-EnSF’s accuracy. Could you elaborate on this? Is LD-EnSF less sensitive to ensemble size because the score-based update effectively approximates the Bayesian posterior even with few samples? Any intuition on why, say, even 1 or 5 ensemble members can yield good results would be interesting – it’s an intriguing contrast to standard EnKF which typically benefits from larger ensembles.\n\nComputational Overheads: Table 2 shows dramatic speedups in the online phase. Could you comment on the offline costs (training LDNet and LSTM) relative to those gains? For a fair real-world assessment, one might consider how many assimilation cycles are needed to amortize the training cost. Do you envision scenarios (like repeatedly assimilating in the same system) where the upfront training is justified by many future uses of the model?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "This paper does not raise any specific ethical concerns.\nThe study involves numerical simulations and synthetic datasets for evaluating data assimilation methods.\nNo human subjects, personal data, or sensitive information are used.\nThe work focuses on methodological and computational contributions rather than societal or safety-critical applications."}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5OLKb8s6Cs", "forum": "AWSVzzhbr7", "replyto": "AWSVzzhbr7", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15624/Reviewer_TvkW"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15624/Reviewer_TvkW"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15624/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761700048213, "cdate": 1761700048213, "tmdate": 1762925889240, "mdate": 1762925889240, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes LD-EnSF, a score-based Bayesian filtering method that performs all assimilation steps in a low-dimensional latent space learned by an improved Latent Dynamics Network (LDNet) and coupled to a history-aware LSTM observation encoder.

Theoretical Guarantees:\nCan the authors comment on whether any convergence guarantees exist for the latent-space assimilation process, particularly as a function of the surrogate model error?\n\n2. Dynamic Re-training:\nHow feasible is LD-EnSF in systems where governing dynamics change over time? Could partial retraining or online fine-tuning mitigate the offline cost?\n\n3. Uncertainty Quantification:\nHow reliable are uncertainty estimates when mapped back to physical space?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "OgbA194Zw9", "forum": "AWSVzzhbr7", "replyto": "AWSVzzhbr7", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15624/Reviewer_ogtz"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15624/Reviewer_ogtz"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15624/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761993524446, "cdate": 1761993524446, "tmdate": 1762925888280, "mdate": 1762925888280, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
