This paper explores structural and weight redundancies in Transformer-based architectures, aiming to identify inefficiencies and leverage them through targeted compression techniques.\nA central focus is assessing whether different modules perform overlapping functions. Although some degree of similarity is observed in the analyzed cases, redundancy proves to be lower than expected, challenging the assumption that weight matrices can be interchanged across layers without compromising performance. Additionally, an analysis of model matrices examines whether they exhibit an inherently low-rank structure.\nTo further explore these aspects, three novel compression methods are introduced: MASS, which enforces weight aggregation and sharing, along with two factorization-based techniques, GlobaL Fact and ABACO. Experimental results show that while these approaches achieve model compression, their ability to maintain performance is limited, reducing their practical viability.\nThe findings highlight the complexity of extracting redundancy from Transformer architectures, raising questions about its extent across layers and blocks. By addressing these challenges, this paper aims to contribute to ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of LLMs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Redundancy", "Weight sharing", "Model compression", "Low-rank approximation"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/76e4ac384af79d8da464c98e5690cceb91ffd45a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies functional redundancy across Transformer blocks and proposes three compression strategies designed to exploit potential sharing: MASS groups same-shape matrices by type and replaces them with a simple average; GlobaL Fact introduces a shared global low-rank factor per group and per-layer local factors; ABACO couples low-rank adapters with an exponentially decaying contribution from the original weights during fine-tuning.

The analysis method of pairwise substitution one by one in Section 3 has an extremely high computational complexity ($N^2$) and is difficult to continue to be used on larger models. At the same time, the selection of datasets and tasks leads to strong task-specific conclusions (for example, outside the early layers of HellaSwag, attention is not so important), which may not hold true elsewhere.\n2. Limited novelty of the proposed methods: MASS directly reduces to uniform averaging within groups of weight matrices without any alignment or importance weighting, so it is unsurprising that capacity is lost. GlobaL Fact is essentially shared low-rank factorization initialized from group SVD, a close cousin of standard truncated-SVD/LoRA-style factorization, with modest adjustments (shared/global vs local). Conceptual distance from known techniques feels small. ABACO is LoRA with an annealed scalar $\\alpha$ on the original weights. While neat in practice, the mechanism is incremental rather than a new compression principle. Most importantly, these methods do not truly address the issue identified in Section 3 of the article (redundancy in the model), which is to remove redundancy while ensuring model performance.\n3. The author only conducted tests on two benchmarks (HellaSwag and GSM8K) and models (Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-2B), and the reliability and comprehensiveness of the experimental results were insufficient. No further verification was conducted on models such as Qwen3 and DeepSeeking R1 for tasks like language modeling confusion, instruction compliance, or reasoning evaluation.\n4.
