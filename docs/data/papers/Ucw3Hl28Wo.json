Unlike brains, these RNNs can be computationally poked and perturbed to reveal principles central to their function. However, whether the insights gained from these RNNs truly apply to biological neural circuits remains an open question. The answer hinges on a key distinction: which RNN parameters are uniquely determined by the data they are trained on (i.e., identifiable), and which are unconstrained? To this end, we develop a framework that isolates identifiable subspaces of the RNN parameters, leading to several key findings: (i) commonly used RNN estimators have unconstrained parameters and the dimensionality of training data, i.e., the trajectories in neural state space, dictates the extent of parameter constraints; (ii) we can design RNN estimators to remain confined to identifiable components; (iii) we propose intervention experiments to expand the identifiable subspace; and (iv) we prove that changes in non-identifiable components preserve dynamics on identifiable subspaces but can introduce spurious structure elsewhere. Together, these results delineate regions of state space where RNN predictions are reliable and pinpoint where they are not. Our theory shows that current RNNs are not valid proxies of neural circuits, as their predictions and interpretation can be swayed by non-identifiable components. These results define guidelines for the responsible use of RNN models in neuroscience.", "tldr": "A theory of parameter identifiability in data-constrained recurrent neural networks", "keywords": ["computational neuroscience", "recurrent neural networks", "identifiability"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/86af66df64ff2d8b7e261f0807551e284c6a278e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper seeks to characterize when the parameters of an RNN can be reliably recovered from neural data, with applications to data-constrained modeling of neural dynamics.

Overall, it feels there is a large gap between what is actually proven in the theorems/propositions, and what is then concluded about identifiability of models from data as a result. For example, Theorem 1, along with most of the following results, characterize parameter identifiability in terms of a projection matrix derived from the concatenated observed neural activity/external inputs, yet this framing strictly holds only for the noiseless dynamics setting, with matched student/teacher architecture and no unobserved influences. The fact that the identifiability criteria of Theorem 1 is identical to that of noiseless LTI systems/linear RNNs speaks to how restrictive of a setting this is. Throughout this paper, stated conditions relating to parameter identifiability seem to be primarily of the necessary kind, whereas the abstract/title/discussion would lead one to think the contents also substantially cover realistic sufficient conditions for identifiability. \n\nI acknowledge that extensions of theorems to more realistic settings are considered, but they still feel underexplored. For example, Proposition S1 regarding recovery under partial observations seems like merely a restatement of Theorem 1, with an addendum to restrict to the case where recovery of parameters associated with unobserved neurons can be safely ignored. I don't see how that result meaningfully characterizes how partial observations can corrupt identifiability. \n\nI am still leaning towards an accept due to the extensive empirics, which I think would be useful in itself to the neuroscience community, but feel the paper would be much stronger if the theory spoke to the empirics better. \n\nFinally, I find it strange that this paper develops a framework around parameter subspaces defined by the top eigenvectors of $X^\\top X$, but makes no reference to PCA. Isn't this identical to (or at least closely related to) projecting parameters onto the top PCs of the activity+external inputs? \n\nOther comments:\n1. A minor point: throughout, $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_X \\times N_X}$ is stated to project to the column space of $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{TM \\times N_X}$, but by shape, this must be referring to the row space projector (projects to the subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{N_X}$ spanned by the rows of $X$). \n2. The dynamics noise scale used in the empirics pertaining to estimation with noise---the more relevant/realistic case---feels absurdly small. For example, in Fig. S3, $\\epsilon_{in} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,10^{-6})$. Since this noise is precisely the noise that corrupts the input $\\theta x(t)$ to the nonlinearity, which is the relevant part of the dynamics invoked for Theorem 1, it would seem this would be the stress point that should be the most tested."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can the learning of non-identifiable parameter combinations by certain algorithms like FORCE be rectified by simply post-hoc projecting learned parameters to the identifiable subspace, as estimated by the empirical Gram matrix? \n\n2. Very minor: In Fig. 2, presumably, the top modes of the Gram matrix change/wiggle as longer neural trajectories are observed, beyond just overall increases in rank. Consequently, the parameter subspaces evaluated need not be exactly comparable across curves in A, B, and C, no?\n\n3. How is accuracy of parameter recovery defined, e.g. in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3? I'm assuming this is something like 1 - (relative error in frobenius norm), but this should be stated somewhere. \n\n4. Regarding effects of partial observations on identifiability: the paragraph starting at line 1345 seems to state that recovery of parameters associated to top spectral components is poor for partially observed systems, even under very long recording sessions, yet the following paragraph seems to contradict this paragraph in spirit, and instead spins an optimistic tone.

(2018)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v75/simchowitz18a.html) or [Geadah et al. (2024)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10886179) and references they cite. It would be useful to make contact with this literature, as my impression is that some analog of their Thm. 1 is folklore there. Also, the discussion of Gram matrices coincides with the classical observability Gramian; it'd be useful to make this connection.\n\n- It'd be interesting to extend these results to nonlinearities that are not strictly monotone. For instance, the paper you cite by Biswas and Fitzgerald focuses on some of the degeneracies that arise from using a threshold-linear function. \n\n- Thm. 2 is (up to the error term) a consequence of the fact that the parameter updates induced by gradient descent lie within the span of the observed covariates. This seems well-known to me, so I think you might consider citing a reference, or at least commenting on the conceptual content. \n\n- Related to this aspect of gradient-descent-type algorithms, I don't think it's surprising that FORCE would retain initialization-dependence, and thus non-identifiable components. Is your aim here primarily to show that CORNN compares favorably to FORCE in this regard? \n\n- I think Cor. 2 could be made more mathematically precise; when is this quadratic approximation reliable? In the appendix you don't consider the remainder term. \n\n- The authors discuss regularization at length. However, thinking naively about neuroscience experiments, it's unclear to me how one should choose a regularization parameter in a principled way, as the data is presumably almost always nonstationary. Can you elaborate on this? For instance, you show in Figure S10 an example where you can get good estimation by choosing a good $\\ell_2$ penalty; how do you choose this? \n\n- The results on interventions are interesting, but could you at least speculate on the informativeness of experimentally-feasible interventions? I suppose those would be limited by partial observation. \n\n- I'm curious about the generality of the claim in Figure S5 - this correspondence between variance and task-relevance should depend on the nature of the solution found by the RNN, right? For example, some solutions based on feedforward amplification - like Karel Svoboda's group has recently suggested are at play in ALM, in [Daie et al. (2023)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.04.552026v2.full) - would seem to violate this. \n\n- There is a long discussion in the appendix (starting around line 1360) about long-term recordings, but it's not clear to me whether that will necessarily resolve any of the challenges documented in the paper, because on those timescales there can clearly be substantial changes due to plasticity and other factors. I'm confused about why you'd cite Driscoll et al. (2017) here and not comment the fact that that paper shows substantial drift in responses over time, which seems contrary to the idea that such long recordings would help constrain an RNN model with fixed weights."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ejWjYXpOdQ", "forum": "Ucw3Hl28Wo", "replyto": "Ucw3Hl28Wo", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10663/Reviewer_Txye"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10663/Reviewer_Txye"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10663/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761764834267, "cdate": 1761764834267, "tmdate": 1762921915484, "mdate": 1762921915484, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors consider the problem of fitting RNNs to data, something often done in neuroscience.

I will list them here, and the authors can likely correct me on some of my mistaken understandings.\n\n- First, since the RNN is trained on one-step prediction, and assuming complete observability, the problem becomes a zero-layer feed-forward neural network, or a general linear model [linear regression then nonlinear link function]. Then the result is simply: if the nonlinearity is monotonic, identifiability becomes the same as for linear regression, and that is identifiable on the span of the input data. (A) Emphasising this simplicity seems good? (B) surely this is already well-known? Googling identifiability of generalised linear models provides many results. In this particular setting it may be new, but it seems very related to existing ideas? \n\n- Then I had some concerns with the unobserved data case. Firstly, unless I'm confused, it is wrongly signposted in the text (it's at the end of appendix B.2, not C as advertised?) Then, for some reason phi become arbitrary rather than monotonic? Finally, and more importantly, the result's framing seemed weird. It showed that, even if you know the parameters relating to the unobserved data, you keep the nonidentifiability of the parameters outside the span of the observed data. So far so good. It did not show that, \"even if $P=I$, RNN parameters may remain non-identifiable due to the hidden influence of unobserved neurons or redundancy introduced by non-monotonic activation functions\". It just showed, exactly as in the original observed case, there exists a class of non-identifiable parameters living outside the span of the observed data. By assuming that the unobserved parameters were correctly observed you remove all the interesting parts of the problem? And you don't discuss the role of the nonlinearity at all? So why should I draw the conclusion you suggest from the theorem?\n\n- Next, I was concerned by the claims about l2 regularisation. In the simplest case (no noise), finding the estimator that fits the data with minimal l2 norm will clearly select the weights that have no projection in the nullspace of the data matrix, solving the identifiability problem. Yet the authors claim that this is insufficient. They justify this claim by showing that FORCE learning recovers non-zero non-identifiable weights - certainly an interesting result on a shortcoming of FORCE learning. But I don't see the link - they claim that FORCE learning effectively performs l2 regularisation, but I don't see how. I read through the original algorithm and couldn't see the link to the fact it is minimising error + l2 regularisation, and in fact I view the authors' results as evidence in the opposite direction. If it were minimising such a loss, it would not have these non-identifiable components upon convergence!\n\n- Theorem 2 seemed solid [did not check this proof], showing that if you start in the identifiable weights and effectively regularise the weights you will stay there. I was surprised about the fact corollary 1 is a local claim, about the loss near a minima where second order taylor expansions are relevant. This is a severe restriction for a general loss, and should be acknowledged as such (for example, perhaps name the corollary local identifiability in nonlinear regression). My take-away was still that l2 regularisation saves the day.\n\n- I found the discussion of noise confusing. The model is introduced as noisy, but all the analytics are not about that setting. The only discussion of noise is in 4.3, where suddenly the data have noise added to them. I did not get why the important quantity is the span of the noiseless component - that's only true if both your real dynamics and your fitting are applied to the noiseless data, which is not the case? (Unless the added noise is just observation noise, not the input or conversion noise introduced in section 2) I agree that estimating the rank of data with noise is interesting, and likely relevant, but (a) surely this stuff is well studied? (b) the link to the rest of the work is very unclear to me.\n\nOverall, despite thinking this was an interesting question, I felt like the more interesting parts weren't tackled. In the noiseless case with full observability it comes down to a very simple result the same as in linear regression about the span of the data. Further, the writing made this simplicity hard to see. A large part of the surprises in this problem seem to come from unobserved parts of the model/noise, and model mismatch; none of these were robustly tackled. Add to this additional confusions listed above, and I'm afraid I am currently leaning reject.\n\nFurther, stylistically, there was just a lot of material, that made it hard to digest. Appendix B was basically a continuation of the paper (8 pages!), including B.3, one of my favourite bits. Some more digesting by the authors, and much punchier writing (it's very verbose), will likely help the presentation.

The mathematical results were found to be intuitive, though at times some connections to existing work in control theory were missing. Referees raised concerns, however, about specific claims (particularly regarding L2 regularization in FORCE learning) and noted that the presentation had major flaws. There was consensus among referees that the work was motivated in a way that implied a major breakthrough in parameter identifiability for general models, though all our results were derived on a simplified dRNN training setting. Therefore, more modest framing at the outset would have better aligned expectations with the actual contributions, which we agreed.\n\n## Broad concerns\n\n1) The main criticism seems to be about presentation, specifically the mismatch between expectations set by the first few pages and the results themselves.\n\nResponse: We agree and have revised the title/abstract (see below) and will revise the text to better match our contributions, removing claims of a “complete theory.”\n\n2) There are valid concerns about the simplicity of the theorem 1, which does have connections to existing results on dynamical systems theory and linear control. Referees had some very good suggestions to strengthen these connections. \n\nResponse: We will follow these suggestions. While these connections seem natural in hindsight, introducing the Gram matrix framework to dRNN analysis is novel and provides practical tools for the field.\n\n3) There were concerns about this simplified setting, i.e., the type of RNN used and the assumptions about 1-1 matching between artificial and biological neurons. \n\nResponse: We will highlight these limitations for a general theory. However, these exact settings are widely used in neuroscience (e.g., see Perich et al. 2021). Our framework helps researchers interpret results from methods they already use.\n\n4) Several technical questions were raised, including the regularization of FORCE, the noise regimes tested empirically, and the local nature of some results. \n\nResponse: We agree with and will clarify all these aspects. In short, \n\n- FORCE uses an online algorithm to approximately minimize a regularized least-squares problem.\n- We will add more experiments with noisy dynamics. We conducted a brief experiment similar to Fig. 2 with $10^{-1}$ variance in input noise; our findings remain unchanged. \n- We clarify that Corollary 1’s connection to weighted least-squares is illustrative, not the main result. We will move it to the methods.\n\n5) The treatment of realistic scenarios (partial observations, significant noise, model mismatch) was insufficient in the main text, despite these being crucial for practical applications. These extensions need to be brought forward and developed more thoroughly. \n\nResponse: We agree with these comments. Specifically, we will move key results on partial observations (currently Appendix B.2) and noise analysis (Section 4.3) to the main text, reducing methodological materials in Section 4 that can be shortened or moved to methods. As referees noted, the writing is quite verbose, which we will significantly shorten as well.\n\n6) Practical relevance of parameter identifiability was not well motivated.\n\nResponse: Since our goal is to explain, not just predict, neural responses, incorrect estimation of unconstrained parameters can introduce spurious structure that does not exist. For instance, consider inter-area communications within multi-region dRNNs, which has three “brain” regions: A, B, C. If A -> C sends a negative current and B-> C sends a positive one, the net effect is cancelled and the dynamics predicted in C is equivalent to having received no current from either brain regions at all, but the interpretations are distinct and can be affected by unconstrained parameters."}}, "id": "hxr7nGUnMY", "forum": "Ucw3Hl28Wo", "replyto": "Ucw3Hl28Wo", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10663/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10663/Authors"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10663/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763066609594, "cdate": 1763066609594, "tmdate": 1763066627763, "mdate": 1763066627763, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The manuscript presents a mostly theoretical treatment of the issue of parameters identifiability in the fits of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to neural data.

Likewise, many mechanistic insights into the function of the fitted RNNs (like the topology of fixed points) are probably possible even if the RNN weight matrix cannot be identified uniquely.

This relationship has been described in detail in low-rank networks (work by Ostojic et al) and even nominally high-rank RNNs have been found to be functionally low-rank (Krause et al, 2022), whereby a only a low-d subspace of the weight matrix is sufficient to explain the corresponding low-d dynamics.
