This results in error accumulation in inference as contractivity weakens. In this work, we propose a principled inference approach, called *SteinDiff*, that relaxes the contractivity constraints through reference-free Stein adaptive regularization. Specifically, drawing on Krasnosel'skiĭ-Mann theory, we reformulate the ODE update to interpolate between predictions and current states.  Importantly, we contribute closed-form optimal regularization parameters via Stein's identity,  which is theoretically grounded in the continuous SDEs theory of  diffusion models. Our analytical approach eliminates the need for ground truth data to adapt to the local geometry of the data distribution while preserving the expressiveness of the vanilla model. Theoretically, our approach not only relaxes the strict contractivity requirements for robust convergence but also reveals a principle behind the stability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-conditioned parameterizations. Practically, we offer a reference-free solution that reduces the risk of mode collapse in large-step inference. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical framework and demonstrate significant gains in generative inference.", "tldr": "We resolve the fundamental tension between stability and expressiveness in accelerating diffusion models by introducing a principled method, SteinDiff, that leverages closed-form adaptive regularization to achieve accurate and robust generation.", "keywords": ["Contractivity Trap; Reference-free Regularization; Stein's Identity; Closed-Form Optimization"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d9657b24fffbe0121b7b149f87431e97b708214b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/dfdf975137dc1d3a800f5640551939ed660848d8.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper addresses a fundamental limitation in diffusion model inference known as the contractivity trap. This trap arises from the tension between efficiency (large integration steps), expressiveness (complex score networks), and stability (the need for contractive updates in ODE-based sampling). While contractivity is a sufficient condition for convergence, this assumption fails for expressive modern diffusion models, leading to instability and degraded sample quality at low step counts. To overcome this, they propose SteinDiff, a new inference algorithm that enforces convergence guarantees leveraging Krasnosel’skiĭ–Mann fixed-point theory. Specifically, the update rule is re-expressed as a regularization of the standard ODE step with parameters being computed in closed form by leveraging the Stein Identity.
