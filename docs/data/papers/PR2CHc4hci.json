Gene-to-WSI tile synthesis offers a principled generative framework to translate molecular profiles into histological images. However, most existing methods compress RNA-Seq into a single global embedding injected once at initialization, an oversimplified design that weakens transcriptomic signals and induces non-causal associations between gene expression and tissue morphology. We present GeneAR, an Autoregressive Gene-to-WSI model that reformulates synthesis as an iterative, coarse-to-fine generative process. At its core is a novel Causal MeanFlow module that reinforces transcriptome-informed guidance at multiple stages and mitigates non-causal factors through counterfactual-style interventions, thereby ensuring biological fidelity throughout the generative trajectory. Combined with a β-VAE for compact gene embeddings and a multi-scale vector quantizer for discrete morphology representation, GeneAR generates H&E-stained WSI tiles that are both visually realistic and transcriptomically faithful. Extensive experiments across five TCGA cancer benchmarks demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods in both generative fidelity and downstream classification accuracy.

Figure 2 is not very clear. In this case, RNA-seq works as conditions or sources? Which modeling approach is the best choice? Moreover, RNA-seq is a matrix, not a protein structure, so the authors need to replace the visualization approaches.\n\n2. The motivation is not clear to me. Normally, performing sequencing+imaging is very expensive, and sequencing is also more expensive than imaging data. If we intend to generate an image based on expression profiles, that means we want to scale something from expensive to cheap, which does not make sense. Do authors have very strong motivations in predicting new modalities? For example, can any tasks be boosted when we have new image data?\n\n3. This paper lacks important baselines included in the discussion and comparison. It seems that all of the benchmark studies in this work are ablation studies.

The paper repeatedly emphasizes causal fidelity and introduces a Causal MeanFlow, yet the notion of causality here is never rigorously defined. There’s no structural causal graph, no do-operator, and no evidence of true interventions on the underlying transcriptomic variables. Instead, the so-called counterfactuals are simply image-space degradations (color, contrast, sharpening) that may improve invariance but don’t demonstrate causal reasoning. If the authors genuinely aim to model gene-to-morphology causation, why not test morphological shifts after perturbing the expression of known driver genes or pathways? Without such experiments, the causal terminology risks being decorative rather than substantive.\n\n2. All experiments are done on TCGA datasets that share preprocessing pipelines and scanner settings. If the method truly mitigates non-causal confounders like stain variation and batch effects, why not evaluate on a cross-institutional dataset such as CPTAC, PAIP, or even GTEx? Without an external test, it’s impossible to know whether the claimed robustness generalizes beyond the domain it was trained on. The five-cohort setup may look diverse on paper, but, in practice, it’s still one dataset in disguise.\n\n3. The FID reductions, often 1–4 points, are small enough to fall within typical random-seed variance, and the downstream accuracy gains (0.579 → 0.592) are hardly convincing. No standard deviations, confidence intervals, or significance tests are reported. I find myself asking: Did the authors repeat the experiments? How stable are these numbers across runs or cohorts?\n\n4. The authors correctly include recent diffusion (RNA-CDM, PathLDM, DiT), flow-matching (SiT), and autoregressive (LlamaGen, VAR) baselines. However, the comparison remains superficial: there is no discussion of training parity, compute fairness, or variance across runs.  Besides, why omit PixCell (https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05127), a foundation model on histology synthesis benchmarks? Even if direct re-implementation was difficult, citing them and discussing relative compute or design trade-offs is expected. Moreover, evaluation is limited to FID, which is an image-space metric without biological validation or cross-dataset testing."}, "questions": {"value": "1. How sensitive is the MeanFlow regularization to the α weighting coefficient and random λ factors? Was training stability or convergence affected? Are the results averaged across multiple seeds or single runs?\n\n2. Since diffusion models are much larger (400–1000 M parameters) and trained with more steps, how do the authors ensure that the FID comparison is meaningful rather than simply reflecting compute disparity?\n\n3. FID captures visual fidelity but not biological plausibility. Have the authors considered metrics assessing gene–morphology consistency, such as correlation of latent representations with expression clusters or pathway coherence?\n\n4. Were FID results averaged across multiple seeds? What is the standard deviation across runs? Without variance reporting, how confident are the authors that the 1–3 FID gains are statistically significant?\n\n5.

The method reads as \"regularized\" MeanFlow with RNA conditioning - strong, but the “causal” claim would benefit from stronger evidence.\n2. Biological faithfulness metrics are indirect: Authors rely heavily on FID and cell-type distributions (with HoverNet) is understandable but indirect for gene->morphology alignment. There’s no metric demonstrating how changes in RNA-seq can drive monotonic, localized morphological changes, given authors main claim to give conditioning in many steps is to maintain plausibility of morphologies. \n3. Clarity on FID backbone: It is unclear how what backbone is used to calculate the FID. It is somewhat odd if standard Inception network is used in this case.

Is it just by removing shortcuts? If so there needs to be more evidence that removing shortcuts related to confounders does indeed lead to better causal generation of the images.\n3.
