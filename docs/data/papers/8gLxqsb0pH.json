A critical challenge, however, is modality heterogeneity, which manifests along two axes: intra-client instability, caused by per-sample sensor dropouts, and inter-client heterogeneity, driven by differences in clients' sensor suites. Existing federated methods often rely on oversimplified assumptions about missing data and fail to capture these complex dynamics. We address this gap by introducing a realistic problem formulation and a principled simulation framework. Building on this foundation, we propose FedDUET (Decoupled Uncertainty-Enhanced Training), an approach designed to handle both axes of modality heterogeneity. To mitigate intra-client instability, FedDUET leverages an Uncertainty-as-Temperature (UT) loss to dynamically calibrate predictions based on data uncertainty. To manage inter-client heterogeneity, it employs a Decoupled Training (DT) strategy that specializes a private model head for each client's unique sensor suite while isolating the shared representation to preserve its generalizability. Across four real-world multimodal sensing datasets and diverse heterogeneity regimes, FedDUET achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results highlight that explicitly modeling uncertainty and decoupling generalization from personalization are essential principles for making multimodal federated learning robust in real-world settings.", "tldr": "We define and tackle the dual challenges of inter-client (device) and intra-client (sensor dropout) modality heterogeneity in multimodal federated health sensing, introducing FedDUET to set a new state-of-the-art in robust performance.", "keywords": ["federated learning", "multimodal AI", "health sensing"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ada1258d611da0fdd8a68d139d88df035c523aa0.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the problem of federated learning with multimodal health sensing data under realistic modality heterogeneity—both intra-client instability (bursty, temporally correlated sensor dropout within a client) and inter-client heterogeneity (diverse, static sensor suites across clients).

There is no learning signal guiding the uncertainty head to capture the uncertainty of each modality.\n* Logic of uncertainty estimation seems unconventional: The uncertainty estimated from shared parts are instability of input given the global model, which is aggregated from different clients. This means that if the local samples are different from the global data distribution across clients, the instability increases, making both shared and private parts to focus on these samples. In other words, the learned models would be more biased towards local data and the modality missing patterns[1], making global aggregation such as FedAvg or FedProx significantly harder and degrading the overall performance[1,2].\n* Lack of literature review.

The main claimed contributions of the paper lack novelty and most of what is proposed in this paper already exists. Specifically:\n    - The core mechanism of UT loss originates from (Kendall & Gal, 2017), and the paper merely applies it to multimodal scenarios. However, as described in Weakness #2, the paper's implementation has critical differences from the original method, which may lead to training instability.\n    - The DT strategy has been extensively studied in FL, such as FedPer (Arivazhagan et al., 2019). Although the paper claims its innovation lies in introducing DT to multimodal scenarios and guiding personalization through uncertainty, almost the same DT method already exist in multimodal FL [1].\n\n2. The mathematical formulation of UT loss has serious flaws and may be fundamentally infeasible for the following reasons:\n    - The paper's Equation (3) is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{UT},m} = \\text{CE}(z_m/\\sigma_m, y)$, missing the regularization term $\\log(\\sigma^2)$ from (Kendall & Gal, 2017).\n    - Without the regularization term, $\\sigma_m$ can theoretically approach arbitrary values. When the model makes incorrect predictions, the gradient $\\partial \\mathcal{L}/\\partial \\sigma_m$ will drive $\\sigma_m \\to \\infty$ to escape the penalty, causing all logits to be scaled to 0, degenerating the model into uniform prediction.\n    - The ablation experiments in Table 2 indirectly support this analysis: FedDUET w/o DT (i.e., using only UT loss) performs even worse than the baseline without UT and DT.\n    - The paper claims $\\sigma_m$ represents \"uncertainty,\" but there is no evidence showing that the learned $\\sigma_m$ truly corresponds to statistical uncertainty rather than simply sample difficulty or arbitrary weight coefficients.\n\n3. The experimental evaluation is insufficient:\n    - The paper only compares with one multimodal FL method (PmcmFL). What about others, such as [1-3]?\n    - The paper only simulates inter-client heterogeneity and intra-client instability, but these are only modality heterogeneity. What about other types of heterogeneity commonly considered in FL, such as class non-IID, client sample imbalance, client computational/communication heterogeneity, etc.?\n\n[1] Communication-Efficient Multimodal Federated Learning: Joint Modality and Client Selection  \n[2] Harmony: Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Federated Learning through Disentangled Model Training  \n[3] Towards Optimal Multi-Modal Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Hierarchical Gradient Blending"}, "questions": {"value": "1.
