In particular, the proposed second-order method relies on using a first-order method as a warm-start, but the main (local) convergence guarantee of the paper (Theorem 4) does not concretely connect the performance of the first-order method with the time to reach the local convergence regime. I believe the presentation would be strengthened if the authors were able to state a concrete end-to-end convergence rate for the Hybrid SSN method (Algorithm 1) using PRM+ for the warm start. It seems this could be achieved using the relationships between the residual norm and duality gap from Theorem 3. This would provide better theoretical insight into the empirical behavior of the algorithm observed in the experiments (where the main speedups occur in the high-precision regime). The authors also mainly suppose the first-order method is Predictive RM+, but it seems the framework could more generally use a different first-order method like Optimistic GDA. \n\nWriting suggestions:\n+ The presentation of Definition 5, Remark 3, and Theorem 3 needs improvement. For example, the definitions of $dist(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ and $\\hat Z^*$ should be given before Definition 5. \n+ The Hybrid SSN method framework (Algorithm 1) and the experimental results of the paper depend on the use of the PRM+ algorithm, however a description of PRM+ (other than one very high-level sentence in the introduction) is missing from the paper.

Designing practical, scalable algorithms for solving such problems is an important and active research topic. The use of second-order Newton-type methods is relatively unexplored in this area. The paper contributes to filling this gap. While second-order methods have a significantly higher per-iteration complexity than first-order methods, such as PRM+, the paper proposes a natural hybrid approach whereby one only switches to the more expensive SSN method once a desired accuracy has been reached. Such hybrid approaches are very much prevalent in state of the art LP solvers, but they have been relatively unexplored in the context of solving zero-sum games. So pushing in that research direction is, I believe, worthwhile. Furthermore, the paper is very well written and organized. The key ideas are nicely exposed and sufficiently explained in the main body."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "On the negative side, there are very basic flaws in the experimental evaluation of the paper, and the results are quite underwhelming. Concerning the results shown in Tables 1 and 2, the first basic issue is that there is no comparison with LP solvers. A commercial solver such as Gurobi would instantly solve exactly such small games. So on the whole, while the method is supposed to be superior in the high-precision regime, the paper fails to benchmark against the best approach in that regime, which is linear programming. In particular, it's hard to believe that Gurobi would be unable to solve a 400x800 game in less than 5 seconds. Besides failing to benchmark against LP solvers, the paper should certainly expand the first-order benchmarks considered. I should say that it is particularly strange to evaluate against the last-iterate of PRM+ when that's not guaranteed to even converge in zero-sum games. In practice, alternating PRM+ is typically much better than simultaneous PRM+, so at the very least the table should also contain results concerning alternating PRM+, together with other first-order methods that have linear convergence, such as extra-gradient and optimistic GD. The second main flaw in the experimental setup is that the games tested are very small, and it's hard to draw meaningful conclusions from random matrix games. There is a suite of benchmark extensive-form games that are commonly used for such purposes, but the paper doesn't provide those experiments, besides a quick mention about Kuhn poker where PRM+ finds exact solutions very rapidly. I would expect to see experiments on large extensive-form games to be convinced about the practical promise of the method. There are concerns that the proposed method doesn't scale well in larger games because of some of the preprocessing steps required.\n\nI can only recommend acceptance for such paper if the experiments show promise. There are not many new insights in the theory of the paper. In particular, the whole hybrid approach is predicated on the assumption that the region of superlinear convergence will be entered reasonably soon; from a theoretical standpoint, that's not guaranteed. If the paper provides more comprehensive experiments that show the superiority of the method compared to state of the art solvers, I would certainly be in favor of acceptance."}, "questions": {"value": "- Can the authors explain what the timeout in Tables 1 and 2 is?
