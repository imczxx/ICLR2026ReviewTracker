Despite its potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they often introduce a \\emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur \\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and effectiveness.  \nTo address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{F}ederated \\textbf{Lo}w-\\textbf{R}ank \\textbf{A}ggregation with \\textbf{N}early \\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\\bar{W} = \\sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\\hat{W} = \\hat{B}\\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches.\nWe conduct extensive evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation models.

This approach is neither theoretically optimal nor computationally cheaper compared to well-established matrix approximation methods.\n \nIf the goal is to minimize $| \\bar{B}\\bar{A} - \\tfrac{1}{U} \\sum_u B_u A_u |,$, then taking truncated SVD or other low-rank approximation methods provably yield the best low-rank reconstruction in Frobenius norm. The proposed optimization over two scalar vectors $ P, Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^U $ is an ad-hoc and suboptimal heuristic, without any proof that it approximates the optimal low-rank structure. \n\n\nThe paper never explains why this weighting approach should outperform SVD-based aggregation, nor provides any theoretical justification beyond hand-waving about computational efficiency. The argument that “SVD introduces numerical inaccuracies” is very weak, in practice, taking truncated SVD is stable and extremely fast.\n\n`W2: Execution time comparison is misleading`\n\nIn Table 1, SVD and Gram-Schmidt are reported as being 10–15 times slower than FLoRA-NA. However, the comparison is unfair: taking truncated SVD matrices would in fact run much faster than full SVD (10s of times faster or so), and this is confirmed in other works like LoRA-GA (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05000), without any loss in performance.\n\nThus, the claim of computational efficiency is unsubstantiated and incorrect, in my opinion.\n\n`W3: Overclaiming novelty`\n\nMost of the claimed advantages (no extra communication, better generalization) stem simply from tuning a linear combination of existing LoRA matrices. This is closer to a reweighted averaging trick than a novel algorithmic contribution. The “nearly accurate” branding oversells what is, in essence, a parameter-weighted variant of FedAvg.\n\nThe idea of using truncated SVD as the best inexact approximation has already been established in FedEx-LoRA, which makes the proposed approach in this paper appear redundant.\n\n`W4: Conceptual inconsistency in results`\n\nThe paper claims FLoRA-NA achieves “nearly exact” aggregation, yet FedEx-LoRA, which performs exact aggregation, yields lower accuracy (Table 2). This is not explained logically, the authors state it is because “ the residual error is added to the frozen pretrained model, which ensures the accuracy of forward update, but cannot fully participate in gradient updates of A and B matrices.,” but this line is vague and unconvincing.\n\nIf the proposed method is truly more “accurate,” it should not outperform an exact method unless the claim itself is overstated.\nCould you please clarify this?\n\n`W5: Missing related work`\n\nThe paper fails to discuss recent federated low-rank methods such as Ravan (https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05568) and Fed-SB (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15436), which provide a clear communication–accuracy Pareto frontier compared to this and other works - at a quick glance. This omission weakens the positioning of FLoRA-NA as a “state-of-the-art” solution. The authors should include comparisons with these works, or at the very least, discuss them.\n\n---\n\nWhile the empirical coverage in the work is impressive, the core contribution is mathematically weak, and the claimed superiority over SVD-based methods is not supported by any evidence (theoretical or empirical).

Lack of causal proof that aggregation bias harms performance.\nThe paper defines an error term 𝜌 = ∥𝐵ˉ𝐴ˉ−1/𝑈∑𝐵𝑢𝐴𝑢∥ and incorporates it into a convergence upper bound. However, this analysis merely indicates that model convergence may depend on ρ; it does not prove that a non-zero ρ necessarily degrades performance. No lower-bound analysis, sensitivity test, or monotonicity relation is provided, making the claim that “the bias is inherently harmful” insufficiently supported.\n\n2. Possible confounding with non-IID data heterogeneity.\nThe reported improvements could stem from alleviating data heterogeneity rather than from the aggregation rule itself. Since non-IID strength is not controlled and there is no oracle baseline (directly computing 1/𝑈∑𝐵𝑢𝐴𝑢), the experiments cannot disentangle aggregation effects from data heterogeneity. To establish a causal link, the authors should fix the data partition and vary only the aggregation operator while measuring the correlation between ρ and performance.\n\n3. Overstated claim that the standard FedLoRA rule is “erroneous.”\nThe paper repeatedly describes the classical FedLoRA averaging as “erroneous” or “fundamentally flawed.” Yet the analysis only shows algebraic non-equivalence, not that this difference is detrimental under general conditions. Without stronger theoretical or experimental isolation, such a statement appears exaggerated.\n\n4. Limited methodological novelty.\nThe idea of learning aggregation weights on the server side is far from new. Similar learnable aggregation or re-weighted averaging strategies have been extensively explored in earlier federated optimization, distillation, and low-rank model aggregation works (2018–2021). The proposed approach learning separate coefficients \n𝑃,𝑄 for the A and B matrices is essentially a linear re-weighted averaging scheme adapted to the LoRA setting. Hence, the contribution is largely engineering-oriented reuse of an existing idea rather than a conceptual innovation.\n\n5. Suggested clarifications.\nExplicitly quantify how ρ affects optimization error or final convergence (e.g., linear vs. sublinear dependence).\nAdd an oracle baseline that uses the true average 1/𝑈∑𝐵𝑢𝐴𝑢 to decouple non-IID effects. Discuss how this approach fundamentally differs from prior learnable aggregation methods rather than merely showing empirical improvements.\n\n6. Alternative perspective: directly addressing non-IID heterogeneity may be more fundamental.\nThe paper attributes performance degradation to inaccurate matrix aggregation, but an equally plausible explanation is that client-specific differences in 𝐴𝑢,𝐵𝑢 caused by non-IID data are the real source of the problem. Methods such as FRLoRA (ICLR 2025), which reduce client drift through residual accumulation and subspace alignment, inherently make client updates more consistent thereby indirectly shrinking ρ without modifying the aggregation rule itself. In this sense, tackling heterogeneity at its root might offer a more principled and effective solution than merely adjusting the aggregation formula."}, "questions": {"value": "The motivation and theoretical justification remain unconvincing. The claim that the standard FedLoRA aggregation rule is “fundamentally wrong” is overstated and lacks causal evidence. The proposed learnable-weight scheme is not methodologically novel and revisits well-studied ideas under a new name. Moreover, non-IID heterogeneity is not controlled and could fully explain the observed performance gap. In contrast, approaches like FRLoRA that directly mitigate client drift may address the root cause more effectively.
