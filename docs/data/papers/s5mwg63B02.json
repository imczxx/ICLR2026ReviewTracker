To catalyze research in this domain, We herein present TN-RCA, an inaugural real-world, publicly accessible benchmark for root cause analysis (RCA)\nof telecommunication network alarms, comprising 530 fault scenarios constructed from expert-validated Knowledge Graphs(KGs). Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) perform poorly on this task, with the best LLMs achieving an F1-score below 70%, highlighting its significant dif\u0002ficulty.To address this challenge, we then propose Auto-RCA, a novel agentic\nsystem that produces the core code to analysis root cause through the automati\u0002cally iterative refinement. The core innovation of Auto-RCA lies beyond simple self-correction; it employs an iterative ”evaluate-analyze-repair” loop that system\u0002atically identifies common patterns across all failure cases to generate contrastive feedback. This feedback guides the LLM to fix systemic logical flaws rather than\nisolated errors. Experiments show that this agentic framework dramatically boosts the performance of root cause analysis in telecommunication networks, raising the final F1-score on TN-RCA from 58.99% (achieved by Gemini-2.5-Pro directly) to 91.79%. Meanwhile, Auto-RCA achieves 50% accuracy on the OpenRCA benchmark and demonstrates its generalization.

There are little details on the paper with regards to the comprehensiveness or representativeness of the dataset. For example, does the dataset include all the failure patterns you see in production telecommunication networks? Can you justify it?\n\nThe paper says that the dataset is sourced directly from the base stations. However, modern telecommunication networks is a complex networked system including edge presences and 5G telco clouds. If the dataset is collected from the base station, how can it include various faults and failure scenarios in the telecom backbone?\n\nI don’t understand why you will always need to generate code for analysis. Most RCA agents can infer root causes from observability data. Have you tried those baseline approaches? If not, why?\n\nI also do not understand what is the definition of root causes. From Figure 3, it seems that root causes in the paper mean hardware faults? What about software bugs?\n\nGiven that you need to generate code, it seems to me that Claude models generally perform better than the other models, because their codegen ability is higher, not because they have stronger reasoning ability for RCA.\n\nThere is a large body of work on using AI for RCA and site reliability engineering in general. The paper does not position itself very well. In fact, I have a hard time understanding what is the fundamental difference between telecom networks versus cloud systems and networks, from an AI perspective.\n\nThe presentation is poor.

Regarding the RCA task, why is it not positioned as a novel task paradigm that sits at the intersection of LLMs and graph learning? The current version of the paper reads more like the discovery of a complex new dataset in an industrial setting, where you observed that LLMs struggle, and subsequently proposed a benchmark. However, I am more concerned with the broader impact of your benchmark on the general LLM research community. In its present form, the influence of your benchmark seems limited to researchers specifically interested in this narrow task (or in 5G), which, I believe, constrains the significance of the contribution.\n2.
