First, characterizing the political bias present in LLMs, especially in a black box manner, is a societally important problem, as LLMs are increasingly being used to analyze political content and even simulate political opinions. Furthermore, results like the instability of alignment of personalities with political beliefs are an interesting result from a bias analysis standpoint and may explain some of the results seen in other LLM political bias papers (as pointed out in the paper)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "There are some weaknesses in the grounding, novelty, and clarity of the paper. For the grounding of the paper, I think there are weaknesses both methodologically and empirically. For methodology its not clear how much the methodology of prompting the LLM to get numerical responses would lead to different results if perturbations were applied. For example its seem likely that perturbing the verbiage of elements like the entity and policies, even if the verbiage is roughly semantically equivalent but maybe with a different sentiment polarity, in the prompts could alter the responses. In Ng et al. “Examining the Influence of Political Bias on Large Language Model Performance in Stance Classification,” the authors found that differences in the datasets lead to downstream task performance differences. Additionally, how would results change if LLM were given a more nuanced way to evaluate positions of entities on policies, like a Likert scale versus a binary yes or no. Finally, the use of a tensor implies that each of the axes are all of the same thing along those axes. It's not clear from a qualitative perspective that policy issues are equivalent to something like moral principles; I would agree that they are related, but not that they are equivalent. Thus, it's not clear that a tensor is the right representation of the outputs of the models, given the entity and policy tests. From the empirical perspective, I think there are some issues with the completeness of the policy probes and presentation of some of the political viewpoints/parties. For the latter, in the U.S., the libertarian party is not a major party and does not represent a third pole of U.S. politics. In fact, most libertarians caucus and vote along Republican lines in major U.S. elections. For the former, while it's probably not possible to fully enumerate all policy positions to really find the contours of a party, there does not seem to be any grounding that the policy positions used in the prompting represent a reasonable basis to separate political parties. \n\nFor the novelty, it's not clear that the proposed method significantly improves upon the political surveying process done by Rozado in his works. The proposed method is, at its core, the same procedure Rozado uses (i.e., prompting LLMs on political questions and topics to evaluate their bias) but with a different structure around the prompts and a quantitative analysis of the outputs. \n\nFor clarity, I think the paper would really benefit from something like a flowchart to understand the full process of prompt generation $\\rightarrow$ tensor $\\rightarrow$ analysis of the tensor. I personally had a hard time tracing where the conclusions were coming from."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
