The recently proposed AlphaEdit method achieves competitive editing performance by updating parameters under null-space constraints. However, our theoretical analysis reveals that AlphaEdit struggles with high knowledge conflicts\nand inconsistencies during editing. To address this, we propose a new editing method AlphaEdit+, featuring three key improvements: 1) relaxing null-space constraints by adding a matrix perturbation through optimization to resolve conflicts between new and preserved knowledge; 2) introducing a weighting scheme on previously updated knowledge constraints to mitigate conflicts between new and\nhistorical editing; 3) developing a value smoothing algorithm to resolve high knowledge inconsistencies. These enhancements collectively ensure robust editing while maintaining model coherence. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach AlphaEdit+ not only resolves the brittleness of the original method on carefully constructed challenging datasets but also achieves slightly better performance than AlphaEdit on existing benchmark datasets.", "tldr": "We propose AlphaEdit+, a framework that resolves knowledge conflicts and inconsistencies in model editing through a  null-space perturbation, conflict-aware weighting and objective smoothing.", "keywords": ["Knowledge Editing; Null-space Perturbation; Knowledge Conflict; Knowledge Inconsistency"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f6c6c28876ea1c820520b8ae06caab83f65bd3ce.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/175b01896761dbd4d4930c00685be9dc23a5a064.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper builds upon AlphaEdit by providing a theoretical analysis (Lemmas 1–3) that identifies its vulnerability under high-conflict and high-inconsistency editing scenarios.

The claim that the proposed perturbation alleviates conflicts is plausible; however, the paper does not provide direct evidence by reporting the pre-/post-edit distributions. As a result, the actual degree of conflict reduction cannot be quantitatively verified.\n\n2.

It remains unclear whether the reduction of cross-term interactions leads to genuine performance improvement.\n\n3. The paper does not evaluate efficiency, interference, or performance guarantees under large-scale simultaneous editing (e.g., Mass/Batch Edit) scenarios, leaving the generalizability of the method to practical large-scale settings unverified.\n\n4. Since the validation set was generated through LLM paraphrasing, it is unclear whether its distribution is fully independent from that of the test set. Components sensitive to validation scores (e.g., smoothing iterations or threshold tuning) may risk overfitting to the style of the validation data.\n\n5. There is no detailed analysis decomposing whether performance improvements are mainly driven by test samples similar to the validation set, or how much improvement occurs for dissimilar samples. This limits the assessment of the generality of the reported gains.\n\n6.

The authors begin by mathematically formalizing and analyzing the negative impact of knowledge conflict (with preserved knowledge $K_0$ and prior edits $K_p$) and inconsistency (residual norm $||r||$) on AlphaEdit's performance. To systematically resolve these issues, AlphaEdit+ introduces three core technical improvements: 1) **relaxing the null-space constraint via a perturbation matrix** to mitigate conflicts between new and existing knowledge; 2) introducing a **conflict-aware weighting factor** to reduce negative interference from historical edits; and 3) employing a **target-oriented smoothing strategy** for highly inconsistent edit targets to facilitate incremental parameter updates.

This offers a new and important perspective and evaluation dimension for research in the field of knowledge editing.\n2.  **Solid Theoretical Analysis:** The authors provide an in-depth mathematical analysis of AlphaEdit's null-space projection mechanism (Lemmas 1, 2, and 3), conclusively proving that high conflict and inconsistency are key factors leading to its performance degradation. This provides strong theoretical support for the proposed improvements in AlphaEdit+.\n3.  **Comprehensive and Targeted Technical Solutions:** The three core improvements of AlphaEdit+ (perturbation-adaptive relaxation, conflict-aware weighting, and target-oriented smoothing) are specifically designed to address different types of conflicts and inconsistencies, forming a structurally complete and mutually supportive solution.\n4.  **Construction of a Challenging Dataset:** The authors constructed the AlphaSet dataset (AlphaSet1, 2, and 3) to validate the method's effectiveness, focusing on high-conflict and high-inconsistency scenarios. This dataset holds significant value for future assessment of knowledge editing methods' robustness."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  **Limited Performance Gain on Core Conflict Datasets:** Although the paper focuses on resolving knowledge conflict, the persuasiveness of its core claim is undermined if the performance on industry-standard counterfactual knowledge datasets (such as Counterfact) shows little difference compared to AlphaEdit. Since the construction of the Counterfact dataset inherently represents a conflict with the model's original parametric knowledge, it serves as a crucial benchmark for testing the efficacy of conflict resolution mechanisms. The paper needs to provide stronger evidence demonstrating a significant improvement on these baseline conflict datasets.\n\n2.  **Choice of Base Models and Reliability of Experimental Results:**\n    * **Outdated Base Models:** The paper primarily uses base models such as GPT2-XL and GPT-J for experiments, whereas the most advanced contemporary research (e.g., AlphaEdit) has shifted to using more representative and larger-scale models like Llama. Conclusions drawn from relatively outdated models have insufficient universality and persuasiveness for modern Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors should explain the rationale behind choosing these models and, if possible, supplement the experiments with current mainstream models.\n    * **Questionable Performance Figures:** Information suggests that the expected or known performance of AlphaEdit+ on GPT-J and GPT2-XL should be higher. The authors need to fully explain and verify the experimental results, clarifying why the performance data presented in this paper might be lower than other implementations or known levels, to alleviate concerns about the reliability of the experimental setup or results.\n\n3.  **Lack of Complete Methodological Details:** In the methodology section, although the concepts of the three improvements are introduced, specific implementation details (e.g., the complete mathematical formulation of the perturbation matrix's optimization objective, the explicit formula for the conflict-aware weighting factor $w$, and the iteration and stopping criteria for the progressive smoothing strategy) are not fully elaborated in the provided main text. This impacts the reproducibility of the research, and the authors are advised to supplement the final version with detailed formulas and algorithmic procedures.\n\n4.  **Consideration of Computational Efficiency:** The introduction of new optimization variables (the perturbation matrix) and the iterative process of progressive smoothing in AlphaEdit+ will undoubtedly increase the computational cost and time required for editing. The paper needs to quantitatively discuss and compare the efficiency overhead of AlphaEdit+ relative to the original AlphaEdit, to justify whether the performance gain is worth the additional computational complexity."}, "questions": {"value": "Why follow up on AlphaEdit's work but fail to maintain the same experimental setup, such as by using Llama?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "gnbtVHZUdK", "forum": "zhI2L3mDoM", "replyto": "zhI2L3mDoM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission216/Reviewer_yoZj"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission216/Reviewer_yoZj"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission216/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761997532367, "cdate": 1761997532367, "tmdate": 1762915471666, "mdate": 1762915471666, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes AlphaEdit+, an extension of AlphaEdit that addresses conflicts and inconsistencies during model editing.
