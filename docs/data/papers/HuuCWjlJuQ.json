To address this challenge, various methods relying on Mahalanobis distance were proposed and widely employed. However, the impact of representation geometry and feature normalization on the OOD performance of Mahalanobis-based methods is still not fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable. Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a model's out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD performance. Building upon these studies, we propose a conformal generalization of recently proposed $\\ell_2$ normalization that allows to control the degree of radial expansion of the representations geometry, which in turn helps improve OOD detection. By bridging the gap between representation geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Out-of-Distribution Detection", "Deep Learning", "Feature Representation", "Normalization", "Model Robustness", "Empirical Study", "Representation Geometry"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/18dccafdbd8986b5ee0bb5b29435ec0be3159508.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper benchmarks Mahalanobis-style OOD detectors across modern vision backbones and links OOD performance to representation geometry (using metrics like covariance, within/between class scatter, LID etc.).

In Mahalanobis OOD detectors, features typically correspond to activations from specific hidden layers, but performance can depend strongly on which layers are used and how they are aggregated. The paper does not specify the exact setup considered.  \n- Several quantities presented in Figure 4 are not formally defined and cannot be easily inferred from the text. For instance, the “Fisher scatter ratio” usually involves both $S_w$ and $S_b$, yet the corresponding plot separates them into distinct lines without explanation.  \n- Most figures lack x-axis labels, which makes them difficult to understand.  \n\n**(W2) Method for fitting $\\beta$:** The proposed normalization method requires fitting the parameter $\\beta$. *Contrary to the claim made in the contributions summary*, the procedure for choosing $\\beta$ *requires access to OOD data* (the authors propose to train on *all OOD datasets except the target one*). Moreover, the parameter must be refitted for each setting, as Figure 7 shows that its optimal value varies widely across models and datasets.

This raises concerns about the practical applicability of the proposed method, since a comprehensive OOD dataset is usually not available in practical settings.  \n\n**(W3) Insight and discussion:** To my mind, the biggest weakness is that the paper presents many isolated results that are not synthesized into a coherent framework. The first part of the contributions shows that Mahalanobis OOD detection depends on various spectral metrics of the feature space. The second part proposes a normalization technique with a tunable parameter $\\beta$ to improve performance. However, the paper does not discuss how this normalization affects the spectral properties relevant to OOD detection, or why fitting $\\beta$ should modify these properties in a favorable way. If I am not missing something, these questions are not addressed in the discussion, and no formal results are provided to support the claim that normalization makes the geometry “better.” Therefore, the proposed method’s connection to the geometric arguments presented in the paper seems unsupported.\n\n**(W4, minor) Scope limited to Mahalanobis detectors:** Since Mahalanobis detectors rely on fitting Gaussian distributions to ID data, it is expected that spectral properties of the feature space correlate with OOD detection performance.

The attempt to predict this parameter through regression gives some hint to step towards automating hyperparameter tuning for post-hoc OOD detectors."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Although the study is broad and the analyses are detailed, the technical depth of the contribution remains limited. Several major concerns are below.\n\nThe first major concern is that the theoretical foundation of the work is a bit shaky. There is an obvious disconnection between OOD and optimality. Each test, based on FPR@95 as a target and surrogate for OOD, appears to be a single trial without repeat. How to justify the findings are robust but not random? There are many hand-wavy statements indicating \"better for OOD detection\" without any source of evidence, including many tests that are highly training dependent (for example, suboptimal due to insufficient training) or sampling rate (sufficiency of the data). As an example of the arbitrary choice in this paper, the proposed transformation is introduced as a geometric intuition but is not supported by a rigorous derivation showing why it improves OOD separability. The Riemannian interpretation provided in Appendix C is ok but not connected to any probabilistic or optimisation principle that would justify its efficacy. As a result, the paper remains largely empirical rather than theoretically grounded.\n\nSecond is that the novelty of the work is modest. The \\beta-scaling formulation extends the idea of \\ell_2 normalisation in Mahalanobis++ (Mueller & Hein, 2025) but offers little conceptual advance beyond introducing a continuous scaling factor. Similarly, the regression model predicting \\beta is only a simple mapping from empirical metrics to a hyperparameter and does not introduce new methodological insights. Consequently, the paper reads more as a diagnostic study than as a genuine algorithmic contribution.\n\nA third issue is that the empirical results do not convincingly demonstrate causal relations between geometry and OOD performance. Most conclusions are based on correlations rather than controlled experiments. The claim that representation geometry “drives” OOD detection is not substantiated, as confounding factors such as model size, dataset diversity, or training objective are not accounted for. Without controlled ablations, it is impossible to determine whether geometry itself or these associated factors explain the observed trends.\n\nAnother major concern is the limited specification and weak predictive performance of the regression model for \\beta. Important implementation details, including the regression type, feature preprocessing, and regularisation, are omitted. The reported R2 values (0.25 for MD and 0.47 for RMD) are low, indicating that the predictor explains little variance. Figure 8 shows large deviations from the diagonal, yet this is not critically discussed. The claim that the regression achieves near-oracle performance is therefore overstated.\n\nThe evaluation protocol lacks clarity and statistical rigour. The process for selecting the “empirical optimal” \\beta is underdefined, and it is unclear whether results are averaged across seeds or if statistical confidence is reported. In Table 1, the differences between methods are small and presented without variance estimates. This weakens the validity of the claimed improvements.\n\nThe interpretability and necessity of the various geometric metrics also remain questionable. The study introduces a large set of spectral and manifold statistics, but many are highly correlated and redundant. The proposed composite metric (the product of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality and within-class scatter slope) appears to have been found post-hoc and is not compared systematically against simpler alternatives. The reported Spearman correlation of 0.85 is presented as strong evidence but is not verified across dataset splits."}, "questions": {"value": "The authors have started a good empirical study that sheds light on how feature geometry and normalisation influence Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. The findings are partially informative, but the paper’s principal claims exceed what is demonstrated. The regression model for predicting \\beta using other data sets' statistics to predict a remaining one seems strange. Also it shows weak generalisation. To strengthen this work, future versions should (1) establish a formal link between the conformal transformation and probabilistic assumptions of the Mahalanobis metric, (2) provide robust and statistically validated evaluation protocols, and (3) strengthen the prediction model for \\beta considering the real world scenarios for practitioners who may have a single data set at hand.

The authors evaluate a diverse collection of modern vision models (self-supervised and pretrained transformers) across multiple benchmarks, revealing that Mahalanobis-style detectors exhibit highly variable effectiveness across models and settings. A key finding is that intrinsic properties of the in-distribution feature space, such as the spectral decay of covariance eigenvalues and estimates of intrinsic dimensionality, strongly correlate with OOD detection success. Building on these insights, the paper introduces a conformal $\\ell_2$ normalization technique parameterized by $\\beta$, which allows one to contract or expand the radial distribution of feature vectors. By tuning $\\beta$, the representation’s geometry can be adjusted to better align with the Mahalanobis detector’s Gaussian assumptions, thereby improving OOD detection performance. Importantly, the paper proposes a simple regression-based approach to predict the optimal $\\beta$ using only in-distribution data, without requiring any OOD samples. This learned predictor uses metrics derived from the training features (e.g. intrinsic dimensionality, within-class scatter) to estimate the best $\\beta$, and achieves nearly the same OOD detection performance as an oracle that had access to OOD validation data."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The study is comprehensive in scope, evaluating Mahalanobis-type OOD detectors across a wide range of foundation vision models, training regimes, and datasets. The authors follow established protocols (e.g. OpenOOD) and test on multiple OOD benchmark suites (NINCO, iNaturalist, OpenImages-O, Textures, etc.), lending credibility to the findings. This broad evaluation reveals interesting trends, e.g., the Relative Mahalanobis Distance (RMD) consistently outperforms the standard Mahalanobis scoring, especially for models that were pretrained on large data but not fine-tuned on the target domain.\n- The paper provides a deep analysis connecting representation geometry to OOD performance, which appears original and insightful. The authors identify measurable statistics of the feature space (covariance eigenvalue distribution, intrinsic dimensionality (ID), within-class scatter, etc.) and show that these correlate strongly with how well OOD examples can be detected. Notably, they find that a compound metric, the product of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality and scatter slope, is highly predictive of a model’s OOD detection effectiveness.\n- Building on the above geometric insights, the paper introduces $\\beta$-scaled $\\ell_2$ normalization as a novel extension of prior Mahalanobis-based methods. Whereas earlier work (e.g., Mahalanobis++ by Mueller & Hein, 2025) simply applied unit-length normalization to features (equivalent to a fixed $\\beta = 1$ case), here the authors generalize this idea by allowing a continuous tuning of the feature norms via the $\\beta$ parameter. This conformal transformation of the feature space is an original contribution: it provides a direct “knob” to control the radial spread of feature vectors, effectively interpolating between the original Euclidean feature space ($\\beta = 0$, no normalization) and a fully normalized hypersphere ($\\beta = 1$), and even beyond ($\\beta > 1$ for extra contraction, or $\\beta < 0$ for expansion). The paper demonstrates that by choosing an appropriate $\\beta$ for a given model, one can significantly improve OOD detection performance (by tightening clusters to better fit Gaussian assumptions or loosening them if needed).\n- The paper is well-written and structured in a logical manner. It clearly lays out the problems and questions in early sections, follows up with corresponding analyses, and then transitions into the proposed method. The use of visuals (plots of OOD separation per dimension, conceptual diagram of $\\beta$-scaling effects, etc.) is effective in reinforcing the arguments. Important claims are either theoretically explained or empirically demonstrated. The authors do a commendable job connecting the dots between observations (e.g. a model’s spectral properties) and the design of their method ($\\beta$ normalization), which makes the paper easy to follow."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **Limited comparison to non-mahalanobis baselines**: A notable limitation is that the study restricts its focus to Mahalanobis-based detectors (standard MD, Relative MD, etc.) and does not compare against other mainstream OOD detection approaches. Methods like the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) baseline or energy-based scores are standard references in OOD detection literature; however, the paper does not report results for these alternatives. This omission makes it difficult to gauge the absolute improvement or significance of Mahalanobis-based methods in comparison to simpler or better-known baselines. For example, if a simpler MSP or energy score performs on par with the tuned Mahalanobis detector, that would affect the paper’s claim of advancing the state-of-the-art. Originality and significance could be better established by demonstrating that the proposed techniques outperform not only variants of Mahalanobis, but also other competitive OOD detection methods.\n- **Primarily empirical findings without deeper theoretical explanation**: The connection drawn between feature geometry metrics and OOD performance, while intriguing, is based on empirical correlation rather than a derived theory. The paper shows strong correlations (e.g., between the product of LID and scatter slope and the detector’s FPR@95), but it stops short of providing a theoretical understanding of why these particular metrics are predictive. As a result, the insight, though useful, can feel a bit post hoc. A reader might wonder: to what extent are these geometric properties causally influencing OOD detection capability, versus simply being correlated indicators?\n- **Incremental methodological novelty**: The proposed $\\beta$-scaled $\\ell_2$ normalization, though useful, could be perceived as a relatively incremental extension over prior art. The idea of normalizing feature vectors ($\\ell_2$ normalization) to improve Mahalanobis detection was already introduced in earlier work (referred to as Mahalanobis++, which corresponds to the special case $\\beta = 1$). This paper extends that concept by making the normalization strength tunable via $\\beta$, which is a natural generalization. While this generalization is well-motivated and yields empirical gains, it may not represent a fundamentally new direction in OOD detection but rather a refinement of an existing technique.\n- **Dependency on auxiliary OOD data for $\\beta$ tuning**: Although the authors stress that their regression model selects $\\beta$ “without access to target OOD data,” in practice the training of this regression does rely on OOD datasets (just not the target one). The experimental setup uses a meta-dataset of OOD experiences: the regression is trained using several auxiliary OOD datasets (and corresponding in-distribution features) to learn a mapping from feature statistics to optimal $\\beta$. This implies that the method’s success partly hinges on having a representative set of OOD scenarios available beforehand.\n- **Presentation issues**: (1) Most of the figures and tables in the paper are a bit too small (the text are difficult to read).

In particular, if one encounters a novel OOD setting without any related auxiliary datasets, can the regression still be applied (perhaps using your pre-trained model)?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "TSVAB1qSoR", "forum": "HuuCWjlJuQ", "replyto": "HuuCWjlJuQ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25544/Reviewer_N2nU"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25544/Reviewer_N2nU"], "number": 7, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25544/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762923779633, "cdate": 1762923779633, "tmdate": 1762943468013, "mdate": 1762943468013, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
