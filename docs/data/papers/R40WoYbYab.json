While prevailing data selection methods rely exclusively on instruction instances X to approximate the target distribution, we argue that selection should align with the joint distribution of instructions and task-specific labels (X,Y), However, task-specific labels Y are typically unavailable in practice. To address this, we reformulate the task-specific data selection problem and present a novel pipeline that leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to infer proxy labels, thereby facilitating joint distribution alignment. Our approach begins by propagating proxy labels from a small target set to a large, unlabeled source corpus. A two-stage filtering process then removes instances with label noise and refines the subset through distribution alignment. This strategy produces more semantically meaningful and task-aware selections than conventional similarity measures based on X alone. Experimental results show that fine-tuning on a subset of only 10K samples—selected from a pool of 300K—achieves performance competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods.", "tldr": "We propose a proxy-label enhanced distribution matching method for task-specific model finetuning which shows superior performance in multiple benchmarks.", "keywords": ["Data Selection; Task-specific model fine-tuning"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e740194f8c268cf27baeb05836e9bf51a1396f67.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a task-aware data selection pipeline for fine-tuning llms.
