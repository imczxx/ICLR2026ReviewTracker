The likelihood of these detections is indicated by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g., \"does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?\"), and ranked retrieval (e.g., \"retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is detected until a pedestrian is detected\"). In this work, we formalize this problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences, given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively.

However, in video or audio, the same attribute is often strongly correlated across adjacent time segments—e.g., an object persists across frames—and different attributes are also frequently correlated, such as a person appearing together with walking actions. The independence assumption therefore generally does not hold. Although the paper acknowledges that this assumption often fails, it represents a core logical inconsistency, as treating LogSTOP as a probabilistic model relies on a fundamentally incorrect assumption. Consequently, the effectiveness of LogSTOP may not stem from the paper’s central conceptual framework.\n2.A question regarding the smoothing window is that it modifies the semantics of temporal logic (LTL). In LogSTOP, the “Next” operator means “φ holds in the next w window” rather than the standard LTL meaning of “φ holds at the next time point t+1.” This fundamentally changes the evaluated logical properties. An “eventually” property under the t+1 semantics is completely different from under the t+w semantics. Did the authors provide any explanation for this?\n3.A question regarding the experimental section is the inconsistency between evaluation semantics and algorithm semantics. The ground-truth labels for QMTP and TP2VR are generated based on “standard LTL (t+1),” whereas LogSTOP actually computes “coarse-grained LTL (t+w)”. This means the model is evaluated under a different semantic framework, and the authors should provide an explanation for this."}, "questions": {"value": "1.While the paper notes that the assumption often does not hold in video or audio sequences, the authors could further analyze its impact on the theoretical interpretation of LogSTOP.

In this global response, we would like to discuss concerns raised by multiple reviewers and highlight the key updates to the paper.\n\n**R1. LogSTOP is an efficient scoring function that does not represent the true probability of temporal properties**\n\nOur main aim with this work is to formalize the problem of assigning scores to temporal properties and to identify an efficient method for computing scores that are useful for several downstream applications. As we discuss in the paper and as the reviewers note, the independence assumptions prohibit us from treating LogSTOPs as true probabilities. Instead, we draw on ideas from probability theory purely as tools for aggregation. This choice allows LogSTOP to operate efficiently while empirically outperforming various baselines (including alternative aggregation methods) on applications such as query matching and ranked retrieval.\n\nWe would also like to discuss potential directions for relaxing the independence assumptions using conditional probabilities of local properties. For instance, consider the temporal property \n“There is a car and a person in all frames”. Using chain rule, the probability of this property can be written as:\n\n$$\nP(car_0 \\land person_0 \\land \\dots \\land car_T \\land person_T)\n= P(car_0)\n  \\cdot P(person_0 \\mid car_0)\n  \\cdot P(car_1 \\mid car_0, person_0)\n  \\cdot P(person_1 \\mid car_0, car_1, person_0)\n  \\cdots\n$$\n\nwhere  $car\\_i$  refers to a car being present in frame $i$.\n\nThis decomposition significantly increases the difficulty of the problem: accurate conditional probabilities are difficult to obtain and using them to compute probabilities of temporal properties is likely computationally expensive. We believe that these challenges point to promising avenues for future research – using domain-specific knowledge as priors for computing the conditional probabilities is a possible direction.\n\n**R2. Supporting ablations and analysis**\n\nWe would like to thank the reviewers for suggestions on additional ablations and analyses. We have added the following ablations and supporting experiments to the paper: \n\n- In Appendix I.3, we present an ablation study on the effect of the smoothing window (w) on LogSTOP’s query matching performance. We find that moderate values of w report the highest balanced accuracies and there exist intuitive trends for different temporal properties in terms of whether they benefit from increased/decreased smoothing (Table 2).\n- In Appendix I.2, we present an ablation study on how changing the base threshold value from log 0.5 to other values in [log 0.1, …, log 0.9] affects LogSTOP’s query matching performance. We find that the highest accuracies are reported using log 0.5 as the base threshold value and the accuracy decreases as we move further away from log 0.5 (Figure 7).\n- In Appendix I.4, we present efficiency plots for LogSTOP demonstrating that the time taken to compute LogSTOPs scales linearly with the length of the sequence for any given temporal property as expected (Figure 8).\n- In Appendix J.2, we report query matching results with a much larger LVLM, namely InternVL2-26B, on QMTP-Video. We find that this model performs only marginally better than LongVA-7B (1% improvement) and LogSTOP with YOLO outperforms this model by 13% in terms of balanced accuracy (Table 7).\n\nWe discuss the setup and results for these experiments in more detail in the responses to respective reviewers."}}, "id": "SICNGYftrV", "forum": "laaPiJJuAZ", "replyto": "laaPiJJuAZ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7929/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7929/Authors"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7929/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763599604586, "cdate": 1763599604586, "tmdate": 1763599604586, "mdate": 1763599604586, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper formalizes the STOP (Assigning Scores for Temporal Properties over sequence) problem and proposes LogSTOP as the efficient scoring function for temporal properties.
