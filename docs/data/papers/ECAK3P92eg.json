While most prior works frame hallucination detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process.\nThis naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the complex task of detecting hallucination spans. \nTo answer this question, we first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and show that  CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a span-level reward function. \nRL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.", "tldr": "We introduce RL4HS, a span-level RL method for hallucination detection.

Experiments are conducted on a single dataset (RAGTruth), which raises concerns about generalizability. Furthermore, the comparison with GPT and Qwen models seems superficial and lacks control over model size, data exposure, and inference strategies. Many of the reported gains are marginal and could be attributed to overfitting or differences in fine-tuning procedures rather than the proposed RL method.

The authors first show that using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning before predicting hallucinated spans makes the model’s predictions more diverse — so when decoding multiple times (say, K attempts), at least one prediction tends to be correct. Building on this, they design RL4HS, which fine-tunes a model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a span-level F1 reward to explicitly encourage reasoning that improves hallucination span localization. However, they find that if the input has no hallucination, directly giving reward = 1.0 biases the model toward always predicting “no hallucination.” To fix this, they propose Class-Aware Policy Optimization (CAPO), which scales the non-hallucination advantages (by 0.5) to balance rewards between classes. They also confirm that simple fixes like Dr.GRPO cannot solve this imbalance.
