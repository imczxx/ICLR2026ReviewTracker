Here we show that a universal, morphology-agnostic controller can be rapidly and directly obtained by gradient-based optimization through differentiable simulation. This process of morphological pretraining allows the designer to explore non-differentiable changes to a robot's physical layout (e.g. adding, removing and recombining discrete body parts) and immediately determine which revisions are beneficial and which are deleterious using the pretrained model. We term this process \"zero-shot evolution\" and compare it with the simultaneous co-optimization of a universal controller alongside an evolving design population. We find the latter results in _diversity collapse_, a previously unknown pathology whereby the population—and thus the controller's training data—converges to similar designs that are easier to steer with a shared universal controller. We show that zero-shot evolution with a pretrained controller quickly yields a diversity of highly performant designs, and by fine-tuning the pretrained controller on the current population throughout evolution, diversity is not only preserved but significantly increased as superior performance is achieved.

This pretrained controller is then used to accelerate evolutionary design in two novel paradigms: \"zero-shot evolution\" (using a frozen controller) and \"few-shot evolution\" (with generational fine-tuning).

I thought they were going to pre-train a single morphological design like what PreCo (Wang et al. 2023) does.\n\n2. The task (phototaxis/magnetotaxis) is a single, well-defined objective. While complex due to the rugged terrain, it does not require higher-level behaviors like object manipulation, multi-agent interaction, or dealing with multiple, conflicting stimuli. \n\n3.
