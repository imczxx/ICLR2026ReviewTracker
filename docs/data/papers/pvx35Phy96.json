As these methods enter pivotal real-world domains, rigorous and impartial evaluation has emerged as a central concern. Although many benchmarks now ensure the comparability of diverse gaming algorithms, prevailing evaluation methods focus on macro-level win–loss outcomes and aggregate metrics, providing little insight into differences among strategies across dimensions of game capabilities. In addition, existing methods are limited to evaluation within a single environment and struggle to handle evaluation tasks under environment shift. In this work, we propose MGCE (Multi-dimensional Game-theoretic Capability Evaluation), a novel evaluation framework that first partitions the scenarios and embeds them using large-model-guided multi-modal features. It then leverages neural networks to model strategy–environment interactions, quantifying multi-dimensional capabilities and characteristics of the environment. MGCE further incorporates a fine-tuning module to predict the performance of game strategies under shifting environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the multi-dimensional game capabilities learned by MGCE facilitate interpretable analysis of strategies, and that MGCE outperforms competing baselines in performance prediction across both private and public environments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["algorithm evaluation", "cognitive diagnosis", "reinforcement learning", "game theory"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/53525b9ee8833e836702e5992bb1c75594996d3f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes MGCE (Multi-dimensional Game-theoretic Capability Evaluation), a framework that evaluates and predicts the performance of game-theoretic strategies under environmental shifts.

It maintains a clear and consistent flow from problem motivation to methodology, experiments, and conclusion. Each section naturally connects to the next, making the overall argument easy to follow. The writing is fluent and professional, with sufficient background and related work to situate the contribution. Moreover, the experimental section is detailed and convincing: the authors conduct comprehensive evaluations on multiple environments, use diverse baselines (including matrix factorization, IRT, and neural cognitive diagnosis models), and report multiple quantitative metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²). These results are presented clearly through figures and tables, effectively supporting the claimed advantages of the proposed method."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Overall, the framework proposed in this paper appears overly complex. The authors assume that each game task $T$ must be divided into $d$ capability dimensions and $S$ scenario types. Unless the problem itself is of high importance, or the authors can automate the partitioning of capabilities and scenarios using LLMs, such a design would significantly limit the model’s generality and scalability.\n\nIn addition, I find the learning process of the “scenario–capability correspondence” described in Section 3.2 confusing. If the paper only focuses on the two environments used in the experiments, manual annotation should be sufficient. However, if the goal is to generalize to a wider range of tasks, the authors should provide the corresponding dataset and the detailed procedure of learning this mapping through the Transformer+MLP network.\n\nMore importantly, the proposed algorithm has no direct connection to game strategy evaluation. The framework is essentially an extension of the single-agent reinforcement learning paradigm and does not exhibit structural characteristics of multi-agent systems. In general, the evaluation of strategies in games or multi-agent systems should be based on concepts such as equilibrium analysis, Pareto optimality, risk–return ratio, non-transitivity of strategies, and strategy evolution. Although these ideas are mentioned in related work, the main body of the paper does not truly reflect these core principles.\n\nTherefore, I believe the proposed framework might be more valuable if applied to complex single-agent reinforcement learning scenarios—such as autonomous driving or Atari games—where the reward structure is ambiguous or extremely sparse, rather than for game-theoretic strategy evaluation. Alternatively, I hope the authors can clarify why they place such strong emphasis on game-theoretic problems."}, "questions": {"value": "Refer to the previous section"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "fIpfFezHpl", "forum": "pvx35Phy96", "replyto": "pvx35Phy96", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13165/Reviewer_4Z3h"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13165/Reviewer_4Z3h"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13165/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761761866627, "cdate": 1761761866627, "tmdate": 1762923874348, "mdate": 1762923874348, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel evaluation framework MGCE to tackle the limitations of existing game-theoretic strategy evaluation, specifically their focus on macro-level aggregate metrics that obscure multi-dimensional capability differences and their inability to handle environmental shifts.

The experiments test two simplistic shift types: terrain shift (adding obstacles) and policy changes (modifying evader strategies), while MPE only considers terrain shift. However, they do not consider more complex shifts that align with real-world scenarios, such as dynamic rule changes (e.g., altering win conditions), and the scaling of agent numbers (e.g., from 3v1 to 5v2 in pursuit-evasion game). This limits the generalizability of MGCE’s prediction capability, as it remains unclear how the framework performs under more diverse shift types.\n2. The paper defines the scenario representation rj as rj=Φ(ej), where ej denotes multi-modal features and Φ is a transformer model with average pooling. However, critical implementation details for the multi-modal fusion module Φ are omitted, which hinders the reproducibility. And it does not clarify if the transformer assigns learnable weights to each modality.\n3. The paper provides minimal details on how scenarios themselves are sampled for dataset construction, creating ambiguity about whether the dataset covers representative variations of game environments. And it does not conduct any checks to quantify or mitigate potential dataset bias, which leaves uncertainty about whether results are generalizable beyond the sampled scenarios.\n4.  The paper claims MGCE’s anchor strategy fine-tuning for cross-environment prediction is a key contribution, but this module is a routine application of transfer learning and few-shot adaptation. The balance score for anchor selection in this paper is a trivial heuristic for choosing a diverse anchor.\n5.  The paper asserts MGCE enables interpretable analysis of strategy strengths and weaknesses. However, this \"interpretability\" is superficial that MGCE only labels capability dimensions but provides no evidence that these labels correspond to meaningful behavioral traits of the strategies. And the paper claims MGCE reduces human and material costs of repeated testing, but it provides no evidence of cost savings or real-world utility, e.g., it does not compare MGCE’s computational cost to baseline methods.\n6.  For the MPE dataset’s terrain shift, the only shift type tested in MPE, Table 1 shows SVD outperforms MGCE in two of three core metrics.
