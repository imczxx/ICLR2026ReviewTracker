Conventional FWI methods are limited by their notorious sensitivity to the accuracy of the initial models. Recent progress in continuous representation FWI (CR-FWI) demonstrates that representing parameter models with a coordinate-based neural network, such as implicit neural representation (INR), can mitigate the dependence on initial models. However, its underlying theory remains unclear, and INR-based FWI shows slower high-frequency convergence. In this work, we investigate the general CR-FWI framework and develop a unified theoretical understanding by extending the neural tangent kernel (NTK) for FWI to establish a wave-based NTK framework. Unlike standard NTK, our analysis reveals that wave-based NTK is not constant, both at initialization and during training, due to the inherent nonlinearity of the wave equation. We further show that the eigenvalue decay behavior of the wave-based NTK can explain why CR-FWI alleviates the dependency on initial models and shows slower high-frequency convergence. Building on these insights, we propose several CR-FWI methods with tailored eigenvalue decay properties for FWI, including a novel hybrid representation combining INR and multi-resolution grid (termed IG-FWI) that achieves an optimal trade-off between robustness and convergence rate. Applications in geophysical exploration on Marmousi, 2D SEG/EAGE Salt and Overthrust, 2004 BP, and more realistic 2014 Chevron models show the superior performance of our proposed methods compared to conventional FWI and existing INR-based FWI methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Full-waveform inversion; Continuous representation; Implicit neural representation; Neural tangent kernel"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2ed687f48c6097b544367e6499b34562e725e7f0.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/abb3b73a71de3593350951b00f649eecab104b16.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, the authors propose a unified theoretical analysis framework based on the wave kernel and\nwave-based NTK to investigate the convergence and robustness of both conventional and continuous representation FWI.
