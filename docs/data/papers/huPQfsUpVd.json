However, its key step, eigendecomposition of an $n\\times n$ matrix, is computationally expensive for large-scale datasets. Recent works have proposed methods to reduce this complexity, such as Nystr\\\"om method approximation and landmark-based approaches. These methods aim to maintain good clustering quality while performing eigendecomposition on a smaller matrix. The current minimum matrix size for spectral decomposition in spectral clustering is $k\\times k$ (where $k$ is the number of clusters). However, no existing algorithms can achieve good clustering performance with only a $k\\times k$ matrix eigendecomposition.\n    In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-based spectral clustering. Our method constructs an $n\\times k$ bipartite graph between $n$ data points and $k$ distributions, enabling the eigendecomposition of only a $k\\times k$ matrix and preserving clustering quality at the same time.
