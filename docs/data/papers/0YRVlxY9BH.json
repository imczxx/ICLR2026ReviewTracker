The following are not weaknesses, but some thoughts shared with the authors. \n\nTravel planning is inherently complex, making it genuinely useful for people involves challenges beyond optimization or scheduling. If we view travel planning purely as a multi-day, multi-point-of-interest (POI) planning problem, as the paper does, the formulation seems reasonable. However, from a broader perspective, I am not convinced that the proposed dataset truly reflects how people make travel decisions, or that strong model performance on this dataset necessarily implies alignment with real user preferences.\n\nIn practice, travel planning goes far beyond cost and time optimization. Human preferences are deeply subjective and influenced by social and contextual factors. For example, people often seek advice from friends who have visited a destination, or they explore social media (e.g., Instagram, TikTok) to find inspiration from influencers or acquaintances. These behaviors are difficult to capture in a dataset that models travel purely as a structured multi-step planning task.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the authors consider reframing their work not strictly as a travel planning problem, but more generally as a multi-step or long-horizon planning task. This broader framing could make the work more generalizable and align it with recent efforts in benchmarking agentic reasoning and planning capabilities.

Thorough failure analysis adds diagnostic insight."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- A potential concern is that the benchmark is tied to China-specific travel data. Agents might overfit to domain idiosyncrasies or to the Chinese language expressions of requirements. The authors do mitigate this by providing English translations of all information for international researchers, but it’s not fully clear how an English-only LLM would perform if the underlying database is Chinese. Moreover, the DSL’s set of primitive concepts is tailored to travel. It’s not obvious how easily this framework would extend to other planning domains, say, event scheduling or travel in countries without the same data availability. The reliance on a predefined set of attributes means truly novel user constraints outside those attributes still cannot be captured without augmenting the DSL, e.g. “scenic beauty of train route” which is not a stored attribute.\n- The neuro-symbolic pipeline is effective but complex and brittle, with multiple interdependent stages prone to cascading failures. Each stage can introduce failure points: e.g., an error in DSL translation can completely derail the planner. Indeed, the results show a sizable drop from an “oracle” DSL setting to the normal setting, indicating the pipeline’s success is heavily dependent on the NL-to-DSL conversion quality. It means the proposed solution might not scale gracefully to even more complex queries or to smaller and less capable LLMs. In essence, the current neuro-symbolic method feels like a very involved engineered solution.\n- The use of micro vs. macro scores for five different rates resulted in dense tables that were a bit hard to parse on first read. For instance, Table 2 presents many numbers for each method, and it wasn’t immediately obvious to a reader what “macro LPR = 0” signifies without reading the fine print. The paper might benefit from a brief explanation in the text of how micro vs macro are calculated (the appendix defines it, but a sentence in main text would help guide the reader).\n- Additionally, the treatment of soft preferences in the evaluation is somewhat under-emphasized. Preferences are encoded as optimization objectives in the DSL, but the main results focus on binary pass/fail of constraints. It appears that preference satisfaction was analyzed separately rather than as part of the overall success metric. This separation makes sense since preferences aren’t hard requirements, but it leaves open questions: for example, if one method produces a plan that satisfies constraints but with suboptimal preferences, e.g., it visits fewer attractions than possible, how is that reflected?\n- Planning remains computationally intensive; even top methods require multi-minute searches and repeated LLM calls. MILP and large-context approaches become intractable for complex itineraries. The paper could discuss strategies to handle combinatorial scaling and efficiency improvements more explicitly."}, "questions": {"value": "- The DSL-based evaluation is powerful, but it relies on a fixed library of concept functions. How easily can this DSL be extended to accommodate new types of constraints or domains? For example, if a user asks for a constraint involving a notion not currently encoded, say, “scenic rating of a route” or “avoid areas with high COVID-19 cases”, would adding such a constraint simply be a matter of defining a new attribute function in the DSL and updating the database?\n - Have the authors considered training a dedicated model for this *NL2DSL translation* task? For instance, using the large set of synthesized queries (Stage II) with their DSL annotations as training data to fine-tune a transformer that directly outputs DSL code could potentially improve accuracy and consistency. It could also avoid the iterative Reflexion loop that sometimes prunes constraints. If this was attempted or ruled out, could the authors elaborate on the challenges?\n - How exactly are soft preferences evaluated in ChinaTravel’s scoring?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "vgbI0AopPt", "forum": "0YRVlxY9BH", "replyto": "0YRVlxY9BH", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13317/Reviewer_a2uL"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13317/Reviewer_a2uL"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13317/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761969087578, "cdate": 1761969087578, "tmdate": 1762923980737, "mdate": 1762923980737, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ChinaTravel, an open-ended multi-day travel planning benchmark designed for evaluating language agents under real-world, compositional constraint scenarios.
