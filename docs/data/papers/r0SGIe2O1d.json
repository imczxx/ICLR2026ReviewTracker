However, existing diffusion techniques often sample noise from just one distribution, which limits their effectiveness when dealing with complex scenes or intricate textures in different semantic areas. With the advent of the segment anything model (SAM), it has become possible to create highly detailed region masks that can improve the recovery of fine details in diffusion SR models. Despite this, incorporating SAM directly into SR models significantly increases computational demands. In this paper, we propose the Diff-SSR model, which can utilize the fine-grained structure information from SAM in the process of sampling noise to improve the image quality without additional computational cost during inference. In the process of training, we encode structural position information into the segmentation mask from SAM. Then the encoded mask is integrated into the forward diffusion process by modulating it to the sampled noise. This adjustment allows us to independently adapt the noise mean within each corresponding segmentation area. The diffusion model is trained to estimate this modulated noise. Crucially, our proposed framework does NOT change the reverse diffusion process and does NOT require SAM at inference. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which exhibits the fewest artifacts compared to other generated models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["super resolution", "diffusion"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/01a8a810926ef63643aac4cf7045e711dd1c5621.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The work presents Diff-SSR, a diffusion-based image SR framework that injects semantic structural guidance from SAM (Segment Anything Model) during training (only).

The paper is difficult to follow, primarily because the motivation for introducing structural noise is unclear. The authors argue that “different local areas of an image may exhibit distinct data distributions,” which is a reasonable observation. However, this alone does not justify why adding structural noise to the diffusion process is necessary or beneficial. A clearer theoretical or empirical explanation of how structural noise contributes to learning better representations or improving reconstruction fidelity is needed to establish the method’s motivation.\n\n2. The proposed forward process converges to a non-zero-mean Gaussian distribution influenced by the structural mask. However, the reverse sampling process still begins from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution, which appears inconsistent and counterintuitive. The authors should provide both theoretical justification and empirical evidence to clarify this discrepancy.\n\n3. As for the quantitative comparison, more perceptural metrics, such as LPIPS, MUSIQ, and CLIPIQA, should be reported. \n\n4. The paper mentions an “Artifact” metric, but its definition or calculation procedure is not provided. If this metric is computed from the error map between the predicted and ground-truth images, it might correlate strongly with PSNR and thus offer limited new insight.\n\n5. The illustration of the forward and reverse processes in Figure 3(b) appears inconsistent with the corresponding mathematical formulations described in Section 4.1.
