However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.\n    \nTo resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function (Zou et al., 2025), PROF leverages their complementary strengths through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\\%$ compared to the blending approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reasoning", "reinforcement learning", "large language model"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/edd96a42904cf65274a74bcf7e7fc38576eb1bb4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/2e9066de480f80c13986f11af93a3996023bd165.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a function to combine process reward and outcome reward rather than adding them.

Table 2, which presents the main results, is entirely missing results for other widely-used model families like Llama. Given the known diversity in model behaviors, validation on Qwen models alone is insufficient to make broad claims, as has been shown in other recent work. The generalizability of this method is therefore not well-established."}, "questions": {"value": "- How sensitive is the PROF method to the quality of the PRM?
