This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, UCS, that registers 3D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions, through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods--improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. Its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.", "tldr": "We present a machine learning model that leverages volumetric and spherical domains for unified registration of cortical and subcortical structures in brain MRI.", "keywords": ["neuroimaging", "registration", "sphere", "cortex", "mri"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f9b15f935a6067e824c40a6219b580bc00b6b3c4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a unified deep learning framework for brain MRI registration that jointly aligns cortical surfaces and volumetric subcortical structures using spherical + volumetric CNNs coupled by a consistency loss.

The paper posits the limitations of volumetric registration methods for registering the cortex despite its success in registering the subcortical structures and global anatomy. The problem with incorporating intensity and surface based registration is that the 2D surface registration has a gradient with a Lebesgue measure of 0 on the ambient 3D space, and to avoid this problem the paper proposes training a 2D and 3D registration network for the surface and volume respectively, and add a consistency term between the losses.

The mathematical formulation is very well defined, easy to follow, and technically sound. Usual papers in this topic are rather sloppy with overloaded notation or hand wavy definitions, but this paper is much clearer in that sense.\n2. Most of the formulation is consistent with a typical deep learning registration framework, and the coupling term is the major technical novelty in the paper, which is easy to undeerstand.\n3. Results are shown on a few popular clinical MRI datasets"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The premise of the paper \"While effective for aligning subcortical structures and global anatomy, volumetric deformable registration often fails in the cortex. The cortex is a thin, highly curved surface with significant inter-subject variability in folding patterns that is difficult to align in Euclidean space\" is not substantiated in any way except for the experiments in the paper. Most methods trained on SynthSeg or Freesurfer labels (e.g. OASIS dataset) have achieved overall dice scores in the order of 0.88, almost to the point of overfitting on the labelmaps. Two of the labelmaps in freesurfer / synthseg labels are the cerebral cortex for each hemisphere. It would greatly strengthen the premise of the paper to show the performance of pre-trained optimization and deep learning methods on these datasets or labelmaps on only the cortical label registration.\n2. Exaggerated narrative about slowness of optimization methods - \"Moreover, because of its reliance on classical optimization techniques, CVS is computationally expensive, requiring several hours per subject pair, making it impractical for large-scale datasets.\" and other statements imply classical methods being very slow which has been shown to be false with newer implementations - particularly in the Oncoreg Learn2Reg challenge (where Syndeeds and ConvexAdam perform very well with no or little learning), and FireANTs which shows real-time registration on various clinical datasets.  \n3. Equation 2 is not a coupled optimization - coupling is only achieved with Equation 3. This is problematic because the objective (integral) in Equation 3 is only defined on the boundary of the surface $dS$ , which has a Lebesgue measure of 0 on the 3D ambient space. This suffers from the same problem as joint optimization of the volumetric and surface registration using a single volumetric displacement grid. The paper does not justify why Equation 3 does not suffer from the same problem that direct optimization on the surface matching objective using a volumetric displacement does. This is a major issue in the paper - since the whole idea behind not performing direct optimization of the cortical surface was the measure 0 gradient of the surface loss. Since this is the only proposed technical novelty in the paper (coupling the surface and volume registration), proper empirical (showing the gradient propagation with and without the coupling term) or theoretical (proofs) justification is needed.\n4. \"All CVS experiments are done on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5218 CPU. (There is no GPU-based implementation of CVS.)\" - Use FireANTs or ConvexAdam for GPUs. These baselines have existed for more than a year now, and are very efficient for the scale of clinical datasets. \n5. Baselines are not adequate. Voxelmorph with segmentation loss should be compared with UCS. Synthmorph and unigradICON are general purpose registration tools like ANTs, but since the method assumes access to a training dataset, at least a few baselines should be trained with the same data. \n6. Line 424: \"Including our proposed sphere loss (Base+Dice(all)+Sphere) produces a clear increase in Dice (cortical) while preserving a high Dice(subcortical) score.\" - this is not the right ablation to run. The correct ablation here is to add the cortical surface loss directly in the training / inference objective instead of the roundabout way (i.e. consistency between network outputs).\n\nMinor issues: \n1. The geometric descriptors used in the surface registration are not mentioned. This hinders reproducibility of the paper.\n2. to my knowledge, loss masking in unigradicon does not explicitly align the structures themselves but only registers within the provided masks. im not sure why this baseline is used in that case\n3. Line 469 - \"Unlike other methods that require additional inputs (cortical meshes, segmentations) at inference, our method requires only structural MRI images.\"  - This is a partially false statement - since all methods considered in the paper (except unigradICON with masking) do not require additional labels at inference. This is only true for classical iterative methods that do not learn any label-aware features.\n4. Another potential weakness in the evaluation setup is that the considered datasets are possibly overfit to in the long run. There are other high resolution, high quality datasets (e.g. Ultracortex 9.4T) that have higher than 1mm resolution (i.e. 0.6mm)  and manual labellings of the cortical surface - providing a challenging evaluation setup for the exact problem tackled in the paper"}, "questions": {"value": "1. 2D registration has to be performed on a sphere where the coordinate $\\phi$ wraps around from 0 to $2\\pi$. how is this circular nature considered in the spherical registration? appropriate citations or derivations in the supplementary material can be useful \n2. What is the performance of the method without the segmentation loss? This might be used for hippocampus or MTL registration for example where only the registration of a single surface might be of interest without registering other structures. \n3. In many other clinical or research scenarios pertinent to neuroimaging studies, the surface mesh is typically available (using a segmentation algorithm or manually) and accurate registration of the surface and volume might be desired. However, collecting training data across many subjects might be infeasible. In such a scenario, can UCS be used in an online optimization fashion? \n\nI would like the authors to address some of the weaknesses of the paper followed up by the questions in this section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Z8MfY41XQR", "forum": "7FvUJu63zq", "replyto": "7FvUJu63zq", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4109/Reviewer_rb9L"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4109/Reviewer_rb9L"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4109/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761886897072, "cdate": 1761886897072, "tmdate": 1762917181158, "mdate": 1762917181158, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents UCS, a deep learning framework for brain MRI registration that combines volumetric and surface-based approaches.
