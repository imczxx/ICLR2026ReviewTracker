In the real world, missing occurrences often depend on the unobservable values themselves, which are referred to as Missing Not at Random (MNAR). To address this, numerous generative models have been proposed, with diffusion models in particular demonstrating strong capabilities in out-of-sample imputation. However, most existing diffusion-based imputation approaches overlook the MNAR setting and instead rely on restrictive assumptions about the missing process, thereby limiting their applicability to practical scenarios. In this work, we introduce the Missing Pattern Recognized Diffusion Imputation Model (PRDIM), a novel framework that explicitly captures the missing pattern and precisely imputes unobserved values. PRDIM iteratively maximizes the likelihood of the joint distribution for observed values and missing mask under an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In this sense, we first employ a pattern recognizer, which approximates the underlying missing pattern and provides guidance during every inference toward more plausible imputations with respect to the missing information. In various experimental settings, we demonstrate that PRDIM achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to previous diffusion imputation approaches under MNAR setting.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Imputation", "Generative Models"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d39451842e8ffbb725b0346ecbed3f14c4792258.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f7c971272f6612b86bdece63cef84781bbcdc5e7.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "To address the limitations of existing diffusion-based imputation models that overlook MNAR (Missing Not At Random) scenarios and rely on strong assumptions about missing patterns, this paper proposes PRDIM.

One of the strong motivations of the paper is that missing patterns, such as Missing Not at Random (MNAR), are more common in real-world scenarios. However, the data used in the subsequent imputation tasks are artificially split from complete datasets such as ETT, PEMS, and Stock, and do not actually use real-world missing data.\n\n2. The proposed model is intended to be a time-series imputation model, but the validation is done on static image data from Fashion MNIST. It is recommended to use a time-series dataset with temporal variations, such as Moving-MNIST, for validation.\n\n3. PRDIM is an imputation model for time-series data. For time-series datasets, there is a significant issue of temporal shift, i.e., the distribution of data in the training set differs greatly from that in the test set. However, PRDIM does not provide a specific solution to address this issue.\n\n4. The terms \"out-of-sample imputation tasks\" and \"in-sample imputation tasks\" are not clearly defined in the main text.\n\n5. PRDIM's performance heavily relies on the accuracy of the pattern recognizer. If the missing patterns are estimated inaccurately, it could affect the final imputation accuracy. This could be especially problematic for time-series datasets with significant distribution shifts, as it may lead to overfitting on the training data.\n\n6. Although the pattern recognizer provides an estimate of the missing pattern, there is a lack of visual interpretability and analysis of how the generated imputations are guided by the pattern. This was one of the motivations of the paper, but it was not well validated in the experimental section.\n\n7.
