Although existing methods based on diffusion models excel in visual realness by leveraging strong priors, they often struggle to achieve an effective balance between fidelity and realness.\nIn our preliminary experiments, we observe that a linear combination of multiple models outperforms individual models, motivating us to harness the strengths of different models for a more effective trade-off. Based on this insight, we propose a distillation-based approach that leverages the geometric decomposition of both fidelity and realness, alongside the performance advantages of multiple teacher models, to strike a more balanced trade-off.\nFurthermore, we explore the controllability of this trade-off, enabling a flexible and adjustable super-resolution process, which we call CTSR (Controllable Trade-off Super-Resolution).\nExperiments conducted on several real-world image super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance across both fidelity and realness metrics.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Image Super-resolution", "Diffusion Model"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/15fe3c672183ca368869690f7ec3b495c1c45495.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes CTSR (Controllable Trade-off Super-Resolution), a novel method for real-world image super-resolution that balances fidelity and visual realness.

The paper claims that the consistency term (weighted by $γ_{time}$) is superior to a standard L2 loss for preventing oversmoothing (line 241), but this central design choice lacks direct empirical validation. The current ablation studies (Tab. 4) only consider \"with/without distill\" and \"teacher\", but do not isolate the contribution of individual components within the proposed loss, e.g., setting $γ_{time} = 0$.\n\n3.\tThe paper says it targets real-world SR, but currently most experiments simulate degradation with RealESRGAN’s operator and then evaluate on DIV2K/RealSR/DRealSR after ×4 upsampling.

At inference you effectively take one Euler step from $z_0$ in the predicted direction, scaled by t. First, does this imply that all intermediate outputs lie on (or near) a single linear path between these two endpoints, regardless of image content? If so, is the controllable frontier actually one-dimensional for every input? What’s more, how do you prevent runaway hallucinations when t>1 or t<0 in your experiment? \n\n2.
