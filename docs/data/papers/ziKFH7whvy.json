Traditional CFD and graphics pipelines can produce realistic fire effects but rely on handcrafted geometry, expert-tuned parameters, and labor-intensive workflows, limiting their scalability to the real world. Recent scene modeling advances like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable high-fidelity real-world scene reconstruction, yet lack physical grounding for combustion. To bridge this gap, we propose FieryGS, a physically-based framework that integrates physically-accurate and user-controllable combustion simulation and rendering within the 3DGS pipeline, enabling realistic fire synthesis for real scenes. Our approach tightly couples three key modules: (1) multimodal large-language-model-based physical material reasoning, (2) efficient volumetric combustion simulation, and (3) a unified renderer for fire and 3DGS. By unifying reconstruction, physical reasoning, simulation, and rendering, FieryGS removes manual tuning and automatically generates realistic, controllable fire dynamics consistent with scene geometry and materials. Our framework supports complex combustion phenomena—including flame propagation, smoke dispersion, and surface carbonization—with precise user control over fire intensity, airflow, ignition location and other combustion parameters. Evaluated on diverse indoor and outdoor scenes, FieryGS outperforms all comparative baselines in visual realism, physical fidelity, and controllability.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Gaussian Splatting", "Physics Simulation", "Combustion Simulation", "Novel View Synthesis"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0566d7d345108e0dfd29ad106d2924c2a94ff989.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f532e9f858222a373ef1ec30ddd0cd7d5929db23.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "FieryGS synthesizes realistic, physically grounded fire effects in real 3D scenes by integrating combustion simulation and rendering into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline.

If I get this right, there is nothing new about the 3D Gaussian Splatting method, the fire and charring simulation, nor the illumination method. \n* While the results look good, they are far from realistic, especially for larger, more turbulent fires. This can easily be seen by comparing Figure 2 (real-world, live fire) and the images generated by the framework. The smoke and turbulence in the real-world images makes for deeper and visually more “exciting” flames. This is probably because the low resolution of the fire, also the turbulence is not modelled well by the simplified Navier-Stokes. This method works fairly well for small fires with little turbulence – in my opinion. The graphics community, however, have many methods and tricks that would help here, such as dynamic meshes that allows detail to be increased in the areas where there is turbulence. Other more complex and realistic physical simulations have been proposed as well. This would if course hamper computational performance, which is really good for the method presented here. The good thing though is that there are many ways to improve it based on related work in physics-based animation of fire. \n* Some parts could be better explained. It is not clear to me what exactly is fed to GPT4o to reason about material characteristics. I would assume the real-world images, but it is not clear to me from the text.  \n\nOn one hand, while the results are impressive, I wonder if the novelty falls short. This paper represents a fairly small step in an evolution, not a revolution. On the other hand, one could easily see that the significance of this work could be high, as it shows how fire could be simulated in real-world scenes. \n\nWhile the rendering of the fire leaves much to be wanted (think about the vivid fires and explosions in special effects such the opening scene of Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith – from 2005 where explosions also are simulated using physics), this does not affect my recommendation much, as I expect this to be improved quickly by future work. \n\nBecause of this I lean towards acceptance."}, "questions": {"value": "* On line 126, it is implied that the method presented in the paper “maintains physical accuracy”. Is maintaining physical accuracy a good term? The reason I ask is that I would assume that this would be evaluated in some way. It is not, and it is not easy to do either as far as I am concerned. \n* The charring effect is very nice. Why would you not let the fire consume the fuel (material) in each voxel? Have you tried? In theory, this should be straight forward. Are there issues with the visualization?\n* It is stated on line 215: “Focusing on efficiency, our method simplifies processes …”. Could you please be explicit about which processes? I would like to understand exactly what you mean. \n* Figure 5f: While the generative refinement improves illumination shadows, it seems to me that the flames get bleaker with less details. Is this true and a problem in general, or is it just this image? What is going on here - if it is the case? Please help me understand.\n* Line 409: “A detailed timing breakdown and comparisons with baselines are provided …”.
