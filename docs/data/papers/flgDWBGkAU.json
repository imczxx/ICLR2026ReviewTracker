Meanwhile, VLM based emotion recognition remains relatively under-explored in current re search. Our work targets this gap with a parameter-efficient, interpretable design. To mitigate class imbalance and make view–emotion relations explicit, we first curate an LLM-assisted QA dataset. In Stage 1, the VLM is adapted into a multi-view emotion encoder that extracts fine-grained features from scene, body, and face using shared, parameter-efficient com ponents with view-specific pathways, enabling interpretable evidence dis entanglement from a single image. In Stage 2, the VLM remains frozen and its scene/body/face descriptors are fused by a lightweight head. This preserves VLM knowledge (avoiding overfitting and label coupling) while yielding independent, well-calibrated scores that support flexible thresh olds, plug-and-play label sets, and strong sample efficiency. Using only single-image inputs, our pipeline attains 37.88 mAP on EMOTIC, 88.82% top-1 accuracy on CAER-S, and higher recall/F1 on HECO than prior VLM-based baselines, while offering clear per-view interpretability.

The method is nearly identical to [1], the main difference being the three encoders and two-stage training. The similarities in the method are too many to ignore, specifically the use of VLLMs and finetuning of InstructBLIP for the task. Furthermore, this work performs significantly worse than all [1,2,3] on both EMOTIC and CAER-S, so it is hard to justify the method (more complex, less effective and with limited novelty). \n\nIn terms of clarity, the paper has a few issues, one of them being Table 7. There are two rows for\" Pose and situation description\", and \"Emotion rationale task\" -- these are not explained in the method, as far as we can see from the figures and the text. In the first stage, the input is 3 RGB images and an instruction in the form of multiple-choice VQA, while the output is class names. Similarly, in the second stage, there is no text input, and the output is standard classification probabilities. Either the method or the experiments need to be updated for clarity. On some more minor clarity/presentation issues, Table 3 is non-legible, and all tables have issues with citations being repeated.\n\nIn terms of results significance, Tables 8 & 9 show very similar results to non-balancing, so I am wondering if 0.16% is enough of a methodological contribution for only three classes.\n\nIn terms of the text, it looks like the citations in the first paragraph of the intro are not appropriate.
