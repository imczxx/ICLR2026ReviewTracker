Point-Based methods mitigate grid quantization errors but current work often oversmooth local details, as query features are obtained solely through interpolation of point-wise features which are aggregated over large receptive fields. To address this, we propose a $\\textit{discriminative region representation}$ that fuses narrow neighborhood features with broader contextual point-wise features, and a $\\textit{primitive-based region representation}$ that decomposes neighborhoods into triplet-defined primitives to capture complex surface structures. Building on these designs, we propose $\\textit{RegionUDF}$, a region-aware UDF framework that achieves state-of-the-art open-surface reconstruction on both object- and room-level scenes, with additional validation on watertight shapes. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and robust cross-domain generalization.

The paper lacks comparison with strong baselines like NKSR, which is widely recognized as a high-precision, non-learning benchmark for surface reconstruction.\n\n3. The performance gains mainly over older UDF methods (e.g., GeoUDF, published two years ago) are modest and largely expected given the richer local feature aggregation. Without demonstrating clear advantages over stronger baselines, the contribution falls short of the level typically expected for a top-tier venue.\n\n4.

The Gaussian noise level used in your experiments (σ = 0.005–0.01) appears substantially low (e.g., σ = 0.02–0.05 or with outliers). This raises concerns about the strength of the claimed robustness. Could you justify this choice of noise level, and discuss how your method would perform under more realistic or higher noise conditions? Do you expect the relative gains over existing UDF baselines to persist in such settings?\n\n\n\n2. Your primitive-based feature uses three neighboring points to form a local patch representation. Conceptually, this seems to introduce a slightly richer local prior compared to the two-point segments used in SALS, but it is unclear why three points were specifically chosen. If the goal is to encode more complex local geometry, why not use four or more points to capture higher-order structures? Is there a principled reason for using a triplet instead of other configurations, or is this choice mainly empirical? How does the representational capacity of a triplet compare to a segment or larger patches?\n\n\n\n3. Since the method builds on local feature enrichment rather than introducing a structural constraint, it remains unclear whether the observed improvements are robust to more challenging conditions. Could you explain why this formulation should maintain its advantages under high noise levels, sparse sampling, or real-world data, and how it provides more than incremental feature engineering?\n\n\n\n4. A key motivation of the method is enhancing local geometric representation. However, the current experimental evidence does not clearly isolate performance in thin structures or boundary regions, which are typical failure cases for UDF methods.
