Traditionally, we rely on manual tools (e.g., Matplotlib and GeoGebra) to generate precise diagrams, but this usually requires huge, complicated calculations. Recently, researchers start to work on model-based methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion and GPT5) to automatically generate diagrams, saving operational cost but usually suffering from limited realism and insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel framework GeoSDF, to automatically generate diagrams efficiently and accurately with Signed Distance Field (SDF). Specifically, we first represent geometric elements (e.g., points, segments, and circles) in the SDF, then construct a series of constraint functions to represent geometric relationships. Next, we optimize those constructed constraint functions to get an optimized field of both elements and constraints. Finally, by rendering the optimized field, we can obtain the synthesized diagram. In our GeoSDF, we define a symbolic language to represent geometric elements and constraints, and our synthesized geometry diagrams can be self-verified in the SDF, ensuring both mathematical accuracy and visual plausibility. In experiments, through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, GeoSDF synthesized both normal high-school level and IMO-level geometry diagrams. We achieve 88.67\\% synthesis accuracy by human evaluation in the IMO problem set. Furthermore, we obtain a very high accuracy of solving geometry problems (over 95\\% while the current SOTA accuracy is around 75\\%) by leveraging our self-verification property. All of these demonstrate the advantage of GeoSDF, paving the way for more sophisticated, accurate, and flexible generation of geometric diagrams for a wide array of applications. The accompanying code, datasets, and all synthesized outputs are being released to benefit the research community.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diagram Synthesis", "Solving Geometry Problem", "Math Reasoning", "Signed Distance Field"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6d6e591a0e580e4cc89e8ca30258ae57802a5b79.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3e45d897400b35b03f98706f3e57af6443536c83.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces GeoSDF, a framework for synthesizing plane geometry diagrams directly from natural-language problem statements.

This choice is both clever and original: by expressing points, lines, and circles as differentiable SDFs and formulating geometric constraints as differentiable loss terms, the method transforms symbolic geometric reasoning into a continuous optimization problem. This formulation elegantly unifies geometry synthesis and constraint satisfaction under a single differentiable framework, enabling gradient-based optimization and smooth convergence toward valid configurations. The approach bridges ideas from computer graphics (implicit surfaces) and symbolic reasoning, marking a clear conceptual advance in geometric problem solving.\n\nBesides of differentiability, the SDF formulation inherently supports quantifiability—every geometric element (angle, distance, area) can be measured directly from the optimized field. This allows GeoSDF not only to synthesize diagrams but also to verify their correctness and even solve geometry problems by extracting numerical answers (“solve-by-construction”). This self-verification property is a strong differentiator compared to black-box neural or diffusion-based methods, and it provides a principled link between diagram generation and mathematical reasoning.\n\nMoreover, the integration of a fine-tuned LLM (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) for natural-language parsing is a practical and impactful design decision. It enables the system to directly interpret geometry problems written in natural language, translating them into symbolic constraint sets without requiring a domain-specific language or manual encoding. The resulting pipeline—from text parsing to symbolic representation to differentiable optimization—is compact, self-contained, and user-friendly. This end-to-end design represents a major step toward fully automated geometry reasoning, offering accessibility for future applications.\n\nFinally, The method proposes a batch-enabled high efficient optimization tools, and achieves state-of-the-art results on GeoQA (95.9% accuracy, +20% over prior SOTA) and performs well on IMO-level problems (88.7% human-verified accuracy)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Overall the paper is great. There are still several places to improve the final quality:\n\n- While the qualitative results in Figures 3–5 effectively show GeoSDF’s synthesized diagrams, the paper would benefit from more side-by-side visual comparisons against competing systems (e.g., rule-based and diffusion-based baselines). Currently, most comparisons are numerical or textual. Presenting visual outputs from alternative methods under the same problem settings would make the superiority of GeoSDF’s precision and stability more intuitive and convincing.\n\n- Sections 4.6 and 4.7 already provide excellent empirical analyses of convergence and regularization. However, a brief theoretical explanation of why the non-convex optimization behaves robustly, or how the regularization weight $\\lambda$ balances constraint accuracy and geometric spacing, would make the methodology more principled and broadly reproducible."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
