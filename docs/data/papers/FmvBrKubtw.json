Existing methods show that endowing agents with reasoning can help mitigate RO empirically, but there is little theoretical insight. We first prove that RO is avoided when agents satisfy a consistent reasoning requirement. We then propose a new negotiated reasoning framework connecting reasoning and RO with theoretical guarantees. Based on it, we develop an algorithm called Stein variational negotiated reasoning (SVNR), which uses Stein variational gradient descent to form a negotiation policy that provably bypasses RO under maximum-entropy policy iteration. SVNR is further parameterized with neural networks for computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SVNR significantly outperforms baselines on RO-challenged tasks, including Multi-Agent Particle World and MaMuJoCo, confirming its advantage in achieving better cooperation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "Relative Over-Generalization", "Stein variational gradient descent"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/95d66227ca9832c34e15b1f6cb7ffd46f2ef5861.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work proposes a “negotiated reasoning” with an SVGD-based algorithm that proves RO-free convergence under strict conditions.

The authors point out that under CTDE settings, RO arises in two stages: during training (when agents form a perceived joint policy) and during execution (when they act without seeing others’ final actions). They formalize these as Perceived RO (PRO) and Executed RO (ERO), and show that if all agents achieve consistent reasoning—reasoning about others in a way consistent with their optimal or executed policies—then RO can be avoided. To realize this condition, they propose a Negotiated Reasoning (NR) framework where agents iteratively update joint action beliefs through structured “negotiation.” They instantiate this idea as Stein Variational Negotiated Reasoning (SVNR), which leverages SVGD updates and a nested negotiation structure. A neural amortized version enables efficient decentralized execution. Experiments on several MARL benchmarks demonstrate that SVNR avoids sub-optimal equilibria and performs better than prior reasoning-based methods."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. Well-motivated and conceptually clear. The paper tackles a long-standing issue in cooperative MARL—relative over-generalization (RO)—from a fresh theoretical angle. The decomposition into Perceived RO (PRO) and Executed RO (ERO) is a intuitive way to separate the effects of exploration during training and coordination failures during execution. This framing alone makes the paper stand out conceptually.\n\n2. Theoretical depth. The authors do not stop at defining RO but go on to establish a sufficient condition—consistent reasoning—under which RO provably disappears. The reasoning flow (formalization → condition → constructive algorithm) is solid and self-contained, which is rare in the MARL literature where many “theoretical” claims are hand-wavy.\n\n3. Negotiated Reasoning framework is novel. The idea of embedding a negotiation mechanism among agents—modeled via particle-based updates and linked to SVGD—is original and technically well-grounded. It provides a new way to understand coordination as an iterative reasoning process rather than just communication or credit assignment.\n\n4. Empirical validation matches the theory. Experiments across both simple and complex cooperative environments (Differential Games, Particle Gather, MaMuJoCo) demonstrate consistent gains."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Assumptions may be restrictive. The theoretical results rely on strictly nested negotiation sets and the maximum-entropy policy iteration framework. These are strong assumptions, and it’s unclear how sensitive the algorithm is to relaxing them. More empirical discussion of non-strict or sparse negotiation topologies would strengthen the practical claim.\n\n2. Scalability and computational overhead are under-discussed. While the amortized neural version helps, the original SVNR involves particle-based updates and iterative negotiation steps. The paper lacks a quantitative analysis of training cost, memory footprint, or runtime.\n\n3. Limited connection to broader MARL literature.\nThe paper positions itself mainly against “reasoning-based” methods, but doesn’t fully clarify how its negotiation differs in spirit from other opponent-modeling or communication-based approaches. A clearer conceptual contrast would make the contribution easier to situate.\n\n4. Experimental evaluation is strong in breadth but shallow in analysis.\nWhile performance improvements are clear, the paper could provide more interpretability: e.g., what negotiation dynamics emerge, how many rounds are effectively used, or how PRO/ERO evolve during training. Without this, the reader must take the “negotiation” story largely on faith.\n\n5. Writing density. Some proofs and definitions could use more intuitive explanation or visual support (especially PRO/ERO and the consistent reasoning condition). The theoretical sections are mathematically heavy, which may alienate non-specialist readers."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
