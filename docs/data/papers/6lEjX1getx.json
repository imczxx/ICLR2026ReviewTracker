Despite the availability of near-complete reconstructions of the Drosophila melanogaster central nervous system, musculature, and exoskeleton, anatomically and physically grounded models of fly leg muscles are still missing. These models provide an indispensable bridge between motor neuron activity and joint movements. Here, we introduce the first 3D, data-driven musculoskeletal model of Drosophila legs, implemented in both OpenSim and MuJoCo simulation environments. Our model incorporates a Hill-type muscle representation based on high-resolution X-ray scans from multiple fixed specimens. We present a pipeline for constructing muscle models using morphological imaging data and for optimizing unknown muscle parameters specific to the fly. We then combine our musculoskeletal models with detailed 3D pose estimation data from behaving flies to achieve muscle-actuated behavioral replay in OpenSim. Simulations of muscle activity across diverse walking and grooming behaviors predict coordinated muscle synergies that can be tested experimentally. Furthermore, by training imitation learning policies in MuJoCo, we test the effect of different passive joint properties on learning speed and find that damping and stiffness facilitate learning. Overall, our model enables the investigation of motor control in an experimentally tractable model organism, providing insights into how biomechanics contribute to generation of complex limb movements. Moreover, our model can be used to control embodied artificial agents to generate naturalistic and compliant locomotion in simulated environments.", "tldr": "We present the first 3D, data-driven musculoskeletal model of Drosophila legs that links neural activity to movement, supports experimental tests of motor control, and helps train embodied agents with naturalistic behaviors.", "keywords": ["Musculoskeletal Modeling", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Imitation Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/63ad312d7546173159a355896d78d3a45c5e9020.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b58157c761cb9c1c294484acc3c47c48103cac87.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper constructs a foreleg musculoskeletal systems of fly based on anatomical data and optimization.

The model the authors present only has muscles in parts of the front two legs, and the work doesn't deal with ground contact or external forces, which could make it difficult to directly apply when modeling many behaviors.\n2. It's a little hard to tell without frame-by-frame comparisons, but it seems like the reconstruction quality presented in panel 3c might not be that high, at least for walking data.\n3. I'm not sure what to make of the muscle synergy analysis. If a meaningful set of synergies was really discovered, I would expect to see a knee in panel 4c, but it doesn't seem like there is one. The explained variance numbers are a little hard to interpret as well; it might be more interesting to know how the fit quality would degrade using 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional control vectors (with learned per-muscle weights) instead of controlling each muscle independently.\n4. The motivating claim on line 451, \"Placing a model of the musculoskeletal system—an additional layer of processing—between the policy network’s output and physical actions stabilizes the control task by making the action space better formed and more error-tolerant\", does not seem to be substantiated. To support this claim, I think the authors would need to compare policy learning in models with and without muscles and per-joint passive forces.\n5. Unless I missed it, there isn't a direct comparison to the original version of the NeuroMechFly model the authors are extending. This would probably help contextualize the behavior fitting results."}, "questions": {"value": "1. What exactly are the inputs to the static optimization procedure used to fit muscle parameters?

I think I eventually figured out the shorthand, but it took me a minute.\n4. On line 381, what is meant by \"systematic evaluation\"? Do the curves plotted correspond to the best models after discovered via a grid search, in which case shouldn't the red-orange family be expected to have an advantage, since there's a larger space to explore?\n5. Where did the reference angles for the joints come from? Would it be worth attempting to discover better values for these?\n6.

But, in the limitations and future work section, it’s mentioned that body-body and body-environment contact forces are ignored - does this mean that the trajectory following was done without any contact between the leg and a surface? Adding to the confusion - In the appendix - the authors mention “We concentrated our efforts on developing a fully functional front-leg muscle model for two main reasons”. Does this mean that only the front two leg motion were simulated in the experiments for locomotion? Clearly describing the exact task would be very helpful to the reader.\n\nSome details about imitation learning would be a great addition to the paper - what was the dimensionality of the state and action space?"}, "questions": {"value": "For most muscles in figure S6, the learned activations seem to be either 0 or 1 across all passive joint properties. Can the authors comment on the plausibility of this in a real musculoskeletal system?\n\nTypically for reward functions in reinforcement learning for locomotion or any in general imitation of a recorded trajectory - there is a term that penalizes effort. For example, sometimes this can be minimizing joint torques, accelerations, muscle activations, etc.. I'm curious if this was considered during experiments? \n\nIm also interested in the authors thoughts about the relationship between muscle synergies and passive joint properties, would it make sense to experiment how the synergies changes as joint properties change?\n\nComment - Typically exploration in reinforcement learning is challenging, especially when the action space is muscle activation. There has been some work in addressing this - https://openreview.net/forum?id=C-xa_D3oTj6 . The idea is not to naively explore but to identify some state dependent exploration that helps learning efficiency.
