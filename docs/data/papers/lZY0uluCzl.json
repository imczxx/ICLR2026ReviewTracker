Recent theoretical advances have provided a deep understanding of how SGD enables feature learning in high-dimensional nonlinear models, most notably the \\emph{single-index model} with i.i.d. data. In this work, we study the sequential learning problem for single-index models, also known as generalized linear bandits or ridge bandits, where SGD is a simple and natural solution, yet its learning dynamics remain largely unexplored. We show that, similar to the optimal interactive learner, SGD undergoes a distinct \"burn-in\" phase before entering the \"learning\" phase in this setting. Moreover, with an appropriately chosen learning rate schedule, a single SGD procedure simultaneously achieves near-optimal (or best-known) sample complexity and regret guarantees across both phases, for a broad class of link functions. Our results demonstrate that SGD remains highly competitive for learning single-index models under adaptive data.", "tldr": "We show that SGD, applied to single-index models (ridge bandits), naturally transitions from a burn-in to a learning phase.

However the information exponent in general relates to the taylor expansion of the population loss and specifically for single index models with iid gaussian data this concept reduces to checking the Hermite coefficients of the link function. It is unsurprising that when the data is not gaussian the Hermite coefficients are no longer important. What would be nice is to consider the original notion of information exponent applied specifically to this problem. For example it is not clear to me that the assumptions (monotonicity and either bounded derivative from below or convexity) do not somehow still just imply information exponent 1 but under a more appropriate definition."}, "questions": {"value": "Do you suspect that there is a similar notion of information exponent for single index models with 'interactive features'?

Do you suspect that it is possible to solve the problem for a more general class of link functions given larger sample complexity? Or that outside of the given class you cannot solve the problem?

Due to the monotonicity of $f$ (hence information exponent 1), the sample complexity of (pure exploration) SGD would scale linearly with $d$ (at least in the noiseless setting, but I believe it should be able to tolerate $O(1)$ i.i.d. noise as well). However, the bound of Theorem 1 (SGD with warm-start initialization) scales with $O(d^2)$ and that of Corollary 1 can be as large as $O(d^p)$ for $f(x) = x^p$. It might be plausible that to get sub-linear regret, one should ultimately settle for a worse sample complexity, but if that's the case it should be better highlighted.\n\n* The argument of Section 5 only shows that $f$ needs to be monotone around $m \\approx 1$, and one can drive $m$ towards $1$ by pure exploration.
