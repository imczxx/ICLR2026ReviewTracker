This is because both the user query and documents within the knowledge base often contain sensitive or confidential information. To address these concerns, we propose $\\texttt{Pisces}$, the first practical cryptography-based RAG framework that supports dual-path retrieval, while protecting both the query and documents. Along the semantic retrieval path, we reduce computation and communication overhead by leveraging a coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, a novel oblivious filter is used to privately select a candidate set of documents to reduce the scale of subsequent cosine similarity computations. For the lexical retrieval path, to reduce the overhead of repeatedly invoking labeled PSI, we implement a multi-instance labeled PSI protocol to compute term frequencies for BM25 scoring in a single execution. $\\texttt{Pisces}$ can also be integrated with existing privacy-preserving LLM inference frameworks to achieve end-to-end privacy. Experiments demonstrate that $\\texttt{Pisces}$ achieves retrieval accuracy comparable to the plaintext baselines, within a 1.14% margin.", "tldr": "We propose the first cryptography-based RAG framework that protects both queries and documents, while supporting dual-path retrieval.", "keywords": ["Retrieval-Augmented Generation", "Privacy-Preserving", "Cryptography"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/66901ea7023293654ba391a7d94599bf5fd421fb.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper focuses on an important research question of privacy-preserving retrieval augmented generation.

So, at the final inference stage, retrieved documents and queries are encrypted through MCP and the user uses a private key to decode and get responses. But during the retrieval phase, the tokenizer and embedding model need the plain text of the query, would that leak privacy? I think at this stage, the query is not encrypted.\n4. Why in Figure 2, ClapNQ_Train_single. Pisces (with MPC) has higher accuracy than plaintext? Is it because of randomness? If so, I think multiple experiments should be conducted and error bars need to be reported.\n5. Why in Table 4, HopotQA, encrypted text computation can have less time than plain text computation?\n\n[1] Koga, Tatsuki, Ruihan Wu, and Kamalika Chaudhuri. \"Privacy-Preserving Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Differential Privacy.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2412.04697 (2024)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "9tc1h8XAew", "forum": "Re3A6vzCTC", "replyto": "Re3A6vzCTC", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17937/Reviewer_Nqrz"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17937/Reviewer_Nqrz"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17937/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761708050149, "cdate": 1761708050149, "tmdate": 1762927746032, "mdate": 1762927746032, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Pisces proposes the first cryptography-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that simultaneously protects both user queries and documents through dual-path (semantic and lexical) private retrieval, achieving near-plaintext accuracy with significantly improved efficiency."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The Introduction mostly summarizes system components and prior cryptographic methods, but does not articulate the specific research problem or insight that distinguishes Pisces from existing privacy-preserving RAG frameworks. Overall, it reads more like a technical report than a research paper with a well-defined innovation.\n\n2. Unclear use of “cryptography-based” in the title: Although the framework is described as cryptography-based, the cryptographic novelty is not obvious. From the description, the “cryptography” aspect mainly involves using an embedding model and tokenizer to encode queries and documents, which is standard in most RAG architectures. If the cryptographic contribution only lies in combining existing MPC/PSI primitives, it does not sufficiently justify the “cryptography-based” claim. The authors should clarify how Pisces provides new cryptographic advances beyond typical embedding-based privacy mechanisms.\n\n3. Missing experimental comparison with Table 1 baselines: The paper introduces several baseline methods in Table 1 (e.g., DP-RAG, LPRAG, RemoteRAG, etc.), but these methods are not actually compared in the experimental section.
