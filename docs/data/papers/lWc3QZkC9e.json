Idealized Evaluation vs. Real-World Complexity:** The experiments, while internally consistent, are conducted in a \"laboratory\" setting that abstracts away critical real-world challenges.\n\n  - ***Scale***: The system is evaluated on a very small number of nodes (4-8). This is insufficient to validate the scalability of a P2P system named \"WWW.Serve\" or to reveal potential issues with the gossip protocol at scale.\n  - ***Network Conditions***: The experiments appear to assume a high-bandwidth, low-latency network. Real-world systems must contend with geographic distribution, variable bandwidth, and network partitions. \n  - ***Simplified Economic and Operational Dynamics***: The game-theoretic model (Section 5) presumes nodes are rational actors with a static quality q_i, overlooking more sophisticated strategies and dynamics. Additionally, the paper has not dicussed the \"cold-start\" problem: How are initial credits distributed, and what mechanism bootstraps the network by attracting the first cohort of high-quality providers?\n\n**2. Unacknowledged Overheads and Practicality:** The paper downplays the significant overhead of its core mechanisms.\n\n  - The \"duel-and-judge\" mechanism is described as applying to a \"small fraction\" of requests (line 265), but the experiments use a 20% duel rate (line 448). This implies a substantial, non-trivial overhead, which is neither quantified nor justified.\n  - Similarly, the performance impact of the \"blockchain-inspired\" ledger is glossed over. High-frequency transactions in a large-scale network could create a severe bottleneck, but the paper simplifies this by using a \"shared ledger\" in experiments (line 695-696).\n\n**3. Potential for Re-Centralization:** The paper's own game-theoretic analysis hints at a potential paradox. Equation (1) (ṗ_i ∝ p_i(∆_i - ∆)) describes a \"rich-get-richer\" dynamic. While the authors frame this as \"quality wins,\" it also implies that nodes with initial advantages (e.g., a large corporation with superior hardware and lower costs) will see their stake share grow exponentially, potentially leading to market concentration and defeating the very purpose of decentralization. This critical long-term dynamic and its negative implications are not discussed.\n\n**4. Unresolved Privacy and Security Issues:** The paper claims to enhance privacy, but it primarily focuses on provider anonymity. It critically fails to address the glaring issue of user data privacy. Sending user prompts (which can be highly sensitive) in plaintext to anonymous, untrusted nodes is a major security risk. The framework lacks any mechanism to protect user data."}, "questions": {"value": "Following up on the points raised in the Weaknesses:\n\n1. Could the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the system's overhead? Specifically, what is the justification for the 20% duel rate, and what is its expected impact on overall system throughput and cost?\n2. Regarding the game-theoretic analysis in Section 5, while it predicts convergence to high quality, doesn't Equation (1) also predict a strong market concentration dynamic (\"rich-get-richer\")?\n3. The paper highlights \"privacy\" as a key benefit. What mechanisms are envisioned to protect sensitive user prompts when they are processed by anonymous, untrusted nodes in the network?\n4.

The system provides a lot of flexibility to service providers allowing them to design their own scheduling and load balancing policies for their infrastructure.

At the same time the credit-based transaction system and the duel-and-judge mechanism ensures that nodes cannot misreport their results or get away with producing quick but poor-quality responses.

It is not clear to me if the user has any say in which service provider manages their request. If they do not have a say in that then that is a drawback since many users may want to restrict their requests to certain service providers - especially due to privacy concerns and also due to variation in the scheduling policies of different providers.\n\n3.
