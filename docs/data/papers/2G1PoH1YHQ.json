Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme—in other words, being “easy” to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation, conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an _assessment environment_ that can be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.", "tldr": "We present a paradigm for reinforcement learning that trains policies to ensure low evaluation error with respect to a performance estimator, while improving the expected return.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning Development", "Policy Evaluation", "Safe Deployment", "Evaluation-aware Learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/60ce3e4b2affd4a9ef2444d51c02328818e09485.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a37a2670fafc188f396f5fc0dfac7f57f9a8fb9f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper challenges the conventional reinforcement learning paradigm, wherein policy learning proceeds without explicit consideration of its subsequent evaluation. The authors argue that verifiable policy evaluation is an essential prerequisite for deploying systems in safety and performance-critical applications.  To address this limitation, the paper proposes a novel framework named Evaluation-Aware Reinforcement Learning (EvA-RL). This framework introduces a dual objective: the policy is trained not only to maximize the expected return but also to minimize the expected evaluation error relative to a given value prediction scheme. The paper substantiates this framework with several key theoretical insights. These include an analysis of the problem's structure, demonstrating the convexity of a relaxed formulation and the existence of multiple optimal value functions. Additionally, the authors formally characterize the inherent tradeoff between policy performance and evaluation accuracy, explore the relationship between hard and soft-constrained versions of the problem, and establish a formal bound on the performance estimation error."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- Novel framework that incorporates evaluation as a part of the learning process, which ensures safety in deploying systems (intuitively).\n- Systematic theoretical analysis gives a deeper insight into problem formulation and solution.

A much stronger test of the framework's utility would be to use a clean simulator as the \"assessment environment\" and a more complex, noisy, or physically different version as the \"deployment environment\" to see if the method can handle the domain mismatch central to its own motivating examples.\n- The paper critiques OPE for failing on long-horizon tasks but then uses very short assessment horizons (10-25 steps {on page 7: Assessment environment design}). It's unclear if this \"cheap\" evaluation is still predictive when the deployment task is thousands of steps long. An experiment on a truly long-horizon task would be needed to validate this.\n- The paper repeatedly motivates itself with \"safety-critical\" applications but never evaluates safety. The experiments only measure return (performance) and Mean Absolute Error (evaluation accuracy).
