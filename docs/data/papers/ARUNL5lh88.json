This design inherently favors increased vergence to access range information.\n  - Strike geometry is related to biology: The success function versus angular misalignment follows a Laplace distribution fitted to larval data, effectively embedding the optimal prey-approach geometry that the agent later discovers.\n   - Triangular action space: The coupling between forward and turn speeds constrains feasible pursuit trajectories, encouraging stereotyped sequences independent of learned policy optimization.\n- The paper has some overclaims.

The conclusion that the proposed framework explains why stereotyped hunting emerges under ecological constraints is underwhelming, as it should be a well-known fact in the biology community.\n\n(2) Weak quantitative evidence behind hunting pattern similarity\n\nThe authors only selected a few general hunting patterns, such as halving of prey angle [Bolton et al., 2019], as evidence for the naturalistic behavior of the trained agents. Stricter quantitative analysis between agent behavior and real zebrafish behavior is necessary. For example, the authors should capture real zebrafish motion and compare it with the agents' motion to prove that the agents can learn naturalistic hunting behavior.
