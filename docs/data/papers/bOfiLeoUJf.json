We characterize conditions under which edges can be removed from a causal graph while preserving the identifiability of (conditional) causal effects. This result enables causal identification on simplified graphs that are substantially smaller than the original graphs. This approach is particularly valuable when researchers are interested in causal relationships within specific tiers while controlling for broader influences from other tiers without fully specifying them. Building on this, we introduce a \\emph{query-specific} causal discovery procedure that takes a causal query as an additional input and recovers a reduced graph tailored to the query from observational data. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies, we demonstrate that our procedure can achieve exponential speedups compared to the existing method when tiered knowledge is available.", "tldr": "We present a method for pruning edges from causal graphs by leveraging tiered knowledge, which leads to significant speedups in causal discovery.", "keywords": ["Causal Inference", "Graph Pruning", "Tiered Knowledge"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d3edfd785c74a72d2737fe3fde34faa18ee2d050.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper focuses on the challenge of answering causal queries in complex systems without having to fully specify or learn an entire causal graph. This comes from the motivation that in some settings the causal model can involve many variables, but a researcher may only be interested in the effect of certain treatments on certain outcomes. The paper focuses on how incorporating background knowledge (tiered knowledge) about the system can improve both identifiability of causal effects and computational efficiency.   They introduce a graph pruning approach to remove certain edges from the causal graph without affecting the identifiability (causal identification on simplified graphs). Based on this, the paper introduces a query-specific causal discovery algorithm that takes as input not just observational data but also a specific causal query of interest to only learn the portion of the causal graph relevant to that query. The paper shows theoretically and empirically that their method can achieve exponential speedups"}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- I think the paper is clear and well written.
