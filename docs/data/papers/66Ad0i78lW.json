Prior works address this by conditioning on LR images, but their fine-tuning often weakens generative capability and requires multiple denoising steps. In this work, we present DM-SR, a novel framework that bridges this gap without modifying the pretrained diffusion model. We train an image encoder that maps LR inputs into the latent distribution aligned with the diffusion model’s training space, preserving its full generative power. Furthermore, DM-SR adaptively predicts the appropriate noise level based on the degradation of each input, ensuring optimal alignment with the diffusion model’s timestep-dependent distribution.

The authors note that DMs are trained on Gaussian-corrupted images, a distribution that low-resolution (LR) inputs do not match. Existing methods attempt to solve this by fine-tuning the DM, which can weaken its powerful generative prior, or by using multi-step inference, which is computationally expensive. The authors propose DM-SR, a novel framework that keeps the pre-trained diffusion model completely frozen. Instead, it trains only an image encoder. This encoder is designed to do two things: (1) map the LR input image into the latent distribution based on the frozen DM, and (2) adaptively predict the appropriate noise level (timestep) based on the degradation of the input image . This approach allows the framework to harness the full generative power of the pre-trained model and achieve state-of-the-art perceptual quality in a single inference step.

The final loss is a combination of five different loss terms, which seems to be very complex. The weighting parameters are simply stated as \"empirically chosen\", and the paper provides no clear explanation or justification for why these specific hyperparameters were set. This makes the method seem brittle and difficult to reproduce. While the ablation in Table 5 shows that all components contribute to the final result 3, the paper lacks a strong justification for why this specific combination is necessary, especially for the two loss terms.\n\n(2) The paper acknowledges the method's poor performance on distortion metrics (PSNR/SSIM) and frames it as a standard perceptual-distortion trade-off. However, the limitation shown in Figure 5 (changing the eye's pupil color from gray to black ) is a clear example of sacrificing semantic fidelity for perceptual realism. This is a significant issue. While the black pupil may appear more \"realistic\" (which is why the NR metrics are high), it is an uncontrolled hallucination—the model is generating a feature not present in the input. There is no evidence that this \"fix\" is semantically correct, and no guarantee that it can be correctly generated every time. This lack of faithfulness deserves a more in-depth discussion.\n\n**Minor Weaknesses:**\n\n(1) The analysis in Table 4 regarding the number of steps is confusing. While the paper explains that too many steps (10+) hurt performance due to the SD-Turbo backbone, it fails to explain the trend for 1, 2, and 5 steps. For some metrics (like LIQE), performance peaks at 2 or 5 steps and is slightly worse at 1 step.

Why was this metric chosen over other, simpler metrics (like PSNR) or a learned degradation classifier?\n\n(2) In Table 4, the model performance varies with the number of steps. The paper explains why many steps (10+) hurt performance due to the SD-Turbo backbone. However, it does not explain the trend for 1, 2, and 5 steps, where performance seems to peak at 2 or 5 steps and then slightly decrease at 1 step (e.g., for LIQE ).
