To address this, we integrate structural insights from pre-trained protein graph neural networks (pGNNs) into pLMs through a latent-level contrastive learning task. This task aligns residue representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins, enriching pLMs with inter-protein structural knowledge. Additionally, we incorporate a physical-level task that infuses intra-protein structural knowledge by optimizing pLMs to predict structural tokens. The proposed \\textit{dual-task framework} effectively incorporates both inter-protein and intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a \\textit{residue loss selection} module, which uses a small model trained on high-quality structures to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn. Applying our structure alignment method to the state-of-the-art ESM2 and AMPLIFY results in notable performance gains across a wide range of tasks, including a $12.7\\%$ increase in ESM2 contact prediction.

The two tasks are:\n* Latent-level task: A contrastive learning objective that aligns the latent residue representations from the pLM with corresponding representations from a pre-trained, frozen protein graph neural network (pGNN), specifically GearNet. This is designed to distill *inter-protein* (dataset-level) structural knowledge into the pLM.\n* Physical-level task: A prediction task where the pLM's residue embeddings are used to predict discrete structural tokens from Foldseek, reinforcing *intra-protein* (local) structural context.\n\nIn addition, the authors also propose a *residue loss selection* module mitigate the impact of low-quality structures in the PDB: they train a smaller reference model on a high-quality subset and then prioritize training the main pLM on residues with a high \"excess loss\" (i.e., residues that are both reliable/learnable and challenging for the current model).\n\nThe authors apply this framework to ESM2 and AMPLIFY, creating \"SaESM2\" and \"SaAMPLIFY.\" Performance improvements are observed across a wide range of downstream tasks, including structure prediction, mutation effect prediction, and property prediction.\n\nI think the paper is of high quality in terms of conceptualization, experiment design and presentation, but there are certain concerns that need to be addressed."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "* The ablation studies are comprehensive.
