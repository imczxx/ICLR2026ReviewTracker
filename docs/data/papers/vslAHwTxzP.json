In this paper, we introduce self-generation technique designed to enhance the performance of conditional generation in time-series forecasting. Self-generation involves synthesizing not only future observations, but also historical data itself conditioned on the given historical context. While noise is often introduced during the observation process, our method can reduce the amount of noise in observed historical data, thereby enhancing forecasting accuracy. Additionally, to further boost forecasting performance, we incorporate classifier-free generation methods into conditional generation for time-series forecasting. In the experiment, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other condition generation methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Forecasting", "Diffusion models"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2367d74504865da66ae1742c38ede7bedfb58ac5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d884391a0ec5fb2f489931c1dd0473f9fa940c52.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tackles probabilistic forecasting for multivariate time series using a diffusion-based approach that departs from the common “predict-future-only” setup.

Rather than conditioning on a fixed past and generating only future values, the proposed SFdiff jointly reconstructs the past and predicts the future within the same reverse-time process. By doing so, the model “purifies” the historical window on the fly, leading to more stable forecasts. The authors provide a theoretical argument via an upper bound on sensitivity, indicating that the joint sequence score is less affected by perturbations in the history than a future-only score, and supply a compatible denoising score-matching training objective. They further integrate classifier-free guidance into score-based conditional modeling and show that, under self-generation, modest guidance improves calibration and sharpness. Across two synthetic dynamical systems and five real benchmarks, SFdiff generally achieves stronger CRPS_sum than prior diffusion, flow, and non-generative baselines. Comprehensive ablations detail the effect of history/future loss masking, guidance weights, and the number of sampling steps. The approach is promising for scenarios with corrupted contexts, though it requires careful hyperparameter tuning and retains the higher sampling cost typical of diffusion methods."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- The toy benchmarks are minimal yet representative, making it straightforward to diagnose where the proposed approach helps under perturbed histories.\n- The writing is concise and well structured, allowing readers to grasp the core idea and theoretical claim without unnecessary detours."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The ablation study is quite insufficient; for example, I did not see an ablation analyzing the contribution/effect of the historical sequence.\n- Since this is a forecasting task, why not include **point-forecast metrics** (e.g., MSE, MAE, RMSE) in the evaluation?\n- The model framework is unclear—for example, it is not specified what architecture is used for the denoising network, and many implementation details remain ambiguous."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "UHZfihJCr7", "forum": "vslAHwTxzP", "replyto": "vslAHwTxzP", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22560/Reviewer_pypy"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22560/Reviewer_pypy"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22560/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761663179263, "cdate": 1761663179263, "tmdate": 1762942278810, "mdate": 1762942278810, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces SFdiff, a diffusion-based model for probabilistic time-series forecasting.
