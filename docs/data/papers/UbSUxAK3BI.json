This paper introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information. We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an improvement of 38.6\\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, and we demonstrate that our approach produces higher quality designs across 5 metrics: scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness, and documentation, plus additional qualitative evidence of the improvements.

Reliance on manual, task-specific template engineering: The framework's performance heavily depends on structured memory templates that are created manually for each specific task. The paper suggests \"automated or generalized\" methods as future work but provides no ablation study on the sensitivity to template design.

Their proposed \"Intrinsic Memory\" with \"Structured Templates\" is a novel and well-thought-out solution to this problem. This approach seems to directly target the core challenges of role adherence and perspective inconsistency.\n- **Rigorous Case Study Evaluation:** The data pipeline design case study is excellent. The authors used a complex, realistic task involving eight specialized agents. Critically, they based the evaluation on 10 independent runs. Their use of an LLM-as-a-Judge, combined with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (as shown by the p-values in Table 2), is methodologically rigorous and makes the results convincing.\n- **High Reproducibility:** I was impressed by the commitment to reproducibility. The paper provides extensive details in Section 8 and the appendix. This includes the key algorithms (Alg. 1, 2), the exact memory update prompt (Fig. 4), the task prompt (Fig. 5), and the evaluation prompt (Fig. 6). This level of transparency is commendable."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **Manual Template Engineering and Limited Generality:** The method's biggest weakness is its reliance on \"manually created,\" task-specific templates. The authors acknowledge this in Section 6. This reliance on expert human effort means the framework can't be easily generalized to new tasks or different agent roles, which severely limits its practical, out-of-the-box utility.\n- **Methodological Flaw in PDDL Benchmark:** I am not convinced by the conclusions from the PDDL benchmark (Section 4). The results in Table 1 are based on \"a single run\". Given the high variance of LLM agent systems, a single run is not sufficient to draw any robust conclusions. \n- **Significant Token Overhead:** This approach introduces a non-trivial cost. The IMA system used 32% more tokens in the case study (Table 2). This extra cost seems to come from two places: 1) the extra LLM call (f_memory_update) needed for every single memory update, and 2) the longer input context (C_n,m) that each agent receives, as it now includes the structured memory.\n- **Low Absolute Scores on Key Metrics:** It's important to note that while IMA performed better in *relative* terms, its *absolute* scores for \"Usability\" (3.67/10) and \"Documentation\" (3.56/10) are still quite low (Table 2). This suggests that even with a better memory system, the underlying base model (Llama-3.2-3b) struggles to produce documentation that is truly usable for engineers."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **On template generality:** Regarding the main weakness (manual templates), have you explored any ways to automate this? For instance, could a \"meta-prompt\" be used to generate the JSON structure for an agent (MT_n) just from its role description (R_n)?\n2. **On PDDL robustness:** Could you please clarify the PDDL benchmark results (Table 1)? Specifically, can you provide the mean and standard deviation over multiple independent runs (e.g., 5-10)? Without that, it's difficult to assess the confidence of those findings.\n3. **On token overhead:** Could you provide a more detailed breakdown of the 32% token overhead? I'm curious how much of that cost is from the extra f_memory_update call (Eq. 3) versus the cost of simply having a longer context for the main agent (L_n, Eq. 2)?\n4. **On performance bottlenecks:** Are the low absolute scores for \"Usability\" and \"Documentation\" a fundamental limitation of the Llama-3.2-3b model, or is it a limitation of the IMA framework? In other words, if you swapped in a more powerful model (like GPT-4o), would you expect those scores to jump significantly?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "sClmSdaAqE", "forum": "UbSUxAK3BI", "replyto": "UbSUxAK3BI", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17498/Reviewer_dG8t"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17498/Reviewer_dG8t"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17498/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761994029889, "cdate": 1761994029889, "tmdate": 1762927378356, "mdate": 1762927378356, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
