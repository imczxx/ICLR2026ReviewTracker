Rather than learning a policy for each task separately, unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) algorithms pretrain without reward, then leverage that pretraining to quickly obtain performant policies for complex tasks. To this end, a wide range of algorithms have been proposed to explicitly or implicitly pretrain a representation that facilitates quickly solving some class of downstream RL problems. Examples include Goal-conditioned RL (GCRL), Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL), Successor Feature learning (SF), among others. Amid these disparate objectives lies the open problem of selecting the appropriate representation for sequential decision-making in a particular domain. This paper brings a unifying perspective to all these distinct algorithmic frameworks that make use of the sequential data in some way to predict future outcomes. First, we show that these seemingly disjoint algorithms are, in fact, approximating a common intractable representation learning objective under differing assumptions. We illuminate how these methods make use of embeddings that compress equivalent states to tractably optimize the objective.

I think the definition of the two phases is not formal enough.\n\n(i) reward-free phase\n\nIt's important to clarify what are the constraints of this phase.\n- Are we allowed to take infinite samples? If so, one would argue that learning the transitions of the MDP is enough to solve whatever RL problem afterwards. \n- Does the representation need to be succinct? Perhaps the transition model is not compact enough, but it's hard to say which direction to take without a formal specification of the objective in the subsequent phase.\n\n(ii) reward-based phase\n\nThe stated objective \"improved sample efficiency, computational efficiency, and/or wall clock time, compared to the standard reward-based RL approach of learning the policy from scratch only once the reward is given\" is far from clear. Especially,\n- What does *improved* means? I guess if sample efficiency goes from $N$ without any representation to $N - 1$ with the representation, we wouldn't be satisfied with the reward-free phase.\n- What is standard RL here? Are we comparing with the theoretical lower bound or a specific RL method?\n- Sample efficiency, computational efficiency, wall clock time... this is arguably too broad to be able to say anything interesting. I would suggest to narrow the definition. Theoretical works are typically much more formal in setting the objective, e.g., Xie et al., Policy Finetuning: Bridging Sample-Efficient Offline and Online Reinforcement Learning, 2021.\n\nI concede that this characterization escaped the unsupervised RL community for a while, but I believe it is necessary to prove the premise of the paper.\n\n**(Major) Main hypothesis**\n\nThe paper is based on the following\n\n*we hypothesize that these methods [URL] learn how the distribution of future states is affected by the policy (successor measure) by treating states with similar properties as equivalent (state feature equivalence)*\n\nUnfortunately, I am skeptical that this is true. There's a sizeable literature in URL (e.g., Liu and Abbeel, Behavior From the Void: Unsupervised Active Pre-Training, 2021) in which the efficiency of the policy inference in the reward-based phase is improved by using the reward-free phase to learn a policy that collects \"good\" data. I don't see how we can prove that an implicit successor measure is learned here.\n\nMy take is that saying that this analysis \"unifies URL\" is too bold of a claim. I think it shall be formally clarified which subset of URL methods is unified here.\n\n**(Minor) The value of unification**\n\nIt is important to note that unifying various algorithms into a unique framework does not necessarily meet the standard for publication at a top ML conference. While the authors provide some discussion on how the unification will help future research (Sec. 6), I think the main points are mostly speculative.\n\n**(Minor) Formal result**\n\nOther than showing that a bunch of different methods can be understood as approximating a successor measure, it would be interesting to see whether it can be proved that any reward-free algorithm that improves the efficiency of policy inference with reward by a certain amount has to implicitly learn successor measures.

Concretely, I suggest: (i) add a small theorem/assumption block stating minimal conditions on $d$ to guarantee the successor-measure–based state equivalence via $\\phi$ and (ii) include a small sensitivity study that swaps 𝑑 with some functions like: cosine, RBF kernel,  energy score, among others, in your gridworld to show how changes the expressivity and inference-efficiency trade-off and the induced abstractions.\n\n- The paper unifies several major URL families, but influential directions such as curiosity-driven exploration, empowerment-based methods, and contrastive predictive control are not explicitly discussed.
