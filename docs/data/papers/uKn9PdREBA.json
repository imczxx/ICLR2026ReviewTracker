By casting the problem through the lens of multivariate Gaussians, \\textsc{DynaProt} estimates dynamics at two complementary scales: (1) per-residue marginal anisotropy as \n covariance matrices capturing local flexibility, and (2) joint scalar covariances encoding pairwise dynamic coupling across residues. From these dynamics outputs, \\textsc{DynaProt} achieves high accuracy in predicting residue-level flexibility (RMSF) and, remarkably, enables reasonable reconstruction of the full covariance matrix for fast ensemble generation.

A Gaussian hierarchy simplifies learning and sampling, and it can not reflect the thermodynamics of MD data. Molecular energy landscapes are multi-well with distinct basins. Gaussian models are locally valid only near a single basin (approximately harmonic vibrations) and cannot capture complex, anharmonic shapes or multimodality across multiple minima. This defect was masked in the atlas dataset. Proteins in Atlas are relatively large, so the existing MD trajectories predominantly capture local fluctuations rather than informative transitions.

Although Eq. 5 and Proposition 3.1 guarantee positive semidefiniteness, the construction in Eq. 5 lacks clear physical motivation. The marginal covariance $\\Sigma_{marginal}$ rightly emphasizes per-residue anisotropy, which is a strength. However, the coupling matrix $C$ enforces isotropic interactions—i.e., identical influence along all three spatial directions—between residues. This design oversimplifies residue–residue coupling and risks weakening key directional effects that are critical in complex biomolecular systems. Could the authors elaborate on the motivation and theoretical basis for this design choice?\n3. When constructing $C$, the use of **mean pooling** as a scalar projection to compute each $C_{ij}$ appears casual and overly simplistic for modeling residue–residue coupling.
