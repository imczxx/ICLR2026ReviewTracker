Minor Suggestion - CMDP formulation (Sec. 2.1): The paper describes the objective as “minimizing accidents while reaching the destination efficiently.” Would it not be more natural to express this as maximizing the probability of reaching the destination while constraining the probability of accidents below a threshold?

See the questions below."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Inadequate Related Work & Positioning\nThe manuscript mentions some prior work on credit assignment / return decomposition in RL, yet it fails to provide a systematic comparison of how those methods match or differ from the present work. For example, RUDDER (Arjona‑Medina et al., 2019) explicitly introduces return decomposition via contribution analysis to handle delayed rewards. The current submission should clearly locate itself relative to this: in what respects is cost‑redistribution simply a straightforward application of the same idea, and in what respects is it novel?\nSimilarly, there is a body of work on hindsight credit assignment (e.g., attributing which action or event in a trajectory caused an eventual outcome) and on temporal‑difference (TD) approaches to propagate costs or rewards backward. The manuscript mentions these only superficially, without contrasting the advantages/disadvantages of each branch (e.g., TD‑based propagation vs decomposition via sequence modeling) and then highlighting the unique benefit of the proposed approach.\nIn the safe/offline RL domain, the manuscript cites only two benchmark datasets/environments. Yet recent work on offline safe‑RL benchmarks (e.g., Liu et al., 2023)https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09303  provides broader suites across many tasks. The manuscript should discuss those works and compare how the present experimental choices relate to them. In summary: the authors need to systematically summarise the branches of prior work (reward/return redistribution, hindsight credit assignment, TD/back‑propagation of cost, offline safe RL benchmarks), contrast their approach to each (assumptions, algorithmic choices, strengths/weaknesses), and then clearly articulate the novelty of their contribution.\n\n\n2. Preliminaries Section is Too Text‑Book and Low Value\nThe manuscript devotes a large portion of the “Preliminaries” section to textbook‑level background (standard MDP/RL definitions, Bellman equations). One suggestion given the limited space available is that this section should be concise, with most of the background moved to the appendix. The main text should focus on how the present work modifies the standard setup and why those modifications matter for cost/violation signals in offline RL.\nRecommendation: shorten the background (or move it to the appendix) and allocate space to emphasise the new modeling/algorithmic choices of this paper.\n\n3. Contribution / Significance Appears Limited \nThe claimed contribution—applying return‑decomposition / credit‑assignment to sparse cost signals and then training a constrained offline policy—reads as a relatively straightforward adaptation of existing ideas rather than a fundamental advance. For a top‑tier venue, please articulate: (i) any new theoretical insights/guarantees about cost redistribution; (ii) specific modeling/algorithmic challenges unique to costs versus rewards; and (iii) empirical evidence on widely used benchmarks showing a clear advantage over prior art.\nThe manuscript should explicitly discuss how it differs from directly applying RUDDER‑style decomposition to costs. If the only difference is that prior work focused on reward assignment while this work focuses on cost assignment, it is unlikely to meet the novelty bar without further technical contributions.\n\n4. Methodological/Modeling Clarifications and Suggestions\nPer‑step cost is defined via the incremental change in predicted episodic cost between successive prefixes.  That is, $\\hat{C}(s_{0:-1})$ and $\\tilde{c}(s_{t}) = \\hat{C}(s_{0:t})-\\hat{C}(s_{0:t-1})$.\nThis attribution assumes that the change in violation probability at time $t$ is the cost for that step. While intuitive, it may under‑represent interactions among factors across time. Consider discussing or comparing with an explicit conditional model of violation risk, e.g., modeling $P(v | s_{0:t-1}, a_t)$ (where $v$ is a violation) and attributing contributions accordingly.\n\n5. Additional Limitation: Dataset Exhaustiveness\nOne important assumption underlying the proposed method is that the offline dataset is sufficiently exhaustive—that is, it covers all or most of the unsafe cases that the policy might encounter. If the dataset fails to include a wide enough range of unsafe scenarios, the cost‑redistribution model will be unable to learn accurate risk attribution, resulting in poor generalization to unseen unsafe situations. In practice, this means the method’s reliability heavily depends on the coverage breadth of the dataset; limited datasets may lead to unrecognized safety violations or over‑optimistic policy behavior."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "OkMTufNE68", "forum": "i7vS325TzM", "replyto": "i7vS325TzM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11234/Reviewer_8CQb"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11234/Reviewer_8CQb"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11234/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761968853534, "cdate": 1761968853534, "tmdate": 1762922395451, "mdate": 1762922395451, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies offline safe RL with sparse \"stop-at-first-violation\" feedback.

This seems to be closer to hard constraint RL which demands zero visitation to unsafe states. CMDP formulation in 2.1 indicates a soft constraint where a soft budget is imposed, i.e., a policy is considered safe if cost incurred is below a certain user-specified budget. This makes the paper's intended setting unclear.\n\n2. **Implicit budget contradiction**: In CMDP, budget is user specified. The paper relabels safety cost to {0, 1} but chooses budget $d$ from the offline dataset percentiles. It's unclear whether this percentile refers to the unknown ground-truth cost or the relabeled proxy, and why practitioners should set $d$ from dataset percentiles when $d$ is supposed to be implicit and unobserved / unknown. By contrast, Chirra et al. (2024) assumes budget is known while Low & Kumar (2025) infers budget from safety data. \n\n3. **State-only cost modeling**: Line 180-187 describes how dense cost is obtained in the paper. The cost predictor only depends on state sequences $\\hat C(s_{0:t})$ despite earlier $C(\\tau)$ with $\\tau$ defined as the whole state action sequences $\\tau = (s_0, a_0, ..., s_T, a_T)$. In the problem formulation (Section 2.1), the ground-truth cost is also defined as dependent on both state and actions, i.e. $c(s_t, a_t)$. This creates a mismatch between problem formulation and model.\n\n## Methodology\n\n4. **Cascading residual errors**: In Appendix A.1, it is claimed that the sum of compensation terms $\\sum_{t=0}^T \\delta_t$ maps to prediction error and is dropped from Eq6. But each $\\delta_t$ depends on the prediction for smaller subsegments. With sparse labels, the smaller subsegment has no direct supervisory ground-truth signal and thus the compensation term at each timestep could be high. Consequently, the sum of all the inferred cost may not approximate or close to the expert-provided label, challenging Eq6's equality in practice.\n\n5. **Inferred cost significance**: Return decomposition techniques don't guarantee that decomposed costs identify true causal precursors of safety events. For example, Fig 3b shows very early timesteps (close to step 0) with high cost and it's challenging to see how the initial steps near $t \\approx 0$ caused an unsafe event 300+ steps later. The redistributed cost could be highly arbitrary than truly pointing to safety-significant steps.\n\n6. **Dense or sparse redistribution**: The return decomposition techniques also don’t guarantee that the redistribution is dense. The inferred cost could still collapse to Dirac-delta-like attribution since the provided label only happens at one timestep.\n\n7. **Length bias**: The proposed framework truncates unsafe trajectories and redistributes costs to earlier steps which approximately sums to $C(\\tau)$. Since $\\sum_{t=0}^T \\tilde{c}_t$ approximates $C(\\tau)$, shorter unsafe trajectories could inflate per-step costs relative to longer ones (or the untruncated safe trajectories). It's useful to analyze this bias further.\n\n8. **Limited novelty**: The proposed method is said to be modular: it uses prior return decomposition methods to redistribute sparse cost label and uses standard constrained RL as algorithm. As written, this reads as an application of known redistribution + plug-and-play with constrained BCQ, with little new algorithmic substance. Furthermore, the return decomposition methods seem to be generally applicable to RL problems (and RL algorithm-agnostic), it's unclear why the paper positions it solely within the offline safe RL setting.\n\n9. **Computation overhead**: To query the dense cost at each timestep, it requires $T+1$ classifier calls for each trajectory. It would be helpful to discuss the scalability to long-horizon problems.\n\n## Evaluation\n\n10. **Limited baseline choices**: The evaluation doesn't seem sufficient given the choice of baselines. They are all restricted to the same BCQ method with varying knowledge of the cost. The reward-only and sparse baselines are weak baselines, since it's expected that cost redistribution would outperform those two. I'd think that an Oracle baseline that has near-complete knowledge of the safety cost and other safety cost inference baseline method should be included.\n\n11. **Puzzling choice of hazard baseline**: Hazard baseline should be described in more detail. The P_1 classifier outputs probability of a state-action appearing in unsafe trajectory. This looks highly similar to RLSF (Chirra et al., 2024). This could be a baseline on its own. It is unclear why it is mixed with an equally weighted P_2 as a hazard baseline. \n\n12. **Under-justified P_2 classifier as baseline**: P_2 classifier is not well defined. It predicts whether a state-action tuple is the unsafe event. Given the sparse labeling of such event, the classifier should be heavily biased towards classifying as safe (due to extreme class imbalance). The paper does not explain its utility or the rationale for mixing with P_1.\n\n13. **Evaluation scope**: Only two tasks are evaluated, each with custom safety criteria, e.g. (i) within critical distance threshold of other vehicles and (ii) presence in predefined hazard region. These tasks and safety definition are not the standard safe RL benchmark / metrics. Furthermore, it necessitates creation of an entirely new in-house offline dataset collected by custom collection policy. This creates new challenges in assessing the validity of the results and raises questions on whether the result is transferable to another offline dataset.\n\n14. **Uninformative noisy label ablation**: The noise model shifts the unsafe event earlier or later. Shifting unsafe event earlier would make the policy more conservative and avoid getting close to unsafe region altogether. Shifting it later would make it more adventurous. Aggregating to population level, the conservative-adventurous effect would largely cancel out. Realistic mislabeling (e.g. unsafe trajectory classified as safe and vice versa) should be tested instead.\n\n15. **Metric misalignment**: Evaluation reports violation rate without the expected cost, deviating from standard safe RL benchmarks. The budget selection procedure (using dataset percentiles) is not aligned with explicit budget, implicit budget nor hard-constraint setting. All of these create challenges in assessing the validity of results.\n\n## Reproducibility\n\n16. The paper makes use of in-house offline datasets collected by its own custom collection policies.
