This paper introduces a novel diagnostic probe—the Conditional Pivotal Reasoning Ratio (CPRR)—to reveal a fundamental characteristic of LLM reasoning dynamics. CPRR captures a phenomenon we term \"confident uncertainty\" by quantifying the model's propensity to engage in statistically surprising (high-perplexity) exploration when making high-confidence decisions.\nThrough an analysis of tens of thousands of reasoning paths from two LLMs with distinct training histories on the AIME mathematical competition dataset, we identify a robust pattern: on problems the models find difficult, successful reasoning paths exhibit significantly higher CPRR during the crucial initial planning phase than do failing paths. This \"peak in thinking\" is absent in simpler problems. The existence of this quantifiable probabilistic \"signature\" reveals that effective reasoning begins with a more intense initial exploration. We further substantiate through qualitative analysis that the high-frequency tokens identified by CPRR semantically constitute a \"cognitive toolkit\" for solving difficult problems.\nThis research provides a new analytical dimension for understanding how LLMs \"think,\" shifting the focus of inquiry from the static correctness of final answers to an analysis of the dynamic, and at times noisy, reasoning process itself.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Chain-of-Thought Reasoning", "Interpretability", "Uncertainty Quantification"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fa3f9dd14838ee954f09517b692c0d94f223fc05.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a targeted diagnostic probe called the Conditional Pivotal Reasoning Ratio (CPRR), designed to capture the phenomenon where a large language model engages in high-perplexity exploration even when making high-confidence decisions.

Although it presents a clear motivation, I believe the authors must address the following issues before the paper can be considered for publication.\n\n1. The description in the Method section is too limited, and I do not understand why confidence is defined over a top-k=20 candidate set. The authors provide neither experimental justification nor explanation for this choice, which makes me seriously question the validity of the conclusions. There are also other arbitrary hyperparameter choices that are not explained, such as discarding the last 10% of tokens and filtering out tokens with perplexity greater than 100.\n2. The main claim of the paper is that a peak appears during the initial phase of reasoning. However, I do not see any clear quantitative result to support this, such as stating that a peak consistently occurs within the first x% of tokens. Moreover, the observed peak difference does not seem substantial from the results shown.\n3. The study includes only two models (Qwen3-8B and DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B) and two datasets (AIME2024 and AIME2025). There is a lack of experiments across tasks and model scales. This makes it difficult to assess the generality of the findings. Therefore, I find the claim of a \"robust pattern\" in the abstract to be overstated.\n4. It seems the paper measures token-level perplexity on the model’s own generated sequences. But the sampling strategy clearly influences which tokens are selected, which in turn affects the observed outcomes. However, the decoding configuration is fixed throughout (T=0.6, top-p=0.95, top-k=20), and no sensitivity analysis is conducted on sampling strategies.\n5. My biggest concern is that the paper appears to simply report an observed phenomenon (termed \"confident uncertainty\") without providing a deep analysis. While the phenomenon seems related to reasoning success or failure, the paper mainly presents correlations between different metrics without further investigation. This limits the contribution of the work.\n\nIn summary, the paper lacks sufficient experimentation and analysis, and the writing has many issues that need to be corrected.\n\nMinors:\n\n1. There are many formatting errors with quotation marks. For example, in line 17, the quotation marks around \"confident uncertainty\" are both downward facing, which is incorrect.\n2. Abbreviation usage is inconsistent. For instance, “Large Language Models (LLMs)” appears four times throughout the paper, which is unnecessary.\n3. Equation (1) lacks a period at the end, and Equation (2) is missing a comma.\n4.

Therefore, the easy problems are not genuinely simple tasks; they are the least difficult of an intrinsically complex set. So it makes it unclear if the low-CPRR mode observed on easy problems represents a true System 1 response, or just a more efficient and well-practiced System 2 path. Because all problems are inherently complex, the study likely just contrasts two modes of analytical reasoning rather than demonstrating a true switch between intuitive and analytical cognition. The comparison should be with AIME and other datasets of elementary or mid-level mathematical problems (e.g., GSM8K).\n\nIn Section 4.2, the authors report that when the number of reasoning trajectories was increased from 64 to 256, the CPRR difference between correct and incorrect paths became less pronounced. They attribute this to added noise from more \"mediocre\" or \"atypical\" reasoning paths, but instead of systematically analyzing this result, they modified their thresholds post hoc (raising the PPL and Confidence percentiles) until the thinking peak pattern reappeared.
