Transformer-based and MLP-based models have both been used effectively on many real-world TSF regression benchmarks, and there is ongoing debate as to which family of methods is best.  While these benchmarks have drawn much attention, it is also worth noting that many current datasets and methods assume approximate periodicity in the time series.  In this work, we focus on a new TSF task without periodicity: anticipating falls during humanoid locomotion, on the basis of egocentric vision and proprioception.  When the locomotion trajectories are sufficiently diverse, periodicity is violated.  We contribute two new benchmark datasets (one from simulation, one from real hardware), showing that periodicity is violated and recent deep TSF methods struggle on these benchmarks.  We also propose a novel deep learning architecture that exploits both endogenous and exogenous variables and a training process that rigorously enforces i.i.d sampling of training examples.

This fills a substantial gap in existing TSF benchmarks that focus on periodic or stationary signals. The new task of per-time-step fall prediction is of clear practical and research importance.\n\n**(S2)** The use of exogenous data. To my knowledge, the key contribution of this work is its use of the planned motion trajectory as an exogenous variable. Leveraging the known future $N+P$ steps of this plan is a fresh and powerful advance. This is a far more meaningful use of exogenous data than the field's standard (and rather weak) reliance on simple time-stamp encodings.\n\n**(S3)** Thorough experiments. The empirical work is robust. It first shows that SOTA regression models fail on this data in Tab. 1, justifying their new method. The comparison with relevant classification and domain-specific baselines shows big improvements with significant p-values in both simulated and real robot scenarios. What I appreciate the most are the multiple repetitions, standard deviations, and statistical tests (Walsh's t-tests and p-values), which are applied to support claims of significance, rather than just cherry-picked runs.\n\n**(S4)** Ablation studies and analysis. Tab. 3 and Tab. 4 provide ablation results to break down the contributions of each encoder (vision, proprioception, and trajectory) and the significance of future planned trajectories especially in simulation. Particularly, MP ablation (removing vision) reveals that the model's strength derives mainly from the proprioceptive and trajectory inputs, not the vision stream. Training overhead for added modalities is also reported for efficiency evaluation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**(W1)** This work’s core premise seems to be directly contradicted by its method. It is built on the premise of tackling aperiodic data. However, in Line 272, the Trajectory Encoder is designed specifically to exploit the \"more reliable periodicity... in a repetitive gait\" of the planned trajectories, and uses an FFT-based filter to do so. This is a direct contradiction. I recommend the authors add clarifications in the revised manuscript to address this point.\n\n**(W2)** IMHO, the comparison seems a bit unfair. The baselines were almost certainly not given access to the same powerful exogenous data (the future plan) that the EMP model uses. In other words, the MP ablation (without vision) achieves 90.40% on SimP, while the best baseline (FlowFormer) scores only 80.00%. This may suggest the 10.4% gap is not due to EMP architecture, but rather that MP has access to $N+P$ future plan and baselines do not. I look forward to the author's response on this and hope they can incorporate insightful comments into the revision.\n\n**(W3)** An unexplained \"sim-to-real\" gap exists. Key components (like the future plan and the vision encoder) are critical in simulation but are marginal or even detrimental on the real-world data. Specifically, the future plan is essential on SimP (with an 11.7% drop when removed) but irrelevant on RP (only a 0.01% drop). The explanation now (“limited diversity”) is a bit insufficient. \n\n**(W4)** The task definition is a bit ambiguous. It is unclear whether the model is truly forecasting the onset of a fall or simply learning a trivial persistence model (i.e., \"if I am already falling, I will still be falling in $P$ steps\"). In this case, it is not a forecasting task. I believe this needs further clarification.\n\n**(W5)** Several limitations in RP dataset. The RP dataset is limited in size (110 episodes) and diversity of environments and trajectories. Also, there are not enough scenarios for each environment (only three locations), which could affect the validation.\n\n**(W6)** The title of Sec. 2.3 is too general. Since it is specifically about multimodal time series forecasting, revising the title to “Multimodal TSF” would better reflect its scope and avoid confusion with general multimodal representation learning.\n\n**(W7)** Some notation issues reduce readability. (i) The symbol **M** (in Line 156, Sec. 3.2.1) and subsequent uses are overly bolded, which is a bit wired in the entire manuscript. (ii) Similarly, **V**, **K**, and **T** in Eqs. 8–10 suffer from the same issue. (iii) Some operators and function names are typeset in italics, which are commonly noted as upright (\\text{} or \\operatorname{}) to distinguish them from variables. Specifically, (e.g., “Spa()” and “TepMLP()” in Eq. 6, “Conv3D” in Eq. 9, “ConvBlk” in Eq. 10, “Perturbation” and “factor” in Eqs. 11–12)."}, "questions": {"value": "Most of my concerns and related recommendations have been stated in the Weaknesses section. I encourage the authors to focus their efforts on addressing those points, as they are critical for strengthening the manuscript in the rebuttal stage.\n\nThe following are more specific, minor questions to help the authors think more deeply about certain design choices and experiment setups, which I hope might be helpful for this and future work:\n\n**(Q1)** Given that ablation shows unimodal MP often matches or outperforms the multimodal EMP (especially for certain $P$ values on RP), what regularization strategies were attempted, if any, to stabilize multimodal learning? What insights can the authors offer about the situations/environments where fusion of vision actually delivers benefit?\n\n**(Q2)** Would EMP's architecture (vision + proprioception + exogenous planning) port well to different domains, or is the value mainly restricted to robotic forecast settings where planned forward trajectories are known and the main source of exogenous data?\n\n**(Q3)** Have variants where DCT/iDCT is replaced with learned temporal filters like Conv kernels been tried? How significant is the DCT feature transformation compared to other modeling components?\n\n---\n\n## Justifications:\n\nThe main idea of this paper is fresh and strong. The new datasets and the focus on exogenous future plans are great advances, and the authors have clearly identified a valuable problem. More importantly, I can catch the soundness of the experiments and analysis.\n\nHowever, several concerns exist as listed in Weaknesses. The model uses future trajectory plans as input, while baselines appear not to. The difference in performance is probably due to unequal information, not better design. Additional concerns include the contradiction between the aperiodic framing and the method’s reliance on periodic gait, the sim-to-real gap, and whether the task truly involves forecasting or label persistence.\n\nTherefore, I cannot recommend acceptance at this stage and give a rating of 4. I would be glad to raise my rating if thoughtful responses and improvements are provided in the rebuttal stage. I am also open to follow-up discussions with the authors to help further strengthen this work.\n\nI hope these comments help my fellow reviewers and ACs understand the basis of my recommendation."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "fkMkMWBCKW", "forum": "IXIIscKdbm", "replyto": "IXIIscKdbm", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3190/Reviewer_uCay"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3190/Reviewer_uCay"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3190/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761569991597, "cdate": 1761569991597, "tmdate": 1762916589834, "mdate": 1762916589834, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focuses on the task of predicting time series that lack periodicity.
