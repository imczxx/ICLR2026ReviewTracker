However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success rates, many responses classified as ``successful'' are actually benign, vague, or unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off: highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those overly OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content. By contrast, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade filters and trigger dangerous outputs. Building on this insight, we present a recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD). The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful outputs, and fewer refusals.

Over-reliance on specific decomposition models without alternative mechanisms: The BSD strategy is highly dependent on Qwen2.5-7B for sub-task decomposition. When this model fails to decompose complex or obviously malicious prompts effectively, the entire jailbreak process breaks down. The paper does not propose alternative decomposition models or adaptive adjustment mechanisms to address this single-point failure risk, which affects the robustness of the strategy.\n\n2. Insufficient validation of the role of visual cues: Although BSD integrates descriptive and distraction images, the paper only verifies the performance differences between FLUX-generated images, colored boxes, and random noise in ablation experiments. It does not quantitatively analyze how factors such as image semantic relevance to sub-tasks, visual complexity, and number of distraction images affect the jailbreak effect, making the role of visual cues in the strategy unclear.\n\n3. Limited analysis of cross-dataset generalization differences: The paper tests BSD on three datasets (HADES, MMSafetyBench, AdvBench-M) but does not deeply analyze why the strategy has significant performance differences across datasets (e.g., lower ASR on AdvBench-M due to fewer samples). It also fails to explore whether the decomposition logic of BSD needs to be adjusted for different types of malicious prompts in different datasets, limiting the understanding of the strategy's cross-scenario adaptability.\n\n4.

SBERT has known limitations in capturing subtle semantic variations—such as word order perturbations or nuanced paraphrases [R1] —which may undermine the reliability of these metrics. For instance, in Eq (2), when the short caption from MLLM is subtly but semantically altered where only minor lexical changes lead to a substantially different meaning—it is unclear whether the OI metric based on SBERT embeddings can reliably capture such distinctions.\n- Also, when measuring OI in Eq (2), a safety-aligned MLLM may generate a safe summary rather than one semantically consistent with the harmful prompt $P_0$. This naturally increases the OI score even though the divergence stems from safety alignment rather than genuine distributional novelty. Consequently, the metric may conflate the model's safety-alignment with true out-of-distribution characteristics, limiting its interpretability as an indicator of OOD intensity.\n- In Eq. (3), the formulation of the Harmfulness Score (HS) may produce misleading results. If the reference vector $h_{ref}$ ​contains uniformly high category scores while the response vector $h_r$ ​ is uniformly low, the ℓ1 ​distance term​ still increases—thereby raising the overall HS despite the response being less harmful.\n- In Eq. (4), the notation $N$ is used without a clear definition. While it appears to represent the total number of evaluated responses, this seems not explicitly stated in the manuscript.\n- In Eq. (5), the assumption that greater semantic dissimilarity among decomposed sub-tasks directly corresponds to higher OOD characteristics lacks clear justification. It is not evident that mutual dissimilarity between sub-tasks translates to genuine OOD behavior from the model’s perspective.\n- The experimental comparison is limited to two baselines (FigStep, CS-DJ), which is too narrow to support broad claims. Including a broader set of recent baselines (also with recent victim models such as GPT-5) would make the results more convincing.\n- The iterative decomposition (width) and refinement (depth) and image generation likely add significant computational overhead compared to the non-optimization methods such as FigStep.\n[R1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03747"}, "questions": {"value": "See above weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["Yes, Privacy, security and safety"]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "vKQaznYjjJ", "forum": "B3YVTwlt5C", "replyto": "B3YVTwlt5C", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7366/Reviewer_FV5b"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7366/Reviewer_FV5b"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7366/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761544471503, "cdate": 1761544471503, "tmdate": 1762919497524, "mdate": 1762919497524, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the challenge of effectively jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
