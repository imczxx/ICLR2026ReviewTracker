The primary weakness is that the comparison conflates two factors: (1) the presence of thinking/CoT and (2) RLMT vs RLHF paradigm. The paper frames the comparison as \"RLMT (with thinking) vs RLHF (without thinking),\" but this is not a correct framing. In RLHF, one can still incorporate thinking by having models generate CoT traces and then extracting only the final output for the reward model to evaluate. The current setup makes it difficult to isolate whether improvements come from thinking itself or from the specific RLMT training paradigm. A more appropriate comparison would be: (a) RLHF with thinking vs RLHF without thinking, and (b) RLMT with thinking vs RLHF with thinking.\n2. The paper is primarily empirical and does not have much novel research value (for example, an industry lab can quickly get such insights by sweeping across different methods).

The key difference that the paper claimed is enabling RL to work on unverifiable domains. This is achieved through substituting a verifiable reward function in RLVR with a reward model.
