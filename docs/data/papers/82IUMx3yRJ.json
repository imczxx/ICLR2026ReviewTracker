The key theoretical contribution is to show that learning equivariant distributions can be reduced to learning related vector fields, provided the initial noise distribution is invariant. Building on this, the authors design an SE(3)^N-equivariant flow-matching framework where the equivariance of the learned distribution is guaranteed by construction. Eda parametrizes vector fields through an equivariant neural network and introduces an equivariant path construction that improves data efficiency during training.

The ablation studies show performance drops when removing the equivariant backbone or path, suggesting that equivariance helps, but this only demonstrates effectiveness, not faithful equivariant behavior. A more rigorous validation would involve explicitly applying controlled rotations to input fragments (right-multiplication in SO(3)^N), or global rotations (left-multiplication), and verifying whether the predicted poses transform accordingly. Such experiments would directly confirm that the learned flow v_X(g) satisfies the claimed equivariance relation v_{rX}(rg)=r\\,v_X(g).\n\n- The authors claim that their model achieves permutation equivariance; however, no direct experiment is provided to validate this claim. It remains unclear how the predicted poses change when the input order of point clouds is permuted.\n\n- Weak Experimental Validation. The experimental section is relatively weak and limited in scope. The first experiment focuses on pairwise registration, which does not align with the paper’s stated goal of multi-piece point cloud assembly. The comparison set is also narrow and excludes strong, widely recognized metrics commonly adopted in the pairwise registration literature and also missing many prevalent pairwise methods such as FCGF, Predator and BUFFER. The multi-piece assembly evaluation is further constrained, only 2–8 fragments on synthetic datasets, which makes it difficult to assess the method’s scalability or robustness in realistic settings. Fig. 4 further indicates limited generalization capacity, performance degrades notably on unseen fragment lengths, revealing the model’s fragility. Including results on more comprehensive datasets such as Fantastic Breaks or FRACTURA would significantly strengthen the empirical claims.\nFinally, the KITTI experiment appears loosely connected to the main task, and its relevance to point cloud assembly is not clearly justified, leaving the overall empirical validation unconvincing.\n\nOverall, the experimental validation is quite weak and does not convincingly demonstrate the real effectiveness of the proposed Equivariant Flow Matching. The experiments are limited in scope, and key claims, such as equivariance and invariance, are only indirectly supported. These issues collectively make me lean toward rejecting this paper at its current stage."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "LNff90v6oc", "forum": "82IUMx3yRJ", "replyto": "82IUMx3yRJ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18461/Reviewer_QEHc"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18461/Reviewer_QEHc"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18461/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761998448505, "cdate": 1761998448505, "tmdate": 1762928155758, "mdate": 1762928155758, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Eda, an equivariant flow-matching framework for assembling 3D point cloud fragments.
