These approaches may not ensure that selected demonstrations align optimally with LMM requirements. To bridge this gap, we introduce DemoReranker, a novel framework that fine-tunes a specialized reranker module to improve demonstration selection for LMMs. First, we assess demonstration quality by measuring its influence on model outputs. Second, our reranker incorporates a scoring head atop the CLIP embedding model, evaluating compatibility between test samples and candidate demonstrations. Third, we optimize the reranker using list-wise ranking loss while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. Extensive experiments across 7 datasets spanning 3 multi-modal tasks confirm that DemoReranker effectively enhances LMM performance in ICL by reranking demonstrations to identify the most suitable candidates.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["large vision language models", "in context learning", "visual question answering"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5324ec70bc56b569bebd0aea9ada1fe9c491cca2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "jNnTgjQH3P", "forum": "wmSEVpkAAL", "replyto": "wmSEVpkAAL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13083/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13083/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761129208388, "cdate": 1761129208388, "tmdate": 1761129208388, "mdate": 1761129208388, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
