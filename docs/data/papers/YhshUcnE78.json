Each strategy leverages different aspects of graph theory to capture both local and global uncertainties in the generated images. We demonstrate how these methods provide insights into model reliability and robustness, and present experiments on several state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models.

The paper is at times ambiguous. How is the graph constructed for diffusion models? Is it built over a single model, or over latents during denoising? Both are mentioned in the text (L.103, L.758 say v_i is a diffusion model; L.747 says diffusion timesteps).\n\n2. The related work section discusses UQ in broad diffusion contexts but omits prior work specific to T2I UQ (e.g., Towards Understanding and Quantifying Uncertainty for Text-to-Image Generation, Franchi et al.).\n\n3. The definition of architectural similarity (L.126) seems over-simplified. Different architectural components generally do not have an equal effect.\n\n4. L.138 is hard to justify as written. The term implicitly assumes a correspondence between the i-th image generated by each model. Also, L.133 mentions using the images themselves. in that case, pixel $L_2$ is a poor proxy for semantic uncertainty.\n\n5. L.148 appears problematic. The architectural term is at most 1, while FID can be much larger depending on the feature extractor. So, the expression in L.148 collapses to the architectural difference.\n\n6. L.273 seems inconsistent. The $U_{\\text{prop}}$ term depends on $U_{\\text{total}}$s (not on the $U_{\\text{prop}}$s) via the weights. A form like $U_{\\text{total}} = (1-\\gamma)U_{\\text{intrinsic}} + \\gamma W U_{\\text{total}}$ would be more consistent with the stated propagation.\n\n7.
