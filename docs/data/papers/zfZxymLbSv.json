Despite their widespread deployment, the community still lacks a mechanistic understanding of how these two modes coexist and interact *within a single model*. Without such clarity, we lack a principled understanding of how these modes operate, making it harder to reason about their behavior or guide future development. In this work, we conduct a detailed mechanistic analysis of a hybrid reasoning model’s internal dynamics. We identify why the thinking and non-thinking modes can be compatible rather than distinct subsystems. Building on this, we propose a metacognitive taxonomy showing that the thinking mode corresponds to a structured, self-corrective protocol whose intensity can be modulated along a continuous spectrum. Furthermore, we causally uncover a surprisingly localized, single-token switch that deterministically governs mode activation.\nThese findings illuminate the control mechanisms underlying hybrid reasoning, providing a foundation for the design of robust, interpretable, and adaptive cognitive systems.", "tldr": "We conduct a mechanistic analysis to uncover how hybrid reasoning modes coexist and switch in LLMs.", "keywords": ["Hybrid Reasoning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ed076af756c3fa53b36dee66456efb0daef651d8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f190b673872ba82b76c2ca955b3762453cec8a41.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper conducts a mechanistic analysis of \"hybrid reasoning\" models, which can switch between a fast, intuitive (non-thinking) mode and a slow, deliberate (thinking) mode.

The paper's core analysis of how metacognitive capacity differentiates reasoning modes is genuinely interesting and important. However, the work structurally overstates the significance of its other two main findings, which are largely unsurprising given prior knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore, the evidence provided does not yet establish a sufficiently strong causal link between the identified metacognitive protocol and the performance gains from the thinking mode. The paper needs substantial reframing to focus on its strongest contribution and to provide the necessary causal evidence to support its central claims.\n\n### **Major Comments**\n\nThe following are things that, if adequately addressed, could increase my score.\n\n1. **Refocus the Narrative and De-emphasize Unsurprising Findings.**\nThe paper should be rewritten to focus on its most valuable contribution—the analysis of metacognitive capacities. The claims of major surprisingness for the other two findings should be substantially toned down.\n\n\t- **Compatibility via Low Divergence (Section 3):** The finding that the same model weights can support both modes with >90% token agreement is not highly surprising. LLMs are known to handle multiple languages or domains within a single weight set, often with significant token-level disagreement - English vs French involves major token-level disagreement!\n\t- **Single-Token Switch (Section 5):** The existence of a localized trigger is also expected. We already know that model behavior can be controlled by a small number of tokens in a system prompt, that's how people tell it what mode to use. The discovery that a specific completion token also functions as a switch is not a given, but fairly unsurprising given this.\n2. **The Metacognitive Analysis Needs Stronger Causal Evidence.** This is by far the most interesting part of the paper, but the current evidence is correlational. The results do not meaningfully distinguish whether these metacognitive keywords are a primary driver of reasoning performance or merely a stylistic artifact. To strengthen this, I suggest:\n\n\t- **Ablation Experiment:** A crucial experiment would be to prevent the model from generating these metacognitive keywords in thinking mode (e.g., by setting their logits to -∞) and measuring the effect. How much does reasoning performance degrade towards the non-thinking baseline? How much does the token-level agreement change? This would directly test the causal importance\n\t- **Baseline Comparison:** Analyze a standard base model (e.g., Llama) prompted with a simple \"think step-by-step\" instruction. This would help distinguish between general properties of chain-of-thought text versus specific behaviors learned during hybrid-reasoning fine-tuning.\n3. **Address Methodological Confounding in Probabilistic Analysis.**\nThe analysis linking high NLL/KL divergence to specific tokens (e.g., after the <think> tag, or near keywords) is likely confounded by token entropy. Tokens at decision points or sentence starts are naturally higher-entropy, which would lead to lower log-probs from any model. To disentangle \"surprise due to mode switch\" from \"predictable uncertainty,\" I recommend presenting a scatter plot of the generating model's token entropy vs. the cross-mode KL divergence to demonstrate that the effect is non-trivial.\n\n### Minor Comments:\nThe following are unlikely to change my score, but are comments and suggestions that I hope will improve the paper.\n\n- The observation that planning keyword density decreases in the \"high\" thinking mode while other metacognitive keywords increase is surprising to me, and interesting - naively, the 3 modes should change the reasoning duration but preserve the ratios of words.

For example, with regards to Takeaway 1 (pg. 4), I would argue that having probability mass on mostly the same tokens is not a “key reason why” (l. 201) non-reasoning and reasoning modes can exist in the same architecture – it is merely a symptom of this co-existence. To truly explain *why* these two modes can coexist, the paper would need to show *why* the reasoning and non-reasoning modes share very similar token distributions. As is, I find Takeaway 1 too strong, and the results in Section 3 not very satisfying.\n\nAnother strong conclusion is when the authors find that the thinking mode of Qwen3-8B leads to outputs with a higher frequency of “metacognitive keywords”, which leads the authors to then write: “This confirms that the “thinking” process is characterized by an active protocol of self-monitoring, logical explanation, and careful consideration” (l. 286-288). I found this conclusion to be highly anthropomorphized, and does not follow from simply observing high counts of words like “Wait” or “Hold on”.\n\nIn Section 4.3, the authors also find that words like “Perhaps” or “Let’s check” tend to be followed by high-surprisal tokens under the evaluator model (if I’m understanding correctly). The authors go on to write: “This experiment not only quantifies our initial visual findings but, more importantly, directly links the linguistic-level concept of metacognitive keywords to the probabilistic-level uncertainty within the model, thus forging a complete explanatory chain.” (l. 308-310). Would a more direct test of this conclusion involve looking at the entropy after these kinds of trigger words *within* a reasoning mode, not looking at the NLL of the words under an evaluator model? I was a bit confused by how the findings in this section form a “complete explanatory chain”.\n\nThere were also key details missing from the description of the taxonomy (Section 4.2).

How were the outputs of Qwen3-8B categorized (just naive string matching)?"}, "questions": {"value": "In lines 243-246, you write: “Conversely, the thinking mode is surprised by the non-thinking mode’s tendency to jump directly into calculations or final answers.

For example, a 91.95% agreement might sound high, but it’s unclear how different that is from comparing any two models. Without a reference point, we can’t tell if this number really shows compatibility or just reflects general similarity between LLMs. Also, both metrics can be misleading because most tokens in a reasoning sequence are low-entropy and easy to predict. Prior work [1] shows that only a few \"high-entropy\" tokens actually drive the reasoning path. This means the average NLL is dominated by many predictable tokens with very low loss, making the results look more similar than they actually are. In fact, the lower Average NLL for texts generated by Reasoning models further supports this explanation, since its outputs are longer, the average is taken over more low-entropy tokens, which naturally lowers the NLL and reinforces the idea that these numbers mostly reflect token distribution bias rather than true behavioral alignment.\n\n[1] Beyond the 80/20 Rule: High-Entropy Minority Tokens Drive Effective Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning\n\nSection 4.1 – Unclear interpretation of \"surprising\" tokens: There is a fundamental issue with the analysis in Section 4.1. The paper identifies \"surprising\" tokens based on high NLL values from the evaluation model, but it’s unclear whether these tokens are also surprising for the generation model itself. I suggest comparing the NLL difference between the two models. If the effect disappears, it would mean these tokens are generally important, not specific to the difference between reasoning and non-reasoning modes.\n\n\nSection 4.2 – Issues with the taxonomy and analysis of metacognitive keywords: (1) Plots (a) and (b) in Figure 3 are misleading because reasoning models produce longer outputs, so the higher keyword counts are largely an artifact of sequence length. It would be more meaningful to report keyword ratios rather than raw counts; those two plots could be removed or replaced by normalized versions.
