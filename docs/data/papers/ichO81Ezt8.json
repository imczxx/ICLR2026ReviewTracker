We propose CocoRNA, a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for RNA inverse design. CocoRNA simplifies the design task by decomposing it into smaller sub-problems, each solved collaboratively by multiple agents. This approach reduces the complexity of the problem and improves the exploration of design policies. During training, a centralized critic uses global structural information to guide the agents, enabling them to jointly optimize their design strategies. As a result, CocoRNA learns high-quality RNA design policies that generalize effectively to unseen structures without additional training. Experiments on the Rfam dataset demonstrate that CocoRNA substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both success rate and design speed. Further experiments on other biological sequence design tasks highlight the effectiveness and broad potential of CocoRNA for complex design tasks.

I’m a bit concerned about the timeliness of the approach. Specifically, using the dot-bracket notation is a clear limitation and excludes design for pseudoknots, or other pairing schemes.\n2. When using the data from [1], why do the authors not evaluate against [1]? In the paper, it seems that libLEARNA is superior compared to Meta-LEARNA-Adapt on the task of RNA design for nested structures. Also RNAPond [2] could be an interesting competitor here. I think there are also further competitors that could be evaluated, e.g. [3,4] but it might be too much to run all these in the limited amount of time during rebuttal.\n3. One motivation in the introduction is about delayed rewards and misleading auxiliaries. However, the proposed reward formulation seems to match the formulation used in [5] quite exactly. Or am I missing something?\n4. While the authors show strong results on the Rfam dataset, the structural diversity might be rather low. A good additional benchmark could be the Eterna100 (version 2) [6] in this case. While not the best benchmark for generative approaches, I would recommend evaluations on it here, since it specifically covers corner cases of the thermodynamic model of RNAfold, which could provide further insights into CocoRNA’s performance. \n5. The authors provide visual examples on an external website. Looking at the designs, it seems that most sequences rarely contain ‘A’ nucleotides. At least there is a clear bias towards G, C, and surprisingly U. The authors should at least mention this somewhere. But I think this could also be a general limitation of the method, since the authors do not include any measure to avoid bad sequences (GC biases can strongly influence function). In the best case, a desired GC-content of the designed sequences would be included (which was e.g. done in [1] in a very simple way that seemed to work well already).\n6. In this regard, the diversity measure might also be a bit misleading since it is only based on the Hamming Distance between the designed sequences. \n7. It would also be interesting to see evaluations based on families. Using RNAfold, it is not too computationally expensive to even fold all sequences in the Rfam database and provide a family based evaluation scheme.\n\n[1] Runge, F., Franke, J., Fertmann, D., Backofen, R., & Hutter, F.

Have the authors thought about / tested different initialization methods? SAMFEO for example, uses an initialization with GC pairs and A for unpaired nucleotides if I remember correctly which itself could already solve many tasks without further predictions when using RNAfold. I would guess that this would further improve performance of CocoRNA (although it doesn’t solve the problem with GC-content during design described above).\n2. In the plots of Figure 3 (and similarly Figure 10). It seems that CocoRNA’s runtime scales quadratic with sequence length (although being much faster than the other methods). If I remember correctly, linear scaling with sequence length was one of the claims of the original LEARNA paper. Can the authors elaborate on that?\n3. While already stated above, what do the authors think about including e.g. pseudoknots in the design? Using dot-bracket notation, this would blow-up the state-space I guess? What about using matrix representations as many recent DL folding engines output L x L matrices like done in the cited work of RNAinformer? \n4.
