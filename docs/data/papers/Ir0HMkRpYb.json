Given one or more unposed RGB views of a scene plus a single style reference image, Stylos directly predicts a stylized 3D Gaussian scene in a single forward pass, without per-scene optimization or known camera intrinsics/extrinsics. Stylos explicitly separates geometry and style: geometry is inferred by a VGGT-like alternating-attention backbone, while style is injected through a Style Aggregator that applies global cross-attention from the style tokens to all content-view tokens. The paper also introduces a voxel-based 3D style loss: instead of matching style statistics (mean/variance in VGG feature space) per-frame, Stylos fuses multi-view features into a shared voxel grid and aligns those 3D features to the style distribution, which the authors argue enforces cross-view consistency and preserves geometry. Experiments on CO3D, DL3DV-10K, and Tanks and Temples report improved multi-view consistency (LPIPS/RMSE) and competitive perceptual/artistic quality (ArtScore) compared to per-scene stylization baselines such as StyleRF and StyleGS, and include ablations on cross-attention design and style loss variants."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- Practical significance.

This work is the first to achieve a stylized 3D world in a fully feedforward manner. From the early days of this field, StylizedNeRF introduced the concept of reconstructing 3D scenes using NeRF, accompanied by a conditional stylization module. While it generalized across styles, it required per-scene optimization. ARF, on the other hand, achieved superior results using a style-matching loss and a deferred backward strategy, but it was not generalized across scenes or styles. Both methods, being NeRF-based, faced limitations due to the high GPU demands during training, requiring solutions like mutual learning and deferred optimization to mitigate these challenges. Similarly, StyleRF was also restricted to per-scene optimization. \n\n   In the era of 3DGS, StylizedGS achieved impressive results in 3D stylization but remained constrained by per-scene fitting. This paper, however, marks a significant milestone by creating a stylized 3D world using a tuned foundation model like VGGT, combined with a generalized stylization module, enabling a fully feedforward pipeline. This eliminates the need for lengthy optimization processes. There is no more waiting hours to transform multi-view images into an artistic 3D world. This breakthrough paves the way for future research to focus on achieving even faster and higher-quality stylizations using similar feedforward approaches.\n\n2. The results presented in the paper are both impressive and inspiring. The examples, particularly in the supplementary video, showcase how realistic 3D scenes can be transformed into artistic styles such as cartoon, sketch, and painting. The stylization maintains consistency across views without any flickering artifacts, which is a significant achievement. Moreover, obtaining such high-quality results in a single feedforward inference is truly remarkable and highlights the potential for real-time applications in this domain."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The most significant contribution of this work is the introduction of a feedforward 3D stylization model, whose core advantages lie in faster inference and reduced memory usage. However, these critical metrics are not evaluated in the experiments. The paper should include a comparison of stylization time across prior works, from the earliest StylizedNeRF, ARF, and StyleRF to the more recent StyleGaussian and StylizedGaussian. For methods requiring per-scene fitting, the stylization time should account for both training and rendering times. Such comparisons would provide readers with a clearer perspective on how this work advances the field in terms of efficiency and practicality.\n\n2. The comparison between NeRF-based and Gaussian-based stylization approaches is not adequately addressed. While StyleRF focuses on zero-shot stylization, its stylization quality is not the strongest. A detailed comparison with stylization examples from StylizedNeRF and similar NeRF-based methods is essential to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach. Moreover, StylizedGS, which outperforms StyleGS, should be included as the representative Gaussian-based stylization method in the comparisons. Incorporating these comparisons would strengthen the paper by demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over both NeRF-based and Gaussian-based approaches."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **Include Inference Speed Comparisons**:  \n   Adding a comparison of inference speed would highlight the advantages of the proposed method and make the paper more compelling.
