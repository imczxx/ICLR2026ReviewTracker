Although neural operators, especially the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have significantly improved computational efficiency, they often fail to effectively capture intricate correlations inherent in coupled physical processes. To address this limitation, we introduce COMPOL, a novel coupled multi-physics operator learning framework. COMPOL extends conventional operator architectures by incorporating sophisticated recurrent and attention-based aggregation mechanisms, effectively modeling interdependencies among interacting physical processes within latent feature spaces. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates into various neural operator frameworks that involve latent space transformations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks—including biological reaction-diffusion systems, pattern-forming chemical reactions, multiphase geological flows, and thermo-hydro-mechanical processes — demonstrate that COMPOL consistently achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "tldr": "A versatile multi-physics operator learning framwork", "keywords": ["operator learning", "physical simulations", "coupled and multi-physics simulations"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/786ba3fc88eeb538ba6f9fce819f955aa4e43702.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces COMPOL, a neural operator framework aimed at modeling coupled multi-physics PDE systems.

Clarity and Writing Quality  \n    - The paper is difficult to follow, especially in Section 3.2–3.3.

Lack of Conceptual Novelty\n     - Despite being described as a new framework, COMPOL is largely built upon FNO, with some modifications—essentially adding a latent GRU or attention module between  FNO layers.  \n     - The claimed unified or architecture-agnostic nature is not demonstrated; all experiments are conducted with FNO backbones only.  \n\n3.  Insufficient Benchmarking\n       - Despite the availability of public multi-physics benchmarks(*PDEArena*, *PDEBench*, *the Well dataset*), the authors rely solely on custom datasets.  \n       - Stronger recent baselines such as DPOT, MPP, PDE-Transformer, and CViT are not included.  \n       - The main baselines (FNO, UFNO, Transolver, DeepONet) are either outdated or adapted in ways that may not reflect their best performance.  \n\n4.  Theoretical Part is Superficial  \n       - The so-called “proofs” of universal approximation, convergence, and stability are directly adapted from existing neural operator theorems (Kovachki et al., 2023) and do not depend on the new aggregation mechanism.

It seems to me that the problem setup is simply multi-channel input, multi-channel output. Furthermore, when the authors make a distinction between multi-physics and multi-channel operator learning, I do not buy it. I believe that framing the contribution as neural operators for coupled multi-variable PDEs would be somewhat more honest.\n\n- A major concern is that the paper tries to appear more theory-grounded and rigorous than it really is. I would suggest moving the theoretical claims to the supplementary material altogether and using the space for clearer notation definitions and detailed framework descriptions. My issues with the current framing are as follows:\n  - Theorem A.1 (Universal Approximation) just cites existing universal approximation results for NOs. I do not see how COMPOL is theoretically grounded in the theorem.\n  - Theorem A.2 (Convergence via Fixed-Point) is fundamentally misapplied. The theorem claims COMPOL's layer-wise updates \"converge to a unique fixed point\" via the Banach fixed-point theorem. However, COMPOL is a finite-depth feedforward network (with 4 layers), not an iterative procedure. By this logic, any deep network would have convergence guarantees, but that is not the case. The Banach fixed-point theorem applies to iterative methods (optimization, equilibrium models), not finite forward passes.\n  - Theorem A.3 (Stability) holds, but it just states that a composition of Lipschitz functions is Lipschitz. I am not sure if that makes COMPOL any more rigorous.\n\n- The experimental setup in Section 5.1 is questionable for three reasons.\n  - First, there are the datasets themselves. Despite the field having multiple benchmarks for the specific \"multi-physics\" setup that were used in other papers, the authors generate all the data themselves and do not use any established benchmarks. This is problematic for both the authors (it is hard to validate proper implementation for a baseline without a ground truth reference) and readers (it is not clear whether those datasets provide meaningful evidence). I strongly suggest the authors use at least one dataset that was previously used by other methods (e.g., CMWNO) or an established benchmark (such as Multiphysics Bench [1]). That would provide a standardized benchmark with established results and make their experimental claims much stronger, in my opinion.\n  - Second, COMPOL uses a stack of neural operators, while other models do not. Hence, it has M times more parameters, which is likely a major reason behind the large performance gap. When the parameter count is matched, the gap shrinks (Table 5.2), although it still remains significant. I would suggest that the authors clarify the parameter count in Table 1, and if it is significantly different across models, redo the experiments matching the models' capacity.\n  - Third, CMWNO, the only baseline actually designed for coupled PDEs, is barely tested and performs suspiciously poorly. In the CMWNO paper, Table 1, the authors compare against FNO on the Gray–Scott benchmark and perform significantly better. Furthermore, I do not see why the result on Gray–Scott is not reported in this paper. On a similar note, CMWNO is originally benchmarked on the Belousov–Zhabotinsky dataset, where it performs significantly better than FNO, while in this paper, FNO outperforms it significantly. Where does the discrepancy come from? I suggest that the authors conduct their experiments on the same dataset as in the CMWNO paper, given that data generation is provided for a fair comparison. I have a strong suspicion right now that there is a bug in the implementation the authors use, which, again, using an original dataset from the CMWNO paper would help to clarify.\n\n- I find the presentation imprecise and confusing. \n   - For example, in Section 3.3: \"V_l = {{v^m_j}^M_{m=1}}^l_{j=0}\" suggests aggregating over ALL previous layers explicitly, but GRU only sees the current layer and previous hidden state. \n    - It is not clear how the aggregation happens. Is it per spatial point? If so, it would feel like modern CNNs that have depthwise/pointwise convolution separation, which is actually nice.\n    - How is z_l \"fed back\" to the FNO layers -- through concatenation, addition, or something else?\n    - \"Recurrent aggregation\" implies temporal recurrence, but it's layer-wise aggregation, so it feels more like a fancier way of implementing residual connections. Wouldn't the latter work just as well?\n\n- The language used across the paper is somewhat ambiguous and imprecise. For example, words like \"sophisticated\" or \"intricate\" -- I do not think they fit scientific language. I suggest polishing the manuscript to eliminate such words.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17575"}, "questions": {"value": "The main limitation for me is the experimental setup.
