With the advent of large language models (LLMs), we advocate a shift *from vectors to text*: representing users and items as *textual profiles* and aligning them in a shared semantic space. Textual profiles are directly compatible with LLMs and offer interpretability for downstream agentic systems.  A key challenge, however, is that the optimal profile format is unknown, and handcrafted templates often misalign with task objectives. We propose **Duet**, a framework for *joint exploration of user–item profile generation in text*. The framework operates in three stages.  First, raw histories and metadata are distilled into simple *cues* that capture minimal but informative signals. Second, during a single sequence-to-sequence inference pass, these cues are expanded into richer prompts and then into textual profiles, allowing for the exploration of multiple formats rather than a single creation. Finally, profiles are optimized jointly via reinforcement learning, where downstream recommendation performance provides feedback to refine and align them. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that **Duet** outperforms strong baselines, validating the effectiveness of joint textual profile alignment and the utility of prompt-driven exploration.

The central problem it addresses is that the optimal format for these textual profiles is unknown, and handcrafting templates is often ineffective and misaligned with the final recommendation task.\n\nThree stages are needed:\n\n1. A Large Language Model (LLM) first distills raw user histories and item metadata into concise, informative textual \"cues\" that act as starting points for profile generation\n2. In a single sequence-to-sequence pass, the framework expands these minimal cues into richer, more descriptive textual profiles. This unique step allows the model to explore various potential profile formats rather than being restricted to a single, predefined structure.\n3. the generated user and item profiles are then optimized together using reinforcement learning. \n\nKey contributions:\n\n* a new paradigm for RS. moving from latent vectors to align users and items using natural language profiles in a shared semantic space.

I am not quite familiar with a comprehensive understanding of existing work though. To me, this joint modeling seems novel.\n\n* The proposed three-stage DUET framework is a novel combination of techniques. The concept of \"self-prompt construction\" to allow the LLM to autonomously explore and discover optimal profile formats—rather than relying on rigid, handcrafted templates—is a particularly creative and original mechanism\n\n* The use of RL to create a closed-loop system where downstream recommendation performance directly provides the reward signal for refining profiles is an elegant and powerful idea.

While this is a valid approach, modern recommendation systems are fundamentally ranking problems. The current evaluation does not assess how well the generated profiles perform in a more realistic scenario of ranking a large set of candidate items. Actionable Insight: The work would be significantly strengthened by including experiments on a re-ranking or full candidate retrieval task, using standard ranking metrics like nDCG, MAP, and Recall@K. This would provide more direct evidence of the profiles' effectiveness in a real-world setting.\n\n* as the author already pointed out, the computational need would be super high.\n\n* The use of RL (specifically GRPO) is central to the framework's success, but RL for LLMs can be notoriously unstable and sensitive to hyperparameter choices. The paper does not discuss the stability of the training process or the sensitivity to RL-specific hyperparameters. The paper would be more robust if it included an analysis of the RL training dynamics. For instance, showing the learning curves for reward and providing details on hyperparameter tuning would increase confidence in the method's reproducibility and stability. Comparing GRPO to another common policy optimization algorithm (like PPO) could also demonstrate that the gains are from the framework itself and not just the choice of a specific, state-of-the-art RL algorithm.\n\n* Certain aspects of the methodology, particularly the novel components, could benefit from more detailed explanation.\ne.g.,  The initial \"cue-based initialization\" stage is described at a high level. The prompt guiding the LLM to extract cues is quite broad (e.g., \"Keep the description concise and avoid full sentences\"). The quality and nature of these initial cues seem critical to the success of the subsequent stages, yet this is not analyzed.  The paper could be improved by adding a qualitative analysis of the generated cues. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis showing how the final profile quality is affected by variations or perturbations in the initial cues would provide a better understanding of the method's robustness."}, "questions": {"value": "* Is the success of the joint optimization stage fundamentally tied to GPRO, or is the framework general enough to work with other policy optimization methods like PPO? A response here would help clarify whether the core contribution is the closed-loop framework itself or the application of a specific state-of-the-art RL algorithm.\n\n* The case study in Figure 4 provides a strong example of success. However, could you discuss potential failure modes of DUET? For instance, how does the framework handle users with very sparse histories, or users whose historical interactions contain conflicting or rapidly changing preferences? Understanding these limitations would provide a more complete picture of the framework's applicability.\n\n* The paper motivates its work by stating that textual profiles establish a foundation for \"future agentic recommendation systems\". This is a very compelling vision. Could you please elaborate on what a downstream agentic system powered by DUET profiles might look like?

While the motivation and empirical results are promising, the paper does not clearly articulate how the generated user and item profiles concretely advance the recommendation task. A more detailed analysis is needed to explain why these profiles lead to improved predictions, e.g., case studies, ablation experiments on specific prompt designs, or comparisons between profiles generated by DUET and those from baselines to highlight the unique advantages of the proposed approach.\n\n2. The proposed cue-based mechanism for profile generation is conceptually interesting but not fully convincing. Since cues are often short phrases containing limited information, the resulting profiles may not faithfully reflect the true user preferences. For example, users sharing a similar cue might still have distinct underlying interests. The paper would benefit from a more in-depth discussion or empirical validation showing how DUET mitigates this issue and ensures that generated profiles remain representative and reliable.\n\n3. It remains unclear why the paper focuses exclusively on the rating prediction task rather than ranking-based evaluation, which is typically more aligned with the goals of recommender systems: identifying and retrieving relevant items for users. Prior work (e.g., [a]) has highlighted the limitations of rating prediction for assessing recommender effectiveness. Furthermore, many of the chosen baselines were originally designed for ranking tasks, which makes the comparison less meaningful in the current setup. Including ranking-based evaluations would substantially strengthen the empirical validation and demonstrate the broader applicability of DUET.\n\n[a] Cremonesi, P., Koren, Y., & Turrin, R.
