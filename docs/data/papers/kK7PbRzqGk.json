We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how an IBG can efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma: for any chosen accuracy, every graph can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on that accuracy. This improves over prior versions of the lemma, where the rank depended on the number of nodes for sparse graphs. Our method allows for efficient approximation of large graphs that are both directed and sparse, a crucial capability for many real-world applications. We then introduce a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.", "tldr": "We introduce a low-rank graph factorization, leading to an architecture with time and space complexity linear in the number of nodes.", "keywords": ["regularity lemma", "graphon", "graph condensation", "directed graphs"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e808c6859b23f40e87d5b99af75591a6e6536a88.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper works with graph approximations roughly based on the stochastic block model, i.e. approximating the adjacency matrix of the original graph as the sum of multiple blocks, i.e. bipartite subgraphs where all source nodes are connected to all target nodes.\nIn contrast to previous work where the number of blocks needed to achieve a given approximation quality depends on the sparsity of the graph, the paper guarantees this depending only on the approximation quality itself.\nThey also showed that good enough approximations can practically be found in reasonable time and thus a GNN based on the approximation is able to run in time depending only on the number of nodes (and blocks) instead of linear in the number of edges compared to message passing. \nThe implemented GNN achieves very good performance over a number of tasks on relatively large graphs."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "- a much improved regularity lemma and corresponding metric that greatly improves over the predecessor architecture\n - a fast enough algorithm to compute the graph approximation\n - complemented by a GNN building on the graph approximation achieving SOTA performance on a variety of datasets\n - there is a vast and clean appendix explaining all the details of the paper and sufficient background.\n - The paper is easy to read for a theory paper"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Overall, the paper is very easy to read (especially for a theory paper). I only have a few smaller remarks:\n\n- It could be more clear whether the representation in terms of blocks for IBG and ICG is actually the same. If there is a discussion about it in the paper, I missed it and glancing over the ICG paper the difference is not immediately clear. (As, following this question is the exact role of $\\textbf{b}$ in the definition of $\\textbf P$, as this seems to be the main modification). The description in the appendix could also include pointers to how exactly the differences show themselves in the definitions.\n- mapping the statement of Thm 4.1 to the claims about the contributions roughly works, but a 2-line explaination below would have been nice as well. But I guess due to space, this won't be possible.\n- in 163 in the definition of the weighted cut: what does the i,j in the normalization factor range over? Is it all of Q or just U,V? (potentially use different indices within and outside of the max to make the difference more clear, given that its indeed ranging over all of Q)\n- the workings of the IBG NN compared to a MPGNN is not clear (344ff). Is it doing something else than running a plain directed GNN on the approximated graph, taking into account the low-rank decomposition to make it fast? Or does the model behave differently? This is also relevant for the context in which the \"simple and efficient operations\" in 411 are to be understood.\n\nMinor:  \n- would it be possible to add references to the sources of each line in table 1? This would also make it clear which of the computations are new. (I know that it is described in the text later on, but simple hyperlinks could help as well and in the text)\n\nTypos:  \n248: soft indicator model -> soft affilitation model?  \n444: kipf and welling -> citep  \n461: performance"}, "questions": {"value": "see weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "wiM7bEpM3t", "forum": "kK7PbRzqGk", "replyto": "kK7PbRzqGk", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11828/Reviewer_Besy"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11828/Reviewer_Besy"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11828/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761580891742, "cdate": 1761580891742, "tmdate": 1762922847605, "mdate": 1762922847605, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes **Intersecting Block Graphs (IBGs),** low-rank directional graph representation allowing the efficient learning on large and even sparse graphs, by squeezing the adjacency matrix into a smaller matrix regarding communities.

Explicitly encouraging density is counterintuitive to me, since it is usually natural to think that in real world graphs, many edges are consequences of other edges. This makes the sparsification of graphs under certain principles appealing. Could you elaborate on your thoughts about this?\n3. Does the proposed IBC happen to align with some graph assumptions in real world data? Since in various real world tasks, IBC performs well with its ability to compress the graph by extracting community wise bipartite graphs. Beyond the numerical improvements, it would be very interesting and necessary to include some real world examples in those datasets explaining why condensing the graph in this way would improve performance even beyond the original one, for both heterophilic (I think the performance is very good) and homophilic graphs."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
