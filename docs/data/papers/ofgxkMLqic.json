Even approaches incorporating advanced training techniques have failed to yield meaningful performance improvements. We hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide verified annotations, while large language models~(LLMs) perform automatic curation based on human guidance. Based on this preference mixture, we train simple Bradley-Terry reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B parameters on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference pairs from the 40M pool. We demonstrate that the resulting reward models are versatile across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and best-of-N scaling. These reward models achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven major reward model benchmarks, outperform the latest paradigm of generative reward models, and demonstrate strong downstream performance. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation. Our approach represents substantial progress in open reward models, revealing the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher data quality.", "tldr": "Through a human-AI synergistic curation pipeline, we curate a high-quality, large-scale preference data mixture of 40 million preference pairs, enabling state-of-the-art reward models on seven major reward model benchmarks.", "keywords": ["preference data", "reward modeling", "data curation", "data annotation"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/01bdeb9e05ce592bf238918f1a39d1d12aeb58ec.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces SynergyPref-40M, a preference dataset of 40M pairs (with 26M curated) and a two-stage human–AI curation pipeline for training Bradley–Terry reward models (0.6B–8B params).

The authors have clearly performed a massive amount of work, but the execution is not explained clearly, hindering reproducibility and full comprehension. Many terms are used without definition, and no single subsection seems to provide all the necessary details.\n\na. Ambiguity in Stage 1 Data Curation:\n\nInitial Data: The method for annotating the initial $y_w > y_l$ pairs is not described in the main paper. (The reviewer guesses this might be in Appendix E.1, but it must be stated).\n\nHuman vs. LLM Verification: Line 191 states human annotators follow protocols, but Line 198 mentions an \"LLM-verified\" portion. It is unclear how this LLM verification is performed. Is it the same as the “Preference-aware labeling”?\n\nMissing Examples: The paper provides no example of the \"LLM-generated preference attributes $a$\" (Line 184) or the full 5-tuple. An example and an analysis of the quality of these attributes are needed.\n\nRetrieval Step: In Step 2 (Line 208), it's unclear what data is used for for the retrieval to calculate the similarity. Is it from $D_{gold}$?. This makes Line 215 confusing: how do \"retrieved examples\" from $D_{un}$ come with \"human labels\"?\n\nLine 191, it is said that human annotators perform verification following the protocols. How is the LLM-verified portion at line 198 annotated? Is it annotated by LLM using the designed protocols as described in Appendix E.3?\n\nLLM Annotation Process: The \"preference-aware\" labeling (Lines 239-243) is opaque. The paper must specify which LLMs were used for annotation and provide the prompts. Without the prompt, this core step is irreproducible.\n\nb. Ambiguity in Stage 2 Data Curation:\n\nData Sources: The origins of $D_{un}$ and $D_{wild}$ are never explained.\n\n\"Best Reward Model\": The paper repeatedly refers to \"the best reward model\" used for filtering in Stage 2, but it is not specified which model this is.\n\nFinal Data Composition: It appears that in Stage 2, all pairs with $p>0.5$ are discarded, and all pairs with $p≤0.5$ are re-annotated by an LLM. This critical detail needs confirmation, as it would imply all data in the final dataset is LLM-annotated.\n\nc. Omissions for Ablations:\n\nFigure 6: The ablation on filtering/correction is confusing. It's unclear how these steps are performed during \"iter1-8\" or what the exact training set is. Stage 1 does not involve filtering $D_{wild}$ and correction.\n\nFigure 7: This figure shows five bars, but the text (Line 416) provides only four descriptions. The descriptions are not clear. What is “LLM curation only” and what is “both human and LLM curation”? Does (4) use more data? The exact training set for each of the five bars must be specified.\n\nd. Omissions in Figures and Tables:\n\nFigure 1 (Right): The method for calculating \"correlation\" is not described.\n\nTable 3: The caption should clarify that this metric is \"accuracy on the Best-of-N split,\" not the more common \"Best-of-N accuracy.\"\n\n**Ambiguity Regarding the True Source of Improvement**\n\nBecause the methodology is so poorly described, it is impossible to determine why the model works so well. The paper's core claim is that its human-AI synergistic pipeline is key, but the details suggest that \"a group of strong LLMs\" with self-consistency may be doing most of the heavy lifting. D_{silver} annotations are generated by LLMs. At Stage 2, all the data included after “Preference consistency with the best reward model” are again annotated by LLMs.\n\nMissing Baselines: The paper fails to provide the most critical baseline: what happens if you only use the LLM annotation: LLM-as-a-Judge with self-consistency? A crucial missing experiment is: (1) Use the \"best RM\" to filter out $p>0.5$ pairs, then (2) apply only LLM self-consistency annotations to the remaining data. Comparing this simple baseline to the full Skywork-Reward-V2 would clarify how much the complex, human-guided pipeline actually contributes. As an additional experiment: If you ensemble all the strong LLMs used in your annotation system to act as a single judge (similar to the GPT-4o judge in Table 1) with self-consistency, how does its performance compare to your final trained RMs?\n\nIn summary, the paper presents a complex pipeline. While the results are strong, the lack of clear explanation and proper baselines makes it impossible to validate the authors' claims about why it is strong. With all the missing details, it is contradictory to the reproducibility statement that “We have made extensive efforts to ensure the reproducibility of our work across all components of our research pipeline”."}, "questions": {"value": "Please address all the points in weakness.\n\nFigure 1 (Left): This chart is not fully convincing because model sizes are omitted.
