Data Augmentation offers a solution; however traditional methods often disrupt the structural and functional properties of biological sequences. Furthermore, current GLMs struggle to capture evolutionary dynamics through standard data pipelines, limiting their understanding of nucleotide-wise importance and constraints. \nTo address this, we present PhyloAug, a structure-aware, evolution-inspired augmentation method grounded in neutral theory. PhyloAug leverages Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) to accurately perturb RNA sequences, guided by phylogenetic analysis via PAML to identify evolutionarily neutral site-wise positions where mutations are unlikely to affect function. These sites are concatenated with RNA secondary structures, ensuring that augmentations respect native structural constraints while embedding signals of neutral evolution. We further validate our method through a direct comparison of predicted neutral sites with Rfam-annotated conserved regions.\nWe demonstrate that by enriching training data with these evolution-guided augmentations, PhyloAug improves GFMs on well-established RNA benchmark tasks, and further enables GFMs to internalise conserved sequence patterns and evolutionary constraints. We demonstrate this through by establishing a novel task requiring evolutionary reasoning, conserved site detection. PhyloAug demonstrates significant performance improvements of up to 12.9% MCC and 17.2% F1-Score across our key tasks.", "tldr": "A data augmentation tool to inject evolutionary information into Genomic Language Models", "keywords": ["Data Augmentation", "RNA", "Genomics", "Genomic Language Models", "Bioinformatics"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5ab0a893b3f195a9100861dc117ac1f9c66dbf0b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors proposed a new strategy for training data augmentation for genomic language models.

There are mixed uses of GLM and GFM. I suggest unifying them into one. Also, it appears this work actually only studies RNAs. The terminology could be changed to RNA LM. In general, this work should be framed as a training data augmentation strategy for training RNA LM, or gLMs focused on RNA tasks.\n\n2. How are the augmented data used to train or fine-tune the model? I find this important information to be largely missing. The authors should have provided the detailed training or fine-tuning setup for each model with the augmented data.\n\n3. The method description could be improved. For obtaining the neutral sites, there are many steps, going from MSA construction to tree construction to rate estimation. There should at least be some descriptive statistics of the data obtained at each step.\n\n4. The RNA structure and MSA were only used to select the sites for perturbation, and then the GLM OmniGenome was used to generate new data. This step is to some extent more important, but was not emphasized in the paper. This design choice should be justified by comparison with baselines, such as using other GLMs, random sampling, or sampling according to MSA.\n\n6. The evaluation is limited to a handful of simple tasks. Consider using more comprehensive and biologically meaningful benchmarks, for example, BEACON (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10391). Besides, the conserved site prediction seems trivial since the same data were used in augmentation. The authors should have made it clear if it is a held-out test set.

To accomplish this, PhyloAug performs a multiple sequence alignment on homologs obtained from the NCBI BLAST portal and then identifies sites on the original sequence that are under neutral evolution. These sites, denoted with a mask token, are selected as candidates for nucleotide permutation and are concatenated with RNA secondary structure predictions from Rfam or ViennaRNA to incorporate structural context. These two tracks are then fed into a biological sequence foundation model to predict possible nucleotides, and a top-k algorithm is used to select augmented sequences from these predictions.

The best-performing models in Section 4.3 do not consistently benefit from PhyloAug to a significant degree. Furthermore, the evaluation does not include SOTA models such as Evo2 or AIDO.RNA, which could further demonstrate the trend of modern models diminishing the need for such augmentation strategies.\n\n- The methodology for training the models in Section 4.3 is unclear, which limits the ability to assess the validity of the results. Unless I have missed it, the manuscript does not report the training procedures or hyperparameters used for each model.\n\n- There is insufficient detail in the manuscript for reproducibility. For example, it is not reported what the temperature setting is when ViennaRNA is used to predict secondary structure. This becomes important in downstream task evaluation on bpRNA or StrAlign, which contains a very diverse mixture of organisms that may require different temperature parameters for accurate RNA secondary structures. Also see the point below regarding the data-splitting strategy. What are the stds in 4.3 computed over: random data splits, or random seed during augmentation? These descriptors all affect reproducibility.\n\n- As the authors have noted, the inclusion of evolutionary information into DNA and RNA modelling is well established. As such, there should be greater clarity on the differentiation of PhyloAug from existing methods, other than a focus on ncRNA and increased empirical performance. As it stands, PhyloAug appears to be a well-executed pipeline for RNA fine-tuning suited for a bioinformatics venue, rather than a manuscript with generalizable insights for the ICLR community.\n\nMinor clarity points:\n\n- There are several writing ambiguities that cause confusion at first glance. For example, on line 330, it's not immediately clear whether \"remove the Rfam part of our pipeline\" refers to the homology filter or the structural concatenation, and it's only after reasoning through the experiment that the ambiguity is resolved.\n\n- The terminology used in the paper requires increased precision. It is incorrect to use \"Genomic Language Model\" as an umbrella term for both DNA and RNA modelling. While this is a minor point and does not contribute to my overall assessment of the paper, many passages do not make sense from a computational biology perspective. As one example, in the introduction, the line \"Prominent genomic benchmarks ... BEACON (Ren et al., 2024)\" is problematic because BEACON only contains RNA tasks, and \"genomic\" is understood to refer to DNA modelling. The current manuscript excludes comparison against actual DNA benchmarks such as the GUE, DGEB, DartEval, TraitGym, and only assesses RNA tasks. As I believe the author's intention is to focus on RNA, I suggest simply refraining from using \"genomic\" as a catch-all phrase for nucleotide sequence modelling and restricting the scope of the claims to RNA language modelling."}, "questions": {"value": "- Its hard to assess the conclusions of Section 4.3 without further details on experimental setup. How was the data splitting conducted? I'm aware bpRNA has standard splits, but it seems important to report on the rest. Given the high amount of homology, one critical concern is data leakage. Since the sequences contained in bpRNA, StrAlign, etc. likely appear in BLAST, it seems to be a distinct possibility  that the PhyloAug method is essentially reducing the search space of augmentations to those that are likely to appear in the test set via family filtering and masking. I would appreciate the authors ruling out this possibility by either describing their data splitting, or running experiments to prevent this type of leakage.\n\n- A minor claim of the paper from the introduction seems to be PhyloAug's efficiency in terms of training resources. However, from my understanding, running BLAST and MSAs takes substantial resources, and reporting the computational cost would help readers understand the practicality of this approach.\n\n- The premise of section 4.1 hinges on Rfam conservation annotations being a reliable source of ground truth. However, if these annotations are themselves derived from a predictive pipeline, the evaluation primarily reflects how closely one computational model reproduces another, rather than how well PhyloAug captures biological reality. Additional details on how the Rfam conservation annotations were generated would be helpful.\n\n- Minor suggestion, but including a few key equations, for example describing the core data flow shown in Figure 1, could be helpful for a computational audience.\n\n- An interesting ablation could be to see how using ViennaRNA predicted vs Rfam structural annotations affects the performance of PhyloAug."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "7YVArVrN8z", "forum": "dLmSOSiArL", "replyto": "dLmSOSiArL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21880/Reviewer_BxkT"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21880/Reviewer_BxkT"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21880/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761896126018, "cdate": 1761896126018, "tmdate": 1762941967670, "mdate": 1762941967670, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes PhyloAug, a data augmentation framework for non-coding RNA that addresses data scarcity and the problem of traditional augmentation methods disrupting function.
