Existing approaches often impose monotonicity constraints between the joint action value and individual action values to enable decentralized execution.\nHowever, such constraints limit the expressiveness of value factorization, restricting the range of joint action values that can be represented and hindering the learning of optimal policies. To address this, we propose Potentially Optimal Joint Actions Weighting (POW), a method that ensures optimal policy recovery where existing approximate weighting strategies may fail. POW iteratively identifies potentially optimal joint actions and assigns them higher training weights. Our approach can be seamlessly incorporated into a variety of value function factorization algorithms, and we provide a theoretical proof that this iterative weighted training guarantees recovery of the optimal policy. Experiments on matrix games, difficulty-enhanced predator-prey tasks, SMAC, SMACv2, and a highway-env intersection scenario demonstrate that our method consistently improves performance and surpasses state-of-the-art value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.", "tldr": "Recovers the optimal joint policy by iteratively recognizing potentially optimal joint actions and assigning higher weights to them.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Value function factorization", "Multi-Agent"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fdac04b91832b1b2d7f62ce9508ee896dd5f44fc.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new way to identify the optimal joint actions to weight the learning of value-decomposition methods.

Finally, the cost (in terms of computational time) of the proposed method seems a bit hidden and not sufficiently and clearly highlighted, making it difficult to actually assess the trade-off one has to make when choosing the proposed method over other ones.

But the training of both $Q_r$ and $Q^\\*$ is done simultaneously, and thus we are not guaranteed that their interplay is accurate before convergence occurred. This would probably lead to similar problems to those you highlighted for CW-QMIX and OW-QMIX (i.e., inaccuracies due to learning) no? Am I missing something here?\n\n- I struggle to understand how the additional $Q_r$ is bringing any benefit over the use of $Q^\\*$ directly to identify the optimal joint actions: at convergence, these will both represent the same action-value function, no? And $Q_r$ is indeed trained to chase the optimal unrestricted $Q^\\*$. So why adding an additional structure rather than simply restructuring $Q^\\*$ itself to be formulated as Equation (3)?\n\n- When computing $w(s,\\mathbf{a})$, how do we check if $\\mathbf{a}\\in A_r$? If we need to explicitly construct the set of recognized optimal actions $A_r$, then this may be a quite expensive operation. Such an aspect should be eventually stated clearly.\n\n- It would be good to explicitly state the loss function for training $Q^\\*$ in the paper, as currently it can only be found in Figure 1.\n\n- In Figure 2, why are the values for $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ of ResQ different between sub-figure (h) and (i)?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "XcZhCsl9Ym", "forum": "YQ1muQBDV4", "replyto": "YQ1muQBDV4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24619/Reviewer_LRKB"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24619/Reviewer_LRKB"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24619/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761221982752, "cdate": 1761221982752, "tmdate": 1762943138944, "mdate": 1762943138944, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes POW (Potentially Optimal Joint Actions Weighting), a value-decomposition method for cooperative MARL.
