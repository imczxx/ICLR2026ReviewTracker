Gradient-based attribution methods have become the most critical because of their high computational efficiency, continuity, wide applicability, and flexibility. However, current gradient-based attribution algorithms require the introduction of additional class information to interpret model decisions, which can lead to issues of information ignorance and extra information. Information ignorance can obscure important features relevant to the current model decision, while extra information introduces the incorrect identification of irrelevant features as significant. To address these issues, we propose the Label-Agnostic Attribution for Interpretability (LAAI) algorithm, which analyzes model decisions without the need for specified class information. Additionally, to more rigorously assess the potential of current attribution algorithms, we introduce a variety of new evaluation metrics, combined with the traditional Insertion \\& Deletion Scores, to comprehensively assess the performance of our algorithm.

To address this, the authors propose a novel Label-Free Attribution for Interpretability (LFAI) algorithm that generates explanations by maximizing the model's output uncertainty rather than focusing on a specific class logit. Furthermore, the paper introduces a more robust evaluation framework, including a Confusion Feature Algorithm (CFA) for creating unbiased baselines and new KL-divergence-based metrics (KL-INS/DEL).

The definitions of \"Information Ignorance\" and \"Extra Information\" are primarily illustrated through examples and feel somewhat subjective. It would strengthen the paper if the authors could propose quantitative metrics to measure the extent of these two phenomena in existing attribution methods, moving beyond the conceptual formulas provided.\n\n2. There appears to be a strong coupling between the proposed method and the proposed metric. LFAI is designed to maximize uncertainty (entropy), while the KL-INS/DEL metrics are designed to measure changes in uncertainty. Could the outstanding performance of LFAI on the KL metrics be a result of this \"self-serving\" evaluation, where the method is optimized for the very quantity the metric evaluates?\n\n3. Equation (3) for entropy appears to be missing a negative sign. The standard definition of information entropy is H(x) = -Σ P(x)log(P(x)). Maximizing entropy is equivalent to minimizing Σ P(x)log(P(x)).\n\n4. There are several minor formatting issues with citations that should be corrected for clarity and consistency.

A brief justification/discussion might help convince the reader to accept it. But most importantly, how does it theoretically help reduce II/EI? The paper would greatly benefit from a direct link between eq (5) and the mitigation of II/EI. A final _minor_ point related to the functional form: $\\frac{1}{P_j(x_t)}$ can overreact to tiny probabilities; path-integrals may also be path/baseline-dependent and subject to OOD drift if the path leaves the data manifold. Any comments on this? \n\n**MINOR POINTS**\n\n- **Method–metric alignment risk.**\nThe CFA baseline and KL-variants seem to be directly aligned with the label-free, distributional objective. That coherence is nice, but it may advantage your method by design, which should be made clear in your paper for honesty purposes. Not sure if it would be productive to report standard Insertion/Deletion (black baseline) results as well?\n\n-  **“Class-independent” wording**: the method is better described as class-agnostic or label-free (it aggregates over all classes) rather than “class-independent,” which could be misread as not using class probabilities at all.\n\n- **CFA / entropy sign**: In the CFA definition, double-check the entropy sign: maximizing uncertainty means maximizing $H(P)=-\\sum_j P_j\\log P_j$.
