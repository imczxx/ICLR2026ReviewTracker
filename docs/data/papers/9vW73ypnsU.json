(line 839), the feasible set A is not closed under the weak topology because absolute continuity is not in general preserved under weak convergence (one can consider normal distributions with decreasing standard deviations which converge weakly to delta measure, which is not absolutely continuous w. r. t. Lebesgue measure). This statement in the proof requires additional assumptions which are not listed in the theorem statement. It is recommended to formulate the statement of the theorem rigorously in the supplementary material, while in the main text a shortened version could be introduced.\n\nThe paper does not clearly show the advantage of multimarginal formulation in comparison to a sequential application of Schrödinger bridge. The experiments with gaussians and cell movements don't show specific scenarios when the proposed method is superior to sequential application of Schrödinger bridges. For example, does the proposed methods is better that sequential application of Schrödinger bridges if all marginals lie on the same Wasserstein geodesic? \n\nDespite video generation being claimed in the abstract as one of the main contributions of the paper, it is evaluated only on a single video dataset. Video-specific datasets are not considered. Moreover, the provided videos appear too similar to simple image blending, making it difficult to assess whether the method can learn coherent motion from unpaired frame data. The paper lacks an experiment on a conventional real video dataset, from which an unpaired frame dataset could be produced, allowing the quality of generated videos to be evaluated using the Fréchet Video Distance or some optical flow-based metric for motion quality estimation. \n\nThe text of the paper is poorly written and difficult to follow. It contains too many generic phases, particularly in the abstract. (for example phrases like “in an efficient and principled way” in line 064). The paper contains missed citations “it is a pure translation of each Gaussian component inside the mixtures [CITE]. After only the warm-up phase (akin to flow matching [CITE], as said before),” in line 335.\n\n​​Experiment 4.3 “Since no closed-form solution is available for the static multi-marginal SB”. There is a closed-form solution for entropic optimal transport between gaussians of any dimension for pairwise (sequential) optimal transport [1], but it wasn’t used for evaluation, as far as the reviewer understood from the paper.\n\nThe multimarginal optimal transport is a complex problem and optimal couplings may have a complex or even fractal form [2]. However it cannot typically be reduced to the pairwise costs like in line 136. This raises the question on how the proposed method behaves for different transport costs. Does it work for costs like c(x,y,z) = x y z or is it limited to cost of the form c(x,y,z) = (x-y)^{2}+(y-z)^{2} (i.e. when there is a sequential separation of costs like c(x,y,z,t,v) = f(x,y)+f(y,z)+f(z,t)+f(t,v))\n\nMethods like Action Matching [3] are also capable of reconstructing dynamics from a sequence of marginal distributions. However such methods were not considered in evaluation.\n\nGenerated videos provided in the supplementary page look like a blending between images and do not recover the cell movements as one would expect. More importantly, there are no comparisons in the supplementary with other methods for the video generation task.
