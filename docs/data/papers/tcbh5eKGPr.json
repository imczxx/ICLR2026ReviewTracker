However, two bottlenecks still limit further performance improvement: \\textit{(1) non-stationary Q-value estimation} caused by jointly injecting entropy and updating its weighting parameter, i.e., temperature; and \\textit{(2) short-sighted local entropy tuning} that adjusts temperature only according to the current single-step entropy, without considering the effect of cumulative entropy over time. In this paper, we extends maximum entropy framework by proposing a trajectory entropy-constrained reinforcement learning (TECRL) framework to address these two challenges. Within this framework, we first separately learn two Q-functions, one associated with reward and the other with entropy, ensuring clean and stable value targets unaffected by temperature updates. Then, the dedicated entropy Q-function,  explicitly quantifying the expected cumulative entropy, enables us to enforce a trajectory entropy constraint and consequently control the policy’s long-term stochasticity. Building on this TECRL framework, we develop a practical off-policy algorithm, DSAC-E, by extending the state-of-the-art distributional soft actor-critic with three refinements (DSAC-T). Empirical results on the OpenAI Gym benchmark demonstrate that our DSAC-E can achieve higher returns and better stability.", "tldr": "We introduce a new TECRL framework, which separately learns reward and entropy Q-functions and applies  trajectory entropy constraint to achieve higher returns and better stability.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/712b99f705e87b4ac68cc5a5497d675ec8ddf062.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b7decd54daf487cc3324597fc21845db2ae88e31.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Trajectory Entropy-Constrained Reinforcement Learning (TECRL), which augments maximum-entropy RL by introducing a separate entropy Q-function to estimate cumulative (trajectory-level) entropy and enforce an entropy constraint, thereby decoupling reward and entropy learning to mitigate non-stationarity from temperature updates.

The paper provides no empirical evidence (e.g., plots of target value variance) to prove that the changing alpha is a significant source of instability that actually hinders performance in SOTA methods.\n- Short-sighted local tuning: The paper claims local entropy tuning is a fundamental flaw, yet it provides no evidence that this mechanism is a primary bottleneck. The very success of SAC and DSAC-T, which use this \"flawed\" mechanism, suggests it is a highly effective and robust heuristic. The motivation feels more like a post-hoc justification for a new method rather than a response to a well-documented problem.\n\n2.
