The authors argue that low-order statistics are insufficient to characterize complex distributional structures and temporal dependencies (L72–L74). However, many prior works using such statistics still achieve competitive or even superior results (e.g. SAN, FAN, DDN [1])compared to those reported here. What accounts for this performance gap and could this paper's idea can be used to improve that low-order statistics normalization methods?\n2. The proposed method appears to be largely built upon FAN. I wonder whether the implementation also inherits FAN's known issue of potential test-set information leakage.\n3. In Table 2, DLinear uses a prediction length of 336, whereas PatchTST remains at 96. For fair comparison—especially when positioning this work as a plug-in—maintaining the original input length would be preferable.\n4. This work seems to blend elements of FAN and [2] Could the authors clarify whether there are essential design differences? While the motivation is valid, I remain concerned that distribution shifts between training and test sets are inherent and unavoidable. Excessive down-weighting of non-stationary components might remove meaningful temporal variations, as non-stationarity is a natural and persistent property rather than pure random.\n\n[1] DDN: Dual-domain dynamic normalization for non-stationary time series forecasting\n[2] Frequency-domain MLPs are More Effective Learners in Time Series Forecasting."}, "questions": {"value": "see weeknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "6O7n0carRS", "forum": "4IZzgIyD91", "replyto": "4IZzgIyD91", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23679/Reviewer_CDmr"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23679/Reviewer_CDmr"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23679/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761718584442, "cdate": 1761718584442, "tmdate": 1762942760805, "mdate": 1762942760805, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper argues that conventional normalization methods for non-stationary time series forecasting typically rely on low-order time-domain statistics, which may be insufficient to capture the intrinsic non-stationary structures of the data.
