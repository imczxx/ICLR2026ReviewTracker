While BERT has demonstrated strong performance in learning rich representations from sequential and grid-based inputs like natural language and images, its extension to non-sequential topologies remains an open research question. In this paper, we integrate BERT with genetic programming whose classic data representation is tree data structure to solve the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS) problem. The DFJSS problem's inherent computational complexity and highly dynamic, uncertain nature provide a rigorous testbed for our methodology. Our experiments demonstrate that BERT can effectively capture and integrate the structural information embedded in these tree-based representations. This finding highlights the versatility and adaptability of the self-attention mechanism, extending its utility beyond conventional sequential or grid-based data structures to a broader class of complex, non-sequential topologies.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["BERT", "Tree Data Structure", "Optimization"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d99348bbe4bb9e9f9d3e9a494836540c273faf0c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper investigates how self-attention from a Transformer model (BERT) can be used to steer GP. Individuals in GP are represented as trees and are first converted into a token sequence in prefix notation through depth-first traversal. This sequence is then passed to a BERT encoder, which computes self-attention scores for each token corresponding to a tree node. These attention scores are subsequently used to influence the genetic operators: subtrees at nodes with low attention scores are selected for mutation, while subtrees at nodes with high attention scores from other individuals are selected for crossover. During the evolutionary process, the model is trained iteratively using a pairwise ranking loss to approximate the relative fitness ranking of individuals. The approach is applied to the DFJSSP, where GP is used to generate dispatching rules, and it is compared against standard GP and a surrogate-based baseline.\nAccording to the authors, the contributions of the paper are:\n- Linearizing GP trees into token sequences using depth-first traversal (prefix/Polish notation), enabling the application of Transformer/BERT models to tree-structured GP individuals.\n- Using self-attention scores produced by the BERT encoder to guide genetic operators: subtrees with the lowest attention scores are selected for mutation, while subtrees with the highest attention scores from other individuals are selected for crossover.\n- Integrating a BERT-based surrogate model that is trained iteratively with a pairwise ranking loss to produce an estimated score for each individual, which then guides the evolutionary search instead of relying solely on true fitness evaluations."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The paper introduces a novel combination of genetic programming and Transformer-based self-attention.

There is no quantitative analysis of attention scores, and no ablation comparing attention-guided vs. random subtree selection to isolate the effect of attention.
