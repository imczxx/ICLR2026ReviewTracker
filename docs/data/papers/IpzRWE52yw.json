For instance, a web browsing agent may get lost in unfamiliar websites, uncertain what pages must be visited to achieve its goals. To address this, we propose Go-Browse, a method for automatically collecting diverse and realistic web agent data at scale through structured exploration of web environments. Go-Browse achieves efficient exploration by framing data collection as a graph search, enabling reuse of information across exploration episodes. We instantiate our method on the WebArena benchmark, collecting a dataset of 10K successful task-solving trajectories and 40K interaction steps across 100 URLs. Fine-tuning a 7B parameter language model on this dataset achieves a success rate of 21.7% on the WebArena benchmark, beating GPT-4o mini by 2.4% and exceeding current state-of-the-art results for sub-10B parameter models by 2.9%.", "tldr": "We propose Go-Browse, a method to automatically collect diverse and realistic web agent data at scale through structured exploration in web environments.", "keywords": ["LLM Agents", "Web Agents", "Synthetic Data", "Exploration"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2daca371c822389766bd7d38a1e8a0d1b7f0cdb4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ae753999cbbf32e5d742e25bb8f7977ed5c785fe.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Go-Browse, a structured exploration framework for collecting high-quality interaction data for web agents.

Therefore, generalization capability is crucial for web agents. However, the current paper’s analysis primarily focuses on in-domain performance, with insufficient analysis on OOD (Mind2Web) settings. It would be valuable to add additional results and analysis on OOD setups, such as (1) direct comparison with the baseline model and other methods, and (2) success and failure case analysis based on the similarity between in-domain training websites and OOD test websites\n\n- Limited applicability of the proposed algorithm for capturing real-world web usage patterns: While the proposed graph-based algorithm improves coverage by systematically exploring web environments, it may not align well with how users interact with the web in practice. Specifically, the framework assumes a navigation-first, leaf-level task completion structure, where the agent traverses through a hierarchy of pages before executing an action. However, many realistic tasks (e.g., flight booking) require frequent alternation between navigation and value input across multiple intermediate pages. This discrepancy reflects a deeper human–agent misalignment, as the method prioritizes coverage over modeling the natural, goal-driven behavior of real users, potentially limiting its ability to capture the tasks that matter most in real-world web interactions.\n\n- Lack of Analysis and Justification for VLM as a Judge:\nThe FeasibilityChecker component and the dataset filtering process seem to heavily rely on VLM as a judge, yet there is no analysis provided (e.g., robustness or correlation with human judges). Moreover, since the VLM judge evaluates success or failure based on screenshots, a justification is needed for whether this observation-based environment allows for accurate evaluations."}, "questions": {"value": "See the weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "81tzJQdQ9y", "forum": "IpzRWE52yw", "replyto": "IpzRWE52yw", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14516/Reviewer_Hdmj"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14516/Reviewer_Hdmj"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14516/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761695083949, "cdate": 1761695083949, "tmdate": 1762924912260, "mdate": 1762924912260, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Achieving effective exploration of web navigation agents can be challenging with existing approaches for the following reasons. Instruction-first approaches, which generate tasks (or task instructions) first and then navigate the web to solve it, are dependent on and limited by the prior information and knowledge about those web pages. On the other hand, interaction-first approaches, which navigate the web pages first and then post-process the collected trajectories, may be inefficient and less cost-effective. This work proposes a hybrid approch named Go-Browse. The authors view web navigation as expanding the graph of visited web pages and combine two types of explorations: global (outer loop) and local (inner loop) explorations. Local explorations are in-page explorations that happen in \"frontier\" nodes in the graph. With the use of vision-language models as judges, the tasks are used to gather trajectories and filtered. For scaling of the trajectory dataset, the authors perform additional sampling of trajectories on the filtered tasks by employing cheaper models to solve the tasks from the current web page (prefixed) or initial web page (unprefixed). Using the trajectory data collected in the WebArena environment, the authors fine-tune Qwen 2.5 7B and compare it with the baselines on Online-Mind2Web and WebArena to show the improved empirical performance."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Also, there are many statistics and analyses included, which can suggest insights about the empirical results from different angles. Additionally, the authors also care about reproducibility.

Scalability of the proposed exploration approach  \nThe authors use WebArena as the testbed for their exploration algorithm. However, the WebArena environment consists of concept/mockup websites and is limited in multiple aspects compared to real-world websites. Regardless of the number of unique web pages it provides, the structure of its websites and thus the possible patterns of navigation may not be diverse enough to test the scalability of the proposed approach. This is especially important, as exploration is more helpful and needed when there is more complexity in the environment.\n\n2. Insufficient set of baselines  \nThe authors compare the proposed method (Go-Browse) primarily with NNetNav, an interaction-first exploration method. On the other hand, while the authors mention instruction-first approaches as a relevant line of research, they do not perform an empirical comparison with such methods. Adding comparison with more baselines could make the submission stronger.\n\n3. Comparison with NNetNav  \nWhile NNetNav is the only exploration approach that is being compared with Go-Browse, it does not look like an apples-to-apples comparison to me. There are some components that are reasonably fair for both: the same base model (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), data from the same WebArena environment, and comparable numbers of samples (around 39k steps for Go-Browse and around 45k steps for NNetNav). However, I am concerned about other components. Importantly, the authors make use of Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o for different purposes. Figure 3 also states that the trajectory data from Claude Sonnet 3.7 constitute 33.9% of the final (successful) trajectory data. On the other hand, for NNetNav, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct was used. Therefore, the strength of the employed models could have meaningfully contributed to the current success rate wins vs. NNetNav on WebArena (2.9%) and Online-Mind2Web (1.33%)."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
