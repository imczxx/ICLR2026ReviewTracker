However, as shown in previous research, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the small set of calibration data used for estimating parameter importance. Current calibration data selection relies on simple heuristics like random sampling or entropy, which often leads to suboptimal and inconsistent pruning outcomes: the same pruning method applied with different calibration data can cause up to 3× variance in post-pruning perplexity. In this work, we reveal the source of this inconsistency: calibration samples are not equally important; a quality hierarchy exists within any data pool. Not only does mixing high- and low-quality data cause a performance degradation, but the quality of the sample is context-dependent, changing with the specific model and pruning algorithm, rendering static filtering infeasible and necessitating an adaptive solution. Therefore, we introduce OASIS, the first end-to-end framework that directly optimizes calibration data selection with respect to the pruned model’s downstream performance. OASIS leverages a differentiable soft-mask proxy to propagate task-level gradients back to the calibration data, enabling dynamic discovery of the most beneficial subset. Experiments show that our approach improves the performance of diverse state-of-the-art pruning methods, establishing a new standard for data-aware model compression.", "tldr": "Random calibration data sabotages pruning; OASIS adaptively learns the right subset to stabilize and improve LLM Pruning.", "keywords": ["Pruning", "Calibration Data Selection", "Large Langauge Model"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b6d227ceeed0faa1c2964871d722efc69751c8d1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper provides an analysis of the influence of individual calibration quality and proposes a soft-mask-based pruning method combined with data selection to improve pruning performance.

Additionally, the overall presentation should be improved. Although I did not read every section in detail, I noticed a significant number of writing issues throughout the paper (see the Questions section for more specific examples).\n- Beyond the writing, the contribution of this paper feels limited. The main contributions can be summarized in two parts: (1) an analysis of the influence of pruning data, and (2) the proposed OASIS method. However, the analysis largely revisits well-established findings—such as the impact of data quality and quantity—which have been studied in prior work. As for the method, it essentially builds on existing soft pruning frameworks, with a gradient-based weight for data selection. These contributions, in my view, are not substantial enough to warrant publication at ICLR.\n- The experimental section is also quite limited, particularly in terms of baseline coverage. The authors should include more direct comparisons related to the data selection component, as this is the core novelty of the paper.
