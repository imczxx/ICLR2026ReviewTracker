However, existing time-domain only diffusion models struggle to reconstruct high-frequency details due to non-uniform energy distribution in real-world time series data. To balance the reconstruction of global trends and local dynamics, we introduce \\textbf{TFD}, spectrally guided \\textbf{T}ime–\\textbf{F}requency \\textbf{D}iffusion model for time series imputation. TFD is a hybrid time-frequency diffusion framework that couples time and frequency domain diffusion processes to achieve coarse-to-fine reconstruction, and we formalize both the noise-injection and denoising procedures following the DDPM framework. In the proposed hybrid framework, the time-domain diffusion stabilizes low-frequency trends by capturing temporal dependencies, while the frequency-domain counterpart leverages band-separable spectral representations to refine high-frequency details. We further analyze the correspondence between denoising steps and spectral components. Based on this observation, we design a frequency-aware high-pass timestep embedding that serves as spectral guidance, emphasizing the relevant bands at specific steps and enabling more accurate band-wise reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TFD achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets.", "tldr": "We propose a time-frequency hybrid diffusion model and frequency-aware high-pass diffusion embedding for time series imputation task.", "keywords": ["diffusion", "time series imputation"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f55ffefbed0dab7bdcc2e5893e434a1dab66fb51.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes TFD (Time-Frequency Diffusion), a hybrid diffusion model for time series imputation that addresses the inability of time-domain-only diffusion models to reconstruct high-frequency details.

This could be validated through spectral analysis of branch outputs. (b) How do errors propagate between branches given their sequential dependency? (c) How does the frequency-aware embedding actually modulate the denoising process at different steps? (d) What happens when training data violates the low-pass assumption? Understanding model behavior is crucial for both practical application and future research directions.\n\n3.
