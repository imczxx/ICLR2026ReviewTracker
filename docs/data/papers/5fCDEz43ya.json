Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can mitigate hallucinations but require resource-intensive retrieval or large-scale fine-tuning. Decoding-based methods are lighter yet lack explicit hallucination control. To address this, we present \\textbf{Token-Guard}, a token-level hallucination control method based on self-checking decoding. Token-Guard performs internal verification at each reasoning step to detect hallucinated tokens before they propagate. Candidate fragments are further evaluated in a latent space with explicit hallucination risk scoring, while iterative pruning and regeneration dynamically correct detected errors. Experiments on HALU datasets show Token-Guard substantially reduces hallucinations and improves generation accuracy, offering a scalable, lightweight solution for reliable LLM outputs.

It targets the big problems with current decoding methods: no token-level checks, unclear hallucination risk, and weak dynamic correction. So it built a three-layer control: first check single tokens, then score segment coherence, finally adjust the reasoning chain globally.\nExperiments are solid enough. On HALU datasets (like FinanceBench, DROP), testing with Llama and Qwen models, its average F1 beats CoT, Tree-of-Thought—for example, Llama’s base model only gets 28.29, but Token-Guard hits 51.03.

Efficiency concerns: Its three-layer processing adds extra work. For long texts or tasks that need fast responses, how fast is it (like tokens per second) compared to light baselines like CoT?

For LLMs that lack key knowledge (like rare medical terms in PubMedQA), hallucinations come from missing info, not bad decoding—can Token-Guard fix that?\n4.

This suggests that the methods may not be very practical in several realistic settings. This also raises the question of how these hyperparameters can be set - for instance in Appendix G, some sets are shown, but could the authors clarify if the F1 scores shown are for the final test data, or a hold-out validation set? Furthermore, could the authors clarify if the same exact hyperparameters are used for all evaluation settings over all datasets (and plausibly models as well)? \n\n2) In Stage 2, if a segment that occurs fairly early in the generation process is detected to be modified, would the scores of every later segment necessarily change? For instance, the hidden states of segments that occur after the modified segment would need to be recomputed, since the autoregressive context available is modified as well. Could the authors kindly clarify this specific aspect, since it was not entirely clear, particularly after referencing the overall algorithm presented in Appendix C. \n\n3) While the paper clearly presents the run-time and output token overheads in Table-3, the memory overheads necessitated by TokenGuard are less clear. For instance, the token-level score relies upon the averaged hidden state upto that token, which with a running average still requires a doubling of the hidden-state memory. For the second stage segment score and third stage global iteration, this overhead appears to be potentially even higher since cosine similarities are computed over hidden representations corresponding to these segments. For instance, in Stage 3, the chain closest to each cluster centroid is retained, but the memory overhead that occurs prior to this choice is not very clear at all!\n\n\n4) In Line 259, the paper mentions the use of an external verification score E_k in order to compute the factual consistency score. Could the authors kindly clarify if an external score is actually utilized for the Stage 3 global iteration? This is an extremely pertinent aspect, since the baseline comparisons would be very different once external verification tools can be incorporated. Additional details on the computation of the sim_ctx score which quantifies semantic alignment is also needed. \n\n5) Several scoring methods introduced seem to be very poorly motivated, for instance the convex combination of the cosine similarity of hidden embeddings and the final probability of a given output token such as in Eq 5. This does not seem well principled apriori, and could be motivated further. For instance, more clarity is needed on which layer is chosen, and how this potentially influences the proposed score in practice. Prior works such as INSIDE [1] use similar components like consistency of representations, but are much more principled and well-motivated!\n\n6) For the final stage, with global iteration and corrections, could the authors clarify how many chains are used? Why not just use the original order of the segments?\n\n7) Given the correction and verification steps, comparisons with prior works such as [2], [3], [4], [5] would be highly relevant baselines to compare and contrast with. \n\n\n\n\n[1] INSIDE: Llms’ internal states retain the power of hallucination detection, Chen et al., ICLR-2024\n\n[2] SELF-REFINE: Iterative Refinement with Self-Feedback, Madaan et al., NeurIPS 2023\n\n[3] Towards Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models via Self-Reflection, EMNLP 2023\n\n[4] Generating Sequences by Learning to Self-Correct, Welleck et al., ICLR 2023\n\n[5] Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique through Self-Reflection, Asai et al., ICLR 2024"}, "questions": {"value": "1) Kindly refer to the questions mentioned in the weaknesses section above.
