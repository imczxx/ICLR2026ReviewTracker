The exposition of the paper needs more work. Most of the main paper constitutes chains of lemmas/algorithms with limited interpretation or intuition. After reading the paper from start to finish I find it hard to say how the contribution was achieved, what exactly it consisted of, and how it compares to past work. On a related note, the main problems being investigated, Definition 1.2, seem to be defined for general sparse/low-rank updates, but the main algorithm seems to only consider the case where the updates are diagonal matrices.\n2. While I agree that the proposed problem is a generalization, the paper provides no intuition for what the challenge in this extended setting is. *Naively*, given that the only place where $p$ influences the problem is to what power diagonal matrices are taken to (again, Definition 1.2 seems to support non-diagonal $W$, but here I am referencing the setting in which the algorithm seems to operate), I would expect that the generalized problem is not much harder unless argued otherwise.\n2. The writing needs more work, and appears excessively inspired from past work in places. Fact 3.1 stating the Woodbury matrix identity also includes a statement about $M_{w^{new}}$ which has not yet been defined, and seemingly is never used. Looking up the arXiv version of (Cohen et al., 2021), arXiv:1810.07896, their Fact 2.1 states the Woodbury matrix identity, with the text immediately after matching the content of Fact 3.1 here, including their eq. (9) introducing $M_{w^{new}}$. Lemma 4.5 for the update time, which cites (Cohen et al., 2021) for the proof and which indeed appears to correspond to Lemma 5.4 in the arXiv version, contains the term $g_r$, which is not commented on or defined. $g_r$ comes from a potential argument in the arXiv version, eq. (20). The main result Theorem 4.1 appears like Theorem 5.1 from the arXiv version of (Cohen et al., 2021) transcribed to this setting and techniques, including the same footnote and typo “with the expectation and variance is [...]”. I do not find these issues too severe, but it is sloppy and makes the work appear derivative even if it were to be meaningfully novel.\n3. The claimed DP guarantee is not clearly expressed for the problem. From what I can tell, the algorithm provided (split up into Algorithm 1-3) does not implement DP.

Strengthening the connective explanations (especially, Sections 3, 4 and 5) and clarifying how each component contributes to the final result (Theorem 4.1) would make the paper more accessible to a broader theoretical audience. The main exposition quickly moves into formal notation, invariants, and amortized runtime arguments, offering limited high-level intuition behind the design choices or the interaction between the $\\ell_p$ formulation and projection updates. The Technical Overview in Section 5 focuses largely on stating the privacy and utility guarantees rather than conceptually motivating how the mechanism operates or why it works, and the transition from the classical $\\sqrt{W} A$ setting to the generalized $W^{1 / 2-1 / p} A$ case could be better contextualized for clarity.
