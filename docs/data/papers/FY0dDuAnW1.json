We introduce ImmunoGraph, a practical pipeline that addresses both challenges by combining antigen-aware, near-subquadratic retrieval with GPU-accelerated similarity kernels, learned multimodal fusion of alignment and embedding signals, and fairness-constrained clustering. ImmunoGraph uses compact MinHash prefiltering to sharply reduce candidate sets, a differentiable gating module to weight complementary affinity channels per pair, and an automated calibration routine that enforces proportional subgroup representation. Evaluated on large viral and cancer repertoires, the system yields large gains in throughput and memory use while retaining or improving recall@k, cluster purity, and equity across subgroups. ImmunoGraph therefore provides a scalable, bias-aware platform for repertoire mining and downstream translational applications such as vaccine target discovery.", "tldr": "ImmunoGraph accelerates immune network exploration through fair representation learning, interactive visualization, and scalable hardware-aware computation for equitable biological insights.", "keywords": ["Representation Learning", "Immunoinformatics", "Fairness", "Hardware Acceleration", "Visual Analytics", "Graph Representation Learning", "Metric Learning", "Biological Networks"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9d8913c7266f3506b4429ebd773d1ccd2178a8e2.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a5fab110a1ecad9142e56c5c377f74bc49a4acd4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors claim that a core computational bottleneck in population-scale immune repertoire analysis is the pairwise similarity computation, which grows quadratically with the number of receptor sequences. Despite prior efforts in subquadratic similarity computation, the authors identify three practical gaps: (1) many high throughput systems overlook domain constraints important for biological validity, (2) there exist systematic omission of low prevalence but biologically important antigenic classes, and (3) existing work have reproducibility issues due to omitting configurations. To address these issues, the authors propose ImmunoGraph, a pipeline that combines antigen-aware, near-subquadratic retrieval with GPU-accelerated similarity kernels, learned multimodal fusion of alignment and embedding signals, as well as fairness-constrained clustering. ImmunoGraph achieves superior performance at higher throughput compared to existing methods for immune repertoire analysis."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

But the results in Table 1 is performed on 10K sequences, which suggests that this is still a subset of a single repertoire. I would like to hear some clarification by the authors on what machine learning task they are doing, detailed in the next bullet point.\n1. What graphs are being constructed? What are the nodes and edges and what do they represent?\n2. What tasks are being performed (graph classification, node classification, link prediction, or not graph tasks at all)? What are the input and output?\n\nAnother major issue is that the presentation of this paper is undermining the contributions of this work. I wonder if the authors were writing this paper in the last minute. I will go over the major issues below.\n\n3. With the entire suite of architectural components, the paper will benefit from a clear and illustrative architecture figure in the main text (I am looking for something much better than Figure 3 in appendix, since that figure is very text-dense and uninformative).\n4. The figures in the main text are subpar. They are creating a lot of unnecessary white space, and they are very casually made without good considerations on background, color, text size, spatial organization, etc.\n5. Some figures in the appendix (for example, Figure 7) deserve to appear in the main text more so than Figures 1 and 2.\n6. The tables can be largely improved too. In Table 1 and 3, if you allow more width on the first column, it can immediately be better looking and taking less space. In Table 2, the ablation study can be a lot easier to follow if which components are included/excluded can be better shown: if they are added/removed one by one, make sure that is clearly communicated; if there are multiple combinations of components, show that in a configuration grid with check marks.
