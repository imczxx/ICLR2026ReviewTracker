However, methods based on diffusion models or Schrödinger bridges have yet to be widely adopted in real-world applications due to their iterative sampling nature. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, Implicit Bridge Consistency Distillation (IBCD), which enables single-step bidirectional unpaired translation without using adversarial loss. IBCD reformulates consistency distillation by using a diffusion implicit bridge model that connects PF-ODE trajectories between distributions, with a novel design parametrization to enable effective translation in a single step. Additionally, we introduce two key improvements: 1) distribution matching for consistency distillation and 2) adaptive weighting method based on distillation difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate that IBCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets in a single generation step.", "tldr": "IBCD enables single-step bidirectional unpaired image translation by carefully reformulating consistency distillation with a diffusion implicit bridge, enhanced by distribution matching and adaptive weighting, achieving state-of-the-art results.", "keywords": ["image translation", "consistency distillation", "unpaired", "single-step", "diffusion models"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b8fc4b1f15501d05cc3fb85ea11e2a3e5d73021f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The work proposed a single-step bidirectional unpaired image-to-image translation model using the combination of consistency distillation and distribution matching distillation for DDIB teacher model.

The evaluation of the proposed IBCD model was done using cat-to-dog, wild-to-dog, and male-to-female unpaired image-to-image translation problems. IBCD is compared with adversarial methods, including CUT and UNSB, and diffusion methods, including EGSDE, CycleDiffusion, SDDM, SDEdit, and the teacher model DDIB. These image-to-image translation models are evaluated using FID, density and coverage for image realism, inference time and NFE for inference efficiency, and PSNR and SSIM for input-output similarity.

The method is also compared with LLM-based GPT-Image-1 model, which shows existing limitations in domain specific problems of foundational large models in zero-shot editing. \n4) Figure 8 studies the effect of realism-similarity trade-off for the proposed model by balancing between DMCD and cycle-consistency losses"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1) According to Table 4, the distillation of DDIB model requires more than 200k steps for the training IBCD. It remains unclear how fast and stable the distillation with the IBCD is performed compared to the training of other unpaired image-to-image translation models.\n2) As pointed in many prior works on image-to-image translation problems [1, 2, 3], diversity remains an important characteristic of image-to-image translation models for multimodal pairs of domains. Even though authors provide standard deviations of the image quality metrics, the study lacks of diversity evaluation for the proposed method. \n3) As pointed out in [1], optimization of cycle-consistency losses struggles for pairs of image domains, where there is a big complexity difference and bijection assumption does not hold, for example, for the sketch-to-image problem. The study lacks of such pairs for image domains in the evaluation protocol.\n4) The work lacks of explanation about the inference efficiency of IBCD compared with GAN-based image-to-image translation models such as number of training parameters and model sizes, which seems to be unexpected. \n\n[1].

This approach enables the creation of a PF-ODE that follows from the first domain through the noise distribution to the second domain.

However, there is no comparison of the parameter count and training time of these models. There is a possibility that the teacher model outperforms other baselines due to the usage of significantly more parameters and compute, and the distilled version does the same for the same reason.\n- I suspect that in the comparison of inference time in Table 7, usage of different batches may not be correct, since there may be a constant overhead for each call of the neural network; hence, methods that use higher batch sizes may be better in img/sec ratio. Since the key part of all methods is to make some number of forward passes of the neural network, a comparison of 1 forward pass of each network with the same batch of images multiplied by NFE would better demonstrate the computational complexity of each model.\n- Some other baselines based on SB theory are missed, such as, but not limited to [1, 2].\n\n[1] Shi Y. et al.
