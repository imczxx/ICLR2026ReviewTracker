Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier, centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We first introduce $\\textbf{EditReward-Bench}$, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate reward models on editing quality. Guided by this benchmark, we develop $\\textbf{EditScore}$, an efficient model to evaluate the quality of instruction-guided editing. Through meticulous data curation and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift. Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity, domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of RL in this domain. Our code, models, and benchmark will be released publicly.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Image Editing", "Reinforcement Learning", "Reward Model"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f14b7bfb06cf18f31674bc60f97a97a5012f33d8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces EditReward-Bench (a benchmark for reward models) and EditScore (a family of generative reward models) for image editing.

The training data for EditScore is constructed using a pipeline that involves generating instructions and candidate outputs from a pool of 11 editing models, including state-of-the-art proprietary ones. Could you please clarify the measures taken to ensure that **EditReward-Bench's test set does not contain images or near-identical instructions from the training data**? Given the overlap in the model pool and data sources (e.g., GEdit-Bench), a detailed description of the train/test split protocol is crucial to validate the benchmark's integrity and prevent overestimation of generalization performance.\n2. The paper states that EditReward-Bench annotations \"have passed rigorous inter-annotator agreement checks.\" For transparency and reproducibility, could you provide the **specific agreement metrics used (e.g., Kendall's Tau, Spearman correlation, or percentage agreement)** and their quantitative results? Furthermore, please detail the **number of annotators per sample** and the process for resolving disagreements to achieve the final consensus ranking.\n3. The performance improvements presented in Tables 2 and 5, while substantial, are reported as point estimates. Have you conducted tests for **statistical significance** (e.g., paired bootstrap tests or t-tests over the benchmark subsets) to ensure that the gains from EditScore and the RL fine-tuning are not due to random chance? Reporting p-values or confidence intervals would strengthen the claims.\n4. The paper excellently demonstrates EditScore's strengths. However, a thorough analysis of its **failure modes and limitations** is equally important. Could you provide examples or a discussion of edit types or instructions where EditScore consistently fails or provides unreliable rewards? For instance, does it struggle with highly abstract or compositional instructions (\"make it look more joyful\") ? A dedicated \"Limitations\" section would be valuable.\n5. The self-ensembling (Avg@4) strategy is shown to be highly effective. However, it incurs a 4x computational overhead during inference.

The Flow-GRPO paper [1] already demonstrated that its method can be used to improve editing models.
