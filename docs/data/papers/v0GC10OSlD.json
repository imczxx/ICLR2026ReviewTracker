This challenge is especially acute in mixed-motive multi-agent systems. This work focuses on **cooperative resilience**—the ability of agents to anticipate, resist, recover, and transform in the face of disruptions—a critical yet underexplored property in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. We study how reward function design influences resilience in mixed-motive settings and introduce a novel framework that learns reward functions from ranked trajectories, guided by a cooperative resilience metric. Agents are trained in a suite of social dilemma environments using three reward strategies: (i) traditional individual reward; (ii) resilience-inferred reward; and (iii) hybrid that balance both. We explore three reward parameterizations—linear models, hand-crafted features, and neural networks—and employ two preference-based learning algorithms to infer rewards from behavioral rankings. Our results demonstrate that hybrid strategy significantly improve robustness under disruptions without degrading task performance and reduce catastrophic outcomes like resource overuse. These findings underscore the importance of reward design in fostering resilient cooperation, and represent a step toward developing robust multi-agent systems capable of sustaining cooperation in uncertain environments.", "tldr": "We propose a reward learning framework for cooperative resilience in multi-agent systems by inferring rewards from resilient behaviors, showing that resilience-aligned rewards improve robustness without compromising individual performance.", "keywords": ["Multi-agent systems", "Inverse reinforcement learning", "Preference-based learning", "Reward design", "Cooperative resilience", "Social dilemmas"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c7408f6de87e4855f06263689c7348267d9ee526.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/dd7137db5e81842c3955828cd9997d71f71ede20.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper focuses on reward or mechanism design for the mixed-motive game Harvest, where two agents can collect apples with a state- and location-dependent regrowth rate.

It is unclear if the MDP refers to a single agent (which would be flawed due to violating the Markov property [6]) or the joint multi-agent view (which would represent a multi-agent MDP or MMDP [7]).\n- The paper assumes full observability, contradicting the original setting of Harvest, which is defined as a partially observable stochastic game [8,9].\n- The paper assumes information sharing between the agents, e.g., the experience trajectories containing the joint actions, which is unrealistic in mixed-motive scenarios, where **(1)** agents are assumed to be independent [8,9,10], and **(2)** global and perfect communication is required, thus limiting scalability.\n\nThe proposed method is specifically designed for the Harvest domain, as the cooperative resilience metric consists of four indicators (the paper states *\"five\"* but I could not find the fifth one):\n1. Cumulative consumption of apples\n2. Resource/Apple availability\n3. Gini index (distribution of apple consumption)\n4. Hunger index (number of time steps without any consumption)\n\nI wonder how these metrics would map to other common social dilemmas, such as Cleanup, Public Goods, Coin, and Wolfpack.\n\nTo further strengthen the contribution, a theoretical analysis would have been helpful, e.g., where the concept is shown to work in the iterated prisoner's dilemma.\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe introduction of the paper puts a strong emphasis on environmental disruptions. However, throughout the paper and experimental section, I do not find such disruptions that would validate the claims regarding cooperative resilience (the metric is reported in the experiments, but I am unaware of the actual disruptions, if any). I recommend testing variations, e.g., where the regrowth rate of apples is varied [8,9] or communication channels are noisy [5]. Without such an evaluation, I cannot confirm its significance.\n\nThe experiments are somewhat preliminary, as they focus on very small instances of the Harvest domain with four agents at most. Prior work evaluates with 8-12 agents in the Harvest domain [1,5,8], as well as other domains, such as Cleanup or Coin [2].\n\nDue to the lack of scaling and variety of test environments, I am concerned about the generality and scalability, and consequently, the broader relevance of the approach.\n\n**Literature**\n\n[1] Lupu et al., \"Gifting in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\", AAMAS-20\n\n[2] Yang et al., \"Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\", NeurIPS-20\n\n[3] Schmid et al., \"Stochastic Market Games\", IJCAI-21\n\n[4] Vinitsky et al., \"A learning agent that acquires social norms from public sanctions in decentralized multi-agent settings\", Collective Intelligence 2023\n\n[5] Phan et al., \"Emergent Cooperation from Mutual Acknowledgment Exchange in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\", JAAMAS-24\n\n[6] Littman et al., \"Markov Games as a Framework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\", ICML-94\n\n[7] Boutilier et al., \"Planning, Learning and Coordination in Multiagent Decision Processes\", TARK-96\n\n[8] Perolat et al., \"A multi-agent reinforcement learning model of common-pool resource appropriation\", NeurIPS-17\n\n[9] Leibo et al., \"Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Sequential Social Dilemmas\", AAMAS-17\n\n[10] Foerster et al., \"Learning Opponent-Learning Awareness\", AAMAS-18"}, "questions": {"value": "Regarding the cooperative resilience metric: Cumulative consumption is potentially unbounded, whereas the Gini index has strict bounds.

Combined with noisy ranking data from random trajectories, narrow metrics, limited environment diversity, and unorthodox PPO configurations, the current results feel preliminary.

The central experimental result confirms that a hybrid reward strategy—which balances the learned resilience reward with standard individual consumption incentives—significantly improves robustness.

While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is not new, using preference-based IRL (MPL/PPL) derived from trajectories ranked explicitly by their recovery and failure profiles under stress is a novel application pathway for incentive design in MARL. This approach circumvents the conventional IRL dependence on near-optimal expert demonstrations by utilizing quantitative rankings derived from a resilience score, which captures the complex dynamic, temporal, and distributed nature of recovery under disruption. The paper successfully operationalizes the abstract concept of resilience (anticipating, resisting, recovering, and transforming) into a practical learning signal. Crucially, the introduction of the hybrid strategy demonstrates an important, original insight into practical reward alignment in mixed-motive settings. The result is an emergent reward function that leads to specialized, non-overlapping spatial behaviors (one agent exploring, one anchoring/harvesting) that maximize joint welfare, illustrating the power of this incentive structure beyond simple aggregated consumption maximization. This framework provides a structured means to inject long-term persistence goals into existing MARL systems.\n\n\n- Quality\n\nThe authors tested 27 configurations across two learning algorithms, various sampling strategies, and three reward parameterizations. Critically, the reward inference used trajectories generated under a single resource removal disruption, while the final evaluation used a complex protocol featuring three distinct, temporally separated disruptions: resource removal, regrowth rate reduction, and agent failure simulation. This methodology provides strong evidence that the learned rewards result in generalized robustness rather than overfitting to a single failure mode present in the training data. The results are quantified using statistical tests (Mann–Whitney U test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction), confirming that the hybrid strategy significantly outperforms Random, standard PPO, and QMIX in terms of cumulative consumption and episode length. Furthermore, the paper includes a non-trivial scalability test in a larger 16x16 environment with four agents and permanent resource depletion, confirming the core benefits persist in increased complexity. The transparency provided by interpreting the learned weights for the best-performing handcrafted model (Section B) significantly enhances the quality of the analysis, offering clear causality between incentive structure and emergent cooperative behaviors (e.g., incentivizing proximity distance while rewarding local density).\n\n\n- Clarity\n\nThe technical presentation is straightforward and professional. The problem formulation, the definition of the MDP, and the two-step methodology (ranking trajectories, then learning the reward via optimization/probabilistic modeling) are clearly laid out. The mathematical structure defining the resilience score (using failure and recovery profiles via integrals and the harmonic mean aggregation) is detailed enough to follow the underlying mechanism.\n\n\n- Significance\n\nThe paper addresses a fundamental limitation in MARL: how to automatically design incentives for long-term collective welfare under uncertainty. The success of the hybrid strategy demonstrates that resilience and individual productivity are not necessarily a zero-sum game; the method simultaneously achieves the highest average consumption and the lowest social dilemma failure rate (13.2% last-apple consumption) compared to baselines. This is a powerful proof of concept for applications in domains like environmental resource management or decentralized infrastructure control."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Quality\n\nThe experimental quality suffers from weaknesses in the baseline selection and the dependence on parameterization. The paper compares performance against basic PPO and QMIX and explicitly notes the omission of more recent, high-performing cooperative MARL algorithms. This leaves a significant open question regarding the necessity of the complex two-stage IRL process compared to simpler, modern reward shaping or decentralized planning techniques. Furthermore, the QMIX baseline required a 10x manual reward increase (+10 instead of +1) just to prevent agents from converging to suboptimal areas, suggesting the baseline policies were highly fragile and perhaps not optimally representative of competitive cooperative MARL standards. The overwhelming success of the Handcrafted parameterization compared to the Linear and Neural Network models (e.g., Last Apple % of 1.75% for MPL-M1 Handcrafted vs. 8.75% for MPL-K1 NN Hybrid, Table A.5 vs A.7) suggests a severe limitation in the generalization capacity of the learned models when forced to work from raw state inputs. This heavily implies that the quality of the system’s performance is primarily driven by the expert’s choice of six input features, rather than the ability of the preference learning pipeline to automatically identify resilience-aligned signals in complex, non-linear state spaces.\n\n- Clarity\n\nthe paper does not fully clarify the mechanisms behind the selection of the best performing configuration (Handcrafted MPL-M1 Hybrid) over other high-performing variants, particularly the PPL models which often yielded comparable resilience scores with drastically different average rewards (e.g., Table A.2). This suggests that the nuanced trade-offs captured by margin definition and sampling strategy were not fully analyzed or clearly presented."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
