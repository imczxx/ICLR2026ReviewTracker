Previous studies have attempted to enforce structural consistency by incorporating manually designed priors, rule-based constraints, or specialized architectures, which often limit adaptability. In this paper, we propose SCoTL-pose (Structural Consistency via Trainable Loss for Pose Estimation) framework that enables pose estimation models (pose-net) to learn structural dependencies directly from data, through a trainable loss function (loss-net), without explicit priors. Our approach introduces a graph-based loss-net that captures both local and global joint relationships, ensuring anatomically plausible pose predictions. While inspired by the idea of Structured Energy As Loss (SEAL), we extend it to tackle 3D human pose estimation, a task with more complex and high-dimensional structural dependencies than those considered in previous applications. To this end, we employ a graph-based model as loss-net architecture, tailored to capturing the intricate local and global dependencies among joints. SCoTL-pose can be combined with diverse backbones, from single-frame lifting networks to state-of-the-art multi-frame temporal models, without additional inference cost. To assess whether SCoTL-pose enhances structural plausibility in a quantitative manner, we also introduce Limb Symmetry Error (LSE) and Body Segment Length Error (BSLE) as evaluation metrics. Experimental results on Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M WholeBody datasets demonstrate that SCoTL-pose not only reduces per-joint pose estimation errors but also generates more plausible poses, with increasing gains under more challenging settings such as single-frame or in-the-wild scenarios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Trainable Loss function", "Structural Consistency", "3D Human Pose Estimation", "Structured Energy network"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ab8a479146d11b554604f33fd89b5ba8dc7fdca8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces SCoTL-Pose, an extension of the Structured Energy As Loss (SEAL) framework, tailored for the high-dimensional and structurally complex domain of 3D human pose estimation.

Below, we clarify how our work concretely extends and instantiates the SEAL paradigm in the context of 3D human pose estimation.\n\nWe fully agree that our work is conceptually inspired by the “structure-as-loss” idea introduced by SEAL. **SEAL, however, is a generic framework:** it shows that a trainable energy-based loss can, in principle, enforce structural plausibility, but **it does not provide a concrete recipe for complex, continuous, high-dimensional regression tasks** such as 3D human pose estimation. **Our contribution is to instantiate and validate this paradigm in a genuinely challenging, real-world setting.**\n\nConcretely,\n\n(1) We are the first to apply a SEAL-style trainable loss to 3D human pose estimation and show that it works **robustly across multiple datasets and six backbones** without any test-time overhead. We are also adding results on two additional strong backbones — a diffusion-based model and the state-of-the-art KTPFormer — which demonstrate that the proposed loss-net is also compatible with high-performing HPE architectures.\n\n(2) We design a **graph-based loss-net that mirrors the human skeleton topology, which is not present in SEAL.** This architecture is designed to capture limb couplings and structural violations that are specific to HPE, and our experiments show that it effectively learns such structure.\n\n(3) We also adopt a **simple but systematic training protocol**: we perform a greedy hyperparameter search where we first tune the pose-net learning rate, then the loss-net learning rate, and finally the energy weight 𝛼. **This procedure makes it easier to find a stable and effective configuration in practice.** We also experimented with explicit negative samples to further guide training; although this has not yet led to clear improvements, it is something we are actively exploring and refining.\n\nWe will revise the main contributions to make this positioning clearer: our goal is not to propose an entirely new generic framework on top of SEAL, but to **bridge the SEAL to a realistic, complex structured prediction task,** and to show that, with an appropriate graph-based loss-net design and training protocol, **it becomes a practical, broadly applicable module for 3D human pose** estimators."}, "title": {"value": "general response1:Regarding novelty beyond SEAL"}}, "id": "yt4vrzBjV9", "forum": "pdEUDwGn7h", "replyto": "pdEUDwGn7h", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23380/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23380/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23380/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763619395962, "cdate": 1763619395962, "tmdate": 1763634095008, "mdate": 1763634095008, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a method to enhance 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) through structural constraints.

The introduction of LSE and BSLE as metrics allows for a direct, quantitative evaluation of the plausibility problem, which standard metrics like MPJPE fail to capture.

The framework involves an alternating training procedure for two networks, which is essentially a minimax game and similar to GANs which is usually difficult to stabilize. The paper admits this in its limitations (\"broad hyperparameter search space,\" \"less straightforward\"). I think that this is a major practical weakness.\n2. There’s no interpretability or visualization of what the loss-net focuses on. As an example, which limbs or joint dependencies dominate the structural energy? Understanding what the loss is penalizing (symmetry violations, limb length deviations, joint rotations) would make the contribution more interpretable and reliable.\n3. The paper mainly compares SCoTL-Pose with vanilla supervised models or simple regularizers. It omits direct comparisons with other structure-aware or constraint-based approaches, such as kinematic tree priors, limb or bone length constraints, graphical model based pose estimators (example Pose-GCNN, kinematic refinement modules). Without such comparisons, it’s hard to understand whether the learned loss is actually superior to explicit structure enforcement.\n4. Since the learned loss may rely on dataset specific geometry such as Human3.6, this limits claims of broad generalizability.\n5.
