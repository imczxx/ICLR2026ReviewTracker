This task enjoys a wide range of applications, e.g., 3D organ and vessel reconstruction from CT scans. Central to our approach is a robust module that takes a collection of oriented triangles in a 3D triangulation as input and outputs a simply connected volumetric mesh whose boundary approximates the input triangles. Starting from a 3D Delaunay triangulation of the input point cloud and initial triangle orientations obtained through a spectral approach, our approach alternates between applying the module to obtain a reconstruction and using that reconstruction to reorient the input triangles.  Experimental results on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "tldr": "An framework that reconstructs a simply connected manifold mesh from a noisy 3D point cloud.", "keywords": ["3D Reconstruction", "spectral techniques", "topological guarantee", "Laplacian", "Hodge decomposition"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5fed91da4429be5aaedf5b8cd5aa8556df82ddd5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents an approach to reconstruct a closed and connected mesh from noise point cloud.
