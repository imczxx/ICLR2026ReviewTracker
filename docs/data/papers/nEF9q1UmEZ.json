Where prior work focuses on generating stable inorganic crystals, our approach optimizes for the synthesizeability of a specific structural class: BCC/B2 superalloys, an underexplored family of materials with applications in extreme environments. Using three open-weight models (LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and OLMo-2), we demonstrate that language models can be optimized for multiple design objectives using a single, unified reward signal through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our reward signal is derived from thermodynamic phase calculations, offering a scientifically-grounded feedback for model tuning. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of preference-tuning a language model using physics-grounded feedback for targeted properties (in our case, BCC/B2 alloys). The resulting framework is general and adaptable to any design problem for which the design space is enumerable and simulation-based feedback is available.", "tldr": "We use preference learning to optimize local LMs to generate candidate compositions for BCC/B2 alloys", "keywords": ["Direct preference optimization", "preference learning", "materials science", "alloys", "language models"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e7e19aee2f2570a808b1d3bdd813d60c2e51060f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper applies direct preference optimization (DPO) to fine-tune open-weight language models to generate BCC/B2 superalloy compositions, with Thermo-Calc simulations as feedback.

The same thermo-calc setup is used to (1) synthesize SFT data, (2) generate preference pairs, and (3) evaluate success.

Cross-simulator or literature-based sanity checks are missing.\n\n2.  Only some base models (e.g., LLaMA, Gemma) improve stably after physics-DPO, while others (e.g., OLMo-2) degrade, which suggests the pipeline is sensitive to model architecture or to off-distribution sampling. This weakens the “general framework” claim.\n\n3. The paper mostly reuses validity/coverage/novelty-style metrics from crystal/material generation, but the target here includes a continuous volume fraction and a thermo-mechanical notion of “two-phase stability over a temperature sweep.” A metric that directly measures the percentage of candidates that satisfy all four thermo-based sub-objectives would be more convincing.\n\n\n4. No experimental or literature recovery check. There is no demonstration that the model can rediscover known BCC/B2 alloy compositions from the literature, or that any predicted alloy is plausible under process constraints (cooling rate, aging).

In Table comparisons, API LLMs with good prompt engineering still look competitive. Do those API models produce samples that are judged better by Thermo-Calc because they encode extra “chemical intuition” not present in your synthetic SFT data? If yes, can high-reward API samples be distilled back into the local model?\n\n4.
