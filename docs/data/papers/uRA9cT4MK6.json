However, existing methods often suffer from two limitations: i) the neglect of preserving sample neighborhood structures, which weakens the consistency of inter-sample relationships across views; and ii) inability to adaptively utilize inter-view similarity, resulting in representation conflicts and semantic degradation. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named Relationship Alignment for View-aware Multi-view Clustering (RAV). Our approach first constructs a sample relation matrix for each view using deep features and aligns it with a global relation matrix to enhance neighborhood consistency across views. Furthermore, we introduce a view-aware adaptive weighting mechanism for label contrastive learning. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the contrastive intensity between view pairs based on the similarity of their deep features: higher similarity leads to stronger label alignment, while lower similarity reduces the weighting to prevent forcing inconsistent views into agreement. This strategy effectively promotes cluster-level semantic consistency while preserving natural inter-view relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmark datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Relationship Alignment; View-Aware Contrastive Learning; Multi-View Clustering"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/569b375a26e7db0bf85838e7276572338c68b346.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The approach is well-motivated, combining relation alignment with view similarity measurement to offer a novel perspective for addressing semantic degradation caused by view discrepancies in multi-view clustering."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "1. This paper effectively addresses two core issues in current deep multi-view clustering: the weak preservation of neighborhood structure and the representation degeneration caused by view discrepancies. It directly offers solutions to these problems by introducing two modules: cross-view relationship alignment and view-aware label contrastive learning. The former ensures the consistency of the neighborhood structure through alignment, while the latter dynamically adjusts the inter-view weights based on the Wasserstein distance. The relational alignment module and the view-aware weighting mechanism are ingeniously designed, and their combination exhibits strong synergistic effects.\n2.
