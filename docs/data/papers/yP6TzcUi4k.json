However, in many decision-critical applications, accurate parameter estimation does not necessarily translate to better decision-making, as not all parameters may significantly affect the efficacy of the decisions made in the presence of uncertainty. In this work, we propose GoBOED (Goal-driven Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design) to directly optimize the experimental design to reduce the model uncertainty that critically affects the quality of the downstream decision-making task of interest. We establish a computationally tractable connection between BOED and robust optimal control based on an uncertain model through convex optimization. This new integrated framework for robust control under uncertainty enables efficient gradient computation through a decision layer in GoBOED. Leveraging amortized variation inference, we create a differentiable pipeline that can identify optimal experiments targeting decision value. Unlike traditional information-maximizing designs, GoBOED can provide flexibility in experimental selection, as the experiment with the lowest data acquisition cost may be prioritized when multiple experiments lead to equivalent decision quality despite their difference in reducing the parameter uncertainty. The application of GoBOED to real-world problems, such as epidemic management and pharmacokinetic control, demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed goal-driven experimental design approach.", "tldr": "GoBOED designs experiments that reduce the uncertainty that matters for decisions, linking BOED with robust optimal control via convex optimization and a differentiable decision layer.", "keywords": ["Bayesan optimal experimental design; Convex optimization; Robust decision making"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fba1dc6a8ea37644bec6c76386c54936f5b6e7f2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents GoBOED, a framework that unifies Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) and robust optimal control for decision-making under model uncertainty.

The main ideas are well structured, with clear visuals (e.g., Fig. 1) illustrating how the BOED and decision layers interact."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "While the paper’s central idea is conceptually appealing, its current presentation overstates robustness. The method addresses parameter uncertainty within a fixed model rather than broader forms of model misspecification. The robustness achieved through chance constraints or CVaR is useful but conventional, and the paper should more clearly define its scope as parameter-uncertainty-aware rather than fully model-uncertainty-robust. The framework’s differentiable structure is well executed but not fundamentally new in either BOED or robust optimization.\n\nEmpirically, the examples in Figure 2 highlight an interesting divergence between EIG-optimal and decision-optimal designs, particularly the emergence of a broader, flatter near-optimal window under risk-sensitive criteria. This is an intriguing and potentially valuable observation. However, the paper does not quantify or interpret why this difference matters or what practical benefit arises from using GoBOED instead of traditional BOED. A more systematic analysis, such as measuring control cost improvements, robustness to posterior misspecification, or constraint-violation frequency, would make the contribution more convincing.\n\nTerminology and exposition could be clearer. Concepts such as risk functional, chance term, and the “discrepancy” corrected through importance sampling are introduced without rigorous definition. Moreover, since the entire method depends on the posterior quality from variational inference, the absence of any evaluation of posterior calibration or its effect on decision reliability leaves an important gap.\n\nThe current evaluation relies on a single-shot design, which limits the interpretability of the framework. Extending the experiments to an iterated design, where updated posteriors inform subsequent measurement choices, would better demonstrate the claimed benefits of goal-driven experimental design. Visualizing posterior updates would also provide concrete evidence of how decision-aware objectives reshape uncertainty, rather than inferring these effects indirectly from control costs. Although benchmarking new methods is challenging, the authors could still compare their approach across multiple time points and posterior evaluations for both models, and contrast the results with plain EIG optimization. Posterior evolution could be illustrated visually or through calibration metrics such as L-C2ST.\n\nThe literature review misses seminal work and blurs distinctions between related methods.\n- The separation between Kleinegesse and Foster’s MI-based BOED methods is overstated; both rely on similar bounds, though Kleinegesse optimized a critic. The paper should also specify which bound is optimized, since MI bias and variance depend on that choice.\n- Foundational references such as Lindley (1956) and Barber–Agakov (2003) are missing.\n\nFinally, the literature review seems to take a very high-level overview of the field of BOED hinting at a misunderstanding of some fundamental concepts. Careless exposition makes it difficult for readers to place this paper in the context of those before, so I recommend edits to the introduction and background on BOED."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The framework relies heavily on how the posterior distribution changes under different design choices, but no posterior visualizations are provided. Could the authors show what the posteriors look like for the single-shot examples presented? Even a qualitative comparison between the EIG-optimal and decision-optimal designs would help clarify how the decision-aware objective shapes posterior uncertainty.\n\n2. How would the proposed approach behave in an iterated experimental design setting, where posteriors from earlier measurements inform the next design choice? This seems especially relevant for the SIQR example, where measurements could be taken over multiple time points. Would the decision-aware design criterion lead to different sequences of measurement times compared to classical EIG?

I agree with Equations 3-4, which align with existing decision-oriented objectives (eg, Bernardo & Smith, 1994; Bickford Smith et al, 2025; Huang et al, 2024; Neiswanger et al, 2022; Raiffa & Schlaifer, 1961) if we set $\\rho = \\mathbb{E}$ as the authors here do in Equation 5, making $h[p(\\theta|\\xi,y)] =\\min_{q \\in \\mathcal{Q}} \\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta|\\xi,y)}[J(q,\\theta)]$ the key quantity to target, where $J$ is a loss function, $q$ is an action, and $\\theta$ is an unknown ground-truth variable.\n\nThings get confusing thereafter because the authors actually consider $J$ not being a function of $\\theta$ while placing constraints on $\\theta$, leading to Equation 5. Mathematically it’s unclear to me how changing beliefs over $\\theta$ lead to a change in the minimising $q$, unless there is some $\\theta$ assigned nonzero weight by the prior and zero weight by the posterior: all that matters with regard to $\\theta$ is that the constraints are met, and these are set upfront, before any experimentation.\n\nEven if there’s some way this works out, it’s unclear to my why the constraints on $\\theta$ should not just be thought of as implying an updated belief state, $p'(\\theta|\\xi,y,\\mathcal{C})$ for constraints $\\mathcal{C}$, produced by applying the constraints and renormalising. If we had this updated belief state and a $J$ that depends on $\\theta$ then I think we’re back to the setup from past work.\n\nAside from these methodological issues, it looks to me like the proposed method is not compared against existing methods, even though the authors promise to “compare GoBOED with standard BOED baselines”. I think the authors should be comparing against EIG maximisation as well as other non-parameter-oriented methods (eg, Huang et al, 2024; Kandasamy et al, 2019).\n\nFinally I think there is a general inflation of the paper’s novelty. The goal-oriented aspect of the work is not new (see for example the citations for decision-theoretic methods). Considering the intersection between experimental design and control is not new (eg, Anderson et al, 2023; DeGroot, 2004; Mesbah & Streif, 2014). Studying SIR and pharmacokinetic models is not new (eg, Ivanova et al, 2021).
