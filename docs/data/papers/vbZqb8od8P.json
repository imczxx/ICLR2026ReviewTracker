However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step. While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39\\%, 64\\%, and 83\\% over standard SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and MATH-500).

That makes $Q$ **depend on both data and parameters $\\theta$**.\n\nThis is a problem because the Kolmogorov equations and the change‑of‑variables steps used to obtain Eq. (10)/(21) assume a Markov process with a generator that's independent of the evolving state and model parameters. Once $Q$ depends on $x$ and $\\theta$, those identities no longer hold as stated. At minimum, the proof needs to be redone for a **state‑dependent generator**—or alternatively, the method should be repositioned as a **sampling/weighting heuristic** rather than a theorem‑backed estimator.\n\nThere are two potential paths forward here. You could freeze $\\beta_i$ using a reference model or a data‑dependent but **parameter‑independent** proxy, which would keep $Q$ fixed during optimization and make your theorem applicable. Or you could acknowledge that the theorem only covers the fixed‑$Q$ case and present the entropy‑driven masking as a heuristic variance‑control scheme. I'd personally prefer seeing the latter with an honest discussion of why it works empirically.\n\n### The objective doesn't actually upweight high‑entropy tokens\n\nThis is subtle but important. Your loss (Eq. 10) is\n\n$$\nL=\\sum_i \\mathbb{E}_{t_i}\\big[ \\mathbf{1}[x^i_{t_i}=\\mathbf{M}] \\, \\tfrac{1}{t_i}\\, \\log p_\\theta(x_0^i \\mid x_t) \\big].\n$$\n\n(There's also a missing minus sign here—more on that below.)\n\nLet me walk through why this doesn't prioritize high-entropy tokens the way the paper claims. If we let $\\ell_i=-\\log p_\\theta(x_0^i\\mid x_t)$ and note that $\\mathbf{1}[x^i_{t_i}=\\mathbf{M}]\\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(t_i)$, then\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\mathbf{1}[x^i_{t_i}=\\mathbf{M}]\\tfrac{1}{t_i}\\,\\ell_i\\big]\n= \\ell_i.\n$$\n\nSo the **expected** contribution per token is unchanged—no token is prioritized in expectation, regardless of $t_i$. What you actually get is **more frequent sampling** of high‑entropy tokens, but the inverse‑probability weighting ($1/t_i$) exactly cancels out the frequency change. The benefit here is plausibly **variance reduction**, not reweighting as claimed throughout the paper (Abstract, §3.1, §3.3).\n\nIt would make more sense to reframe this as **importance sampling** or **variance control** rather than \"prioritization.\" Alternatively, if you genuinely want to upweight difficult tokens, you'd need to either remove the $1/t_i$ term (accepting bias) or use a partial correction like $1/t_i^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha<1$ and then analyze the bias–variance tradeoff explicitly.\n\n## Mathematical Issues in the Derivation\n\nBeyond the conceptual problems, there are several concrete mathematical errors that need fixing.\n\n**Sign errors and missing negatives:** Equations (1) and (10) write $\\log(x_0^i|x_t)$ as part of the **loss**, but a loss should use $-\\log p_\\theta(\\cdot)$ or an explicit cross-entropy term. Algorithm 1 does use `CrossEntropy`, which implies the negative sign, so there's an inconsistency here.\n\n**Small-o notation:** Equation (2) uses $o(t)$ where it should be $o(\\Delta t)$.\n\n**Lemma 1:** This one really caught my attention. In Equation (18), the numerator and denominator are identical:\n\n$$\n\\frac{p_t(x_t^1,\\dots,x_t^i,\\dots,x_t^d)}{p_t(x_t^1,\\dots,x_t^i,\\dots,x_t^d)}\n= \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta_{x_t^i}\\bar f(t))}{1-\\exp(-\\beta_{x_t^i}\\bar f(t))}\\\n p_0(x_t'^i\\mid x_t^{\\text{unmasked}}). \\tag{18}\n$$\n\nThe LHS is just 1. I think you meant to write a ratio of two *different* sequences—maybe something like $\\frac{p_t(x_t^{(i=[M])})}{p_t(x_t^{(i=x'_t)})}$, or $p_t(\\text{masked at }i)/p_t(\\text{unmasked with token }x'_t)$. Equation (19) has the same issue. As currently written, Lemma 1 is invalid.\n\n**Change-of-variables in Appendix A:** You write \"define $t_i=1-\\exp(-\\beta_{x_t^i}\\bar f(t))$ and $dt_i=\\beta_{x_t^i} f(t)\\exp(-\\beta_{x_t^i}\\bar f(t))$,\" which is differentiation w.r.t. the time variable. But then your integral bounds are over $t_i\\in[0,1]$ without a clear statement of how the measure changes. Combined with the state-dependent $Q$ issue from earlier, this section needs careful rewriting.\n\n**Notation inconsistencies:** There's a lot of notation drift—switches between $\\beta_{xi}$, $\\beta_{x^i}$, and $\\beta_i$\n\n## Problems with Algorithm 1\n\nThe pseudocode has several concrete bugs that need fixing before the method can be correctly implemented. These aren't conceptual issues—they're implementation errors that would prevent the algorithm from working as intended.\n\n**You're training on the wrong tokens.** The loss computation uses\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} \\leftarrow \\frac{\\sum_i \\mathbf{1}_{\\{M'^i=\\mathbf{0}\\}} \\frac{1}{t_i}\\,\\text{CE}(z_i,l_i)}\n{\\sum_i \\mathbf{1}_{\\{M'^i=\\mathbf{0}\\}}}.\n$$\n\nBut Eq. (10) says you should train on $\\mathbf{1}[x_{t_i}^i=\\mathbf{M}]$—the **masked** tokens. Your code trains on unmasked tokens (`M'^i=0`), which inverts the training signal.\n\n**The second forward pass is missing.** After you sample $M'$ with $\\text{Bernoulli}(t_i)$, you need to build the partially masked input and run the model again to get logits $z$ conditioned on that specific masking pattern. In the pseudocode, `z` only comes from the first pass (where all answers are masked), not from the actual training masking pattern.\n\n**$\\beta_i$ is zeroed for answer tokens.** In `EstimateRate`, you set $\\beta_i \\leftarrow (1-M^i)\\sqrt{H_i}$. But earlier, $M^i=1$ denotes the answer tokens (the ones you're masking). This assignment zeros out $\\beta_i$ for exactly the tokens you want to weight. It should be $\\beta_i \\leftarrow M^i\\sqrt{H_i}$.\n\n**Undefined variables in the loss.** The `z_i` used in the CE is never properly defined (see missing second forward pass above). Also, `l` is passed to `EstimateRate` but never actually used.\n\n**Unexpected normalization.** Equation (10) doesn't divide by the number of masked tokens, but your algorithm divides by $\\sum \\mathbf{1}[M'^i=0]$. If you want an unbiased estimator of the sum, you shouldn't include this normalization—or if you want to redefine the objective as an average, the weighting needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Experimental Claims Don't Match the Results\n\nThis is perhaps the most visible problem in the paper. When I read the abstract claiming \"39%, 64%, and 83% relative improvements,\" I immediately went to Table 1 to see these impressive gains—but the numbers tell a very different story.\n\n### The claimed improvements vs. what's actually in the tables\n\nThe abstract and §4.2 state: \"WeFT delivers substantial gains… **39%, 64%, and 83%** relative improvements over SFT…\"\n\nBut looking at Table 1's averages:\n- s1K: SFT gets **34.9**, WeFT gets **35.8** → that's a **+2.6%** relative improvement\n- s1K‑1.1: **33.7** → **34.4** → **+2.1%** relative\n- openr1‑3k: **33.2** → **33.7** → **+1.5%** relative\n\nThese are nowhere near 39/64/83%. Even looking at individual tasks, WeFT sometimes **underperforms** SFT (e.g., on s1K‑1.1, Countdown is 20.3 vs. 21.5; GSM8K is 78.1 vs. 78.4). So the claim that \"WeFT consistently achieves higher accuracy than SFT\" isn't supported by Table 1.\n\nI'm genuinely confused about where the 39/64/83% numbers came from. If they refer to some other metric (perhaps error reduction on Sudoku specifically? or improvement relative to SFT's delta from baseline?), this needs to be stated explicitly and calculated transparently in the text.\n\n**\"SFT improves performance on all tasks\"** — §4.2 states: \"Compared with the base… both SFT and WeFT improve performance on all tasks.\" But on Sudoku (s1K), SFT actually **drops** from 5.5 to 4.6."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see above sectino."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5eXAqd8aBD", "forum": "vbZqb8od8P", "replyto": "vbZqb8od8P", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14817/Reviewer_Cyn9"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14817/Reviewer_Cyn9"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14817/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762157427859, "cdate": 1762157427859, "tmdate": 1762925163923, "mdate": 1762925163923, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
