Artificial Intelligence has accelerated this trend with power demand by data centers growing from 1.9\\% of total US power demand to 4.4\\% of US power in only six years. While anecdotal evidence suggests that AI data centers are using enough power to have substantial impacts on the U.S. power grids, there are no systematic studies to quantify these effects. We utilize econometric techniques to determine the impact of AI model training and inference on consumer electricity quality and fossil fuel power demand. We find significant reductions in power quality and significant increases in power demand near data centers both immediately before and immediately after the publication of AI models. The largest impact worsens power quality equivalent to an additional .5-1 power outages per year. We further show these estimates can also be used for counterfactual analysis to assess impacts of scaling for future model development.", "tldr": "We utilize econometric techniques to examine the impacts of AI models on demand for power and power quality in the United States.", "keywords": ["Electricity", "Energy", "Artificial Intelligence", "Economics", "Power", "AI Efficiency", "LLMs"], "primary_area": "infrastructure, software libraries, hardware, systems, etc.", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4be17a0c835cea0a655d793be759755bff7835d6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents an econometric model to estimate the causal impact of AI data center operations on power grids using publicly available data.

It’s impressive to integrate multiple sources of data, but there some underlying shortcomings: 1) it does not capture much physical information about the grid, as most of the studied areas are interconnected through electric power infrastructure, except Texas, and the effects may propagate; 2) the geographical coverage for the demand model may not capture the full jurisdiction of certain ISOs, how this affect the findings needs careful examination or discussion; 3) is the electricity supply to the data centers studied all coming from interconnected grids or partially from co-located power plants, which may affect the analysis.\n- Despite DiD being a widely used model, the parallel trends assumption may be violated and needs more careful justification. For example, other affecting factors could include confounding regional developments, weather events, and the evolving grid conditions, such as generation mix change, battery deployments (that can balance supply and demand), because of energy transition.\n- Regarding the temporal alignment, is there any more information about when model training occurs and how sensitive are the results to alternate treatment timing?\n- The flow of the presentation needs improvement to explain the motivation of model choice and setup choices instead of listing what’s done.
