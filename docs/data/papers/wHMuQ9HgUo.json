Inspired by how humans recognize objects, which involves first identifying them as a whole and then distinguishing their parts, we propose a hierarchical prototype-based segmentation method called Hierarchical Prototype Segmentation (HiPoSeg). HiPoSeg builds a structured prototype space that captures both abstract object-level representations and detailed part-level features, enabling consistent alignment between levels. The model leverages a hierarchical contrastive learning strategy to structure semantic representations across levels, encouraging both intra-level discrimination and cross-level consistency. Experiments on standard benchmarks including Cityscapes, ADE20K, Mapillary Vistas 2.0, and PASCAL-Part-108 demonstrate that HiPoSeg produces consistent improvement of performance with an average +3.07\\%p mIoU gain without any additional inference cost.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Semantic Segmentation", "Contrastive Learning", "Prototypical Networks"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4e35cc492beba5551b20860673d757ba7d16cf63.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Traditional semantic segmentation methods often overlook semantic relationships across levels.

Experimental Completeness: No hyperparameter sensitivity analysis: The paper sets σ₁=0.25, σ₂=1, m=0.9 without justifying why these values are optimal or how performance changes if they vary (e.g., σ₁=0.1 vs. 0.5).\nLack of alternative backbone validation: All experiments use ResNet-101, but no results on mainstream backbones like HRNet-W48 or SegFormer are provided, making it unclear if HiPoSeg’s gains generalize beyond ResNet.\n2. Insufficient qualitative challenging cases: The qualitative results (Figure 3/4) only show simple scenes (e.g., clear buses in Cityscapes) and omit scenarios with dense small objects (e.g., crowded pedestrians) or severe occlusion—critical for verifying fine-grained segmentation ability.\n3. Motivation and Context:The related work section does not contrast HiPoSeg with 2024 SOTA methods (e.g., Contextrast’s contextual contrastive learning) in depth, only listing them in tables. It fails to explain why HiPoSeg’s hierarchical prototype design outperforms these latest methods, weakening the motivation’s urgency.\n4. No failure case analysis: The paper only reports successful segmentation results but does not analyze when HiPoSeg fails (e.g., which classes/regions still have high error rates) or why, limiting insights into the method’s limitations.\n5.
