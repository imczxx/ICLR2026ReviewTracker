Current social navigation methods focus on reactive collision avoidance and trajectory adaptation, but lack mechanisms to proactively gather information through human-robot communication.\n\nWe introduce Communication-enabled Social Navigation (CommNav). In this novel task, robotic agents actively seek assistance from residents to locate target individuals by requesting information about recent sightings, locations, and movement patterns.\nTo evaluate CommNav, we extend Habitat 3.0 to create Habitat 3.0c, a communication-enabled variant supporting multi-human environments with structured information exchange protocols. Adding COMM to a state-of-the-art social navigation model yields an improvement of 7\\% in finding a specific individual and 8\\% in overall episode success.\n\n\nOur experiments reveal that: (i) explicit human-robot communication substantially enhances multi-person navigation performance; (ii) pre-training COMM on a communication pretext task effectively addresses the challenge of occasional interaction signals.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Embodied AI", "Simulator", "Social Navigation"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3a3c20bbd632fe674b5ef1d3e685b95dab91205b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/5dfe0f2b69482c532b212e67254291f783416142.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Building upon existing LLM-based semantic navigation frameworks, this work introduces a\nproactive communication paradigm.

While the idea is conceptually strong and points toward an important direction for integrating HRI and LLM-based reasoning, the overall system maturity remains at an early stage. The experiments are purely simulated, and the interactions are simplified.\n2. The technical description of each component seems insufficient. For instance, the paper does not clearly specify: 1) how the language queries are generated, 2) how human responses are formatted and transformed from natural language to actionable commands, or 3) how the behavior planner defines its reward function and integrates with the communication policy. Also, although a high-level framework diagram is provided, the flow of information (e.g., LLM -> Policy -> Action) is not explicitly visualized or discussed in sufficient depth.\n3. This reviewer believes that the baselines are limited to non-communicative social navigation models (DDPPO, SDA), which only demonstrate that \"adding communication\" improves over \"no communication\". Also, although the paper introduces an LLM-based framework, it did not compare it with other LLM-based interactive agents introduced in literature. \n4. The paper assumes human responses to be relatively simple and reliable, but in reality, human behavior can be highly dynamic, ambiguous, or even misleading. Also, it is unclear how human feedback is modeled, whether it is rule-based, scripted, or simulated.\n5. Without real-world experiments, the proposed framework remains only partially validated.
