In this manuscript, we propose DualRes, a framework that improves the probabilistic forecasting performance of existing algorithms by incorporating conditional heteroskedasticity and residual distributional information. Specifically, during training, DualRes employs two separate models to learn the conditional mean and volatility of the time series, while during inference it generates pseudo-normalized residuals through resampling. DualRes requires only mean forecasts, so it offers substantial flexibility in the choice of forecasting algorithms-even algorithms originally designed for mean forecasting can be adapted to probabilistic forecasting. DualRes applies to both univariate and multivariate time series and remains robust under non-Gaussian errors with conditional heteroskedasticity. Numerical experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate its good empirical performance in capturing distribution of future observations and producing accurate prediction intervals.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["probabilistic forecasting", "Time Series", "Resampling", "Multivariate Forecasting"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f8d2b4d27bfa943edadb83d47656c64276b16139.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a post-hoc method for probabilistic forecasting for time series data.

For instance Flow-matching allows this through the learning of the velocity field mapping samples from a standard Gaussian distribution to samples from the desired complex distribution (as can be seen in [1]).\n- The literature that the authors are citing about probabilistic forecasting (mainly around diffusion and flow-matching models) is not complete. Other ways of doing probabilistic forecasting include: Quantile regression (as done in Chronos [2]), Parametric models (the most simple ones use a Gaussian distribution such as DeepAR, but more complex mixture based models exist such as Moirai [3]), and Bayesian methods (as in [4]).\n- The comparison in Table 1 is not fair to me as 3 of the 4 considered baselines were originally trained for point forecasts and the comparison is solely done in terms of probabilistic metrics.
