However, dominant training paradigms face a critical limitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final task success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem we term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail to generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason coherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel frame-work that integrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding verifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag its cognitive steps—such as planning, exploration, and reflection—and provides program-matic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to effective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the final outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method. On the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new state-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on the most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem from improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant actions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and interpretable agents.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["LLM", "RL", "Agent"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/67f7af8144f0c052af335379b8d87116388db28a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces RLVMR, a RL framework designed to improve the robustness and generalization of long-horizon agents.

A sensitivity analysis on the weighting parameter $\\alpha$ is also missing.\n*   **Vagueness in Reward Implementation:** The paper could be more specific about the implementation of the programmatic reward rules.

The reward for `<planning>` is granted only if the entire trajectory succeeds.
