In this work, we introduce a novel black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models, ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model (LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses in real-world decision-making systems.", "tldr": "We propose a black-box, decision-based attack leverages gradient-free direction estimation and iterative boundary search.

The core contribution is a two-stage pipeline: first, it employs SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to create a model-agnostic, unified feature importance ranking that handles both continuous and categorical features. Second, guided by this ranking, it uses an iterative boundary search algorithm (combining expansion and bisection) to efficiently find a minimal perturbation that causes the target model to misclassify an input. The authors conduct experiments across five datasets and a wide range of models—from classical classifiers to modern transformers—demonstrating high attack success rates (often >95%) with a small number of search iterations."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper addresses a critical and relatively under-explored area: the adversarial robustness of machine learning models on tabular data. As these models are widely deployed in high-stakes domains like finance and healthcare, understanding their vulnerabilities is of paramount importance. This work makes a timely and significant contribution by focusing on this problem.\n\n2. The primary methodological novelty lies in using SHAP values as the guiding signal for a black-box attack. This provides an elegant and intuitive way to unify the treatment of heterogeneous feature types (continuous and categorical) into a single importance-guided search space. This approach circumvents the need for gradient estimation and is well-suited for the decision-based setting.\n\n3. The authors have performed a comprehensive experimental evaluation. The breadth of models tested—spanning logistic regression, tree ensembles (XGBoost, CatBoost), and transformer-based architectures (RoBERTa, TabPFN)—is commendable and provides strong evidence for the generalizability of the proposed attack. The consistent high performance across multiple diverse datasets further strengthens these claims.\n\n4. The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and easy to follow. The proposed attack pipeline is illustrated effectively in Figure 1, and the overall methodology is explained logically. The abstract and introduction do an excellent job of motivating the problem and outlining the paper's contributions."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The paper fails to clearly articulate why a new, specialized attack for tabular data is necessary in the decision-based black-box setting. Tabular data is a mix of continuous and discrete features. However, the paper does not explain the unique challenges this mixture presents that could not be solved by simply combining existing attack strategies for continuous domains and discrete domains. Without this crucial justification, the contribution risks being perceived as an incremental combination of existing ideas rather than a novel solution to a distinct problem.\n\n2. The central claim of high query efficiency is based on a flawed accounting of query costs. The analysis exclusively focuses on the low number of iterations in the boundary search phase while completely ignoring the query cost required to compute the SHAP values. In a true black-box setting, obtaining model-agnostic SHAP values (e.g., via KernelSHAP) is computationally expensive and requires a substantial number of model queries, often scaling with the number of features. By omitting this significant upfront cost, the paper presents a misleading picture of the attack's true efficiency. This omission makes it impossible to fairly compare the method against other attacks.\n\n3. The experimental evaluation is critically lacking a direct, head-to-head comparison with established black-box attack baselines. While Table 2 references results from prior work, this is insufficient as experimental settings can vary significantly. To validate the superiority of the proposed method, a direct comparison against a strong, relevant baseline like HSJA, adapted for tabular data, is essential. Without such a comparison on total query cost and perturbation magnitude under an identical experimental framework, the paper's claims of state-of-the-art performance are unsubstantiated.\n\nMinor but Notable Presentation Issues:\n- The font size in several key figures, particularly Figure 1 and Figure 2, is too small to be comfortably read, hindering the paper's clarity.\n- There are instances of confusing and inconsistent notation, like x^A_combined used in line 181 and line 186."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can you please provide a full accounting of the query complexity of your attack? This should include the queries needed for the initial SHAP value estimation plus the queries for the boundary search. How does this total query cost compare empirically to a baseline like HSJA on the same task?\n\n2. What are the specific, fundamental challenges of attacking mixed-type tabular data in a decision-based setting that are not adequately addressed by a straightforward combination of existing continuous-space and discrete-space search strategies?\n\n3.  Your method relies on a generic X_valid constraint set. How would your SHAP-guided approach handle more complex real-world constraints, such as (a) immutable features (e.g., gender, race) that should never be perturbed, and (b) correlated features where changing one necessitates a valid change in another (e.g., Age and Years of Experience)?\n\n4. While you demonstrate a high attack success rate, the paper lacks a quantitative analysis of the resulting perturbation magnitude. Could you provide statistics on the norms of the adversarial perturbations generated by your attack?
