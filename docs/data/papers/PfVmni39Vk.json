The complexity of analyzing and utilizing sequencing data is significantly amplified by the high dimensionality and high noise levels of the data, as well as the presence of missing data. In order to tackle these problems, we suggest implementing a novel data processing framework that consists of two primary algorithms: the imputation algorithm scICLGAE and the clustering algorithm scCapsZB. scICLGAE employs two graph autoencoders (GAE) to fill in missing values by utilizing comparison learning to filter similar nodes from both global information and local structure. In order to verify the imputation impact and enhance the precision of the clustering outcomes, we have devised the scCapsZB algorithm. scCapsZB is a method that integrates a capsule network and a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution (ZINB) autoencoder. It incorporates prior knowledge through the capsule network and employs a self-attention routing mechanism to reduce the number of training parameters. Additionally, it uses the ZINB model to capture the feature representation of the data. The testing of our new framework on both generic and Alzheimer's datasets demonstrates substantial enhancements.", "tldr": "We use multiple encoders to analyze scRNA, promoting the analysis of Alzheimer's disease.", "keywords": ["Deep learning; scRNA-seq; Alzheimer's disease; Autoencoder; Imputation"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fb90ac76d442563a50b1f24ec455750533e5b65b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Summary\nThe paper proposes a two-stage scRNA-seq pipeline: an imputation module that builds a cosine-KNN graph and contrastive graph autoencoder to fill zeros, followed by a capsule-network clustering module coupled to a ZINB autoencoder with a DEC-style target distribution and a small set of true labels.

The method largely assemble established ingredients (contrastive graph AE, DEC target sharpening, ZINB AE, capsule routing) without a new principle, analysis, or guarantee.\n2.

Widely used scRNA-seq VAEs/autoencoders (scVI/LDVAE/SAUCIE, etc.) are cited but not included, undermining any SOTA claim.\n4. Cosine KNN in imputation and Pearson KNN in clustering are used without justification; it’s also unspecified whether ZINB is fit to raw counts, size-factor–normalized counts, or log space—crucial for model validity.\n5. The Alzheimer’s analysis lacks subject-level statistics: proportion shifts and DE appear pooled across cells (risking pseudoreplication), and pathway enrichment is run on DE from imputed matrices, which can inflate false positives.\n6. Key hyperparameters are missing on key knobs: KNN size, Louvain resolution, labeled-data fraction, capsule hyperparameters, neighborhood size for imputation, random seeds; no runtime/memory reporting.\n7.

For example, it uses contrastive learning, but did not justify why it would be helpful in the imputation tasks. Similar for the self-attention routing capsule network module. This unnecessary complication leads to concerns in robustness and computational efficiency. \nThe paper did not compare with the most highly-cited single cell methods like MAGIC[1], scImpute[2] and SAVER[3] for imputation, and Leiden[4] for clustering. \nThe method uses cosine similarity on raw sequence counts, but it is known that cosine similarity is going to suffer for high dimensionality and large noise, and the computational cost is very high given the high dimensionality.\nThe paper claims to be focused on Single-cell RNA sequencing data of Alzheimer’s Disease, but there is no specific method design that utilized the properties of AD data, making it unclear why it would have benefit on such data, compared to scRNAseq data in general.\nFor comparison with baselines, there is no error bar or uncertainty measure to show the statistical significance. Moreover, the proposed method does not outperform the existing baselines overall.\nThe paper has some issues in clarity and presentation. \nComparison results are not shown in a clear table but are in nonstandard plots. Besides, there is a global mismatch between the figure/equation numbers and their reference. \nThere also needs some explanations to the evaluation metric. The notations of $$y_i$$ and $$p_k$$ are also ambiguous: they are described as cell indices in the text but probably are the expression values.\nThe prior probability matrix $$L^i$$ being used is not defined in the text.\nThe negative sample generator in Figure 2 is also not well defined. \nEquation numbers are misaligned and/or missing. Equation 23 is referred to as equation 24.\nThe pathway analysis results are overinterpreted. For example, the conclusion about the implication of COVID pathways in the AD dataset is not sufficiently justified.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Van Dijk, David, et al. \"Recovering gene interactions from single-cell data using data diffusion.\" Cell 174.3 (2018): 716-729.\n[2] Li, Wei Vivian, and Jingyi Jessica Li. \"An accurate and robust imputation method scImpute for single-cell RNA-seq data.\" Nature communications 9.1 (2018): 997.\n[3] Huang, Mo, et al. \"SAVER: gene expression recovery for single-cell RNA sequencing.\" Nature methods 15.7 (2018): 539-542.\n[4] Traag, Vincent A., Ludo Waltman, and Nees Jan Van Eck. \"From Louvain to Leiden: guaranteeing well-connected communities.\" Scientific reports 9.1 (2019): 1-12.\n[5] Cheng, Yi, et al. \"Evaluating imputation methods for single-cell RNA-seq data.\" BMC bioinformatics 24.1 (2023): 302.\n[6] Hou, Wenpin, et al. \"A systematic evaluation of single-cell RNA-sequencing imputation methods.\" Genome biology 21.1 (2020): 218.\n[7] Zhang, Shixiong, et al. \"Review of single-cell RNA-seq data clustering for cell-type identification and characterization.\" Rna 29.5 (2023): 517-530.\n[8] Luecken, Malte D., et al. \"Defining and benchmarking open problems in single-cell analysis.\" Nature Biotechnology (2025): 1-6.\n[9] Blondel, Vincent D., et al. \"Fast unfolding of communities in large networks.\" Journal of statistical mechanics: theory and experiment 2008.10 (2008): P10008.\n[10] Levine, Jacob H., et al. \"Data-driven phenotypic dissection of AML reveals progenitor-like cells that correlate with prognosis.\" Cell 162.1 (2015): 184-197.\n[11] Song, Qianqian, Jing Su, and Wei Zhang. \"scGCN is a graph convolutional networks algorithm for knowledge transfer in single cell omics.\" Nature communications 12.1 (2021): 3826.\n[12] Weinreb, Caleb, Samuel Wolock, and Allon M.
