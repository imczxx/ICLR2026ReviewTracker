This paper presents a **global-regional coupling framework** for kilometer-scale regional weather forecasting that synergistically couples a pretrained Transformer-based global model with a high-resolution regional network via a novel bidirectional coupling module, **ScaleMixer**. ScaleMixer dynamically identifies meteorologically critical regions through adaptive key-position sampling and enables cross-scale feature interaction through dedicated attention mechanisms. The framework produces forecasts at  $0.05^\\circ$ ($\\sim 5 \\mathrm{km}$ ) and 1-hour resolution over China, significantly outperforming operational NWP and AI baselines. It exhibits exceptional skill in capturing fine-grained phenomena such as orographic wind patterns, Foehn warming, and coastal transitions during typhoon events, demonstrating effective global-scale coherence with high-resolution fidelity.

To overcome this, the authors propose a global–regional coupling framework specifically designed for high-resolution regional forecasting. This framework includes a module called ScaleMixer, which identifies spatial regions with strong multiscale interactions and learns bidirectional feature encoding between global and regional tokens in these areas. The experimental analysis includes two complementary settings, hindcast and operational forecasting, both demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.\n\nSpecifically, the authors formulate the forecasting problem as developing a hybrid global–regional weather forecasting framework that extends the capabilities of a pretrained global network by leveraging interactions between large-scale (global) atmospheric dynamics and small-scale (regional) weather effects. The pretrained global model, M_global, is a ViT-based architecture trained on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. The regional model,  M_regional, uses the same architecture with certain modifications. The ScaleMixer module then models the interaction between these two networks by learning their relationships and performing token-level encoding based on them, effectively prioritizing regions with strong cross-scale dependencies."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- The authors clearly identify the gap in the current literature on regional weather forecasting. The related work section provides an up-to-date review of both global and regional forecasting studies. The motivation behind the proposed architecture is clearly presented as a mechanism to dynamically identify cross-scale interaction regions and enable bidirectional feature encoding between global and regional tokens through a coupling framework. The overall structure of the paper is clear, well-organized, and easy to follow.\n- The experimental analysis (Table 1 and Figure 2) clearly demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model over other methods by a significant margin. Including the results of M_global and M_regional further highlights the need for a coupled architecture that leverages both global and regional information, hence the need for ScaleMixer. Case studies on orographic-induced wind and temperature forecasting, and extreme event prediction further support the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Visualizations of forecasts for various metrics, such as temperature and surface pressure, also show that ScaleMixer adapts well to different scenarios rather than performing well in only a single setting."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- For an experimental work like this, the ablation study is a crucial component, as it should strongly justify the need for each distinct part of the architecture. While the paper provides clear motivation for each component in earlier sections, for instance, the need for a ScaleMixer like structure, the choice of its exact architecture would be much more convincing if supported by a dedicated ablation study.\n- Similarly, the proposed architecture includes multiple components that depend on various hyperparameters, such as patch size and the number of encoder layers. The authors neither specify what kind of validation—if any—was used to select these hyperparameters nor present results using alternative settings. Including these details would experimentally strengthen the evidence for the model’s efficiency and its superiority over other baseline methods.\n- The authors state that the code for the proposed architecture and experiments is available at the provided URL for reproducibility.
