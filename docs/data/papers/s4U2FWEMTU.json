However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently, updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.", "tldr": "We propose ADAPT-Z, a new online learning method for time series forecasting that updates feature representations to handle distribution shifts.", "keywords": ["time series", "neural network", "online adaption"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/377277d239d3bad8542ba1d39222df3c62ca2b6e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles the challenge of distribution shift in online time series forecasting. It introduces a paradigm that deviates from conventional methods of updating model parameters. The authors posit that distribution shifts are fundamentally caused by changes in underlying latent factors, and therefore, it is more effective to directly adjust the feature representations produced by a model's encoder.\nTo this end, they propose ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in Z-space), a method that uses a lightweight adapter module to predict a corrective \"delta\" for the feature vector."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper is built upon a clear and intuitive premise.

While this is a pragmatic approach to handling delayed feedback, this term is not a true gradient for the current step but rather a delayed and averaged approximation. The paper could provide a clearer discussion on the implications of this temporal mismatch, especially in scenarios with abrupt, non-gradual shifts where this historical information might be stale or misleading.\n\n2. **Insufficient Engagement with Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) Literature:** The task of adapting a pre-trained model to a stream of incoming data under distribution shift is the central problem in the Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) field. The paper does not adequately position its work within this highly relevant body of literature in the main text. A more thorough comparison and discussion of the similarities and differences with TTA methods would provide better context for the paper's contributions.\n\n3. **Practical Concerns Regarding Computational Efficiency:** The efficiency analysis in the appendix reveals that ADAPT-Z, while often more memory-efficient than full-model fine-tuning, is slower in terms of runtime than most baseline methods. For real-world online applications where prediction latency is a critical constraint, this added computational cost could be a significant drawback. This trade-off between accuracy and speed deserves a more prominent discussion in the main paper.\n\n4. **Potential Ambiguity in Dataset Split Justification:** The authors justify their use of a 60/10/30 train/val/test split by arguing it is more \"realistic\" than the 25/5/70 splits used in some prior work. While their reasoning is plausible, this choice results in a significantly shorter online deployment period for evaluation. This could make the adaptation challenge less severe compared to enduring a distribution shift over 70% of the data, thereby complicating direct comparisons with results from papers that used the longer test split."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Zre8V3k70M", "forum": "s4U2FWEMTU", "replyto": "s4U2FWEMTU", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4690/Reviewer_a4GN"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4690/Reviewer_a4GN"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4690/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761816083994, "cdate": 1761816083994, "tmdate": 1762917514005, "mdate": 1762917514005, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in Z-space), a novel online time-series forecasting framework that adapts to distribution shifts by updating feature representations instead of model parameters.
