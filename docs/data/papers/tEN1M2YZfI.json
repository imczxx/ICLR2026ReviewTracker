Derivation of Equations (6)–(9) lacks rigor and clarity.\n\n1.1 The transition from Eq. (4) to Eq. (6) appears ad hoc and not rigorously derived from the underlying stochastic dynamics or variational principles.\n\n1.2 It is unclear how Eq. (8) is obtained from Eq. (6)—specifically, how the second term in Eq. (6) is eliminated and under what assumptions this simplification holds.\n\n1.3 The statement that “we can minimize (8) in a weak form to learn the pseudo-potential and the rotation part” lacks justification. The rationale for why minimizing this functional corresponds to learning the desired decomposition should be explicitly established.\n\n2. The constraint $\\nabla\\psi \\cdot R = 0$ is enforced only via an integrated (global) penalty term. There is no theoretical argument showing that minimizing this global loss guarantees pointwise orthogonality. A discussion of this discrepancy and its practical implications would be important.\n\n3. The paper provides no analysis of the consistency, bias, or variance of the proposed estimators. Without such analysis, it is unclear under what conditions the learned drift and potential converge to the true physical quantities. The good numerical results currently shown may depend strongly on the specific form of the training data rather than the generality of the method.\nIn particular, the dataset includes distributions at long times, which might already be close to the stationary distribution. This could artificially improve the training performance. It is recommended to quantify this effect—for example, by computing and plotting the distance between the data distribution at large t and the stationary distribution—to clarify how much of the observed accuracy stems from near-stationary data.\n\n4. All numerical examples are synthetic 2-D toy problems. The absence of higher-dimensional or real-world cases limits the demonstration of scalability and practical relevance. Moreover, no quantitative evaluation of runtime, efficiency, or robustness across architectures is provided.\n\n5. The assumption $b = -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\nabla\\psi + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma^2R$ is central to the method but not theoretically or physically discussed. All test cases are artificially constructed to satisfy this decomposition, which weakens the claim of general applicability.
