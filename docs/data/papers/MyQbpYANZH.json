Nevertheless, their large-scale deployment faces challenges due to computationally intensive iterative denoising processes. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an effective pathway for accelerating sampling, the iterative nature of diffusion models causes stepwise quantization errors to accumulate progressively during generation, inevitably compromising output fidelity. To address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that mathematically formulates error propagation in Diffusion Models (DMs), deriving per-step quantization error propagation equations and establishing the first closed-form solution for cumulative error. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate that our compensation strategy effectively mitigates error propagation, significantly enhancing existing PTQ methods. Specifically, it achieves a 1.2 PSNR improvement over SVDQuant on SDXL W4A4, while incurring only an additional $<$ 0.5\\% time overhead.", "tldr": "We propose a timestep-aware error compensation scheme that mitigates quantization error accumulation in low-precision diffusion models, achieving SOTA performance through theoretical error propagation analysis and adaptive correction", "keywords": ["Diffusion Models", "Post-training Quantization"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e6e71be00467482767d54f76593036b4739356f0.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Timestep-aware Cumulative Error Compensation (TCEC), a method designed to mitigate quantization error accumulation across timesteps in diffusion models.

The paper claims that prior approaches lack rigorous theoretical analysis (line 161 of the paper), but these works actually provide concrete and well-grounded derivations. Furthermore, the claim that “their experimental designs rely on ad-hoc fitting to specific tasks and are only validated on simple datasets such as CIFAR-10” (line 186 of the paper) is difficult to agree with. Prior studies [1, 2] demonstrate error compensation using lightweight calibration—similar to the method proposed in this paper—and report results on more complex datasets, including ImageNet, LSUN-Bed, and even text-guided image synthesis with Stable Diffusion.\nMore importantly, the core concept of TCEC, which estimates accumulated error and corrects it across timesteps, closely aligns with [2], yet this connection is not explicitly acknowledged. This raises concerns regarding the originality and novelty of the work.\n\n\n- The paper presents an unnecessarily complex derivation that ultimately leads to an intuitive conclusion that compensating quantization error at each timestep can mitigate cumulative error. This excess complexity may confuse readers.\n \n- There is a mismatch between the experimental setups for image/video quality and latency evaluations. The proposed error compensation term (Eq. 18) is derived for DDIM/DPM++ solvers under a noise scheduler, and image/video quality in Tables 1 and 2 is evaluated using diffusion models with these solvers. However, the inference latency is measured on Flux.1-dev, which is a flow-matching model. Thus, the reported latency comparison is inconsistent with the theoretical formulation. \n\n[1] Huanpeng Chu, Wei Wu, Chengjie Zang, and Kun Yuan. “Qncd: Quantization noise correction for diffusion models.” ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2024\n\n[2] Yuzhe Yao, Feng Tian, Jun Chen, Haonan Lin, Guang Dai, Yong Liu, and JingdongWang. “Timestep-aware correction for quantized diffusion models.” In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2024"}, "questions": {"value": "Please check weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "COysT7i69r", "forum": "MyQbpYANZH", "replyto": "MyQbpYANZH", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2540/Reviewer_eQpu"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2540/Reviewer_eQpu"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2540/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761794662159, "cdate": 1761794662159, "tmdate": 1762916273524, "mdate": 1762916273524, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "TCEC is a novel method designed to mitigate error propagation across successive denoising steps in quantized diffusion models.\nThe paper introduces a theoretical framework that models how per-step quantization errors accumulate over time, deriving the first closed-form solution for this propagation and simplifying it through practical approximations.\nAt inference, TCEC injects a lightweight correction term to counteract this accumulated error on the fly.\nAs a result, it significantly improves the performance of low-precision diffusion models and is compatible with a wide range of quantization approaches."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

As a result, the error pattern is more structured and non-random. For example, channels with larger value ranges are likely to experience greater quantization error due to coarser quantization scales. This suggests the theoretical model may oversimplify how real quantization noise behaves in practice.\n\n2. **Limited and Incomplete Experimental Coverage:**\nSeveral key experiments are missing or underdeveloped. For instance, Table 1 omits ViDiT-Q + TCEC results for image diffusion (despite its presence in Table 2 for video), without explanation. More critically, comparisons against error-aware baselines like QNCD or [1] are missing. This is a notable omission given the shared goal of runtime error correction.\nThe paper also lacks evaluation across a broader range of conditions (e.g., varying sampling steps per model) and provides only one latency example in the main text. Further ablations on hyperparameters (such as the sliding window size m, beyond Table 5) would help understand sensitivity.\n\n3. **Marginal Gains in Image Models:**\nWhile TCEC yields measurable accuracy gains in video diffusion models, the improvements in image generation tasks appear marginal. This raises questions about the general effectiveness of the method across domains. Additionally, Table 5 shows that the difference between Eq. (10) (exact form) and Eq. (13) (practical approximation with m = 1) is small, suggesting that the simplified formulation may not offer substantial gains — and setting m = 1 might not be a sufficiently accurate approximation in some settings.\n\n\n[1] Timestep-Aware Correction for Quantized Diffusion Models, Yuzhe Yao et al., ECCV 2024."}, "questions": {"value": "Mainly listed in the weakness.

At line 214, why is it valid to assume that the input x_t​ remains unchanged, even though quantization error from the previous step should propagate and alter the input over time?
