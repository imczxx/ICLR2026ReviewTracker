However, non-uniform interactions and random topologies make this task challenging. We address these challenges by proposing Graph Controllable Embeddings (GCE), a general framework to learn stochastic multi-object dynamics for linear control. Specifically, GCE is built on Hilbert space embeddings, allowing direct embedding of probability distributions of controlled stochastic dynamics into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which enables linear operations in its RKHS while retaining nonlinear expressiveness. We provide theoretical guarantees on the existence, convergence, and applicability of GCE. Notably, a mean field approximation technique is adopted to efficiently capture inter-object dependencies and achieves provably low sample complexity. By integrating graph neural networks, we construct data-dependent kernel features which are capable of adapting to dynamic interaction patterns and generalizing to even unseen topologies with only limited training instances. GCE scales seamlessly to multi-object systems of varying sizes and topologies. Leveraging the linearity of Hilbert spaces, GCE also supports simple yet effective control algorithms for synthesizing optimal sequences. Experiments on physical systems, robotics, and power grids validate GCE and demonstrate consistent performance improvement over various competitive embedding methods in both in-distribution and few-shot tests.", "tldr": "The paper explores to construct efficient representations for stochastic multi-object systems.", "keywords": ["Embedding to Control", "Controllable Embedding", "Graph Representation for Linear Control"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ff883be6a1e7b34f45b1c4f1d1766cc7808e93d5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3050ed2f6a185d66d173b3e53de9873f19319639.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper considers the problem of controlling stochastic nonlinear dynamics with interacting objects, and proposes a graph controllable embedding framework to map the dynamics distribution to RKHS.
