Confidence estimation (CE) provides reliability signals but is usually restricted to the final answer, offering only coarse diagnostics. While recent studies have explored stepwise diagnostics, existing methods rely on white-box access, such as token-level logits or fine-tuned models, which are infeasible for closed-source LLMs.\nWe introduce Stepwise Confidence Attribution, a black-box framework for diagnosing errors, requiring only access to generated reasoning traces.\nStepwise confidence attribution applies the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle to assign confidence scores at the step level, treating consensus structures across correct solutions as anchors of reliable reasoning with high confidence. Steps that do not align with these consensus patterns are assigned lower confidence.\nWe propose two complementary methods: (1) a non-parametric overlap-based approach (NIBS) that measures consistency without graph context, and (2) a Graph-based IB model (GIBS) that learns subgraphs through a differentiable mask to capture structural variability.\nThrough extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and multi-hop question answering, we show that our framework reliably identifies low-confidence steps strongly correlated with reasoning errors. Moreover, incorporating step-level CE improves overall reasoning accuracy, yielding up to an 12.3\\% accuracy gain. Our framework provides a practical diagnostic tool for enhancing the reliability of LLM reasoning.

The introduced confidence estimation methods introduce dependency on external models and/or additional requirements on the format of model outputs, which could make them brittle and hard-to-generalize.\n\n    (a) The NIBS method requires either BERT embeddings or an NLI model. Therefore, its effectiveness depends on the reliability of the embeddings and/or the NLI model. (There is no clear description regarding the BERT embeddings and the NLI model. Which BERT was used? Was the NLI model trained? Which model is the NLI model based on?)\n\n   (b) The GIBS method requires the model to output structured reasoning traces or a post-processor for parsing the reasoning trace. (There is no specific information in the paper on which approach was actually used.) If the former approach is used, it requires the reasoning model to be capable enough to generate structured reasoning traces and might alter model behavior and introduce computational overhead. If the latter is used, an additional post-processor is required for the method. Moreover, the GIBS method also requires an NLI model. (Again, the specific information of the used NLI model is lacking). For annotating the entailment, two hyper-parameters are introduced ($\\tau_{e}$, $\\tau_{v}$), of which the values seem to be arbitrarily set (Line 787).
