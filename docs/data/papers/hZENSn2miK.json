Yet the dominant Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective, which underpins Contrastive Loss, optimizes a softened ranking surrogate that we rigorously prove is fundamentally oblivious to score separation quality and unrelated to AUC. This mismatch leads to poor calibration and suboptimal performance in downstream tasks like retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG). To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the MW loss, a new training objective that maximizes the Mann‑Whitney U statistic, which is mathematically equivalent to the Area under the ROC Curve (AUC). MW loss encourages each positive-negative pair to be correctly ranked by minimizing binary cross entropy over score differences.  We provide theoretical guarantees that MW loss directly upper-bounds the AoC, better aligning optimization with retrieval goals. We further promote ROC curves and AUC as natural threshold‑free diagnostics for evaluating retriever calibration and ranking quality. Empirically, retrievers trained with MW loss consistently outperform contrastive counterparts in AUC and standard retrieval metrics. Our experiments show that MW loss is an empirically superior alternative to Contrastive Loss, yielding better-calibrated and more discriminative retrievers for high-stakes applications like RAG.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Dense retrieval", "AUC", "Mann-Whitney", "RAG"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6c5403088d85332aa0c0506c65e1dcec5a95f57b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the limitations of the Contrastive Loss (CL) for training dense neural retrievers and proposes a alternative called Mann-Whitney (MW) loss.

In this context, the AUC metric is rarely used to evaluate the quality of a ranking method, for several well-known reasons:\n\n- It does not depend on the actual positions of items in the ranked list, effectively treating the problem as classification rather than ranking.\n\n- It assumes binary relevance, whereas in practice relevance is often graded or continuous.\n\n- It is pairwise rather than listwise, and it is well established that listwise approaches tend to be more effective.\n\n(2) The choice of baselines for comparison is also quite weak: only a single baseline is considered.

How does your approach relate to, or compare with, these existing techniques?\n* Given that the choice of baselines is somewhat limited (only a single method is considered, and arguably not the most representative of current practice in the RAG community), it would have been valuable to include additional ablations or variants, such asvthe use of other differentiable surrogates of the indicator function 1{𝑧≤0} (e.g., hinge loss, etc.);\n* the influence of the temperature parameter;\n* a deeper analysis of the somewhat counterintuitive observation that the proposed method preserves or even improves within-query (fine-grained) ranking quality.
