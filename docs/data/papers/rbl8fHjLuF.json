This paper proposes a Lyapunov-guided multi-constraint aware decoding framework that innovatively adapts Lyapunov stability theory to discrete language generation processes. By constructing a multi-constraint Lyapunov modeling system, constraint deviations are quantified as Lyapunov functions, enabling agents to quantitatively assess constraint satisfaction distances and obtain optimal convergence directions.

Besides, I notice that the discussed existing works are no later than 2021, lacking advanced works. Comparing with such old baselines makes the effectiveness of the method not strong.\n2. The experiments are not solid. Only one benchmark and base model is used. The setting of a 256-token limit is not normal, needing an explanation for it. Also, the baselines are weak and old.

To the best of my knowledge, this is the first attempt to transplant Lyapunov stability—originally formulated for continuous-time dynamical systems—to the discrete stochastic space of LLM generation.

The $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ at line 188, the $\\alpha$ in Algorithm 2 and Equation 19, and the $\\beta$ in Equation 14 denote different weights—these should be distinguished with consistent notation. A thorough pass to ensure consistency and rigor in symbol definitions is recommended.\n3. Insufficient justification for Lyapunov-function suitability. The paper heuristically maps constraint deviation to a Lyapunov function but does not establish how the discrete text-generation process satisfies the core assumptions of Lyapunov stability theory, nor does it provide a rigorous convergence proof in the discrete language generation space.\n4. Incomplete experimental analysis. Given the real-time nature of UAV inspection, please report computational overhead and efficiency for multi-step prediction, constraint-coupling modeling, and gradient projection. Add comparisons of decision-making trajectories between LCAD and baselines to illustrate how Lyapunov gradients guide globally better choices, and include ablations to quantify each module's contribution, with deeper analysis of results.\n5. Applicability and generalization. Experiments are limited to a single scenario. It remains unclear how the approach would handle constraints that are more open-ended, semantically complex, or subjective.

It is the first work to adapt Lyapunov stability theory to the discrete generation process of LLMs, addressing two core challenges in multi-constraint environments. By converting multi-dimensional heterogeneous constraints into a single \"system deviation\" optimization objective, it avoids the fragmentation issues of traditional constraint-handling methods. Leveraging the \"progressive improvement\" paradigm, it provides strict mathematical convergence guarantees for constraint satisfaction, filling the gap of insufficient theoretical support in traditional methods.\n\n2. The LCAD framework covers the entire lifecycle of agent decision-making and forms a closed-loop control. Before decision-making, MPC-based predictive decoding optimizes future sequences over H steps to balance long-term constraint satisfaction and computational efficiency. During decision-making, the multi-dimensional projection mechanism detects constraint deviations in real time and maps infeasible states back to the feasible region, preventing deviation accumulation. After decision-making, external knowledge injection and adaptive weight updates continuously optimize subsequent generations, effectively avoiding the limitations of single-module designs and ensuring sustained constraint satisfaction.\n\n3. Experiments were designed for the safety-critical scenario of UAV wind farm inspection, focusing on five high-priority constraints. Quantitative results show significant improvements in safety-related constraints, demonstrating the practical value of the method in high-risk real-world applications. Meanwhile, by comparing with four representative baseline methods (Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thoughts, DExperts, PPLM), the superiority of the proposed framework was verified from three dimensions: overall constraint satisfaction rate, individual constraint satisfaction rate, and collision rate—without sacrificing generation quality.\n\n4. The work establishes an interdisciplinary connection between control theory and NLP, providing a mathematical basis for the predictability of constraint satisfaction in AI systems. From an engineering perspective, the unified constraint framework supports flexible configuration across different scenarios, avoiding the high costs of scenario-specific customization in traditional methods and reducing the deployment threshold in complex environments, thus showing potential for practical implementation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The H value in MPC-based predictive decoding directly affects performance and computational cost. However, the manuscript fails to provide quantitative data (e.g., inference latency, GPU memory usage) for different H values, making it impossible to determine the method’s applicability in scenarios with strict real-time requirements (such as emergency obstacle avoidance for UAVs). Additionally, no computational optimization strategies were proposed for scenarios with large H values.\n\n2. The manuscript mentions injecting environmental constraints and external knowledge through \"hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation or dynamic prompt engineering\" but does not specify details of the retrieval mechanism (e.g., type of data source, logic for generating retrieval keywords). Furthermore, no ablation experiments were designed to compare performance with and without external knowledge, making it impossible to quantify the module’s actual contribution to the constraint satisfaction rate and hindering the reproducibility of its implementation details.\n\n3. Ablation experiments for individual modules of LCAD are absent, so the specific contribution of each module to overall performance cannot be determined, and key optimization points remain unclear. In addition, the discussion explicitly identifies the need to balance individual and global constraints in multi-agent scenarios—a critical application direction for LLM agents—but no exploratory work was conducted in this area, which weakens the comprehensiveness of the method."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
