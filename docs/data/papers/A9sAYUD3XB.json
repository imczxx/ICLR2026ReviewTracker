However, the only downstream task evaluated is gene expression prediction, with minimal mention of MSI status classification. This makes it difficult to fully assess whether the learned features of pathology images are truly hierarchical. Additionally, HCA and HEA function more like pre-training objectives. It remains unclear how the method would perform if the training were separated into two distinct stages: pre-training and downstream fine-tuning. Furthermore, there are alternative objectives for encoding global and local (hierarchical) features such as DINOV2 and it would be informative to compare the performance of these methods in this context.\n\n- Experimental setting\n\nWhy were experiments not conducted on Visium HD, which provides multi-level gene expression data that better aligns with the paper’s goal of learning hierarchical representation features?\n\nThe experiments are limited to colorectum, skin, and kidney from the HEST-1K dataset.

The core theoretical foundation that ST data forms hierarchies based on \"information specificity\" (line 96) is unconvincing:\n   1. From a spot, you cannot infer the environmental/biological gradients or neighborhood context (eg, proximity to vasculature, immune infiltration from adjacent tissue, tumor boundaries). From a niche, you cannot determine spot-specific cellular heterogeneity (eg, single-cell composition, microenvironmental niches within the spot). This is a complementary relationship where each level provides unique information. I'm not seeing a parent-child hierarchy where one entails the other\n   2. Similarly, morphology lacks information about genes without morphological correlates. Gene expression also lacks information about: spatial organization and tissue-level patterns invisible at the molecular level. \n2. Following last comment, the ablation is also not supporting the use of hyperbolic representation alignment. The error bars of `w/o G-I HEA ` ,`w/o HEA `, `w/o HEA + HCA ` heavily overlap and the means show a bare difference for pearson across # of genes (table 13)\n3.
