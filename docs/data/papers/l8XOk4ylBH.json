It operates by linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a *guidance weight* $\\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional alignment.\nIn order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,\nwe instead learn *guidance weights* $\\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the time $s$ towards which we denoise. \nWe achieve this by minimizing the distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process.  We extend our framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we observe improvements in Fréchet inception distance (FID) for image generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve image-prompt alignment.", "tldr": "Learn Classifier-Free guidance (CFG) weights as a function of time and conditioning to better approximate the target distribution", "keywords": ["Diffusion models", "Classifier-free Guidance", "Conditional sampling", "generative mode"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/846b94f611fdbc22b3aa3f2b398694f231fc53a2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes to introduce the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to quantitatively evaluate the distance between the CFG-guided distribution and the ground-truth one.

Beyond the main objective being directly motivated by prior works, similar idea of canceling mismatch (or \"self-consistency\") between forward diffusion and reverse denoising stages has also been proposed [1].\n\n  [1] Towards More Accurate Diffusion Model Acceleration with A Timestep Tuner. Xia et al., CVPR 2024.\n\n- The main concern about the proposed method is the optimality. There is no theoretical analysis about the optimality or convergence about the proposed objective. Then why the optimized guidance weight could guarantee the self-consistency? What further confirms my worries is in Appendix C.1. The most intuitive objective is the L2 norm in Eq. (23), which is consistent with the vanilla training loss of diffusion models, *i.e.*, the ELBO loss. However, as the authors themselves claim, such an objective leads to zero guidance weight. That is to say, **diffusion model converges well and both conditional and unconditional scores are accurate**, thus there is no need to employ CFG. Under this discussion, I am curious about the theoretical optimality of Eq. (20) or Eq. (21). Could the authors provide theoretical analyses under some trivial toy data to verify the correctness of the method? From my opinion, Eq. (21) is somewhat an upper bound of ELBO (*i.e.*, Eq. (23)). Given that ELBO itself is an upper bound of KL-divergence (by the native theory of diffusion models), the optimization of a looser bound may lead to meaningless results.\n\n- What further weakens the soundness of the paper is the employment of an auxiliary network. To be honest, such a setting could lead to more flexible guidance weight given different conditions. However, what if the network fails to converge well and only predicts sub-optimal guidance weight? The accuracy issue is more severe under open-vocabulary setting, *i.e.*, text-to-image or text-to-video. Considering that the authors employ a light-weight network, such a concern is also crucial. Could the author provide some closed-form expressions or some empirical solutions avoiding the employment of an auxiliary network?\n\n- The qualitative results of text-to-image is somewhat not convincing.

The objective is to minimize the distributional mismatch between the generated guided samples and the noised true conditional samples, using a novel self-consistency loss.

The simplified L2 objective (Eq. 21) also appears surprisingly straightforward to implement."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The proposed method involves a large number of hyperparameters to determine the optimal guidance weight, and additionally requires performing $m$ rounds of noising and comparison at every denoising step, which introduces significant computational overhead. Given this, I wonder whether the computational cost difference compared to existing guidance distillation methods is actually substantial. It would be valuable to include a cost comparison table or discussion.\n\nMoreover, since the loss function in this paper formalizes the matching between the true sample distribution and the guided one, I suspect that a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach such as LoRA could optimize a student model directly using the same loss formulation, without needing a separate guidance network at inference time. This would result in a more inference-efficient model, and I’m curious whether the authors have considered or experimented with this alternative.\n\nRegarding the design of the guidance network, the paper focuses heavily on the loss formulation for learning guidance weights but provides limited discussion or justification for the network’s architecture. The rationale behind its input-output design is unclear. Based on Table 1 and Fig. 1, 3, the conditioning input seems to have a stronger influence than expected, suggesting that incorporating the currently sampled image as an additional input could further improve weight estimation. Were such variants or conditioning combinations explored?\n\nIn the COCO experiments, the guidance network uses the text encoder output as a conditioning signal, and Fig. 3 shows that the learned guidance weights vary across prompts. Does this imply that the network has learned semantic understanding of the text embeddings? If so, how heavy must the model be to capture such semantics effectively? Additionally, from the qualitative results on COCO, the outputs often resemble those with weak or no guidance, which may indicate that the diffusion model’s original objective still struggles to fully capture the conditional distribution, similar to previous findings.\n\nFinally, in the loss formulation, the authors mention using $m=4$ particles for computing the MMD in the image domain. Even if self-consistency reduces variance, I question whether the MMD loss computed from only four samples can be sufficiently accurate. Was this number chosen primarily to reduce computational cost? If so, it would be helpful to report how performance varies with different particle counts, to justify the design choice."}, "questions": {"value": "- How does this method compare to guidance Interval approaches? The guidance interval method empirically finds an optimal guidance schedule, assigning near-zero guidance weight in early steps and large weights in the final few steps. Since the proposed method can measure how well the estimated distribution matches the true one via its loss, it may be possible to evaluate the optimality of the interval-based scheduling using the same loss metric. If so, this could open new directions for systematic guidance interval optimization beyond the work of LIG.\n- Once the optimal guidance weights are obtained through this method, could they be further distilled into a single model to achieve both high performance and inference efficiency?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "LDUPtVtTny", "forum": "l8XOk4ylBH", "replyto": "l8XOk4ylBH", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20348/Reviewer_6vA2"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20348/Reviewer_6vA2"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20348/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762012593572, "cdate": 1762012593572, "tmdate": 1762933807275, "mdate": 1762933807275, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
