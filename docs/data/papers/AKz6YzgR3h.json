However, most existing methods implicitly assume that the reference and degraded input are age-aligned, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios where only cross-age references are available, such as historical photo restoration. This paper proposes MeInTime, a diffusion-based face restoration method that extends reference-based restoration from same-age to cross-age settings. Given one or few reference images along with an age prompt corresponding to the degraded input, MeInTime achieves faithful restoration with both identity fidelity and age consistency. Specifically, we decouple the modeling of identity and age conditions. During training, we focus solely on effectively injecting identity features through a newly introduced attention mechanism and introduce Gated Residual Fusion modules to facilitate the integration between degraded features and identity representations. At inference, we propose Age-Aware Gradient Guidance, a training-free sampling strategy, using an age-driven direction to iteratively nudge the identity-aware denoising latent toward the desired age semantic manifold. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeInTime outperforms existing face restoration methods in both identity preservation and age consistency.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Blind face restoration", "Diffusion fine-tuning", "Personalized image generation", "Face identity preservation", "Text-to-Image Generation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/719df2329b25a1ccd438b3735e0a1096899abf25.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents MeInTime, a diffusion-based face restoration framework designed to handle cross-age reference-based restoration.

Under such extreme degradation, facial wrinkles and texture cues are largely lost, making it unreliable to infer age semantics from low-quality inputs. This could easily cause instability or misalignment between estimated and target ages in practice.\n\n– The method introduces a gradient-based optimization process during inference to achieve age control. However, it is not clear whether this method is better than those using face editing-based solutions on the reference image or the restored images. It remains unclear why such simpler or more direct methods are not considered or compared.\n\n– The AGE metric depends on a pretrained estimator, which might not correlate well with perceptual aging. Additional perceptual studies or human evaluations would strengthen the claims.\n\n- The so-called ID-preserving sampling in Eq. 8 effectively modifies the denoising trajectory based on facial feature gradients, which is conceptually similar to facial attribute editing or latent direction control seen in previous works such as [r1,r2] or other latent manipulation methods.

The cross-age reference setting is a rare and contrived use case. It’s unclear how many real restoration tasks actually require explicit age matching.

Limited Theoretical Analysis of Attribute Decoupling: The paper claims that identity and age are decoupled by design (identity during training, age only via gradient guidance at inference), yet it lacks a more principled investigation or proof of whether and to what extent this decoupling is reliably achieved.

Without explicit investigation, it remains somewhat speculative whether the method fully avoids entanglement between age and identity, especially under distribution shifts.\n\n2.

For example, the precise effect of the GRF module hyperparameters, the initialization process for identity/token projection, and the inferred scaling of guidance during inference are not dissected in depth.
