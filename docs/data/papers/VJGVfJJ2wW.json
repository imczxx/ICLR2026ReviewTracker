While this assumption might hold with a small $\\epsilon_i$ in semantically related cases, it may not hold in semantically unrelated batches, where $\\epsilon_i$ could be large. In such cases, the reconstruction residual would be excessively high and lose its interpretative significance. How do the authors explain this issue?\n* Is the cosine similarity in Equation $9$ order-invariant? In massive editing, the order of knowledge updates should be arbitrary, so I believe an order-invariant definition should be provided here. If it is not order-invariant, what would the empirical results look like when the order is randomized?\n* Why is preserving original knowledge defined as $\\Delta C_p = 0$? Theoretically, $C_p$ should be a positive value to ensure the protection of existing knowledge. Practically speaking, removing $C_p$ should lead to a significant drop in editing performance (intuitively), since it serves as a regularization term, especially for preserving existing knowledge (specificity metric). How do the authors justify this design choice?\n* Robustness when editing the same subject is indeed important. However, what happens if the facts about the same subject are potentially contradictory? Would the post-edit LLM produce inconsistent answers in such cases?\n* Figure 1 is not mentioned in the main text, and the last case (i.e., {Sentences | $𝑠_i$ = Jeep Commander}) requires further clarification of its meaning to make it more reader-friendly."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "mN8UzgfRLu", "forum": "VJGVfJJ2wW", "replyto": "VJGVfJJ2wW", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4398/Reviewer_jhJa"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4398/Reviewer_jhJa"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4398/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760668339047, "cdate": 1760668339047, "tmdate": 1762917339019, "mdate": 1762917339019, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies why massive editing (e.g., 10k facts at once) breaks many model-editing methods and proposes EAMET, which aligns key and residual embedding spaces during the edit step.
