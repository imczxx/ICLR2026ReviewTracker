Yet, they face a trade-off challenge: SFT excels at incorporating external knowledge but often fails to foster deep comprehension, whereas RL can internalize knowledge but struggles to expand the model's knowledge frontier. To resolve this, we propose **LESE** (**L**earning from **E**xamples and **S**elf-**E**xploration), a framework that dynamically interpolates between SFT and RL. LESE introduces an instance-adaptive mechanism that assesses a model's real-time task proficiency and exploration diversity, thereby allocating a dynamic weight between SFT and RL for each training instance. This adaptive methodology addresses the limitations of static strategies by adjusting the balance between SFT and RL at the instance level. Empirically, it improves performance on mathematical benchmarks and enhances training stability, while maintaining consistency with human-preferred outputs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Supervised Fine-Tuning", "Large Language Models", "Reinforcement Learning", "Mathematical Reasoning", "Dynamic Fusion"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/397a5f0e7886a8a057053df12ac9fddc52eaeb89.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes LESE (Learning from Examples and Self-Exploration), a way to train large language models by dynamically blending supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Instead of fixing their ratio (static), LESE adjusts it per example based on how well the model understands the task (task mastery) and how diverse its solutions are (exploration diversity). This helps the model stay stable when it’s uncertain and explore more once it’s confident. It also uses a filtering technique to filter out training on examples that already get good rewards. With fine-grained rewards for clearer feedback, LESE outperforms existing methods on several math benchmarks (ID, OOD), showing better reasoning, stability, and generalization."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "I think this paper explores a really interesting direction by trying to **dynamically combine SFT and RLHF** instead of treating them as separate stages.

The explanation of Exploration Diversity (D) is unclear. The equation introduces a summation over N without defining what N represents or how it relates to the reward components. It would help to clarify whether N is the number of reward signals or samples, and how exactly D is computed (per instance or across batches).\n\n2. Figure 3 is confusing. What exactly does R_format represent? What are the y-axis units or limits? If I understand correctly, the GRPO curve actually rises faster at the beginning — so why does the text claim that “LESE converges rapidly and maintains stable preference rewards”? Do you mean a different phase of training or a different metric? It would help to clarify this or add a zoom-in or wall-clock-time plot to support the claim.\n\n3. I’d like to see a concrete example comparing LESE with a standard SFT then RL pipeline on the same prompt. Showing the original model’s answer and how it improves through each training regime would make the adaptive mechanism much easier to understand.\n\n4. Similarly, providing an example with outputs from SFT-only, RL-only, and LESE for one problem would help illustrate the differences in behavior — for instance, how SFT falls into the imitation trap, how RL might show exploration risks, and how LESE balances the two.\n\n5. The experiments are limited to mathematical reasoning tasks. Have you tried LESE on other domains like coding or logical reasoning to test its generality? That would strengthen the paper’s broader claims.\n\n6. It would be useful to quantify the rollout efficiency gains introduced by the “saturated instance filtering” mechanism. How many rollouts per prompt are actually skipped compared to standard SFT→RL training? Presenting this comparison would make the efficiency argument more convincing.\n\n7.

Method generality\n  * Most results are on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B–style math solvers. While the results are positive, adding tasks such from reasoning gym, which are harder to solve would also improve confidence in the method. Qwen 2.5-1B is know to have poor initial performance on these tasks.   \n\n2.  Diversity collapse / pass@k vs pass@1 \n  * When $\\alpha$ is low (ie. more SFT), do we see any loss of diversity in outputs?  \n  * Concretely: how does LESE affect pass@k (best-of-k sampling) vs pass@1? RL-style exploration often helps pass@k more than pass@1; heavy SFT pressure might over-regularize toward a single canonical answer style.  \n  * If entropy collapse is an issue with standard GRPO baseline, having the comparison would be helpful.\n\n3. Choice of mastery threshold c, number of rollouts.\n   * How is the mastery cutoff c picked in practice? Is it tuned per dataset, fixed globally, or annealed? Please report sensitivity to c, since $\\alpha$ rises sharply once M crosses c. In the appendix, for the math specific task, c=0. This assumes that the model if unable to solve an instance will rely completely on SFT.  \n   * The appendix states that only 4 rollouts were used, can this be increased to mitigate the stability issues for RL mentioned in the Appendix? - An ablation on how number of rollouts affect the stability of the method would strengthen the paper.\n\n4. Section 4.2 – using output length as confidence.\n  * The authors claim that LESE gives short answers when confident and longer chains when uncertain. That’s plausible, but length is only a proxy for hardness/uncertainty. Stronger metrics would make the claim better.\n\n5. Line 266: fine-grained reward\n   * The authors mention a fine-grained / multi-component reward. Can you spell out the components (format correctness, reasoning validity, final answer match, etc.), how they’re combined, and whether weights are hand-tuned or learned? This is important for reproducibility and for understanding how generalizable the approach is beyond math-style verifiable tasks.  \n   * Details in appendix are for math related datasets, would similar reward functions have to be handcrafted for any RLVR task?\n\n6. Out-of-domain alignment degradation.\n  * To argue the SFT component isn’t overbearing, can you add evals on unrelated chat / instruction benchmarks (e.g. open-ended dialogue like WildChat, safety / helpfulness like MT-Bench) to check that LESE hasn’t harmed general usability? This would also help position the method as “alignment-friendly,” not just math tuning. Especially since high levels of SFT have been shown to hurt model performance.\n\n7. Curriculum details (Appendix A).: The authors  mention a hand-crafted curriculum.  \n  * How exactly is that curriculum in the training data curated (sampling weights? staged unfreezing? ordering of problems)? Is it model specific? This is unclear from the details in the appendix  \n  * The related work section would benefit from a discussion on curriculum learning as well, and not just RLHF vs SFT."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "rQohDKtpwP", "forum": "5v0p0Bmp6S", "replyto": "5v0p0Bmp6S", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24956/Reviewer_knXr"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24956/Reviewer_knXr"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24956/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761972410801, "cdate": 1761972410801, "tmdate": 1762943260774, "mdate": 1762943260774, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work proposes instance-level dynamic fusion of SFT (using expert examples) and RL (via self-exploration).\nThis is done by adaptively weighting their losses, based on task mastery and exploration diversity:\nintuitively, the method increases SFT weight when task mastery is low or exploration diversity is limited, and increases RL weight otherwise.\nEmpirical comparison with prior SFT-RL fusion methods are conducted on math and reasoning benchmarks."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- Presents a reasonable motivation and practical approach for instance-level dynamic fusion of SFT and RL, in contrast to prior fusion methods that are largely static.\n- Shows promising empirical performance compared to selected baselines."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Concerns about experimental setup:**\n\n- Different reward designs are used for baseline methods, according to Appendix A.5.
