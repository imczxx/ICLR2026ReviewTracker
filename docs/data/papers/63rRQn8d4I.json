To address this, we propose TimeRM, a simple yet effective residual modeling framework. We decompose the time series into periodic and residual components. The Multi-Level Decoupling (MLD) module processes the residuals, extracting sub-residuals that capture hierarchical temporal patterns and supply the main model with previously neglected dynamics. We further introduce the Multi-level Sub-residual Compensation (MSRC) module, based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which captures entangled temporal patterns, quantifies their contribution to the sequence, compensates the primary residual, and thereby reduces the impact of unmodeled dynamics. Additionally, to resolve the issue of insufficient representation of expert models when handling data with complex channel characteristics, we propose the Multi-Expert Coupling (MEC) module to predict sub-residuals, enhancing the prediction of neglected channel features through a multi-level coupling approach to improve model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeRM framework outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Time Series Forecasting; Non-Stationary Reconstruct; Random Fluctuation; Noise"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fd053185d3bfa6547411040c7215da84ce2a441a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/86643037fde5aa7f75f64454f6300c803b40ad1f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the TimeRM framework to model residual components in time-series forecasting: MLD extracts hierarchical sub-residuals; MSRC uses a mixture-of-experts to capture temporal patterns; MEC integrates high-dimensional channel features."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Most of the core components are standard or well-established modules from existing literature, with little novel contribution.\n\nW2: The paper’s review of SOTA methods is not comprehensive. For example, it overlooks Linear-based methods such as FITS [1], RNN-based improvements like PGN [2], and Attention-based approaches such as Leddam [3].\n\n[1] FITS: Modeling Time Series with 10k Parameters.

In Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning.\n\nW3: The experiments lack critical details. The paper does not provide any information about the hyperparameter search space, making it unclear whether the authors performed hyperparameter tuning for all baseline methods on the validation set before reporting results on the test set. This process needs to be clearly described:\n\n(a) If hyperparameter search was conducted, the full search space for each dataset and task, as well as the final selected parameters, should be provided.\n\n(b) If no such search was performed, the experimental results are questionable. Even with the same parameters and random seeds, results can vary across different hardware platforms. To ensure fair and rigorous comparisons, all methods should be run on the same platform, using a unified and sufficiently broad hyperparameter search space, selecting the best parameters on the validation set, and then evaluating on the test set. This is necessary to eliminate the influence of platform differences and hyperparameter sensitivity on model performance, and is essential for fair model comparison. If this was not done, additional experiments are required.\n\n(c) Regarding model efficiency analysis, it should be clarified whether the compared baseline models used consistent hidden dimensions, batch sizes, number of layers, etc., to ensure fairness in efficiency comparisons.\n\nW4: The model lacks consistency and generalization ability. Currently, TimeRM primarily uses MSRC on low-dimensional datasets and MEC on high-dimensional datasets. This indicates that different processing modules must be selected for different datasets, suggesting that TimeRM’s two implementations are scenario-dependent and lack generalization capability.\n\nW5: The effectiveness of the main contribution to time series prediction is questionable. The final prediction process in the paper consists of two steps: aligning and integrating the residual analysis with the seasonal information Cy, resulting in the final output y. Is it possible that most of the observable performance gains of the model primarily come from the fitting of Cy, by the seasonal branch/RCF module and the \"addition of seasonality,\" rather than from the core contributions claimed in the paper, the multi-level residual decoupling (MLD) and multi-expert compensation (MSRC/MEC) design?
