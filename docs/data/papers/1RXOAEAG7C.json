Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a promising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of conformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce Torsional- GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample conformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution, using only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular graph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples rotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is able to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann distribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for zero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD simulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for scaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local structure into the GFlowNet model.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["GFLowNet", "molecular conformations", "torsion angles", "Boltzmann distribution", "generative models"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/12360a9eea0dc2c1d6551d3ad8d97a0c84bde6a7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce Torsional-GFN, a GFlowNet-based method to sample molecular conformations (and energies) proportional to the Boltzmann distribution.

However, the results on unseen test molecules are very inconsistent, with one molecule performing okay and the other having no correlation with the true distribution. Therefore, it is difficult to claim that the generalization to unseen test molecules works well, meaning in my opinion the paper does not achieve its main motivation. Beyond this main weakness, additional concerns include:\n\n1. The authors claim that \"if we care about the full potential energy landscape, [RDKit] approximations do not hold.\" However, I don't see how Appendix A.3.4 addresses this problem. A.3.4 includes data on the bond lengths not matching exactly with MD, but to really show that the approximation is inaccurate I'd like to see the energy landscape from RDKit plotted against that from MD.\n2. There are no baselines besides MD. Including previous works that do Boltzmann sampling, such as Lahlou et al. 2023, would be informative as a point of comparison (although I understand that their model requires training for each new molecule). Other baselines that are applicable, I think, include Noe et al. 2019 and some of the diffusion models mentioned in the Related Work.\n3. MD sampling is done in vacuum, which I believe is not really interesting for many drug discovery applications. I think simulations should be done in solvent."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
