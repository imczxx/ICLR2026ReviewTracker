However, existing federated unlearning approaches may overlook the overlapping information between the unlearning and retained datasets, leading to ineffective unlearning and unfairness between clients. We revisit this problem through the lens of memorization, showing that only unique memorization information from the unlearning dataset should be removed, while shared patterns should remain. Subsequently, we propose the Grouped Memorization Evaluation, a metric that distinguishes memorized from shared knowledge, and introduce Federated Memorization Eraser (FedMemEraser), a pruning-based method that resets redundant parameters carrying memorization information.

In Section 6.2, during Stage 1, the manuscript uses the average gradient magnitude to evaluate the amount of memorized information in the parameters. However, the authors do not provide sufficient justification and evidence for the superiority and necessity of this step. Moreover, the rationale behind the selection of the threshold hyperparameter for filtering is not thoroughly explained—how is the predetermined percentage of initialized parameters determined? In addition, the method does not appear to account for sensitivity differences across layers.\n2. The manuscript discusses the issue of overlapping and non-overlapping information. Since the proposed method aims to remove non-overlapping information while preserving overlapping information, would the presence of retained clients whose data distributions are similar to that of the forgetting client affect the evaluation results?\n3. The core assumption that “memorized information is equivalent to non-overlapping information” appears to be overly idealized. In Equation (3), $F_m=F_u-F_g$ is defined as the memorized information, but the manuscript does not explain how to concretely distinguish between “overlapping” and “non-overlapping” components in the feature space. Given that the feature distributions are highly nonlinear, an empirical definition alone cannot guarantee that $F_m$ truly corresponds to the memorized portion.\n4. The assumption regarding redundant parameters in FedMemEraser lacks validation in Stage 1. The key premise of the algorithm is that small-gradient parameters correspond to memorized information. This assumption is too absolute and lacks theoretical justification or empirical support.\n5. FedMemEraser consists of three phases: positioning, resetting, and fine-tuning. If only positioning and reset phases are performed without fine-tuning, what would happen to the forgetting effect and generalization performance of the model? How much forgetting effect does the reset operation itself contribute, and how much does the subsequent fine-tuning contribute?\n6. The manuscript's experiments mainly focus on client level forgetting.
