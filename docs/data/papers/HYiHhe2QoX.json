In many real-world settings, this assumption fails, motivating the monitored Markov decision process (Mon-MDP), where rewards may be unobserved. Prior work on Mon-MDPs has been limited to simple, tabular cases, restricting their applicability to real-world problems. This work explores Mon-MDPs using function approximation and investigates the challenges. We show that combining function approximation with a learned reward model enables agents to generalize from monitored states with observable rewards to unmonitored states with unobservable rewards. Therefore, we demonstrate that such generalization with a reward model achieves near-optimal policies in environments formally defined as unsolvable. However, we also uncover a critical limitation: agents may incorrectly extrapolate rewards due to *overgeneralization*, which can lead to undesirable behaviors. To mitigate overgeneralization, we propose a cautious policy optimization method leveraging reward uncertainty. This work serves as a step towards bridging the gap between Mon-MDP theory and real-world applications.", "tldr": "Extend Monitored-MDPs to non-tabular environments using function approximation and investigates the associated challenges.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning", "Monitored-MDPs", "Partially observable rewards", "Generalization", "Function approximation", "Caution", "Partial Observability", "RL Safety", "DQN", "CVaR", "Reward Model"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b3cd00407762a03ada6ab8b619778a27a3e2e37b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/bb01f20f5a6b7f33a4fa4f25f6ae51be896ab712.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the integration of function approximators into traditional tabular (monitored) MDPs to enhance scalability.

These settings could be modeled without a stateful monitor MDP, and there are some papers that do just that. To justify the general model, I recommend adding scenarios with nontrivial monitor dynamics (at least giving examples where stateful monitor MDP makes sense, e.g., even the watering robot example in the introduction is vague and not clear what the monitor MDP is in that example) or, alternatively, narrowing the claims to the studied special cases.\n\n2) Role of $r_M$ is very non-intuitive\n\nBecause the objective maximizes $r_𝑀+r_E$ , the monitor reward acts as an arbitrary scalarization of two objectives. \n=0; the paper gives no guidance for selecting $r_M$. (e.g. Binary monitor example or no-monitor experiments can be really different with different $r_M$ selection, again in the watering robot example, what is $r_M$ ) . For now, I think it is just reflective ofthe  cost of observation or something similar\n\n3) About Contribution 3\n\n The ‘overgeneralization’ result (watering cacti unseen during training) is unsurprising given that rewards for cacti are never revealed. As framed, it reads more like an instance of standard distribution shift than a novel Mon-MDP phenomenon. The paper does add a metric and a cautious policy mitigation, but the underlying failure case is expected. One way to circumvent it will be to make the failure non-obvious. e.g., create unmonitored states that are feature-similar to monitored ones (not a new class), show the ratio spikes anyway, then show the mitigation helps; or show a case where FA surprisingly doesn’t fail due to representation structure.\n\n\n4)What is not tested is the reward misspecification under the mon-MDP setting.
