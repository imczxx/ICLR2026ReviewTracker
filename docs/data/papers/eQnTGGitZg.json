Executing a web task based on the intent expressed by a user requires carrying out a sequence of steps which presents several challenges owing to complex nature of web workflows and variation across web interfaces. Several past works which have proposed agentic framework for web workflow execution either employ a fixed static call sequence while invoking LLM agents or stack calls to code-based functions during runtime. Further, limited attention has been given to designing adaptable LLM-based web agents with dynamically tunable prompts. To this end, we propose AutoWeave , an agentic framework comprising of a suite of LLM-based agents to anticipate future possibilities due to an action by looking-ahead and simulate the suitability of actions during each step of workflow execution. The deliberation between the agents is facilitated by an orchestrator LLM agent which dynamically invokes the next appropriate agent based on interaction between the agents and the workflow executed so far. In addition, the orchestrator agent refines the prompt for each agent based on the task context before calling it during deliberation. We establish the efficacy of AutoWeave on a variety of benchmarks comprising 1) real-world websites like WebVoyager and 2) simulated web environments like WebArena with relative gains of 10% and 22% respectively over the best baselines. We show that AutoWeave consistently improves the performance of LLM-based web agents for multiple model families like Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5. Further, we conduct extensive ablations to verify the effectiveness of each agent in AutoWeave and the importance of Orchestrator for dynamic invocation of agents and prompt adaptation.", "tldr": "A framework for web workflow automation comprising of an orchestrator agent that dynamically invokes diverse LLM agents to deliberate the suitability of actions.", "keywords": ["Web Workflow Automation", "LLM Agents", "Orchestration", "Prompt Adaptation", "Lookahead Agent", "Observation Space Reduction"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3e4bb11095ef67d21ba2a52373cafb75eb0e585f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes an agentic framework for LLM-based web agents that anticipate future possibilities for step-wise action improvement with multi-agent orchestration.

All the designs of such workflows are not validated on OOD benchmarks (e.g., replace the observation reduction agent with other agent that can handle observations of different domains).\n- The analysis of computing budget is not given for a fair comparison with baselines. It remains unknown the amount of tokens consumed for each baseline and how the proposed method performs on par with a similar resource budget. Especially from Fig.5, it can be observed that smaller turns (e.g., 5 turns) result in performance of WebArena (~23%) and WebVoyager (~36%) which are respectively lower than baselines (e.g., STeP, Agent-E).\n- There exists no analysis on the performance of each role (sub-agent). For example, how well is the summarization? How accurate is the simulation of one-step forward? How effective is the prompt tuned for each task? Too many details are missing and honestly the reviewer cannot get much valuable information from the provided ablation study tables. How should we interpret the system?

And try to replace those components with general ones (e.g., sub-agent) for testing under OOD domains. Otherwise, the reviewer feels uncertain if the proposed framework can really make a difference rather than overfitting those two benchmarks.\n- The comparison is not fair since the involved methods: 1) might not be reimplemented under the same experimental settings (instead directly cited only from their papers); 2) might consume different token budgets. The reviewer is concerned about the performance versus computing for comparison as scaling test-time computing is often positively associated with performance growth. It is unfair to simply run more turns (e.g., more reflection; more refinement; more voting) for performance gains.\n- The illustration is poor with too small font size. Please consider improve the readability of texts in figures.\n- Please add more discussions on the sub-agent performance itself.

AutoWeave tackles a major limitation in web agents: fixed pipelines and static prompts cause stalls, over-deliberation, and broken behavior across diverse webpages and sub-tasks. The proposed system adds an LLM orchestrator that dynamically routes control among a few specialized agents with pre-defined roles (evidence reduction, action proposal, look-ahead, critic/validator, selector) and performs prompt adaptation each step to inject recent context and feedback. The key insight is that which agent to call next and how to prompt them matters as much as raw model capacity, as targeted agent routing plus small prompt edits reduces hallucinated actions and avoids wasteful tree search. Evaluation results on major web agent benchmarks (WebArena and WebVoyager) demonstrate that orchestration + prompt adaptation is a practical recipe for more reliable, cost-efficient web agents that remains modular and reproducible."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. Very smart and solid design based on multi-agent and context adaptation philosophy. One thing I like about the design of AutoWeave is that the multi-agent workflow is not fixed. Instead, the orchestrator dynamically decide which specialized agent to call for the next step. After picking an agent, the orchestrator adapts its input prompt based on recent context and feedback. This is an idea widely adopted in recent work in agentic systems and context engineering, as this approach is training-free and flexible during runtime. Overall, the agentic system design is very reasonable and echoes with many classic design philosophy in multi-agent systems / context engineering. \n\n2. Evaluation is comprehensive and results are good. Both WebArena and WebVoyager are very challenging and popular benchmarks in the research field. Numbers are really good as compared to existing web agent systems like STeP and AgentOccam (+6%~+10%). Microbenchmarks in 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 show that AutoWeave is a generalizable and efficient solution. \n\n3. Visualizations (Figures 1, 2, 3) are super helpful in terms of understanding how the agentic system works.
