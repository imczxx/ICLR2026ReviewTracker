There is no evaluation of how rule confidence aligns with contribution scores or ground-truth relevance. A simple correlation or fidelity metric would help validate that interpretability is not merely descriptive.\n2.\tCounterfactual and causal reasoning terminology ambiguity.\nAlthough the title and abstract emphasize “reasoning,” the framework is purely observational—confidence estimation depends only on empirical Δ-lag statistics (Sec. 4.2). There is no notion of intervention, counterfactual simulation, or temporal causation. Clarifying the term “reasoning” to mean “pattern-based temporal inference” would avoid conceptual confusion.\n3.\tTwo-stage confidence fitting without sensitivity analysis.\nIn Eq. (14), the confidence function is decomposed into recency and frequency components fitted sequentially. This procedure lacks quantitative analysis of whether the order of fitting (recency-first) affects the balance between short- and long-term contributions. The absence of a sensitivity or ablation study limits understanding of parameter robustness.\n4.\tSimplifying assumptions in the noisy-OR aggregation.\nThe truncated decayed noisy-OR (Sec. 4.3) aggregates top-H rule confidences under an implicit conditional independence assumption. The paper acknowledges this simplification (last paragraph of Sec. 4.3) but does not empirically test its effect—e.g., whether correlated rules inflate probability estimates. A diagnostic example or comparison with a logistic combiner could strengthen this section.\n5.\tLimited evaluation horizon.\nExperiments (Sec. 5) only cover single-step extrapolation. While this setting is common in temporal KGs, the paper does not analyze how rule confidence behaves under longer horizons or sparser timestamps, leaving uncertainty about the model’s stability for multi-step forecasting."}, "questions": {"value": "1.\tConfidence function shape: In Fig. 4, learned confidence curves exhibit various non-monotonic shapes. Could you characterize the conditions under which these curves are monotonic or peaked, and how such shapes affect prediction reliability?\n2.\tSensitivity to H and decay parameters: The noisy-OR aggregator uses truncation parameter H and decay D (Sec. 4.3). Have you explored how varying these parameters impacts both MRR and rule interpretability? For instance, does larger H lead to overcounting correlated rules?\n3.\tRule family contributions: The paper defines four rule types (xy, c, z, f). Could you report which families contribute most to top-ranked predictions across datasets? An aggregated table of rule coverage or confidence variance would clarify their relative importance.\n4.\tTemporal granularity: Since datasets such as ICEWS and GDELT have different time resolutions, how does the choice of window W affect the fitted recency decay parameters? Is there evidence that these parameters are transferable across datasets?\n5.\tScalability breakdown: Can you provide more detailed timing results—such as per-dataset CPU time for rule extraction and fitting—to better substantiate the “CPU-efficient” claim?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5U1b1vRD4j", "forum": "GhjeTkOEDG", "replyto": "GhjeTkOEDG", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12131/Reviewer_Qwtd"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12131/Reviewer_Qwtd"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12131/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761834056019, "cdate": 1761834056019, "tmdate": 1762923092562, "mdate": 1762923092562, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"title": {"value": "Author Response to All Reviewers"}, "comment": {"value": "We thank the reviewers for their insightful reviews. \n\nWe are glad to see that the reviewers liked the\n* Interpretability and transparency of the model `(Qwtd, 2EQa, jc2c)` as well as the explicit explanations `(2EQa)` and the explainer tool `(Qwtd)`\n* Fully interpretable confidence functions with clear recency and frequency components and intuitive parameters `(Qwtd, 2EQa)`\n* Comprehensive empirical evaluation across nine datasets, including ablations `(Qwtd, 2EQa, jc2c)` and reproducibility due to code, datasets, and detailed appendices `(Qwtd)`\n* Competitive accuracy and scalability, even with a simple, CPU-only model `(Qwtd, jc2c)`\n\n\nWe appreciate the constructive feedback from the reviewers to help improve our paper.
