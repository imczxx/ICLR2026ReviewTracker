Yet existing discrete diffusion models require hundreds of refinement steps for high-quality text, undermining the efficiency gains of parallelism. We introduce the Consistent Diffusion Language Model (CDLM), a new family of generative models that brings the benefits of consistency training---enforcing agreement across noise levels to enable one- or few-step generation---to the discrete domain. Our approach leverages an exact closed-form formulation of discrete posteriors, providing a rigorous analogue to the missing probability-flow ODE in discrete space. This yields a multi-path consistency objective that, as we show, unifies and generalizes popular diffusion, consistency, and distillation methods in a single view. To ensure stability at scale, we introduce a set of principled design choices that prevent training pathologies like mode collapse. On conditional and unconditional text-generation benchmarks, CDLM establishes new state of the art as a single-stage model, consistently outperforming both base and distilled DLMs across sampling budgets. These results position CDLM as a new paradigm for efficient, scalable, and high-fidelity discrete generative modeling.

Moreover, the loss does not require distillation from a teacher model (i.e., can be trained from scratch), which is a nice property. The authors also provide conceptual comparisons with related methods such as the vanilla masked diffusion model, consistency models, and distillation-based methods.

Also, I don't fully understand the motivation and feel that the learning objective is not well defined. I won't lean towards acceptance unless these issues are sufficiently addressed in the rebuttal.\n\n1. The notations in the paper are mainly **token level** instead of **sequence level**. For instance, in section 2, $\\mathbf{x} _ 0\\in\\mathcal{X}$ is defined as a *sequence* of one-hot tokens (so I thought $\\mathcal{X}\\subset(\\\\{0,1\\\\}^V)^{|\\mathbf{x}|}$), but the transition matrix $\\mathbf{Q} _ t$ has dimensions of $V\\times V$, so I realize $\\mathbf{x} _ 0$ still represents a single token and $\\mathcal{X}\\subset\\\\{0,1\\\\}^{V}$. Everything after that (except in algorithm 2) seems to be all operating on token level. However, we all know that the actual language modeling task is on sequence level. While I understand this simplifies the presentation to some extent, it loses many important implementation details for dealing with sequences, and made me very confused when reading the paper. I hope the authors can clarify this point. I also suggest removing the one-hot representation and using token indices instead, as otherwise the matrix multiplications with $\\mathbf{Q} _ t$ would be hard to follow.\n\n2. The learning objective is also very unclear to me due to the token-level notation. First, in definitions 2 and 3, what's the range of $f$ when we input a partially masked sequence $\\mathbf{x} _ t$ and a time $t$? Is it $(\\Delta^V)^{|\\mathbf{x} _ t|}$ or something else? If it is $(\\Delta^V)^{|\\mathbf{x} _ t|}$, (i) is there any mechanism to model the correlation between different masked positions, as we are doing few-step generation that would involve unmasking multiple positions simultaneously, (ii) for non-mask dimensions in $\\mathbf{x} _ t$, will the output at those dimensions matter (because in the cross-entropy loss for training masked diffusion models, only the logit output at masked positions are used to compute the loss), and (iii) what's the explicit form of the loss $\\mathbb{D}(f _ \\theta(\\mathbf{x} _ t,t)||f _ {\\bar\\theta}(\\mathbf{x} _ s,s))$ in equation (9), considering the dimensions that are masked in $\\mathbf{x} _ t$ but unmasked in $\\mathbf{x} _ s$? I think clarifying these points will help readers better understand the learning objective. Also, it would be helpful if the authors could provide the code in the link to the anonymous repository so that we can better understand the implementation details, which is currently empty.\n\n3. I feel equation (8) is not well-defined. The optimal predictor $f ^ * $ is defined to satisfy the equality $f ^ * (\\mathbf{x} _ t,t)=\\mathbb{E} _ {q(\\mathbf{x} _ s|\\mathbf{x} _ t,\\mathbf{x} _ 0)}[f ^ * (\\mathbf{x} _ s,s)]$. The left-hand side does not depend on $\\mathbf{x} _ 0$, while the right-hand side does. There are infinitely many clean data sequences $\\mathbf{x} _ 0$ that can be masked into $\\mathbf{x} _ t$, so how can the equality hold for all possible $\\mathbf{x} _ 0$? Judging from lemma 2, it seems that we need to take an expectation over $\\mathbf{x} _ 0$ on the right-hand side as well, i.e., assume that I can swap the order of $\\mathbb{E}$ and $\\mathbb{D}$, we want to match $f ^ * (\\mathbf{x} _ t,t)$ with $\\mathbb{E} _ {q(\\mathbf{x} _ 0|\\mathbf{x} _ t)}[\\mathbb{E} _ {q(\\mathbf{x} _ s|\\mathbf{x} _ t,\\mathbf{x} _ 0)}[f ^ * (\\mathbf{x} _ s,s)]]=\\mathbb{E} _ {q(\\mathbf{x} _ s|\\mathbf{x} _ t)}[f ^ * (\\mathbf{x} _ s,s)]$ as the dependency on $\\mathbf{x} _ 0$ is marginalized out. I think this is a more reasonable definition of the optimal predictor, but whether this swap is applicable is unknown, so I am not sure if this is what the authors intended. Finally, does the optimal predictor have an analytical expression if we take $\\mathbb{D}$ to be some simple divergence such as KL or $L^2$? Of course, if the swap is valid, i.e., $f ^ * (\\mathbf{x} _ t,t)=\\mathbb{E} _ {q(\\mathbf{x} _ s|\\mathbf{x} _ t)}[f ^ * (\\mathbf{x} _ s,s)]$, we know it is the posterior distribution $\\\\{q(\\mathbf{x} _ 0|\\mathbf{x} _ t):\\forall\\mathbf{x} _ 0\\\\}$."}, "questions": {"value": "My main questions are detailed in the weaknesses above. In addition, I also have a few more minor comments:\n\n1. The presentation of figure 2 can be improved to be more clear and have better visual effects.\n\n2. I don't think it's necessary to present the transition matrix $\\mathbf{Q} _ t$. For masked diffusion models, the forward and backward probabilities as well as the posterior bridge operator can be defined directly.\n\n3. From equation (10), is it possible to finetune (distill) a pretrained masked diffusion model into a CDLM? This may be an interesting experiment to try.\n\n4. Assume $\\mathbb{D}$ is symmetric, is there any intuitive reason for preferring $\\mathbb{D}(f _ \\theta(\\mathbf{x} _ t,t)||f _ {\\bar\\theta}(\\mathbf{x} _ s,s))$ over $\\mathbb{D}(f _ {\\bar\\theta}(\\mathbf{x} _ t,t)||f _ \\theta(\\mathbf{x} _ s,s))$?\n\n5. When sampling from CDLM, the procedure described in section 3.1 can't correct the generated tokens at previous steps, as once a token is generated it will always be fixed under the posterior bridge operator. This is a little bit different from the continuous consistency model where the predicted $\\mathbf{x} _ 0$ will be renoised so that all dimensions are updated.

Because the training loss contains another forward pass on the $\\mathbf{x}_s$ sequence as well, when the training steps are the same, the training FLOPs double. Hence, I do not believe the authors have conducted a fair comparison in their paper.

Therefore, the work can be considered significant."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Presentation and relation to regular Consistency Models:** The paper motivates CDLM from the perspective of consistency models from the continuous diffusion literature, even calling their method \"*Consistent* Diffusion Language Model\". I think this is misleading, because the method really behaves very differently compared to regular consistency models. Since the posterior bridge involves an expectation over $x_s$, training CDLM necessarily always incorporates some form of averaging over different $x_s$ and the corresponding predictions, which prevents learning a perfect few-step denoiser. This is in contrast to the ODE-based consistency objective in regular consistency models, which does not incorporate such an expectation. For instance, I believe it is fundamentally impossible to learn an accurate one-step denoiser from all-mask states with CDLM's objective, while this is possible in regular consistency models. Hence, the way the work is presented is misleading, as readers may falsely get the impression that this is a direct generalization of consistency models to diffusion language models, but this is not the case. I would suggest the authors to better discuss this and present the method accordingly.\n\n**Theoretical justification:** Related to the above point, the paper misses a rigorous theoretical justification for the proposed objective. For regular consistency models, as discussed above, the perfect minimizer of the objective would be a perfect one-step generator, maintaining the original generated distribution. What would the perfect minimizer of the proposed objective here correspond to, given the averaging over $x_s$? Again, this is a very different situation compared to regular consistency models.\n\n**1-step results:** CDLM seems to completely fail in single-step generation (Figure 1). This is again evidence that the model behaves entirely different compared to regular consistency models, which can produce good single-step samples.\n\n**Relation to SDTT:** The method is similar to Self-Distillation Through Time, with the main difference being that here we are training from scratch, whereas SDTT uses a teacher.\n\n**Ad-how modifications and hyperparameters:** It seems the method can only be trained to high performance with additional modifications (mixing in a regular diffusion language model loss) and carefully chosen hyperparameters, like step size $\\delta$ and $\\kappa_{ms}$ schedules. The necessity for these adaptations calls into question how principled the approach is, aligned with the comments above.\n\n**Quality-diversity tradeoff:** The numerical results suggest that there is a quality-diversity tradeoff, also evidenced by the need to train two different models (CDLM vs. CDLM-PPLOptimized). While the method achieves strong generative perplexity, this seems to come with reduced entropy. The reason for this is not discussed in detail, and -- related to my above points -- this is also fundamentally different from regular consistency models, which learn the exact noise-to-data mapping without loss in diversity.
