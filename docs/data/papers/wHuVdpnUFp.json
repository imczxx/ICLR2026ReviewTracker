Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and feature learning methods.  In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts of training data. We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced tabular foundation models (TabPFN-v2) and GBDTs,  xRFM achieves best performance across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across $200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides  interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.", "tldr": "We develop a non-neural, non-boosting kernel method that is state-of-the-art for supervised learning of tabular datasets.", "keywords": ["Tabular data", "kernel methods", "tree-based methods"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e3ab8af8d140a7e0f0273bffccdddb7208881683.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e29f3a7bab915d5dad14683b5085b38e67885c1d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new architecture for tabular prediction tasks called xRFM.
