However, current large-scale datasets predominantly focus on low-frequency time series with sampling intervals, i.e., time resolution, in the range of seconds to years, hindering their ability to capture the nuances of high-frequency time series data. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel dataset that captures millisecond-resolution wireless and traffic conditions from an operational 5G wireless deployment, expanding the scope of TSFMs to incorporate high-frequency data for pre-training. Further, the dataset introduces a new domain, wireless networks, thus complementing existing more general domains like energy and finance. The dataset also provides use cases for short-term forecasting, with prediction horizons spanning from 100 milliseconds (1 step) to 9.6 seconds (96 steps). By benchmarking traditional machine learning models and TSFMs on predictive tasks using this dataset, we demonstrate that TSFMs perform poorly on this new data distribution in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Our work underscores the importance of incorporating high-frequency datasets during pre-training and forecasting to enhance architectures, fine-tuning strategies, generalization, and robustness of TSFMs in real-world applications.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["High-frequency data", "Time series foundation models", "Short-term forecasting", "Wireless networks"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/be9a5f23a2a604bb5026444597783387629624b4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/19192c95babaa8992de335f1a0d307a745375eca.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the important challenge of adapting TSFMs to high-frequency data, a domain that is currently underrepresented in standard pre-training benchmarks.

It is a significant leap to assume this one dataset can adequately represent the diverse challenges of all high-frequency data, which might include high-frequency finance, industrial sensor readings, or biometrics, each with unique properties. The authors should be more precise in their claims, positioning this as a valuable benchmark for high-frequency communication network data, rather than a general solution for the entire high-frequency gap.\n2. I found a jarring inconsistency in the description of the experimental methodology. In Section 4, the authors state that the multivariate setting uses \"four input features\".

While Limitations (Section 5) mention this, the omission is significant, especially since ARF’s advantage may partly stem from online adaptation absent in the TSFM attempts.\n\n**W3** Baselines: Shallow models use modest hyperparameter tuning, and TSFM implementations are described as \"default.\" More systematic and rigorous HPO or ensembling (which is routine for robust time series baselines) could potentially close some of the reported performance gap, as acknowledged in Section 5, raising questions about the finality of the reported results.\n\n**W4** Metrics and Fairness of Comparison: Although considerable care goes into aligning horizon evaluation, there are differences in how the models exploit input features, prediction structure, and context.
