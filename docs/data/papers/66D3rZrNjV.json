Prior work on standard large language models proposed two approaches: advanced \\emph{verbalized confidence} (VC), where the model self-checks its chain-of-thought or directly reports its own certainty, and \\emph{self-consistency} (SC), where the agreement across multiple stochastic samples of the answers to the same question indicates reliability. How these methods behave in LRMs, with long, rich, and internally branching reasoning traces, remains unclear. \n\nWe present the first systematic evaluation of six VC methods, SC, and their hybrid (VCSC) across nine scientific benchmarks and three LRMs. We find that advanced VC instructions bring little benefit, sometimes reducing accuracy on mathematical tasks, and improving AUROC by about three percentage points on non-mathematical tasks. By contrast, VC-based parallel sampling and hybridization deliver dramatic gains: with just two repeats, VCSC improves AUROC by over 10 points on average. With larger budgets, parallel VC alone can approach perfect discrimination, as in the distilled DeepSeek model on AIME where AUROC reaches 1.0.\n\nThese results establish VCSC as a simple, overlooked, and highly effective recipe for uncertainty estimation in LRMs, and deepen our understanding of how these models expose and exploit their own uncertainty.", "tldr": "Combining verbalized confidence and self-consistency in reasoning LLMs shows that just two samples are enough to achieve strong and reliable confidence estimation.

From a comparison of three models on 3 math and 2 general reasoning datasets, the authors present a mixed picture, with many methods offering similar AUROC when predicting final answer correctness. The authors additionally evaluate the role of number of sampled traces, but again report a mixed picture where the effect of number of parallel samples varies by model for self-consistency, but appears to positive increase AUROC for average verbalized confidence. Finally, the authors evaluate a combination of self-consistency and averaged verbalized confidence (controlled by a mixing hyperparameter, lambda), and report relatively strong results when using 2 or more sampled traces."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "* The linear combination of verbalized confidence and self-consistency appears to be relatively insensitive to the mixing hyperparameter lambda, which would support its practical application.\n* The choice of AUROC as an evaluation metric is well-motivated, given discriminative power is more important than calibrated estimates in this context.\n* The bootstrapping methodology is a welcome addition for improving the estimates of results. However, confidence intervals are surprisingly neglected."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* The principal contributions of this work are (1) an empirical evaluation of a handful of known methods for uncertainty quantification on select reasoning benchmarks, finding a mixed picture of results, and (2) proposing and evaluating a combination of two existing methods, which demonstrates positive results. I find these contributions to be relatively limited in scope, particularly given the mixed results picture of the empirical evaluation.\n* The framing that uncertainty quantification has two main approaches, verbalized confidence and self-consistency, is inaccurate. There are many more families of methods that have been applied to quantifying LLM uncertainty: making use of token output distributions [1], semantic entropy [2], probing approaches [3], etc. If the authors wish to focus on just two approach families, the reason for this reduced focus should be clearly motivated. Equally, the related work section would benefit from significant expansion to cover alternative approaches.\n* The model names are needlessly truncated. It would be much clearer to use the full model names throughout, e.g. \"GPTOSS-20B (high)\", \"DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B\". Referring to this latter model as \"DeepSeek8B\" is particularly confusing, given this is really a Qwen3 model with a little reasoning post-training on distilled traces.\n* The MMLU Pro evaluation is only on a limited set of domains, with limited justification for why other domains were dropped. Given the highly variable results by MMLU-Pro subject (Table 2), it would be helpful to have a full picture of MMLU Pro performance. Ideally, the overall MMLU-Pro performance would be used for the Overall Avg, as the current approach of averaging a single GPQA-Diamond with several MMLU-Pro topics skews results in favor of MMLU-Pro.\n* As mentioned above, given the bootstrapping methodology employed, where are no confidence intervals reported? This would go a long way towards showing whether the differences between methods are meaningful.\n\n### References\n1. https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15260\n2. https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09664\n3. https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15927"}, "questions": {"value": "1.

It is too trivial to combine two effective methods to achieve further performance improvements.\n2. The effectiveness of the proposed method should be further explored because VCSC does not show significant gains on major datasets, and with increases in K, the performance of VCSC does not always improve. Therefore, it is important to further understand the scenarios in which it works or does not work.\n3. The organization of this paper is a bit strange. The authors first discuss all the verbalized confidence in Section 5.1 and then present the experimental results of VCSC in the following sections. It is confusing whether this paper aims to provide a systematic evaluation or to introduce a novel method. It seems that the workload for both sides is not sufficient.\n4. The results of ECE and NLL can only be found in the Appendix, while they are introduced with extensive text in the main paper. It is confusing why these metrics are heavily discussed without reporting corresponding results in the main paper.\n5. Important related works are missing. Generally, this paper discusses how to combine SC and other confidence estimations. As detailed in their method, it does not really matter if the verbalized confidence is replaced with other informative signals. [1] theoretically and empirically studies how to combine self-consistency, perplexity, and rewards together. [2] presents empirical results showing that other confidence measures can help SC.
