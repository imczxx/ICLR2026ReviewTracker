However, current methods struggle to capture the hierarchical relationships among enzymes and often overlook critical structural and active site features. To bridge this gap, we introduce PoinnCARE, a novel framework that jointly encodes and aligns multi-modal data from enzyme sequences, structures, and active sites in hyperbolic space. By integrating graph diffusion and alignment techniques, PoinnCARE mitigates data sparsity and enriches functional representations, while hyperbolic embedding preserves the intrinsic hierarchy of the EC system with theoretical guarantees in low-dimensional spaces. Extensive experiments on four datasets from the CARE benchmark demonstrate that PoinnCARE consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in EC number prediction.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["EC number prediction", "enzyme function", "hyperbolic space learning", "multi-modal learning", "enzyme structure", "enzyme active site"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b157b7c614a6a899b8c3d62fab43678ede072846.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces PoinnCARE, a hyperbolic multi-modal learning framework for enzyme function prediction.

Integration of multiple modalities: The paper goes beyond sequence-based modeling by integrating experimentally determined or predicted enzyme structures and active site annotations, which addresses the intrinsic complexity of enzyme function prediction.\n2. Hyperbolic embedding with theoretical justification: Embedding enzyme representations in hyperbolic space is both theoretically motivated  and practically validated. The paper rigorously discusses why hyperbolic geometry is ideal for modeling the EC system's hierarchy.\n3. Comprehensive and robust empirical evaluation: The method is benchmarked across four different and increasingly challenging test scenarios from CARE, with comparisons to a wide range of recent and classical baselines, including CLEAN, CLEAN-Concat, various PLMs, and LLM approaches. Tables 2, 3, and supplemental metrics (precision, recall, F1; Tables 9–14) consistently show improvements of PoinnCARE, validating its robustness to sequence diversity and test set complexity.\n4. Ablation and dimensionality studies: The results in Figure 6 and Table 16 demonstrate that performance gains are attributable to each design component, and PoinnCARE's effectiveness persists even at smaller embedding dimensions, reinforcing the theoretical claims regarding hyperbolic geometry.\n5. Reproducibility efforts: The authors provide detailed data and implementation information, facilitating future reproduction."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Lack of comparison with advanced models: This paper uses enzyme structure and active site information, but the specialized models it compares against are limited to the sequence-based CLEAN and its derivatives. It does not include comparisons with structure-based models such as EnzymeCAGE (Liu et al. 2024) and GraphEC (Song et al. 2024).\n(1) Liu, Yong, et al. \"EnzymeCAGE: a geometric foundation model for enzyme retrieval with evolutionary insights.\" bioRxiv (2024): 2024-12.\n(2) Song, Yidong, et al. \"Accurately predicting enzyme functions through geometric graph learning on ESMFold-predicted structures.\" Nature Communications 15.1 (2024): 8180.\n2. Questionable choice of hyperbolic GNN architecture: PoinnCARE adopts the Poincaré Ball Model and performs GNN aggregation and transformation in the tangent space at the origin ($o$). The authors state this choice was made \"For simplicity\". However, HGCN (Chami et al., 2019) explicitly argues for and demonstrates the superiority of aggregation in the local tangent space of each center node ($x_i^H$). PoinnCARE's architectural choice seems to be a simplification that may lead to suboptimal representation power. The paper does not provide sufficient justification that this \"simple\" choice is reasonable or equivalent to local-space aggregation.\n(1) Chami, Ines, et al. \"Hyperbolic graph convolutional neural networks.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 32 (2019).\n3. Concerns about the efficacy of the active site modality: The paper admits that the active site data is extremely sparse, with \"more than half of the enzymes have no annotated active site residues\". Despite using graph diffusion, the information foundation for this modality is very weak. Furthermore, the input features $H^{(0)}$ for both hyperbolic GNNs are identical. This introduces a risk: the representation $H_{(a)}$ learned by the GNN on $G^{(a)}$ ($f_{hyp}^{(a)}$) might just be a variant of the $H^{(0)}$ features on a highly smoothed (post-diffusion) graph structure, without capturing much genuinely unique \"active site\" functional signal. The contribution of this modality may be overestimated.\n4. Oversimplified modality fusion: The final fusion method for prediction is a simple weighted sum: $\\beta_{s} \\cdot H_{(s)} + \\beta_{a} \\cdot H_{(a)}$. Given the heterogeneous nature and different sparsity levels of the two modalities (structure vs. active site), this linear, static fusion method is likely suboptimal. The paper does not explore more dynamic fusion mechanisms (e.g., attention, gating).\n5. Positioning in relation to closest prior work: Several highly relevant recent papers are not cited or discussed, particularly those specifically focusing on hyperbolic multimodal taxonomy or hierarchical enzyme function prediction. This weakens the contextualization and differentiation of the method’s originality.\n(1) Gong, ZeMing, et al. \"Hyperbolic Multimodal Representation Learning for Biological Taxonomies.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2508.16744 (2025).\n(2) Li, Nan, et al. \"Hyperbolic hierarchical knowledge graph embeddings for biological entities.\" Journal of Biomedical Informatics 147 (2023): 104503.\n6. Insufficient analysis of failure cases: The analysis leans heavily on aggregate metrics. It would be helpful to present examples or qualitative analysis, where the method fails, especially at deeper EC levels. There’s a lack of introspection on possible errors, such as misclassification of enzymes with convergent functions but divergent structures or sequences (a case hinted at by Figure 3, but not explored in error analysis)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could the authors please clarify the reasoning behind the exclusion of state-of-the-art specialized models from the evaluation?\n2. What is the rationale for choosing to perform GNN operations in the origin's tangent space rather than the local node's tangent space? Beyond \"simplicity,\" is there any theoretical or experimental evidence (e.g., a comparison of these two aggregation methods within the PoinnCARE framework) to support this decision?\n3. Given the extreme sparsity of $G^{(a)}$ and the shared $H^{(0)}$ input, how can the authors demonstrate that $H_{(a)}$ has learned \"active site\"-specific information that is meaningful for prediction and distinct from $H_{(s)}$? Is there any qualitative or quantitative analysis of the differences between the $H_{(a)}$ and $H_{(s)}$ embedding spaces (e.g., t-SNE visualization or mutual information analysis)?\n4. Why was a simple linear weighted sum chosen as the final modality fusion method? Did the authors experiment with more complex fusion mechanisms (e.g., concat + MLP, or cross-modal attention)?\n5. In constructing $G^{(s)}$ and $G^{(a)}$ (Sections B.1 and B.2), how were the similarity thresholds $\\delta^s=0.3$ and $\\delta^a=0.05$ chosen? How sensitive is the model's performance to these thresholds?\n6. Could the authors analyze cases where PoinnCARE makes errors at the deepest EC digit level (level 4), and provide qualitative examples? Are there biological patterns (e.g., convergent evolution) that systematically challenge the model?\n7.
