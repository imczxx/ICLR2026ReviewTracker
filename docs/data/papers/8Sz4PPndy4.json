Recent advances in machine learning have shown promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this work, we present XAStruct, a two pipeline system capable of predicting XAS spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70 elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety of chemistries and bonding environments. The framework includes the first machine learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra, as well as a generalizable regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that requires no element-specific tuning. By combining deep neural networks for complex structure–property mappings with efficient baseline models for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference.

As the authors introduced in the related physical background, XAS can be divided into two regimes: XANES and EXAFS. XANES mainly reflects multiple-scattering fingerprints, while EXAFS primarily encodes the local atomic configuration.\n\n* Structure-to-XAS mapping: If the structure is given and key information such as local coordination and electronic states is known, there is limited means to fully recover the entire XAS pattern. For generating detailed XAS patterns for experimental matching, the current model does not account for atomic disorder or thermal vibrations, which also significantly affect XAS fluctuations.\n* Inverse problem: While the inverse mapping is valid in principle, there are key limitations. First, high-fidelity XAS simulations are currently not feasible because fine structures are related to charge density. Therefore, it is unclear whether the current model can be reliably applied to real patterns without providing any experimental validation.\n* Cross-chemical coverage: To cover such a broad chemical space, certain crystals may have elements whose K and L edges are very close, which can hinder the resolution of EXAFS or even XANES signals. The current work does not discuss such scenarios."}, "questions": {"value": "+\tHow does normalization affect energy alignment, given that each XAS has a different energy range depending on the element, while the absolute energy reflects the electronic level gap?\n+\tAre there any defined criteria for segmenting XANES and EXAFS regions?

However, it is unclear why SGMLP improves performance for the spectra-to-structure task. Does simply increasing MLP complexity lead to better results?
