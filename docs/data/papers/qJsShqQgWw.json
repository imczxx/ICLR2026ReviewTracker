We study whether LLMs can practically drive algorithm generation, and find that they are biased towards well-known generic designs, rather than making the creative leaps needed to navigate the discontinuous solution space. To address this limitation, we introduce MetaMuse, a framework for creative ideation built on three self-reflection principles: (1) quantifying solution diversity and usefulness in measurable performance space, rather than abstract idea space, (2) steering ideation through external stimuli, rather than internal randomness, and (3) constructing executable solutions using waypoint reasoning, rather than free-form chain-of-thought. Extensive evaluation shows that MetaMuse can generate high-performing solutions for two critical problems at a global cloud provider: cache replacement (reducing cache misses by up to 35.76%) and online bin packing (reducing bin usage by up to 30.93%).", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["system algorithm design", "creativity", "ideation", "self-reflection"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/58594bf13ba09e120c0e8859a77da052ef00c648.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/83a013d32eaede2a697f27b8ea0cd545db820bc4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The goal is to generate algorithms with LLMs. The paper notes that diversity is necessary for generating good algorithms, but that LLMs are inherently bad at creating diverse output.

Given a set of stimuli, MetaMuse (3) develops an executable implementation using waypoint reasoning, which encourages non-trivial analysis and application of the external stimuli in the context of the problem at hand.

The authors partially motivate their work by citing that previous solutions ignore higher-level design parameters like data structure selection, in favor of tweaks to the scoring function. Yet, the authors measure diversity in performance/feedback space, and explicitly dismiss the efficacy of observing semantic differences in language or code, including data structure changes (l. 200-205). It seems like the emphasis on performance-only diversity metrics would also fail to incentivize/meaningfully reward the higher-level tweaks, but these larger jumps in algorithmic design space feel critical. How often do you witness higher-level changes in your experiments? How much of the increased diversity stems from scoring function changes (or other tweaks mirroring previous works' exhibited tendencies) vs. more novel types of changes? Would you consider the examples discussed in Section 4.4 to be scoring function changes, or larger-scope ones (this might be clear to a system algorithms expert, but wasn't clear to me)? I would be interested to see more discussion on this point.\n\n2.

Additionally:\n\n1. Figure 1 / l. 137 - is the clustering algorithm such that it forms a partition of the 1200 solutions, based on the closest human-derived heuristic in the set? i.e., if something is sufficiently unique (like the solutions described in l.399-409), would it have to belong to the nearest cluster, or would it be separately labeled? If it's the former, the mere presence of the cluster isn't necessarily compelling -- it's there by construction. We'd have to know what the radius/desnity pattern of the cluster was, similar to the discussion you present in l. 376. Perhaps a visualization like a scatter plot might be more illustrative in that case. Relatedly, as someone with little knowledge about cache replacement, I'm curious whether the bias toward LRU/LFU/FIFO might reflect something deeper than mere availability/prevalence bias. For example: since you're measuring by similarity of hit ratios, do the algorithms with large clusters have some inherent performance advantage? This might explain the demonstrated bias in a few ways: maybe it makes sense for the LLM to offer variants of these, since they perform well; alternatively, maybe the metric causes highly performant algorithms cluster near these baselines, even if the underlying approach is different.\n\n2. l. 210 -- how important is it that the performance metrics be bounded? What would be required to accommodate unbounded metrics? Relatedly, how well could this approach generalize to multiple metrics?

Missing Mechanism for Incremental Improvement: The framework overly emphasizes \"Eureka\" ideas to improve algorithm quality. However, iterative algorithm design often requires continuity and gradual improvement. Significant gains often come from small adjustments (e.g., hyperparameter tuning) to a good algorithm. MetaMuse currently lacks a mechanism to effectively capture and execute this type of small-scale, continuous refinement, focusing only on large, creative leaps.\n\n2. Insufficient Justification for \"Unbiased Stimuli\": The authors state that \"Stimuli should be unbiased to the problem, forcing LLMs to associate with knowledge that seems probabilistically irrelevant.\" While this is experimentally successful, the theoretical justification needs strengthening. Why are completely neutral keywords more effective than carefully curated, domain-relevant concepts in avoiding the availability bias? As demonstrated in the authors' examples, unrelated keywords must still first be linked to domain-relevant concepts before further reasoning can occur. Furthermore, the authors should supplement the experiments by showing the performance of non-neutral keywords to demonstrate the necessity of using unbiased stimuli, and discuss the risk of generating incoherent algorithms due to unrelated stimuli.\n\n3. Scalability Concerns with RSDict-SF: The RSDict-SF strategy relies on building a performance prediction model (GPR), which requires a large amount of multi-dimensional feedback embedding data. The practicality of RSDict-SF is limited for domain problems where each evaluation is prohibitively expensive. The paper should offer a more in-depth discussion on how MetaMuse can be adapted to handle sparse feedback or difficult-to-quantify tasks.\n\n4.  Limited Application Scope: The framework is only validated on two specific system problems (cache replacement and online bin packing).

In Figure 1, please clarify how Repeated sampling with previous solutions is specifically implemented. Does the input of previous solutions include all prior sampling results, or only a recent subset? Furthermore, a detailed comparison with this baseline is more crucial than a simple Repeated Sampling analysis to substantiate the paper's claim regarding diversity.\n\n4. Figure 1 illustrates the failure of LLMs to explore the algorithm space effectively. Please clarify what an ideal sampling distribution looks like under the authors' claims (I assume a uniform distribution across different clusters?). More importantly, the authors should display the actual sampling points of MetaMuse to demonstrate that the framework successfully overcomes local clustering and achieves effective exploration of the discontinuous space.\n\n5. The diversity evaluation in MetaMuse is strongly correlated with the distribution and number of traces used to generate the performance feedback embeddings, which directly impacts the clustering results.
