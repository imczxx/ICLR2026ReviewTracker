However, most existing methods struggle to jointly localize event boundaries and classify event types; even detection transformer (DETR)-based approaches show limited performance when confronted with extremely sparse events typical of clinical recordings. To address these challenges, we propose a coarse-to-fine detection framework combining a global context explorer, a local detail inspector, and an adaptive gating module (AGM) that fuses multiple label perspectives. The AGM uses transformed labels—encoding event presence and temporal position—to improve learning on sparse events. This design acts as a switch that selectively activates detailed feature extraction only when an event is likely, thereby reducing noise and improving efficiency in sparse settings. We evaluate our framework on diverse healthcare datasets—including arrhythmia detection, emotion recognition, and human-activity monitoring—and demonstrate substantial performance gains over existing DETR-based models, with particularly strong improvements in sparse event detection. With precise and robust event detection, our framework enables interpretation and actionable insights in real-world clinical applications.", "tldr": "We propose an adaptive gating framework that improves sparse event detection in healthcare time-series by selectively fusing context and detail features.", "keywords": ["Event detection", "Time series analysis", "Healthcare"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5205fca4d6faf3972232043c2e4d93993b8ed297.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a DETR-inspired framework for sparse event detection in healthcare time-series.

The tailored Hungarian matching cost for temporal events is a thoughtful adaptation.\n3.  **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The framework is rigorously evaluated on four diverse healthcare datasets across three different tasks (arrhythmia, emotion, activity recognition) and various class evaluation scenarios, demonstrating consistent performance gains over multiple strong DETR baselines. The use of PW-F1, AF-F1, and mAP provides a holistic view of performance."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  **Ambiguity in Time-Series Windowing and Event Truncation:** The use of fixed 10-second windows with a 1-second stride for long-duration healthcare time-series (e.g., Holter ECG) raises concerns. The paper lacks a clear explanation of how events that span across window boundaries are handled, potentially leading to event truncation or inaccurate boundary detection, which contradicts the goal of \"precise event boundary detection.\" This is a critical aspect for reproducibility and clinical applicability.\n\n\n2.  **Underspecified \"Adaptive Gating Module\" (AGM) Mechanism:** The core component, the AGM, specifically the precise mechanism for generating the `g` gate tensor (e.g., what layers/activation functions are applied to which input features to produce `g` as a R $\\in$ B×τ×1  tensor), is not explicitly detailed. This lack of clarity hinders the understanding of a key novelty and impacts reproducibility.\n\n\n3.  **Lack of Clarity in GCE/LDI \"Coarse-to-Fine\" Distinction and TCN Details:** The distinction between \"global\" (GCE) and \"local\" (LDI) features is primarily attributed to TCN kernel sizes (7 vs. 3). However, **without specifying the dilation rates** used in their TCN-Attention mechanisms, it's unclear if this difference is substantial enough to justify the \"coarse-to-fine\" claim, especially given the inherently short window length. Furthermore, the detailed operation and structure of the \"FFN-based alignment layer\" are insufficiently explained.\n\n4.  **Information Dispersal and Lack of Self-Containedness:** Several crucial details, such as full metric definitions, complete quantitative results tables (beyond highlights), detailed dataset class distributions for specific class evaluation scenarios (e.g., \"Class 3\", \"Class 6\", \"Class 15\" for MIT-BIH), and specific hyperparameters/adaptation methods for baselines, are mostly relegated to the Appendix. This significantly impedes the reader's ability to grasp the main content and evaluate the results. Key figures like Table 1, Table 2, and Figure 2 (which is overly complex and lacks sufficient labeling for intermediate representations like `z` and `h`) are not self-contained, forcing constant reference to the appendix and hindering streamlined understanding.\n\n5.  **Inconsistent and Undefined Notation:** Several fundamental variables used in equations, such as the batch size `B` (Eq. 2), the total number of events `N` (Eq. 1), and the subscript `b` in $w_b(t)$ (Eq. 6), are used without explicit definition early in the methodology. Furthermore, the input definition for `X` (Eq. 1) does not include the batch dimension `B`, leading to an inconsistency with later equations that use `B`.\n\n6.  **Limited Discussion on Clinical Interpretability/Actionability:** While the abstract and introduction mention \"actionable insights\" and \"reliable interpretation\" in real-world clinical applications, the paper's analysis is predominantly quantitative. A deeper discussion or qualitative analysis on *how* the improved event detection truly translates into concrete clinical benefits (e.g., enabling earlier alerts, more precise diagnosis, or better treatment planning) would strengthen its real-world impact claim."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  **Event Handling at Window Boundaries:** Given the 10-second windowing approach for continuous time-series, how are ground-truth events that are longer than 10 seconds or that span across window boundaries specifically annotated and handled during training and evaluation? Does this approach risk truncating events or causing ambiguities in boundary detection, especially for a framework aiming for \"precise event boundary detection\"?\n\n2.  **Precise Generation of Gate Tensor `g`:** The paper states that \"the AGM produces a gate tensor `g`... that controls the relative contributions of LDI and GCE\" . However, the exact mechanism or specific layers (e.g., what output features, linear layers, and activation functions) through which this `g` tensor is computed from the features (e.g., after PGI and CGS) is not explicitly described. Please clarify the precise generation process of `g`.\n\n3.  **TCN Dilations for GCE and LDI & Alignment Layer Details:** To substantiate the \"coarse-to-fine\" distinction between GCE and LDI, please specify the dilation rates used in their respective TCN-Attention mechanisms. This is crucial for understanding how kernel sizes 7 and 3 translate into genuinely \"global\" and \"local\" effective receptive fields. \n\n4.  **Clarification of Notation and Consistency:** Please provide clear and explicit definitions for all variables used in equations (e.g., `N` in Eq. 1, `B` in Eq. 2) early in the methodology section. Ensure consistency in input definitions, specifically by including the batch dimension `B` in the definition of input `X` (Eq. 1).
