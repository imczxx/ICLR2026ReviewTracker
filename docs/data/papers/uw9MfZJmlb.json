Our approach implicitly recover scene geometry from monocular color images via pre-trained depth and normal estimation models. The core of our framework departs from traditional random or uniform initialization strategies, instead leveraging the recovered geometric priors to effectively manage the entire lifecycle of Gaussian primitives, including initialization, updating and eventual pruning. Specifically, we design a Geometry-Guided Initialization module that utilizes the recovered geometry to generate Gaussian primitives within potentially occupied regions of the scene, ensuring a rational and efficient primitive distribution from the outset. Subsequently, we propose a Position-Aware Scene Update and Pruning pipeline, which integrates a Position-Aware Gaussian Refinement process and Confidence-Based Fusion and Pruning module. This pipeline is responsible for maintaining the global consistency of the scene representation across continuous online observations while adaptively fusing redundant primitives to manage computational complexity. The effectiveness and advanced nature of our method are thoroughly validated through extensive experiments on four popular indoor semantic occupancy prediction benchmarks, where it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Embodied Occupancy Prediction", "3D Gaussian"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/903e96bce4016b8985df793aca4831ddbe530696.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes G2-OCC, a vision-only framework for embodied semantic occupancy prediction model.\nThe core design of this work is a Geometry-Guided Initialization module that leverages the recovered geometric priors to generate Gaussian primitives within potentially occupied regions of the scene, improving the efficiency.\nTo handle the embodied Gaussian memory update, this paper proposes a Position-Aware Scene Update and Pruning pipeline.\nExperiments show that the proposed Geometry-Guided Initialization module is effective."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

I'm curious about the differences between your proposed Geometry-Guided Initialization module and SplatSSC's depth-guided initialization strategy. And what are your advantages? \nIn addition, Table 1 presents the experimental results of several methods under the training setting of SplatSSC, which shows a significant performance improvement compared to the normal version (like Ours). I am wondering if only the learning rate was modified during this process? Does this imply that the performance of current methods is highly dependent on the setting of experimental parameters? I believe there should be more discussions on this aspect.\n2. In the Position-Aware Gaussian Refinement, you state that updating Gaussians in the global absolute coordinate system is more optimal. From my understanding, these coordinate systems only have a certain transformation relationship. Does requiring all Gaussians to be updated in a fixed world coordinate system introduce additional bias priors into the model? In a truly embodied setting, if we do not know the size of the environment to be explored in advance, the predefinition of the world coordinate system is unreasonable. Moreover, from the results in Table 4, adding the Position-Aware Gaussian Refinement does not bring about a significant performance improvement.\n3. Similarly, the experimental results in Table 5 fail to effectively prove the advantages of Confidence-Based Fusion and Pruning. Moreover, since a more refined paradigm has been incorporated, I believe it is necessary to conduct a more comprehensive comparison between G2-OCC and the baselines, such as in terms of running time, peak memory usage, training time, and so on.\n\nMinor Weaknesses:\n1. Some citations (like Line48 & Line49) are improper.\n2. I think abbreviating many small modules used in the article in a similar way greatly affects the reading experience. For those who are not familiar with the names of these modules you proposed, such abbreviations require readers to repeatedly check back to confirm which words they specifically refer to (like CBFP, PAGR).\n3. As mentioned in the abstract, this work has conducted sufficient experiments on four popular indoor semantic occupancy prediction benchmarks, but this seems an overclaim regarding the workload.

The paper's novelty is limited. The core contributions, including the Geometry-Guided Initialization (GGI) module and the Position-Encoding module, are incremental. The GGI module closely resembles prior work in GaussianFormer-2 [1], which also leverages depth priors to initialize Gaussians in occupied regions, while the Position-Encoding module is relatively simple in design. Both innovations lack significant originality.  \n\n2. The experimental comparison with EmbodiedOcc [2] is unfair and fails to validate the effectiveness of the proposed innovations. As shown in the supplementary material, $G^2-Occ$ employs Moge-v2 [3], a much stronger visual geometry model, to provide geometric priors. This raises doubts about whether the performance gains are due to the GGI module. Furthermore, $G^2-Occ$ relies on only a small number (2,205) of geometry-guided primitives while using a large number (14,175) of randomly initialized primitives, which questions the motivation behind the GGI module.  \n\n3. The paper lacks sufficient visualization of Gaussian distributions to validate the effectiveness of the GGI module, such as showing more Gaussians distributed in occupied regions.  \n\n4. Additional experiments are needed to analyze the efficiency impact of the GGI module, considering that the usage of Moge-v2 may introduce extra computational overhead.  \n\n5. The paper needs to be revised for better readability. Excessive use of abbreviations for proposed modules, such as Geometry-Guided Initialization (GGI), Position-Aware Gaussian Refinement (PAGR), Global Position-Aware Feature Refinement (GPAF), Global Position-Aware Encoder (GPAE), and Confidence-Based Fusion and Pruning (CBFP), makes it difficult to clearly identify the core innovations.  \n\n**Minor issues**:  \n1.
