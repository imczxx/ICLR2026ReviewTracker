While many real-world network instances modeled by hypergraphs, e.g., social networks, brain connectome networks, and online question-answering communities, are rich in noise and error-prone, existing hypergraph representation learning methods often assume that hypergraphs contain limited or no noise. We reveal that even a small amount of Gaussian noise can deteriorate the performance in node classification and hyperedge prediction.\nIn this paper, we study the problem of alleviating the impact of noises present in node features on hypergraph representation learning. We first establish the connection between receptive fields and denoising capabilities, showing increasing receptive fields may enhance the denoising ability and robustness. We then develop a four-stage message-passing method that can increase the receptive fields within a single neural network layer, which is applicable to any existing two-stage SOTA methods. We demonstrate the increase in receptive fields both theoretically and empirically. \nWe have performed extensive experiments, including analysis of convergence time, an ablation study, and visualization of node embeddings to verify that our four-stage enhanced models achieve superior performance in node classification and hyperedge prediction under various noise settings.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph Learning; Noise; Denoising Capability; Hypergraph Neural Networks"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/df62899b893a84fbda846185d8754015f9fb5f5b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The study investigates the effect of injecting noise into node features on the performance of hypergraph neural networks.

The connection between the receptive field and denosing capability is trivial. It is widely known that a standard graph convolution is a smoothing operator, and it serves as a low-pass filter of node signals. Thus, the proposed connection between receptive field and denosing capability is not novel. Theorem 1 and Lemma 1 seem trivial, too. Using the four-stage message-passing, obviously, should have a larger receptive field than a two-stage counterpart. I do not see how the Theorem and Lemma are surprising findings.  \n- [misleading assumption]. The paper argument rests on the assumption that certain node information is lost during 2-stage message passing, while a 1-stage message passing (e.g., node-to-node) may preserve it (lines 204-205). However, this assumption is unfounded. Message passing and non-linear transformation, whether it is based on a 1-stage or a 2-stage framework, aim to enrich node information, and thus, the authors' assumption that the 2-stage framework leaves only 'partial information' (line 205) is not convincing without concrete evidence.\n- [trivial method]. Adding N2N (node-to-node) and H2H (hyperedge-to-hyperedge) message passing, on top of N2H and H2N message passing, is a technically trivial to improve the denoising capability of HNNs. I do not think this is a technical innovation that is typically appreciated in a top-tier conference. \n\nThe experimental outcomes also raise suspicions about the contribution of the present method.\n- [marginal performance improvement]. Performance improvement is only substantial when the injected noise is very heavy. When no noise was injected, the performance of the proposed method is worse than the baseline HNNs. Moreover, after stacking multiple layers, the performance gap between the proposed method and the baselines (especially ED-HNN) is substantially reduced. \n\nAlso, I find the experimental setting problematic.\n- [unrealistic noise injection]. In most of the benchmark datasets, the input node features are sparse, multi-hot vectors. However, the noise that the authors injected is Gaussian. This is highly unrealistic and, thus, problematic. The significant performance degradation of the baseline HNNs may be partially due to this unrealistic noise injection. \n- [missing baselines]. If denoising capability is the major strength of the proposed method, I would expect baseline methods that improve denoising capability, including GNN-based ones (e.g., [1]). However, all the baselines are standard HNN encoders. If it turns out that GNN-based baselines have better denoising capability than the proposed method in the hypergraph benchmarks, I do not think there is a contribution of the proposed method. \n- [fairness] Furthermore, fixing the number of HNN layers in the experimental comparison is unfair. Each message-passing step generally improves denoising capability, and the proposed method is designed to conduct more message passing within a single HNN layer. Then, with a fixed number of layers, it is only natural that the proposed method has better denoising capability than the baselines (since it conducts more message passing steps). For fairer comparison, the number of layers should be tuned for each HNN model, dataset, and injected noise level.\n\nLastly, I do not think deferring most of the main experiments, e.g., hyperedge prediction and the effect of stacking multiple layers, to the Appendix is desirable. \n\nOverall, with the given limitations, I do not recommend accepting the paper.\n\nReference\n- [1] Graph Neural Networks with Adaptive Residual, NeurIPS 2021"}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "DU4VYlreF9", "forum": "CR9GzI3GeT", "replyto": "CR9GzI3GeT", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23234/Reviewer_Mwkm"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23234/Reviewer_Mwkm"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23234/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761900636462, "cdate": 1761900636462, "tmdate": 1762942569518, "mdate": 1762942569518, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, the authors aim to address the challenge of noise robustness in hypergraph representation learning.
