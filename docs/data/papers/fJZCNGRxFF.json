While recent advances such as DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) have demonstrated strong performance, they often rely on regular grid discretizations, limiting their applicability to complex or irregular domains. In this work, we propose a Graph-based Operator Learning with Attention (GOLA) framework that addresses this limitation by constructing graphs from irregularly sampled spatial points and leveraging attention-enhanced Graph Neural Netwoks (GNNs) to model spatial dependencies with global information. To improve the expressive capacity, we introduce a Fourier-based encoder that projects input functions into a frequency space using learnable complex coefficients, allowing for flexible embeddings even with sparse or nonuniform samples. We evaluated our approach across a range of 2D PDEs, including Darcy Flow, Advection, Eikonal, and Nonlinear Diffusion, under varying sampling densities. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, particularly in data-scarce regimes, demonstrating strong generalization and efficiency on irregular domains.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["PDEs", "Neural Operator", "AI for science", "Scientific Machine Learning", "Operator Learning", "Graph Neural Networks"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3cf28682c933ff5c711ee2e700f990b717073d9b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/acccde82db7b4d4864b616d6e7850ed5b3df6c48.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces GOLA (Graph-based Operator Learning with Attention) — a framework for operator learning on irregular spatial domains.

Limited Novelty and Overlap with Existing Work\n- Both Fourier encoding and attention mechanisms have been extensively explored in the context of graph neural networks, including Fourier Feature Networks, Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and Graph Transformer networks (GTN).\n- The proposed combination in GOLA therefore appears incremental, as similar designs integrating spectral embeddings with attention-based message passing already exist in prior operator learning and geometric deep learning literature.\n- The paper fails to clearly articulate what novel insight, mechanism, or theoretical contribution differentiates GOLA from existing graph-based operator learning frameworks.\n\n2. Weak Baselines and Benchmarks\n- The baseline comparisons are limited to older and weaker models (DeepONet, AFNO, GKN), which no longer represent the state of the art. The authors should include more recent and competitive baselines that address irregular or non-Euclidean domains, such as Transolver, Position-induced Transformer (PiT), Geo-FNO, PINO, Geo-FNO, etc.\n- The chosen benchmarks are small-scale, synthetic PDEs (Darcy, Advection, Eikonal, Diffusion) simulated in-house. These toy problems do not adequately demonstrate the model’s generalization capability. Evaluation on standard community datasets—such as Airfoil, ShapeNet-Car, or AirFRANS—would significantly strengthen the empirical validation.\n\n3. Lack of Depth in Theoretical and Conceptual Analysis\n- The “theoretical analysis” section is superficial, restating standard neural operator approximation theorems without offering any model-specific insight or proof.\n- The paper provides no theoretical reasoning or ablation-based evidence explaining why combining Fourier encoding with attention-enhanced GNNs should lead to improved expressivity, generalization, or sample efficiency."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Because of the learned frequencies, the model can generalize across resolutions (the spectral representation is not tied to a fixed grid). This also reduces aliasing artifacts compared with naïve coordinate MLPs and gives a compact, physics-plausible feature space for operator learning.\n\n2. **Clear and sufficiently detailed method presentation.**\n   The paper lays out the pipeline cleanly—Fourier encoding → graph construction → attention-augmented message passing → decoding—with consistent notation and design choices explained (edge features, attention rationale, training objective). The ablations and component descriptions make it straightforward to reproduce and to understand which parts drive gains.\n\n3. **Helpful visualizations.**\n   The figures (architecture block diagram, graph construction sketches, and qualitative field reconstructions) make the workflow and design choices easier to follow and provide intuitive evidence for how attention and spectral features influence predictions.

Without head-to-head evaluations against stronger and more recent models (e.g., graph/mesh operators with positional encodings, attention-based operators on point clouds), it’s hard to substantiate GOLA’s claimed advantage. This limits the paper’s positioning and makes the empirical novelty less compelling.\n\n2. **“Irregular domains” are synthetically derived from uniform grids, weakening the motivation.**\n   The paper’s “irregular sampling” is obtained by subsampling a uniform lattice, which **does not reflect** the practical challenges that motivate irregular discretizations: complex or curved boundaries, anisotropic resolution to capture fine features, mesh adaptivity, or true unstructured meshes common in CFD and geometry-rich PDEs (e.g., airfoils, cylinder flows, ShapeNet-like CAD geometries). As a result, the experiments do not test boundary handling, mesh heterogeneity, or topology changes—key factors for demonstrating real-world utility. The focus on **only 2D** further narrows external validity; many operator-learning applications (fluid/solid mechanics, climate/ocean) require robust performance on 3D unstructured meshes.\n\n\n[1] Li, Zhihao, et al. \"Harnessing scale and physics: A multi-graph neural operator framework for pdes on arbitrary geometries.\" Proceedings of the 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining V. 1. 2025.\n\n[2] Wang, Honghui, Shiji Song, and Gao Huang. \"GridMix: Exploring Spatial Modulation for Neural Fields in PDE Modeling.\" The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations. 2025.\n\n[3] Wu, Haixu, et al. \"Transolver: A Fast Transformer Solver for PDEs on General Geometries.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
