This phenomenon, known as mode connectivity, refers to the existence of such paths between distinct modes—i.e., well-trained solutions in parameter space. However, existing empirical methods are primarily effective for older and relatively simple architectures such as basic CNNs, VGG, and ResNet, raising concerns about their applicability to modern and structurally diverse models. In this work, we propose a new empirical algorithm for connecting independently trained modes that generalizes beyond traditional architectures and supports a broader range of networks, including MobileNet, ShuffleNet, EfficientNet, RegNet, Deep Layer Aggregation (DLA), and Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCT). In addition to broader applicability, the proposed method yields more consistent connectivity paths across independently trained mode pairs and supports connecting modes obtained with different training hyperparameters.", "tldr": "We propose LLPF algorithm, which leverages the layer-wise mode connectivity to reliably construct mode connectivity across a broader range of model families.", "keywords": ["Neural Network", "Mode Connectivity"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2c0ce2f56efa3a2614beff8c560561f82c0121d5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c13d4cee04a5153f2c7af270c49ae07ce719b977.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an algorithm for finding low-loss paths between independently trained models across a wide variety of architectures.

However, $x$ is also used to represent a hyperparameter, and this dual use may cause confusion. In addition, $x$ commonly represents the input, so using it as a hyperparameter symbol is unconventional.  \n\nFurthermore, the variance of the $l_x$-th layer is written as $\\mathrm{Var}(\\theta_{l_x})$. However, this expression does not refer to the variance of a distribution in the usual statistical sense but rather to the squared L2-norm of the layer parameters. Using the term “variance” might imply that $\\theta_{l_x}$ is a random variable drawn from a distribution determined by the training algorithm. Since the intent seems to be to compute the variance across the dimensions of $\\theta_{l_x}$ itself, it would be clearer to simply write $\\Vert \\theta_{l_x} \\Vert^2$.\n\n## It is unclear whether Algorithm 2 consistently works as intended.\n\nAs I understand it, Algorithm 2 searches for a path from a model with larger parameter variance to another with smaller variance. It is used to align the variances of two pretrained models so that Algorithm 1 can then find a low-loss path between them. In other words, if Algorithm 2 fails to produce an intermediate model whose variance matches that of the destination model, Algorithm 1 may not work properly.  \n\nAt line 402, the authors write:  \n> Unlike the results in Figure 2, the L_2 distance here is not expected to converge to very small values, because the destination point in Algorithm 2 is the origin, which is not itself a low-loss mode.\n\nThis suggests that Algorithm 2 does not always produce models with small L2 norms. This might be acceptable if we could guarantee that models with small parameter norms necessarily yield large losses. However, that is not always the case. For example, when a convolutional layer is followed by layer normalization, scaling the convolution weights does not change the layer output. Consequently, the variance of such weights could be arbitrarily small without degrading performance. Therefore, if one of the pretrained models happens to have a much smaller parameter norm, the proposed method might fail. Unless Algorithm 2 can **always** find the lowest-variance model with performance comparable to the original, this remains a potential limitation.\n\n## The experiments are biased toward CIFAR-10.\n\nAlthough various architectures are tested, the dataset choice is limited to CIFAR-10. It would be more convincing to include experiments on larger-scale datasets such as CIFAR-100 or ImageNet.\n\n## There is no guarantee that models with low test loss will be found.\n\nAs acknowledged by the authors, the proposed algorithm ensures low training loss but not low test loss. If the purpose of this study is to provide new insight into the generalization properties of SGD, this limitation should be considered a notable weakness.\n\n## It would be helpful to include experiments where hyperparameters other than weight decay are changed.\n\nThe paper claims that low-loss paths can be found between models trained with different hyperparameters. However, in practice, the only hyperparameter varied is the weight decay, which mainly affects the scale of the parameters. It is well known that the sharpness of the loss landscape is also influenced by other hyperparameters such as the learning rate. At line 314, the authors mention:  \n> Empirically, we find that starting from sharp minima can cause our algorithm to fail to find feasible paths.\n\nHowever, the paper does not provide experiments that explicitly examine the effect of sharpness. It would strengthen the work to include experiments where other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, are varied to demonstrate the broader applicability of the proposed method."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "mF15UNghKf", "forum": "lHp9ef3kfm", "replyto": "lHp9ef3kfm", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10028/Reviewer_suKz"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10028/Reviewer_suKz"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10028/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761025470329, "cdate": 1761025470329, "tmdate": 1762921436859, "mdate": 1762921436859, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"comment": {"value": "Thank you for the time spent reviewing our paper.
