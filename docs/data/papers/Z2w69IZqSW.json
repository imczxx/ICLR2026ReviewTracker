Intuitively, activating more experts at inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However, contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings. Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2–3$\\times$ the training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher level.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Mixture-of-Experts", "Large Language Models"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/153748eba15b6c13f8502c83bd7d3242561c384f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper postulates that elastic allocation of compute in MoE layers (e.g., activating more experts per token than in the training setup) can provide additional flexibility for inference. However, as the authors show, the naive approach, where we just increase the top-k in the router, does not result in model quality improvement. The authors hypothesize that the reason is lack of collaboration between experts - the model is not able to leverage new combinations of experts not seen during training. The proposed solution is to \"simulate\" training with larger top-k by sampling smaller groups of experts from larger, \"ideal\" groups, that will be seen during inference.

The argument of the reduced training cost with stochastic co-sampling is not relevant since the entire fine-tuning phase has negligible cost compared to the model pretraining.
