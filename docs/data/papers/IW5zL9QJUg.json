However, current approaches for trajectory prediction rarely account for differences in driving style, which may lead to \"averaged\" driving style in predictions. While average-case behavior may work well in straight driving, easy scenarios, it limits the diversity of outcomes in more complex scenes or in rare events. Extraction of driving style has several benefits, as it enables simulation of counterfactual outcomes in real-world log replays and potentially more accurate predictions through style-consistent predictions. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient Mixture-of-Experts framework for extraction of latent driving styles in trajectory prediction models. We choose a parameter-efficient approach to reduce forgetting in well-generalized trajectory prediction models, while offering portability of trained driving style modules. We also propose a Style Consistency Metric to quantify how often a model’s multi‐modal outputs cover the true driving style.

Motivation and evaluation:  We remain fundamentally confused about the motivation and evaluation methodology for driving style modeling after carefully reading this paper:  \n    1.1. Mischaracterization of the Core Problem: The issue illustrated in the Introduction (Fig. 1) fundamentally stems from the inherent multi-modality in trajectory prediction, rather than being specifically related to driving style modeling. Through learning across diverse scenarios, prediction models are expected to generate multiple plausible trajectory hypotheses. Despite being supervised with only a single ground truth (GT) trajectory per instance, this is precisely why mode diversity and coverage are essential objectives in multimodal forecasting research. In industrial practice, downstream motion planners typically evaluate multiple candidate trajectories simultaneously rather than committing to only the highest-probability mode. The planner then selects or synthesizes appropriate actions by considering the full distribution of predicted behaviors from surrounding agents. Therefore, the core technical challenge lies in effectively capturing this inherent behavioral diversity and ensuring proper coverage of the prediction space, rather than explicitly modeling subjective notions of \"driving styles\" as the authors suggest. The authors should clarify why style-based decomposition offers advantages over existing multimodal prediction frameworks that already address trajectory diversity.  \n    1.2. Circular Definition of Style Evaluation: While the authors conceptually motivate the importance of driving style and propose the Style Miss Rate (SMR) metric, described as \"evaluating whether a model's multimodal outputs 'cover' the true driving style\", the evaluation methodology still fundamentally relies on kinematic signals such as acceleration and speed extracted from the single GT trajectory to define the ground truth driving style. This approach effectively reduces the problem back to regressing toward a single mode in the GT, which contradicts the authors' stated motivation. It fails to address the central question the paper claims to tackle: whether maintaining style consistency can effectively handle safety-critical driving scenarios where behavioral diversity is most crucial. Moreover, how can we be confident that the kinematic properties of one observed trajectory adequately represent an agent's underlying \"driving style,\" especially when the same driver might exhibit different kinematic profiles under different traffic contexts?  \n    1.3. Insufficient Demonstration of Practical Impact: The experimental design makes it difficult to assess the actual impact and practical value of explicitly modeling driving styles. A lower SMR indicates better alignment with the GT trajectory's motion dynamics (e.g., acceleration profiles), thereby providing a complementary signal to traditional displacement error metrics, such as ADE/FDE. However, this alone does not demonstrate that the method successfully resolves the safety-critical scenario depicted in Fig. 1, nor does it provide evidence of tangible improvements in downstream planning performance or decision-making quality. The authors should provide more unmistakable evidence or ablation studies demonstrating: (a) how explicitly modeling \"driving style\" as a distinct latent variable enhances trajectory prediction quality beyond standard multimodal approaches, (b) whether style-consistent predictions lead to safer or more efficient downstream planning decisions, and (c) concrete examples where style modeling prevents the failure modes illustrated in Fig. 1.\n\n2. Experimental Setup Concerns  \n    2.1. Non-standard Historical Context Length: Regarding the experimental setup on Argoverse 2, why is only 2 seconds of historical trajectory data used for prediction, instead of adhering to the official benchmark specification of 5-second history? This significant deviation from the standard protocol makes it difficult to compare results with existing literature and raises questions about whether the proposed method can effectively leverage longer temporal contexts. The authors should either justify this design choice with compelling reasons or provide additional experiments using the standard 5-second history to ensure fair comparison.  \n    2.2. Inadequate Training Duration: Training for only 10 epochs appears insufficient to properly evaluate the convergence characteristics and generalization capability of both the MTR baseline and the proposed PolySona method. Standard trajectory prediction models on Argoverse 2, such as MTR and its variants, are typically trained for approximately 60 epochs to reach convergence and achieve competitive performance. With such limited training, it remains unclear whether: (a) the observed performance differences reflect genuine architectural advantages or merely artifacts of incomplete optimization, (b) the proposed method exhibits different convergence properties that might become apparent with extended training, and (c) the style-based decomposition continues to provide benefits as the model sees more diverse training data. The authors should extend the training to match standard practice or provide learning curves and convergence analysis to justify the abbreviated training schedule."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "dZeBAieLVE", "forum": "IW5zL9QJUg", "replyto": "IW5zL9QJUg", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15087/Reviewer_VnwB"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15087/Reviewer_VnwB"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15087/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761098096108, "cdate": 1761098096108, "tmdate": 1762925412210, "mdate": 1762925412210, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The manuscript presents a mixture-of-expert approach to capture the driving styles of multiple agents in trajectory prediction tasks.

The driving styles are captured as different MoL layers, if I understand the framework correctly. The authors also describe that they observe driving styles as the outcomes of latent variable modeling.

In other words, we may never have general styles that can be applied across different datasets. I am not sure this design is applicable enough.\n\n3.

Learning a discrete latent space using a variational autoencoder is typically done using a VQ-VAE[A]. It'd be useful to clarify if the latent space is discrete or continuous. If it is discrete, then more details are required to understand how it is being trained. If it is continuous, then how is the discrete nature of driving styles being captured in the latent space?\n- The text mentions about priors from existing traffic psychology literature (L240-241: Klauer et al., 2009) about distinct driving styles. Klauer et al. mention multiple categorizations of driving styles, e.g. different types of risky behaviors, or {safe,moderately-safe,unsafe} drivers, and more. Are the 3 experts related to {safe,moderately-safe,unsafe drivers} or any other categorization? And how are these incorporated in the model? Currently, there is no clear indication of how the 3 experts are capturing these specific driving styles.\n- Tab.3 shows evaluation using Kalman difficulty categories and TDBM driving styles (Cheung et al., 2018). Are these categories/styles estimated somehow or obtained from the dataset? How are they different than the styles (Klauer et al., 2009) used for training the proposed approach? Are the different models in Tab.4 retrained with these new categories? These details are not available in the paper.\n- L182-183 state that \"we make the key assumption that driving style must be strongly correlated to observed second-order kinematics\". How is this related to the architecture and training of the model?\n- L362-363 state that \"our work focuses on modeling variations in driving style, where we assume intent is fixed\". Where is this assumption incorporated into the proposed framework? Since L365 mentions intent as one of the two distinct aspects compared to existing works, these details are important. In the absence of this, it is hard to understand if the proposed model is indeed capturing driving styles or intent or both.\n- Fig.4(a) shows that experts 1 and 2 are quite similar in terms of kinematic attributes. This would suggest that only 2 experts are essentially being learned. However, Fig.4(b) shows 3 clusters in the latent embeddings. This seems to be inconsistent. Are the same features being used for both these figures?\n- In Tab.4 ablations, the effect of different components is quite marginal (most delta scores are <1%). This also seems to be the case when comparing the performance of different variants in the bottom half of Tab.1 & Tab.2. It'd be helpful to provide more insights into why these differences are quite small.\n- Why is the performance of the TAE baseline significantly worse compared to all other approaches in Tab.1 & Tab.3? Is TAE trained in the same setting as the other baselines? Are there any major differences in its architecture that may lead to such a significant deviation in performance? It'd be useful to provide details about the baselines so that the results can be better contextualized.\n- Tab.5 indicates that K=2 is best overall, but K=3 is better on medium and hard cases. This is likely due to bias towards easy scenarios in the training data (also stated in L466-467). If this is the case, then the learned experts are likely to be biased towards easy scenarios. It'd be useful to clarify this dataset bias by providing statistics about the distribution of easy, medium, and hard scenarios in the data.\n\n[A] Oord et al. Neural Discrete Representation Learning.
