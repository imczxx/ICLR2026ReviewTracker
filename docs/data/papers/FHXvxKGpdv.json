However, state-of-the-art models often fail to preserve the fine-grained details that define a subject's unique identity, a critical flaw that limits their use in high-fidelity applications. This \"consistency gap\" arises from a misalignment between the model's learned similarity metric and nuanced human perception. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{UPER} (\\textbf{U}nifying \\textbf{P}ost-training for P\\textbf{er}sonalization), a post-training framework designed to align generative models with human preferences for detail consistency. UPER employs a two-stage process: it first refines the model's focus on the subject's core attributes via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a dataset with cleaned background information. Subsequently, it optimizes the model using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel composite reward function. The key component of this function is a new patch-based consistency metric that accurately measures subject fidelity using only pre-trained vision encoders, eliminating the need for expensive preference data collection. We apply UPER to the state-of-the-art OminiControl model. The results are unequivocal: in a blind user study with over 1,000 responses, images generated by our final model were preferred for their overall quality and subject consistency \\textbf{89.3\\%} of the time over the strong baseline.

If a user's priority shifts (e.g., they care equally about aesthetic quality and subject consistency), would you recommend re-running the full RL stage with new weights, or could a pre-trained UPER model be adapted more quickly?
