However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their \"comfort zone,\" lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective alternatives.\nTo address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints, and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities, enabling it to move beyond its \"comfort zone\" and mitigate exploration stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards", "Reasoning", "Stepwise hints"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c50daebcb7d5997b4e35c4188ba75e46a0889f4b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a new method that leverages the reasoning steps of much stronger LLMs to improve RLVR for 7-8B policies.

The paper's own ablation study (Appendix G.2) compares the 'Base' and 'Salient' strategies and finds they have comparable overall performance. This finding directly undermines the novelty, suggesting the specific heuristic for identifying 'salient' boundaries is unnecessary. Moreover, the paper fails to compare this complex probabilistic method against simple, non-probabilistic baselines (e.g., splitting by sentence boundaries, or splitting into $m=4$ equal token chunks). Without this, the complexity of the proposed method is not justified.\n- The 'multi-level' hint strategy (Sec 3.2.2) is not an adaptive curriculum.

Have the authors compared this method to simpler, non-probabilistic baselines like splitting by sentence boundaries?\n- Regarding the 'multi-level' design (Sec 3.2.2), could the authors provide an ablation study comparing the current brute-force approach (training on all $m-1$ hint prefixes) against a more efficient strategy, such as randomly sampling a single hint level per training instance? This would clarify if the significant computational overhead is necessary for the method's success.\n- For the training dynamics in Figure 4, how can the authors decouple the high entropy from the high-variance input data (a mix of no-hint, partial-hint, and full-reference data)?

For the comparison in Table 2 using Llama, isn't GRPO a relatively weak baseline as it doesn't get to leverage the teacher reasoning traces at all? Also I'm a bit confused about the benchmark results for GRPO. Llama 3 8B gets 20% on MATH based on the original Llama 3 paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783). Why does GRPO only get 9% on MATH500 in your setting? Can you also include the results of the initial model in your setting so we know how much improvement there is. \n5. Would StepHint provide a benefit over vanilla RL if the teacher hints were from the starting model and filtered for correct traces?\n6. For Table 1, are all of the rows re-implemented from scratch or are the models just evaluated in the same setting? \n7. For Table 1, the only methods that get access to the reasoning traces are LUFFY and StepHint?
