We present HydroGen, a domain-adaptive framework that overcomes these challenges through instruction tuning, temporal modeling, and knowledge-guided reasoning within a two-stage pipeline. First, we build HydroMM-Instruct, an instruction dataset that uses YOLOv8 for typhoon detection and shapefiles for region mapping, with reports standardized into cause–effect phrases. Second, we introduce a two-stage training pipeline with continual pre-training on hydrological data (radar maps, pressure charts, expert assessments) followed by supervised fine-tuning for report generation. Third, to enhance multi-image alignment, we introduce temporal prompt tokens that capture event sequences and progressions. Finally, we present GuideAC, an in-context agent that injects antecedent–consequence rules to improve reasoning. Evaluation on Thailand’s weekly hydrological reports (2018–2025) shows that HydroGen substantially outperforms strong multimodal baselines, achieving a BERT-F1 of 84.5% (+50.6%) and a ROUGE-L of 38.3% (+33.9%).", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Hydrological Report Generation", "Multimodal Large Language Model", "Temporal Prompt Tokens", "Knowledge-Guided Agents"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/36d7d0b70750f43d4ed773089d96969d9ef41c41.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents HydroGen, a domain-adaptive multimodal framework for generating hydrological reports.

The test set spans only 2-3 months (April-June 2025), approximately 8-9 weekly reports. This is problematic as it misses typhoon season (July-October) and dry season patterns, making performance claims questionable. A full annual cycle is needed for reliable evaluation.\n2. With only 376 reports from a single Thai source, the dataset is too small for deep learning and too geographically restricted for international venues. The model cannot generalize beyond Thailand without region-specific shapefiles and hydrological patterns. This work seems better suited for regional journals rather than ICLR.\n3. No systematic expert evaluation of generated reports or validation of Gemini-extracted causal rules. The paper needs: (i) blind expert rating comparing generated vs. real reports, (ii) accuracy assessment of auto-extracted causal relationships against expert annotations, and (iii) cross-model consistency checks.\n4.
