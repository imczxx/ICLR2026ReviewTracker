For tabular data, defining meaningful augmentations is non-trivial and can easily distort semantics, limiting the effectiveness of conventional SSL. In this work, we rethink SSL for tabular data and propose Separated-at-Birth Alignment (SeBA), a joint-embedding framework for SS-FSL that eliminates the dependence on augmentations. \nOur core idea is to separate the data into two independent, but complementary views and align the representations of one view to mirror the nearest-neighbor correspondence of the data in the second view. A type-aware separation scheme ensures robust handling of mixed categorical and numerical attributes, while a lightweight architecture with ensemble aggregation improves generalization and reduces sensitivity to misselection of model parameters.

While SeBA adds new datasets, it remains unclear under what criteria these datasets were added and how representative they are of broader tabular domains. Several entries in Tables 1–2 remain blank, leaving unclear whether SeBA’s advantage stems from better representation learning or from dataset selection bias.\n- The paper lacks organization and comprehensive baseline coverage. The evaluation does not clearly separate supervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised baselines, resulting in a fragmented comparison. Several widely used methods are omitted: classical semi-supervised algorithms such as Pseudo-Labeling [1], Mean Teacher [2], and ICT [3], as well as strong tabular SSL frameworks like SAINT [4]. Moreover, recent contrastive and range-limited augmentation approaches (e.g., FESTA [5]) directly address the same challenge of constructing semantically valid augmentations for tabular data. Including and organizing these baselines would provide a fairer and more interpretable evaluation of SeBA’s contribution within the broader SSL landscape.\n- The paper shows an unreliable alignment assumption on certain datasets, as the core premise—that samples close in the target-view space are semantically similar—does not hold for datasets such as CMC and GES, where feature redundancy is low. This suggests that the alignment mechanism is not reliable and becomes unstable when the underlying feature correlation is weak or when the domain structure is heterogeneous.\n- The paper shows limited performance without ratio ensemble, as training with a single separation ratio 𝑇 leads to highly variable results across datasets. This suggests that the learned representations are mask-dependent rather than semantically invariant. The ratio ensemble compensates for this instability but requires training multiple encoders (≈5× compute), reducing scalability and reproducibility. More efficient alternatives—such as Dynamic Ratio Sampling or a ratio-conditioned encoder—could replace the multi-encoder ensemble by learning to handle varying separation ratios within a single network.\n\n*Reference*\n\n[1] Dong-Hyun Lee, Pseudo-label: The simple and efficient semi-supervised learning method\nfor deep neural networks.

This problem is particularly relevant in domains like medical diagnosis, credit risk prediction, and cognitive sciences where obtaining labeled data is expensive but unlabeled data is readily available. The research aims to develop an effective pretraining method specifically tailored for tabular data that can learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data and then be fine-tuned with just a few labeled examples.\n\nThe paper identifies critical limitations of existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods when applied to tabular data. Traditional SSL approaches rely heavily on data augmentations to create semantically similar positive pairs for contrastive learning. While augmentations like cropping, rotation, or color jittering work naturally for images, defining meaningful augmentations for tabular data is problematic. Poorly chosen transformations such as zero masking, Gaussian noise, or sampling from marginal distributions can distort semantic meaning, generate out-of-distribution samples, or create invalid data points. For instance, decreasing a car's age while increasing its mileage would be semantically inconsistent, or assigning non-integer values to discrete features like number of car seats would be invalid. This fundamental challenge has led recent work to largely abandon SSL for tabular data in favor of alternative approaches like cluster detection or diffusion-based methods.\n\nSeBA introduces a novel approach that eliminates the need for augmentations entirely. The core idea involves separating tabular data \"at birth\" into two complementary and independent views: feature views and target views. For each minibatch, a random binary mask determines which columns belong to each view. The method then identifies nearest-neighbor relationships in the target view space and trains an encoder to align the representations of feature views according to these nearest-neighbor correspondences.\nThe authors argue this works well for several reasons. First, it avoids the problematic task of designing augmentations for tabular data. Second, the nearest-neighbor relationships provide semantically meaningful positive pairs based on actual data similarity rather than artificial transformations. Third, the method employs a conditioned projector that takes both the encoder representation and the separation mask as inputs, allowing the model to adapt to different separation schemes. Fourth, type-aware separation ensures categorical variables are handled properly without splitting their one-hot encodings. Finally, an ensemble strategy using multiple separation ratios eliminates the need for careful hyperparameter tuning.\n\nThe authors conduct extensive experiments across twelve tabular datasets in 1-shot, 5-shot, and 10-shot classification settings. They compare SeBA against multiple baseline categories including supervised methods like CatBoost and k-NN, self-supervised methods like VIME and SCARF, meta-learning approaches, and state-of-the-art SS-FSL methods STUNT and D2R2. Performance is measured through classification accuracy with multiple random seeds and support/query set selections to ensure statistical reliability.\nAdditionally, the authors provide detailed ablation studies examining the impact of data normalization, missing data imputation strategies, separation ratios, and classifier choices. They also analyze the alignment between the pretraining objective and downstream tasks by measuring the proportion of nearest neighbors that share the same class label and examining the stability of neighbor assignments across different random separations.\n\nThe authors conclude that SeBA successfully demonstrates that self-supervised learning can be effective for tabular data when properly designed. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on tabular few-shot learning benchmarks, obtaining the best accuracy in 29 out of 36 experimental instances. The main contributions include introducing the Separated-at-Birth Alignment framework that eliminates augmentation requirements, instantiating it as a lightweight model with ensemble strategies to prevent overfitting, providing thorough empirical validation, and demonstrating consistent generalization across diverse tabular datasets. The work opens new avenues for SSL paradigms in tabular data and provides a practical foundation for data-constrained applications."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "SeBA addresses the fundamental incompatibility between traditional SSL and tabular data by completely reimagining how positive pairs are constructed. Rather than forcing unnatural augmentations onto tabular data, it leverages the inherent structure of the data itself through nearest-neighbor relationships. This approach is particularly well-suited because tabular data naturally contains meaningful similarity structures that can be discovered through partial feature comparisons.\n\nThe key contribution lies in demonstrating that SSL principles can be successfully adapted to tabular data without relying on augmentations. By introducing the separated-at-birth concept, the authors provide a principled alternative to augmentation that maintains the benefits of contrastive learning while respecting the unique characteristics of tabular data. The type-aware separation scheme for handling mixed categorical and numerical features represents an important technical innovation that ensures semantic validity.\n\nThe method builds on solid theoretical foundations from contrastive learning while addressing specific tabular data challenges systematically. The use of InfoNCE loss provides a well-understood optimization objective, while the conditioned projector allows the model to handle varying separation schemes coherently. The ensemble approach addresses the practical challenge of hyperparameter selection in few-shot scenarios where validation data is scarce. Each design choice, from zero imputation to type-aware separation, is motivated by specific tabular data characteristics and supported by ablation studies."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The paper lacks theoretical justification for why nearest-neighbor relationships in partial feature spaces should consistently produce semantically meaningful positive pairs. While empirical results show high same-class neighbor rates, the conditions under which this assumption holds or might fail are not thoroughly analyzed. The relationship between separation ratio and dataset characteristics remains underexplored, leaving practitioners without clear guidance on when certain ratios might be preferred.\n\nWhile the experiments cover multiple datasets and shot settings, certain aspects lack depth. The comparison with D2R2 uses only the inductive variant rather than the full transductive version that achieves better performance. The paper does not explore performance on datasets with very high dimensionality or extreme class imbalance, both common in real-world tabular applications. Additionally, computational efficiency comparisons are absent, which is important given the ensemble strategy requires training multiple models.\n\nThe ensemble approach, while eliminating hyperparameter tuning, significantly increases computational cost during both training and inference. The method's reliance on nearest-neighbor relationships may be problematic for datasets where local similarity doesn't align well with class structure, such as data with multimodal class distributions. The fixed separation ratios used in the ensemble might not be optimal for all datasets, particularly those with very few or very many features. Finally, the approach assumes that partial views contain sufficient information for meaningful nearest-neighbor matching, which might not hold for datasets with complex feature dependencies."}, "questions": {"value": "Regarding the architectural choice, what is the theoretical advantage of using a lightweight MLP encoder over a transformer-based model for representation learning in the tabular SS-FSL setting, aside from the general benefit of avoiding overfitting on small datasets?\n\nCan the authors clarify the underlying logical reason why zero imputation for masked features performs best in the SeBA framework compared to previous methods like sampling from empirical distribution, especially considering how this choice impacts the subsequent nearest-neighbor calculation in the target view?\n\nGiven the acknowledged weakness of SeBA's performance on the CMC and GES datasets, what specific characteristics of the data in these two datasets, such as dimensionality, feature distribution, or type complexity, might be hypothesized as the cause of the reduced efficacy of the Separated-at-Birth Alignment mechanism?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "8YY9FcacZA", "forum": "shywrceKra", "replyto": "shywrceKra", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4167/Reviewer_nyXb"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4167/Reviewer_nyXb"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4167/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761790134844, "cdate": 1761790134844, "tmdate": 1762917209783, "mdate": 1762917209783, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "In the Tabular Semi-supervised Few-shot Learning (SS-FSL) setting, to address the fundamental difficulty that conventional Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods face in defining data augmentations, the authors propose a new joint-embedding architecture called Separated-at-Birth Alignment (SeBA).
