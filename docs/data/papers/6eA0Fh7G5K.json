Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response burden.\nEmpirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50–87\\% compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71\\% fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85\\% fewer questions). MAQuA demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping strategies further reducing patient time and burden.\nThese findings position MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into real-world clinical workflows.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["language", "item response theory", "bayesian methods", "llms", "mental health", "adaptive", "question-asking"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
