Recent approaches address this limitation by training discriminative or conditional generative models on paired radar-LiDAR data, learning an explicit mapping from radar measurements to LiDAR-like outputs. However, these methods are sensitive to calibration errors and fail when LiDAR data is unavailable. In this work, we propose the first *cross-modality, unsupervised* radar point cloud super-resolution method by formulating radar enhancement as a Bayesian inverse problem. We explicitly model the radar sensing process with a differentiable forward operator, defining the measurement likelihood, and combine it with a LiDAR-trained latent diffusion model that captures the distribution of physically plausible point clouds. During inference, we perform posterior sampling that integrates this generative prior with the radar likelihood, yielding reconstructions that are both geometrically rich and strictly measurement-consistent — without requiring paired radar-LiDAR data. Experiments on the RADIal dataset show that our approach matches the performance of supervised mapping-based methods, while generalizing significantly better to unseen datasets such as K-Radar. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining physics-based modeling with distributional priors, offering a robust and practical solution for radar perception in real-world deployments.

The paper relies on several strong modeling assumptions—particularly the use of Gaussian noise and an idealized, linear radar sensing model and some are not clearly stated or justified. These assumptions may not accurately reflect the statistical or physical characteristics of real radar signals. In the reviewer’s opinion, assuming Gaussian noise before the FFT stage is reasonable and common practice, as it represents thermal receiver noise. However, for radar tensors from datasets such as RADIal and K-Radar, subsequent processing steps like FFT beamforming introduce additional structured artifacts, including deterministic sidelobes and spectral leakage. The omission effects limits the realism of the forward model and could partly account for the false alarms observed in the qualitative results—most notably on K-Radar, which exhibits stronger sidelobe artifacts.\n2. Writing can be improved, for example the symbols $𝜖_𝜃$  and $𝜖_𝛿$ appear interchangeably without explicit definition, while $𝜇_t$ and $Σ_t$ are referenced but not introduced. The update term $𝜇_t − z_t$ uses the hyperparameter $λ$$diff$, which is not defined elsewhere. The parameters $γ$ and $ζ$ are inconsistently described between Algorithm 1 and Table 1. The appendix extends the derivation of the Bayesian update but suffers from notation inconsistencies. Clarifying these definitions and ensuring consistent notation throughout would greatly improve readability\n3.  Authors target a 2D range–azimuth slice. Many automotive radars are now 3D/4D (with elevation, Doppler). 2D enhancement limit the potential usage to only in BEV space.\n4. Another concern is the lack of detail regarding the CFAR baseline. The paper does not specify which variant of CFAR (e.g., CA-CFAR, OS-CFAR, GO-CFAR, etc.) is used, nor how its parameters are selected. These parameters are typically carefully tuned in practical radar systems, and their performance can vary significantly depending on the setting. Without this information, the reported CFAR results may not represent a fair or optimized baseline, which makes the comparison potentially unreliable."}, "questions": {"value": "The authors propose a radar enhancement system based on a diffusion model and report quantitative improvements across several metrics against Lidar pc. Chamfer Distance and FID-BEV measure geometry but not physical consistency. There’s no analysis of false positives, detection precision/recall, or uncertainty — all key for radar. Also, it remains unclear how these enhancements affect downstream perception tasks compared with using CFAR point clouds or raw radar data. Since the enhanced results still contain noticeable noise, conducting relevant downstream experiments (e.g., object detection or tracking) would substantially strengthen the paper. My main concern lies in the paper’s overall contribution. Introducing an unsupervised radar enhancement approach is interesting, it is still uncertain whether this direction is worthwhile without stronger evidence. More comprehensive experiments or deeper analysis are needed to convince the community of its significance. \n\nI believe this is an interesting research direction, and I am open to raising my score if the authors effectively address the concerns outlined above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "sPbLFZOKS1", "forum": "c4Nbn695Au", "replyto": "c4Nbn695Au", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6387/Reviewer_ZmfZ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6387/Reviewer_ZmfZ"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6387/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761576982834, "cdate": 1761576982834, "tmdate": 1762918671525, "mdate": 1762918671525, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper aims to mitigate the sparsity of radar points for autonomous vehicles, thereby enhancing high-precision perception.

Based on this standpoint, the work is considered an incremental contribution to the field, as it replaces prior models in a Bayesian inverse setting with a learned Diffusion model of LiDAR points. This raises the question about its significance.\n2. **Significance of Performance.** With the limited novelty above, I would expect authors to showcase an improved performance with the proposed design. However, as listed in Table 2, the proposed method has improved none of the five key metrics. In particular, it has a relatively worse FID in BEV and UCD. In this sense, I would argue that there are potential improvements to be made in the proposed method, given the increase in computational and memory costs associated with incorporating a Diffusion model.\n3. **Generalizability.** Despite the promising generalizability demonstrated in Table 3, I wonder if the model can be efficiently scaled up with additional parameters or new data."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

More critically, the qualitative results in **Figure 4** show that CFAR can produce significantly more accurate reconstructions in some scenes (e.g., the third row), whereas the proposed method introduces numerous artifacts. This discrepancy suggests the quantitative gains might be illusory, potentially stemming from merely generating a denser cloud of points rather than from successfully integrating a meaningful scene prior. Consequently, the method's performance does not demonstrate a clear and significant advantage, even over the CFAR baseline.\n\n2. Questionable Validity of the Prior: The poor results call the core premise into question: is using a LiDAR point cloud as a prior truly sound for this task? A key implementation detail is omitted: did the authors strictly filter the LiDAR training data to only include points within the radar's specific Field-of-View (FOV)? The paper mentions pre-processing LiDAR to a $512 \\times 768$ BEV image covering [-90°, 90°], but it is not explicitly stated if this range was chosen to match the radar's FOV. If out-of-FOV data was used to train the prior, this would introduce a strong, incorrect bias, forcing the model to hallucinate points in areas the radar *cannot* see, which could explain the artifacts and poor metrics.\n\nIf the authors can substantially address concern #1 (Poor In-domain Performance) and provide a clear, reasonable explanation for concern #2 (Validity of the Prior), I will consider improving my rating."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "1jS6yAVe3n", "forum": "c4Nbn695Au", "replyto": "c4Nbn695Au", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6387/Reviewer_AEG4"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6387/Reviewer_AEG4"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6387/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761907939745, "cdate": 1761907939745, "tmdate": 1762918669850, "mdate": 1762918669850, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
