The obtained Riemannian metric entirely defines the geometry of the latent manifold and can be used to compute geodesic that stays on the data manifold. In contrast, the paper learns an approximate projection onto the latent manifold. While this indeed allows the projection of latent points onto the manifold, the paper still requires the latent space to be endowed with a Riemannian metric, i.e., the projection itself is not enough to define the geometry of the manifold and compute associated geodesics. In this paper, the Riemannian metric is either chosen empirically as flat (Sec. 5.1, 5.3), or obtained as the pullback metric similar to previous work. The former requires additional assumption on the latent space and/or the AE which do not always apply, while the latter boils down to pulling back the metric as in previous work thus resulting in a two-step approach (instead of the single step required in previous works such as Arvanitidis et al). Thus, the advantages compared to previous works are unclear. \n\nMoreover, the requirements or benefits of computing discrete rather than continuous geodesics in the considered setup are unclear to me. As the metric of the latent space is known, geodesics could be computed as in previous works, i.e., by solving an ODE, approximating the geodesic as a spline (e.g., Tosi et al, Arvanitidis et al), or in a discrete fashion via a Dijkstra algorithm as in (Beik-Mohammadi et al, 2023, Sec. 4.4.3). However, the paper does not compare to these alternatives approaches neither theoretically nor experimentally. Such comparisons are crucially missing, and the contributions of the paper, as well as the performance of the proposed geodesic computation approach compared to previous works, remain unclear. In addition, the aforementioned related works only require a Riemannian metric on the latent space to compute geodesics, while the proposed approach requires both the Riemannian metric and the learned projection.\n\n\nReferences:\n- Beik-Mohammadi, H., Hauberg, S., Arvanitidis, G., Neumann, G. & Rozo, L.
