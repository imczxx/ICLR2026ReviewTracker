As such, identifying relevant confounders from the data is an important preliminary task. Although numerous data-driven techniques have been suggested for confounder selection in conventional exposure-outcome analyses, such methodologies are absent in causal mediation analysis, which entails identifying the effects within the exposure-mediator-outcome framework. This paper presents a Bayesian framework for confounder selection in mediation analysis via Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). We specify separate models for the exposure, mediator, and outcome, and introduce a common sparsity-inducing prior on their selection probability vectors. This enables identification of covariates that are jointly important across all models (that is, potential confounders). Furthermore, we introduce a novel criterion for confounder selection in the context of mediation analysis and establish that satisfaction of this criterion ensures the validity of the sequential ignorability assumption under certain conditions. The proposed method demonstrates consistently strong performance across a range of simulation scenarios, offering a practical approach for confounder selection in high-dimensional mediation analysis.", "tldr": "We develop a Bayesian nonparametric framework for data-driven confounder selection in mediation analysis, designed to handle high-dimensional settings with numerous potential confounders.", "keywords": ["Causal mediation", "Bayesian additive regression trees", "Dirichlet prior"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/acff280df0fd5eeaf374cdda0d8d2920912d6340.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ec43dbc91a9ea557094d1173b5991c6945f16272.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies confounder selection for causal mediation analysis with high-dimensional covariates. It introduces a “mediation disjunctive cause” criterion that extends standard disjunctive cause ideas to the exposure–mediator–outcome setting and shows that sets satisfying this criterion support sequential ignorability, given rich pretreatment covariates. Methodologically, the paper proposes a Bayesian causal mediation forest built from BART components for the exposure, mediator, and outcome, linked by a common sparsity prior on variable selection probabilities to favor variables that matter across all three models. The theory gives selection consistency (including regimes with $P>N$ under growth conditions) and posterior consistency of direct and indirect effects when the models are well specified. Experiments across diverse scenarios and one clinical dataset (ACTG175) suggest improved effect estimation and more targeted selection relative to baselines."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The work's main idea is original in scope: it formulates a mediation-specific selection principle that acknowledges three types of confounding ($\\mathrm{A}-\\mathrm{M}, \\mathrm{A}-\\mathrm{Y}, \\mathrm{M}-\\mathrm{Y}$) and ties it to identification. That fills a gap left by criteria developed for treatment-outcome problems without mediators. The modeling choice-three linked BART components with a shared Dirichlet prior on selection probabilities-offers a clear mechanism to surface variables that play confounding roles in more than one submodel, which is exactly what mediation requires. On technical quality, the paper states conditions under which selection is consistent (including $P$ growing with $N$) and links correct selection to consistent estimation of direct and indirect effects; the assumptions are explicit and the statements align with the modeling choices. Empirically, the simulation design stresses instruments, nuisance predictors, and high-dimensional regimes; the method shows lower bias/MSE and better coverage in many settings, which supports the practical value of joint selection. Clarity is generally good: notation is standard, the three submodels are written down, and the algorithmic idea (reparameterizing the selection vectors through a single Dirichlet prior) is explained. The potential significance is high because mediation analyses in practice often face large covariate sets and need principled, data-driven adjustment that guards against instruments and unrelated predictors while remaining computationally feasible."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Assumptions**. Selection consistency and effect consistency rely on correct specification of the exposure, mediator, and outcome models and on regularity conditions (including Dirichlet concentration behavior). In applied settings, BART components can still be misspecified (e.g., heteroscedastic mediator or non-Gaussian noise). So I am willing to see some robustness results or at least stress tests where one or more components are misspecified (e.g., non-additive interactions only present in $M$ or $Y$). In particular, how selection and effect errors change when the Dirichlet concentration parameter is mis-tuned? \n\n2. **Finite-sample guidance on the prior**. The reparameterized prior is elegant, but the paper offers limited guidance for setting $\\alpha$ and tree counts across submodels beyond defaults. Empirically, the authors conducted a sensitivity analysis of the prior specification in Section F.1. But I am curious if there are any theoretical results which map sample size and $P$ to recommended $\\alpha$, number of trees, and depth priors? \n\n3. **Evaluation design**. The simulation design is broad, but two important regimes are under-explored. First, mediator–outcome confounders partly affected by exposure (post-treatment common causes) violate sequential ignorability and are common in practice. Can the authors show how the method behaves and whether it tends to select such variables (and what that does to bias)? Second, highly correlated covariates and ancestor/proxy chains can cause a high variable inclusion between parents and proxies. Can the authors include correlation-structured designs and report stability (e.g., PIP dispersion across correlated groups)? \n\n4. **Real-data study**. The ACTG175 application uses an RCT. Because randomization weakens A–M and A–Y confounding by design, it is not the strongest test of a confounder-selection method for observational mediation."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Misspecification and sensitivity. How does performance change if the mediator model has heavy tails or heteroscedastic errors, or if the exposure model is probit vs. logit while fitted with a probit link? Please add stress tests and report selection and effect errors.\n\n2. Correlation and proxies. When two or more covariates are highly correlated and sit on the same backdoor path, does the shared Dirichlet prior pick one stably, or does inclusion probability split across them? \n\n3. Tuning the Dirichlet concentration. Provide a data-driven rule or cross-validation scheme for $\\alpha$. Right now, users have little guidance beyond defaults. Could AIC/LOO select $\\alpha$ by targeting coverage or MSE of effects?\n\n4. Sequential ignorability violations. Please include a simulation where some mediator–outcome confounders are affected by treatment. Even a small violation can create bias; showing failure modes and diagnostic signals would help practitioners.\n\n5. MCMC diagnostics. Please provide effective sample sizes, acceptance rates for grow/prune/change steps, and trace plots for key quantities (e.g., average PIP, average effects). This will build confidence in the numerical results.\n\n6. Interpretability. The authors claimed that the shared prior encourages “direct causes” over upstream ancestors (Line 246). Can you formalize this tendency? A small proposition or lemma with assumptions would clarify when the method prefers nearer causes along backdoor paths.\n\n7. On low coverage in Scenario 2 (heterogeneous effects; non-linear outcome with two extra outcome predictors).\nIn Scenario 2 the reported coverage is low for all methods, with your approach also under-covering (e.g., BCMF-CS 0.64; BCMF 0.17; DCMF 0.22; LSEM 0.38). Could you explain the mechanism behind this failure and provide evidence that separates bias from variance underestimation?

As shown in Figure 1, $X_2$ does not appear to satisfy this assumption, since it seems to be a pretreatment variable for $M$ rather than for $A$. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify and formalize this assumption more precisely.\n\nThe proposed method is not evaluated against several recent and relevant approaches, such as Disentangled Representation for Causal Mediation Analysis and Causal Mediation Analysis with Hidden Confounders.
