We introduce learnable fractional operators that bridge time-frequency analysis and functional connectivity through trainable fractional orders. We propose EEG-GraphFrFT, a unified dual-path framework implementing this approach. The first path employs a fractional Fourier transform with a trainable order to adaptively capture nonstationary, transient patterns. The second path constructs functional networks derived from wPLI and Spectral Granger causality and applies graph fractional operators to model complex network interactions. We establish the minimal theoretical properties required for stable training, namely well-posedness and Hölder-type stability, under mild spectral assumptions. A parameter-efficient low-rank cross interaction integrates the two paths. As a challenging validation, we evaluate on epileptic seizure detection across three public datasets (FMCE, HUP, and Helsinki neonatal EEG) under strict subject-disjoint conditions (no leakage). EEG-GraphFrFT consistently outperforms strong baselines (e.g., EEG-Conformer, Mamba) by approximately 2–8 \\% in accuracy, while demonstrating robust performance under colored Gaussian noise and channel dropouts, with corresponding improvements in F1 and AUROC. Beyond EEG, the graph fractional operators are task-agnostic and apply broadly to nonstationary graph signals, e.g., traffic sensor networks, climate teleconnections, and multi-asset financial series.", "tldr": "Adaptive Fractional Fourier Transform with Graph Functional Connectivity for Epileptic Seizure Detection", "keywords": ["AI for health.+Graph Fractional Operator.+Epilepsy Detection"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ff8794dd64f3c1e2dc97475846fc6778bc997189.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes EEG-GraphFrFT, a dual-path architecture combining a learnable fractional Fourier transform on raw EEG signals with a fractional graph operator applied to functional connectivity networks.

Motivation is not clear**\n\nThe paper argues that combining fractional temporal and graph operators addresses non-stationary EEG signals, whose amplitudes and frequencies evolve over time. However, it is not justified why classical time–frequency representations (e.g., multi-scale wavelet transform, which are explicitly designed to handle time-varying frequency content) are insufficient in this setting. Why the fractional transforms are preferable to established non-stationary analysis tools (e.g., wavelets, STFT variants, adaptive time–frequency bases)?\n\n**2. Lack related work and connection to prior methods**\n\nThe related-work section briefly mentions FrFT-based and multi-scale wavelet approaches in computer vision, as well as graph fractional Fourier neural networks. However, the paper does not clearly articulate how these prior works relate to the proposed EEG-GraphFrFT model, nor how the presented method differs from them, weakening the significance of EEG-GraphFrFT model.\n\nIn addition, the discussion of fractional time–frequency methods is incomplete. Relevant recent work on fractional scattering and adaptive time–frequency representations (e.g., Zhao et al., IEEE TSP 2023; Chen et al., IEEE TGRS 2023) is not discussed, leaving a gap in positioning relative to established fractional and wavelet-based models.\n\n[1] Zhao et al, Deep scattering network with fractional wavelet transform, IEEE TSP 2023. \n\n[2] Chen et al, Ssn: stockwell scattering network for sar image change detection, IEEE TGRS 2023\n\n**3. Trivial definition of the fractional pseudo-differential operator**\n\nThe defintion of Fractional Pseudo-Differential Operator $T_{\\alpha}^{\\theta}$ appears trival. It performs a windowed FrFT followed by an inverse transform, with a separable window in the time and fractional-frequency domains. Although the window $a(t,\\xi)$ is stated to be learnable, the core formulation remains largely conventional. From a novelty/contribution perspective, it would be natural to expect the fractional order $\\theta$ itself to be learnable within the framework; without this, the contribution of the proposed operator seems overstated. \n\n**4. Mismatch between theoretical discussion and robustness evaluation**\n\nThe theoretical analysis focuses on the stability of graph fractional filters under structural perturbations of the Laplacian. However, the robustness experiments primarily evaluate performance under additive pink noise. A robustness study aligned with structural graph perturbations (e.g., edge noise, topology corruption) would better support the theoretical claims.\n\n**5. Lack of complexity analysis**\n\nThe paper does not provide a computational complexity analysis for the proposed EEG-GraphFrFT model. It is unclear how the method scales with graph size and how training time, inference cost, and memory usage compare to standard spectral or graph-based baselines."}, "questions": {"value": "1. For the Figure 1. Chanel 1 provides adaptive time-frequency analysis, and Chanel 2 offers the graph (spatical)-spectral analysis, how these outputs from these two Chanels could be fused and combined?\n\n\n2.  In the ablation study of the learnable $\\alpha$, the paper states that both channels use trainable $\\alpha$. However, in the temporal branch (Channel 1), the operator is defined via the fractional Fourier transform, where the fractional order is typically denoted by $\\theta$. It is unclear whether the $\\alpha$ mentioned in the ablation refers to this FrFT order $\\theta$, or to a different parameter. This notation inconsistency makes it difficult to interpret the ablation design.\n\n3. According to the definition of the fractional order $\\alpha$ in graph fractional filters, $\\alpha$ is typically constrained to $(0,1]$.
