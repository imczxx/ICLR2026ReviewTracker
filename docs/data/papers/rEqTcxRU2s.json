By using angular rather than spatial frequencies, our bispectrum achieves lower dimensionality than traditional 2D scattering-based bispectra, avoiding comparisons across two spatial dimensions while still preserving rich frequency information. Extending these bispectra to first- and second-order scattering coefficients produces low-dimensional multi-scale features that capture detailed image structure. To illustrate the quality of the representations, we use k-nearest neighbors, which highlights that our features encode meaningful similarity structure even without a learned parametric classifier. Results on texture, medical, and galaxy images demonstrate that these features show improved separability and similarity structure compared to existing geometric and deep learning-based representations.", "tldr": "We design roto-translation invariant features using the bispectrum of solid harmonic wavelets and test them in supervised tasks.", "keywords": ["Invariant Features", "Wavelets", "Bispectrum", "Solid Harmonics"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/03af8e6b7b04629b4f21f5d4a2eb43c6863718a0.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a Solid Harmonic Wavelet Bispectrum as an alternative to scattering transforms based on the same family of wavelets (which have been shown to be effective for e.g., quantum chemistry) as an unsupervised, deep, nonlinear feature extractor.

This should not be misinterpreted. Most of these weaknesses are fairly unimportant and all are less important than the strengths.\n\nThe authors claim that scattering networks are restricted to two layers because of information destroyed by the modulus operator. However, the reason that scattering networks can be kept \"shallow\" is the concentration of energy results obtained in \"Group invariant scattering, Mallat 2012\" are related works. The modulus operator is intended to introduce invariance in the context of analytic wavelets. However, it may readily be replaced with any activation function in many context, e.g., He and Hirn (see Questions). \n\nTrispectrum is mentioned but not defined.\n\nIt is hard to tell which results are best in the tables. Some bolding/underlining of top methods would help.\n\nTables lack standard deviations which makes it hard to tell how \"real\" the differences in performance are.

This is okay since the backend can be thought of as a tuneable hyperparaemeter in the scattering context.
