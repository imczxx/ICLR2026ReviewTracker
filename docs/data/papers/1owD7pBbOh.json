Yet most sparse recovery methods assume $ \\mathbf{A} $ is precisely known, forcing costly calibration or restrictive acquisition protocols. We address the more realistic setting in which only limited number of observation--target pairs $ (\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{x}) $ are available, necessitating joint operator learning and signal reconstruction. The core challenge is cross-domain dispersion: local structures in the signal $ \\mathbf{x} $ are spread globally into measurements $ \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} $, while CNN architectures rely on local receptive fields. We propose TRUST, a hybrid model that uses multi-resolution attention to recover sparse support directly from measurements. Theoretically, under the standard RIP conditions on $ \\mathbf{A} $, we show that attention maps computed on $ \\mathbf{y} $ approximate those computed on the true signal $ \\mathbf{x} $, with error bounded by the RIP constant. Architecturally, a Vision Transformer encoder estimates global sparse support from $ \\bf y $, and attention-guided skip connections steer a U-Net decoder to concentrate reconstruction capacity on support-consistent regions, coupling global contexts with local details. TRUST resolves the mismatch between measurement dispersion and the locality bias of CNN-only approaches. Across optical imaging, FastMRI, and ImageNet benchmarks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines -- both objectively and subjectively -- with marked reductions in hallucination artifacts. These results establish attention-guided support estimation as a principled and effective approach to high-quality reconstruction while jointly learning unknown sensing operators, enabling robust performance on inverse problems where conventional methods require the precise knowledge of forward models.", "tldr": "We introduce TRUST, a hybrid Transformer–U-Net architecture that jointly learns unknown sensing operators and reconstructs signals, using attention to recover sparse support directly from measurements.", "keywords": ["Inverse Problem", "Sparse recovery", "Compressed sensing", "Cross-domain reconstruction"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b3898f7ccdb11c7a79037cb756028a7359cd08f3.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/22cf81bee62b3657f4bfaac8b4e9b769cc9bc377.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a hybrid transfomer-CNN architecture for solving inverse problems, and experiments on FastMRI, random impainting and fiber coded aperture microendoscope.

Also, for example, Figure 1 and its accompanying discussion add little technical value and could be safely removed; the space would be better used to clearly explain the problem setting and the novelty, and include more evaluation tasks.\n- Technically, the work has limited novelty. The model is essentially a supervised combination of a Vision Transformer encoder and a U-Net decoder, using standard losses (ℓ₂ + SSIM) and skip connections. The method remains a straightforward supervised mapping. Conceptually, this is an incremental variation of prior architectures such as TransUNet or Restormer. \n- Generalization and reconstruction quality remain weak.
