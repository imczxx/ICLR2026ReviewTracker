However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes—vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion—while modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results show that UrbanGraph improves R² by up to 10.8\\% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0\\% over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5\\% and 7.1\\% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Spatio-Temporal Graph", "Heterogeneous Graph", "Dynamic Graph", "Physics-Informed ML", "Urban Microclimate"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/630c50086c169a598dbabf08fc92e3e3a3f1d30b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a novel method to generate high resolution forecast of weather variables over cities.

Although this might be true, I would argue that their method is also fixed. The graph is a gridded mesh, where the edges weight are varying. Additionally, the advantage of using GNNs is usually to work with non-gridded data. Since the domain is discretized, what is the advantage of using a GNN? Wouldn't a transformer with a weighted attention mask work as well?\n- There is no mention of spatial resolution. Maybe I've missed it, but what is the resolution? The GIS data is discretized, so there is a spatial resolution.\n- I am not sure I understand what the inputs are. Beyond the discretized GIS data, what are the inputs of the model? How are the environmental variables integrated? I also didn't see any mention of embedding the environmental variables. The only mention is the Graph-level global environmental features. Are the environmental features only embedded at the graph level? Is there no per-pixel data?\n- I have only seen a train a validation set mentioned, but not test set.\n- The authors claim to increase the computational efficiency in FLOPS by 17%. But in table 1, GGAN-LSTM performs better in terms of FLOPS.

These models often feature more sophisticated spatio-temporal fusion mechanisms than the sequential RGCN-then-LSTM approach used here. Could the authors comment on why these state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs were not included as baselines? A discussion (or ideally, a new experimental comparison) would be needed to truly position UrbanGraph's performance within the broader ST-GNN literature, rather than just against its own ablated components.\n2 Some parameters are likely effective for the UMC4/12 dataset, which is based on Singapore's climate. a) How sensitive is the model's accuracy to these specific values? b) If this model were deployed in a city with a vastly different climate and morphology (e.g., a dry, arid climate with sparse vegetation or different wind patterns), would these parameters need to be manually re-tuned? c) Does the model risk failing if the true physical influence (e.g., of wind) differs from the hard-coded heuristic?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "h7aam7Q0Be", "forum": "ckjNF94cIi", "replyto": "ckjNF94cIi", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17804/Reviewer_dxkG"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17804/Reviewer_dxkG"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17804/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761747412912, "cdate": 1761747412912, "tmdate": 1762927648916, "mdate": 1762927648916, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes UrbanGraph, a framework for urban microclimate prediction that integrates physics-informed, dynamic, and heterogeneous graph neural networks.
