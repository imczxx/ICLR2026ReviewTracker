Yet on-policy algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer in early training: noisy gradients from low-quality rollouts lead to unstable updates and inefficient exploration. We introduce Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO), a simple yet efficient mechanism to address the above limitations via decomposing each iteration into three stages: a short fast trajectory of inner steps on the same batch, a reposition step to control off-policy drift, and a final slow correction. This reposition-before-update design preserves the objective and rollout process unchanged, making SFPO plug-compatible with existing policy-gradient pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFPO consistently improves stability, reduces number of rollouts, and accelerates convergence of reasoning RL training. Specifically, it outperforms GRPO by up to 2.80 points on math reasoning benchmarks. It also achieves up to 4.93$\\times$ fewer rollouts and a 4.19$\\times$ reduction in wall-clock time to match GRPO’s best accuracy.", "tldr": "We propose Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO), a reposition-before-update method that stabilizes on-policy optimization for LLM reasoning.", "keywords": ["LLM reasoning", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5fc51ee3689c9ce0acc9622f5ad44f981887406d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO), a plug-and-play method to stablize and accelerate the learning of on-policy RL algorithms such as GRPO.

The proposed method addresses a significant and well-recognized problem: the instability and sample inefficiency of on-policy algorithms like GRPO in the context of LLM reasoning. The proposed three-stage solution is simple, intuitive, and clearly motivated as a way to reduce update variance and make better use of collected data.\n2.  A major strength of SFPO is its \"plug-and-play\" compatibility with existing policy gradient pipelines. By modifying only the parameter update rule while leaving the loss function, rollout generation, and regularization terms of GRPO intact, the method offers a practical, low-effort path to improving existing training setups.\n3.  The paper is supported by a comprehensive set of experiments that demonstrate consistent and substantial gains over a strong GRPO baseline across multiple models and benchmarks. The reported improvements in sample efficiency (up to $4.93\\times$ fewer rollouts) and wall-clock time (up to $4.19\\times $ reduction) are highly significant. Furthermore, the ablation studies effectively justify the inclusion of each component of SFPO, particularly the adaptive entropy control and the slow correction stage."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.

For example, the citations \"Yu et al., 2025a\" and \"Yu et al., 2025b\" both point to the exact same arXiv preprint, which is misleading."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  Could you clarify the nomenclature for Stage I, the 'Fast Trajectory'? The term 'fast' is somewhat ambiguous. Does it refer to the speed of convergence, the magnitude of the parameter change, or some other property?\n2.  A crucial baseline seems to be missing from the ablation studies. To isolate the benefits of Stage II (Reposition) and Stage III (Slow Correction), have you considered a baseline that only uses Stage I? This would be equivalent to applying GRPO with $K$ inner updates on the same batch, which would more clearly demonstrate the contribution of the reposition and slow correction steps.\n3.  Stage II is designed to control off-policy drift via interpolation. A more common approach in policy gradient methods is to use a KL divergence penalty to constrain the policy update. Could you comment on the design choice of interpolation over a KL penalty? Have you compared the performance of your reposition step against a KL-constrained update in this multi-step update setting?\n4.  The paper claims that SFPO addresses the high-variance gradient issue in GRPO. A significant source of variance in GRPO can come from batches with uniform rewards (e.g., all successes or all failures), which result in zero advantage for all samples. Does SFPO's performance gain stem primarily from better handling these 'zero-advantage' batches? To verify this, it might be necessary to conduct experiments with an algorithm like DAPO, which is explicitly designed to use *dynamic sampling* to mitigate this issue, to see if SFPO provides similar benefits in a setting where this specific source of variance is already addressed.\n5.  Could you provide a derivation or at least a reference for the descent guarantee in Equation (10)? A more formal explanation of the assumptions and the term $F(K, \\alpha) $ would strengthen the paper's theoretical grounding.\n6.  Would you be able to correct the numerical errors in the text describing the results in Table 1 (lines 322-323)? The discrepancies between the reported gains and the values in the table are substantial.\n7. The interpretation of lower entropy in SFPO as \"more efficient exploration\" (lines 374-375) is intriguing. Could you elaborate on this? Is it possible that the method simply encourages faster convergence to a more deterministic policy, which might be beneficial for exploitation but could also be interpreted as a sign of reduced exploration?\n\nI look forward to the author's response. I am willing to reconsider my score if the questions above, particularly those concerning the experimental details, numerical correctness, and key design choices, are adequately addressed."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "wrG8MTAtEC", "forum": "xBlHiHdXap", "replyto": "xBlHiHdXap", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14321/Reviewer_5eGS"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14321/Reviewer_5eGS"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14321/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761882363689, "cdate": 1761882363689, "tmdate": 1762924755717, "mdate": 1762924755717, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper argues that the direction of token-level updates, measured by the signed log-probability difference between base and RLVR models, is more informative than magnitude-based metrics for understanding RLVR's effect on LLM reasoning.
