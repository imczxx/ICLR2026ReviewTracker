We introduce \\textbf{ExpeSQL}, a zero-shot, open-source–compatible framework that enables self-evolving SQL generation through experience-guided refinement. ExpeSQL decomposes questions using schema-aware reasoning, generates verifiable sub-SQLs, and aggregates candidates via result-based filtering and majority voting. When errors occur, a self-critique module performs diagnostic backtracking, storing structured remedies in a persistent memory. These experiences are replayed in future rounds to prevent repeated mistakes—enabling continuous improvement without parameter updates.

The paper does not clearly explain how sub-query–level critiques affect final SQL generation. Algorithm 1 shows sub-queries are executed and validated per node, but self-critique occurs only after full SQL composition. Section 2.3 mentions that agents “leverage long-term memory” to guide decomposition and synthesis, yet no example shows how stored remedies are retrieved or applied in later iterations. The impact of sub-query feedback on future reasoning remains unclear.\n\n2. The proposed “sub-query critique” is essentially an additional diagnostic signal recorded after execution, not an independent reasoning or learning mechanism. The framework mainly combines known components, divide-and-conquer (MAC-SQL), self-reflection (Renze & Guven 2024), iterative refinement (ROUTE, MCTS-SQL, Gen-SQL), and Best-of-N sampling (SuperSQL, Alpha-SQL). Storing these diagnostic traces in an experience repository extends prior fine-grained error-analysis methods (Gen-SQL, SHARE) but does not introduce a substantively new paradigm.\n\n3. The experiments do not isolate the effect of sub-query critique or experience storage. A key missing baseline is ExpeSQL with critique applied only to the final SQL, without sub-query analysis or experience replay, to test whether the fine-grained diagnostic signal provides measurable gains over standard self-reflection. Table 3 reports “Self-Reflection (+3.1%)” but conflates multiple factors, and the paper presents no per-iteration accuracy or retrieval-success statistics to substantiate the claimed benefits."}, "questions": {"value": "see weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "no concerns"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "f2JC53Tu0s", "forum": "StuinE1Ju2", "replyto": "StuinE1Ju2", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10737/Reviewer_sJAv"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10737/Reviewer_sJAv"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10737/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761498447053, "cdate": 1761498447053, "tmdate": 1762921963975, "mdate": 1762921963975, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "EXPESQL introduces a zero-shot, open-source–compatible framework that enables self-evolving SQL generation through experience-guided refinement.

The overall efficiency relative to other fast test-time frameworks remains unclear, and the generalization of efficiency gains across model scales is insufficiently demonstrated.\n* **Missing Ablation on efficiency gain from Long-Term Memory.** The proposed reasoning-path caching with long-term memory is a central contribution, yet there is no quantitative ablation analyzing its benefit. Additional experiments—such as the distribution of refinement loops per task and the token savings with vs. without caching—would strengthen the justification of this design.\n* **Uneven Benchmark Comparison.** The paper’s motivation emphasizes balancing accuracy and efficiency between MCTS-SQL and Alpha-SQL. However, Table 1 reports MCTS-SQL results only on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, whereas Alpha-SQL and ExpeSQL use larger 14B and 32B models. A fair comparison on the same backbone is necessary to substantiate the claimed improvements.\n* **Presentation Could Be Improved.** Since this work focuses on the accuracy–efficiency trade-off, visualizing the results in a 2D scatter plot (e.g., x-axis = token cost, y-axis = accuracy) would make the trade-off clearer. Moreover, presenting results by model family rather than mixing different backbones in one table would improve readability and fairness."}, "questions": {"value": "* The authors note that Spider is relatively simple and therefore skip its evaluation, but Spider 2.0 [1]—released recently—includes more realistic and complex queries.
