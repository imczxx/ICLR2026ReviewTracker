The key challenge in steganography is ensuring imperceptibility while maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction. However, existing methods often suffer from detectability risks and utilize only suboptimal 3DGS features, limiting their full potential. We propose a novel end-to-end key-secured 3D steganography framework (KeySS) that jointly optimizes a 3DGS model and a key-secured decoder for secret reconstruction. Our approach reveals that Gaussian features contribute unequally to secret hiding. The framework incorporates a key-controllable mechanism enabling multi-secret hiding and unauthorized access prevention, while systematically exploring optimal feature update to balance fidelity and security. To rigorously evaluate steganographic imperceptibility beyond conventional 2D metrics, we introduce 3D-Sinkhorn distance analysis, which quantifies distributional differences between original and steganographic Gaussian parameters in the representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both cover and secret reconstruction while maintaining high security levels, advancing the field of 3D steganography.

Using the term \"feature\" may cause confusion with the \"feature\" is used in GS-Hider.\n\n2. **Motivation should be further clarified**: \n- Mentioned in Line 48, the rendering strategy in GS-Hider introduces deviations from the standard GS pipeline. It’s unclear what these deviations refer to, and whether any experiments or visualizations support them. The Keyss method also adds extra MLPs; does this not also deviate from the standard GS pipeline?\n- The main motivation of the proposed method is that \"Gaussian Attributes\ncontribute unequally to steganographic effectiveness\", while all attributes are equally learned, a transformation from the original Gaussian via a set of MLPs. However, all attributes are transformed equally via a shared set of MLPs. Moreover, Tab. 4 shows that all attributes except 'SH' are used, which seems inconsistent with the stated motivation. Since the method essentially learns a transformation of the secret scene, it is natural that all attributes are required for rendering in a new scene. Therefore, further clarification is needed on how the method design aligns with the proposed motivation.\n\n\n3. **Clarification of the used metrics**:\n- The proposed 3D Sinkhorn distance is less motivated: The Sinkhorn distance differs from the Wasserstein distance (commonly used Optimal Transport) mainly by the addition of an entropy regularization term. A theoretical justification for choosing Sinkhorn over standard OT is needed, as the motivation behind this choice is not clearly explained.\n- Main results in Tab. 1 show the effectiveness of the proposed method only by PSNR, while the component selection for the proposed are mainly depends on the proposed Score, shown in Tab. 4. This inconsistent use of the two metrics is confusing. Moreover, the ranking of different settings by Score in Table 4 does not align with their PSNR rankings, which calls for more visual evidence to justify that Score is a more effective metric than PSNR.\n\n\n4. **Experimental Details**:\n- The comparison with related work in the experiments is insufficient (only compared with GS-Hider), though clarified in Line 322 WaterGS and SecureGS are both not open-sourced.\n- The input key is embedded with a Clip text encoder. When the input wrong key is semantically similar but not identical to the correct key (e.g., synonyms or slight word order changes), can the model still successfully reconstruct the cover scene? Additionally, the ratio of correct and wrong keys used during training should be clearly described.\n- The scales of the scenes in Mip-NeRF360 and DeepBlending differ, resulting in different camera intrinsics and extrinsics. How these camera details are handled should be clearly explained.\n\n5. **Visualization should be refined**: \n- Fig.1 and Fig.2 are hard to follow due to low-contrast colors and unclear fonts. The color scheme makes it difficult to distinguish key elements, and the font choice affects readability. Improving visual clarity would make the diagram easier to understand. \n- The Visualization in Fig.4, Fig.5 are blurred. The specific resolution settings for MIP-NeRF360 and DeepBlender used in the experiments should be explicitly reported for reproducibility and fair comparison."}, "questions": {"value": "Refer to the weakness section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "No Ethics Concerns."}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5VnTSYzY1P", "forum": "CcxIDaTfLB", "replyto": "CcxIDaTfLB", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6548/Reviewer_djaB"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6548/Reviewer_djaB"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6548/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761572276753, "cdate": 1761572276753, "tmdate": 1762918894785, "mdate": 1762918894785, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces KeySS (Key-Secured 3D Steganography), a novel end-to-end framework for hiding 3D secret scenes within a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) cover scene.

It incorporates a key-controlled access mechanism into a neural decoder, where CLIP text embeddings act as learnable semantic keys that determine whether the model reconstructs the hidden scene or reproduces the visible cover. The classical concept of secure hiding, which reveals the secret only with the correct key and restores the cover otherwise, is reinterpreted in the 3D Gaussian parameter space by modulating attributes such as opacity, rotation, and position instead of image pixels. In addition, the paper extends the notion of distributional detectability from traditional steganalysis to 3D by introducing the 3D-Sinkhorn distance, a metric designed to measure subtle distributional variations among Gaussian parameters. Together, these components represent a careful transfer of established security mechanisms into modern 3D scene representation learning.\n\nThe method jointly optimizes the cover and multiple secret scenes using a shared decoder, which raises potential concerns about overfitting among different supervision signals. It is not explicitly stated whether the reported quantitative results are obtained on training views or unseen novel views.
