These developments are necessitated by the increased volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However, progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition, it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning applications for optimal power flow problems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["optimal power flow", "machine learning", "dataset"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fd5eeb0f31c7314e1a281a352fb1482d043c4b7b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a28a8d9a416133fc8eb7e5c3a56324a22a26a933.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces PGLearn, an open-source suite for machine learning (ML) research on Optimal Power Flow (OPF).

While the datasets aim to capture real-world conditions, unforeseen variability in actual grids may still limit the applicability of the models trained on these datasets. In addition to the author's previous comments and the testing network size, the variability lies in both the load/demand level but also on the network structure, e.g., the number of nodes, connection, contingency etc.\n\n3. It only focus on OPF problems, which may not be fit for the general audience of the ML community.

The authors are suggested to include a general review on the ML for OPF papers, e.g., how ML are generally applied to OPF problems. There have been several literature review papers on it.

The authors are suggested to state clearly whether the kit contains the function to train/test different ML models? If so, please clarify how to integrate the numerious DNN models and approaches; if not, how should the mentioned Metrics be calculated? Is it still done based on the user side to mannually do so? \nCould you provide more details on the \"baseline ML models\" included in AnonymousRepo2? For example, what specific architectures (e.g., feedforward DNNs, graph neural networks) are supported out-of-the-box, and how does the toolkit handle hyperparameter tuning or integration with popular frameworks like TensorFlow alongside PyTorch?\n\n3. It is also useful to add a set of adversial samples in the dataset for robustness testing under the worst case scenario. The adversial samples here refer to the 'extreme' load inputsinto it, which could lead to solution with high percentage of constraints tightness and lead to the ML model easily makes mistake.\n\n4. Can the suite allow users to self-define the problem and use e.g., API calls, to load the generated dataset? It can be helpful if user have some uncommon reformulated OPF formulations and other general optimization formulation\nRegarding custom OPF formulations or even non-OPF optimization problems (e.g., unit commitment or other power system tasks), how does the modular design support extending the dataset generation in AnonymousRepo1? For example, can users define new constraints or objectives via configuration files without altering the core codebase, and is there built-in validation for feasibility?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "uu59oe381l", "forum": "Q2bEFIk6Y5", "replyto": "Q2bEFIk6Y5", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20946/Reviewer_kPPx"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20946/Reviewer_kPPx"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20946/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762487103432, "cdate": 1762487103432, "tmdate": 1762939041726, "mdate": 1762939041726, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Following the popularity of ML techniques for solving OPF problems, this paper aims to introduce standardized datasets and evaluation tools for ML and OPF. The main motivation of the paper is addressing data scarcity in ML for OPF research by providing a “data augmentation” strategy given snapshots of electricity networks, such as OPF examples from the PGLib-OPF library.

For example, as shown in Algorithm 1, one knows exactly the probability distribution generating the datasets, and can therefore recreate the same dataset. This sets the issue apart from the classical ML reproducibility problem, where we do not know the true data distribution generating image, text, or other data. Therefore, I do not think the authors overcome a very high barrier for democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning applications for optimal power flow problems, as they claim.\n\nHowever, solving the second-order conic relaxations of large datasets in Table 1 for many OPF instances could potentially take a lot of time. In that sense, it could be useful that the library provides these solutions."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "This paper should be rejected because it does not go beyond simply releasing data. ICLR is not a “dataset-only” venue; papers must show scientific contributions, insights, or methodological novelty. Also, the paper could use some polishing. \n\n- The provided sampling methods either have marginal effect on capturing network-level load variability (Demand Sampling) or are repetitions of other works (Status and Time-Series Sampling). Furthermore, it is not convincing that their datasets actually provide this variability. The main motivation of the paper is the lack of (open) datasets capturing variation of load profiles in real-life operating conditions. The authors address this problem by, as they write, “explicitly capturing both global and local variability in the data generation,” as opposed to other works simply adding random perturbations to each bus demand. However, their Demand Sampling method simply multiplies perturbed active/reactive demand at each bus by the same constant $b$ sampled from a uniform distribution. While this contribution is quite marginal, it also reduces the approximate correlation between bus demands to a linear relationship, which is not realistic for power systems. This load profile would only be realistic if the support of  $b$  is around 1."}, "questions": {"value": "- Line 307 mentions N-1 contingencies. Are you solving any security-constrained OPF problems? If not, what is the purpose of this part?

Could you clearly state the contribution here?\n- Do the generated OPF datasets include any variations of generator cost curves, or upper/lower bounds on branch flows, generation, or bus voltage magnitudes?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "p704Z1wMKr", "forum": "Q2bEFIk6Y5", "replyto": "Q2bEFIk6Y5", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20946/Reviewer_uQ1p"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20946/Reviewer_uQ1p"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20946/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762549010987, "cdate": 1762549010987, "tmdate": 1762939041394, "mdate": 1762939041394, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
