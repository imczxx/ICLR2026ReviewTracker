The framework produces a virtually infinite combination of data streams with controlled shift events and time-dependent data, making it a tool to evaluate methods under evolving data. CaDrift synthesizes various distributional and covariate shifts by drifting mapping functions of the SCM, which change underlying cause-and-effect relationships between features and the target. In addition, CaDrift models occasional perturbations by leveraging interventions in causal modeling. Experimental results show that, after distributional shift events, the accuracy of classifiers tends to drop, followed by a gradual retrieval, confirming the generator's effectiveness in simulating shifts. The framework has been made available on GitHub.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["synthetic data generation", "data streams", "structural causal models", "distributional shift", "concept drift", "causal modeling"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/908c4612356b068901f03e6397190f56ef878681.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/5ea2e728116d4bc9def324d838b5bd64da7cddd5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces CaDrift, a framework for generating synthetic, time-dependent data streams with concept drift, based on Structural Causal Models (SCMs).

The work addresses a well-recognized need in the data stream community: the lack of versatile and controllable benchmark generators. The ability to simulate specific types of drifts, including those rooted in causal mechanisms, is a valuable goal.\n\n2. The proposed framework is technically sound. The combination of SCMs for structured data generation, classic time-series components (EWMA, AR noise) for temporal correlation, and parameter modulation for drift is a logical and well-implemented approach."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The primary weakness is the limited novelty of the proposed method. CaDrift is essentially an engineering amalgamation of existing, well-known components: SCMs, EWMA, and AR models. While the integration is effective, it does not introduce new machine learning principles or a novel theoretical framework. The contribution feels more like a useful software tool than a fundamental research advancement.\n\n2. The paper heavily emphasizes its \"causal\" foundation, yet the experimental design fails to demonstrate why this is beneficial. The experiments do not show how the underlying causal structure leads to challenges that are distinct from those in non-causal generators. For instance, there are no experiments showing how models fail on specific types of causal confounding or how a causally-aware model might excel on CaDrift's data. Without such evidence, the \"causal\" aspect remains an unsubstantiated claim of superiority.\n\n3. The main experimental results (Table 2, Fig. 3) largely confirm a well-established phenomenon in streaming literature: model performance drops after a concept drift, and adaptive models recover faster. The experiments use CaDrift as a testbed but fail to yield any new, deep insights into model behavior. The controllable nature of the generator is underutilized; it could have been used to explore more nuanced questions, such as how the topological location of a drift in the causal graph affects model adaptation.\n\n4. It is not clear that the data generated by CaDrift presents challenges that are fundamentally different from or more realistic than those from widely-used existing generators (e.g., SEA, RandomRBF, Hyperplane). While CaDrift offers more explicit control, the paper does not demonstrate that this control allows for simulating real-world phenomena that other generators cannot. The value proposition over the existing ecosystem of benchmarks is not strongly made."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "WOVoOBta5f", "forum": "ncc1Wz02Fc", "replyto": "ncc1Wz02Fc", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21888/Reviewer_v6KE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21888/Reviewer_v6KE"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21888/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761455696945, "cdate": 1761455696945, "tmdate": 1762941970023, "mdate": 1762941970023, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a dataset generator for generating causal concept drift datasets that can be used for benchmarking concept drift detection and adaptation methods."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- Addresses an important problem, which is well-grounded in the literature.
