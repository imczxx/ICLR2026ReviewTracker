In our approach, safety rules are grounded as temporal logic constraints, providing precise semantics for specifying state invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing requirements. These rules enable formal checking of embodied-agent behavior at multiple stages of decision-making. $\\texttt{SENTINEL}$ is organized into a progressive evaluation pipeline: at the $\\textit{semantic level}$, natural language safety requirements are interpreted as Temporal Logic (TL) specifications; at the $\\textit{planning level}$, high-level action programs and subgoals are checked against these TL rules before execution; and at the $\\textit{trajectory level}$, multiple simulated executions are merged into planning trees and verified against more physical-detailed Computation Tree Logic (CTL) specifications. This provides a reproducible protocol for jointly measuring task completion and safety compliance. By grounding safety in temporal logic and enabling formal evaluation across semantics, plans, and trajectories, $\\texttt{SENTINEL}$ establishes a comprehensive pipeline for systematically assessing LLM-based embodied-agent safety, laying the foundation for agents that are not only capable but also reliably safe in realistic environments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Safety in LLM-based Embodied Agent"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e77b3395be8c1012832021fdda1f82fe7b80cb91.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e9c201bc0a20e76665230b79ad34512580f03a51.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces SENTINEL, a framework for evaluating the physical safety of LLM-based embodied agents.

This is a critical, high-impact research area and a significant bottleneck for the trustworthy, real-world deployment of these systems."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**1. Questionable Motivation and Limited Novelty**\n\n* **Unnecessary Complexity:** The framework's core premise of translating natural language (NL) rules into formal temporal logic (TL) adds a complex layer that may be unnecessary. This translation step itself is a significant source of failure, as shown by the paper's own semantic evaluation, and complicates the process for LLMs that are designed to reason over NL directly.\n* **Insufficient Justification:** The paper fails to justify *why* this translation is necessary. It does not explain why an LLM capable of understanding complex NL task instructions cannot also be evaluated directly against NL safety constraints.\n* **Unmet Burden of Proof:** The authors do not demonstrate that their complex, TL-based evaluation is more effective at detecting safety violations than a simpler, direct NL-based evaluation. The assumption that TL is superior to NL for this task remains unproven.\n\n**2. Doubts Regarding the Methodology**\n\n* **Decoupled Hierarchy:** The \"multi-level\" framework does not match an agent's runtime decision flow (Instruction $\\rightarrow$ Plan $\\rightarrow$ Action). \"Level 1\" (NL-to-TL translation) is merely an offline pre-processing step, completely decoupled from the agent's reasoning. A true hierarchical evaluation should first assess the agent's ability to identify risks from the initial instruction *before* planning.\n* **Redundant Logic:** The switch from LTL to CTL is poorly justified. Verifying that all *n* sampled trajectories are safe can be achieved by *n* independent LTL checks. Merging paths into a tree for a single, more complex CTL check is logically equivalent, and its added benefit over the simpler approach is not explained.\n* **Offline-Only Assessment:** The framework is a purely *post-hoc* auditing tool, not a real-time safety mechanism. It evaluates trajectories *after* they have been fully sampled, offering no capability to intervene or prevent an unsafe action as it happens, which severely limits its practical utility.\n\n**3. Lack of Evaluation on Mainstream VLA Models**\n\n* **Outdated Model Scope:** The evaluation is restricted to LLMs, ignoring the more relevant Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that dominate modern robotics.  VLA models, which fuse vision into their decisions and directly output control params, will have different failure modes than text-only llms. By excluding VLAs, the paper fails to assess the framework's applicability to state-of-the-art agents or to compare safety performance across architectures.\n\n**4. Absence of Real-World Robotic Evaluation**\n\n* **Simulation-Only Validation:** The experiments are confined to simulation, which is insufficient for evaluating *physical* safety. This approach ignores real-world physics, sensor noise, and actuator latencies that are critical to safety.\n* **Ignoring the Sim-to-Real Gap:** The paper makes no attempt to bridge the \"sim-to-real gap.\" A plan verified as \"safe\" in simulation could fail catastrophically in the real world, and without validation on physical hardware, the claims about \"physical safety\" are not credible.\n\n**5. Missing Critical Experimental Details**\n\n* **Undefined Data Curation:** The paper fails to describe the *criteria* or *methodology* used to extract the \"safety-related subset\" of tasks from VirtualHome and ALFRED. This makes it impossible to judge if the dataset is representative or biased.\n* **Unspecified Dataset Size:** The total size (N=?) of the task datasets is never reported. Without this, the reported percentage-based metrics are statistically meaningless and their robustness cannot be assessed.\n* **Ambiguous Notation:** Key formal notation is left ambiguous or undefined. For instance, the definition of \"C\" is not clearly defined in line 140-141, creating confusion in a paper that should be formally precise."}, "questions": {"value": "See above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "HCcKFtuGkj", "forum": "vCyxemIKLL", "replyto": "vCyxemIKLL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3494/Reviewer_eNbM"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3494/Reviewer_eNbM"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3494/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761510834903, "cdate": 1761510834903, "tmdate": 1762916756404, "mdate": 1762916756404, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "SENTINEL translates natural language safety rules into temporal logic and evaluates LLM agents at three levels: semantic, plan, and trajectory.

While SENTINEL reimplements CTL checking (via BFS/DFS traversal), it does not leverage existing mature model-checking tools (e.g., NuSMV, SPIN, PRISM). Although the paper's key difference lies in its use of formal verification, it has not demonstrated that SENTINEL's in-house LTL/CTL checker is equivalent to standard model-checking semantics. It defines satisfaction rules for LTL/CTL from natural languages but it's still unclear to me that the verification is sound (no false positives) or complete (no missed violations). To me, the claimed rigor of \"formal verification\" remains conceptual rather than guaranteed.\n\n(-) No refinement process is used, i.e., the framework performs plan-level verification in isolation without progressively refining or strengthening specifications during execution. Consequently, plan-level checks cannot capture runtime or spatially dependent conditions (e.g., proximity, force, timing).\n\n(-) Evaluation is confined to VirtualHome and ALFRED, both using discrete action spaces. The framework is not tested in continuous, more complicated environments where continuous control and real-time safety verification are critical, limiting generalizability to real-world application.\n\n(-) The framework depends on a curated set of ground-truth temporal-logic constraints per task, but the paper only briefly describes how these constraints were created. It does not explain who curated them, how long it took, or how correctness and consistency were validated. This makes the specification process hard to reproduce or adapt to new domains that require expert-defined safety rules.\n\n(-) The paper lacks quantitative analysis of property coverage and verification efficiency. It does not report how many properties were tested per task, their representativeness across safety categories, or the average number verified. Verification time, storage overhead, and scalability as trajectory complexity grows are also not discussed, leaving the practical scalability and completeness of the method unclear.\n\nSuggestions:\n1.
