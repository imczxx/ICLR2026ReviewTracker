Existing datasets lack scale, tightly aligned modalities, and balance in emotion diversity thereby limiting robust multimodal models. To address this, we propose \\textbf{SpEmoC}, a large-scale \\textbf{Sp}eaking segment \\textbf{Emo}tion dataset for \\textbf{C}onversations. SpEmoC comprises 306,544 clips from 3,100 English-language videos, featuring synchronized visual, audio, and textual modalities annotated for seven emotions, and yields a refined set of 30,000 high-quality clips. It focuses on speaking segments under diverse conditions like low lighting and resolution, with a threshold-based filtering and human annotation ensuring a balanced dataset. SpEmoC is class-balanced, which enables fair learning across all emotions and leads to comparably balanced performance across all classes. We introduce a lightweight CLIP-based baseline model with a fusion network and a novel multimodal contrastive loss to enhance emotion alignment. We conduct a series of experiments demonstrating strong results, establishing SpEmoC as a reliable benchmark for advancing multimodal emotion recognition research.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multimodality", "Audio", "Vision", "Language", "Emotion Recognition"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c3c73e08dbd647ba67e3928567c2624baf45fac2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces SpEmoC, a large-scale multimodal dataset for emotion recognition in spoken conversational segments.

SpEmoC significantly outperforms previous benchmarks (e.g., MELD, CAER) in terms of scale and emotional balance. The use of synchronized video, audio, and text from various cinematic sources in real-world settings (e.g., with low lighting and variable resolution) improves the ecological validity of multimodal emotion recognition.\n2. The authors use a two-step annotation strategy: first, they use pseudo-labels generated from pretrained unimodal emotion classifiers (DistilRoBERTa and Wav2Vec 2.0) to create a large dataset of labeled clips. They then use the KL-divergence regularization to ensure consistency between different modalities. Second, they have 20 experts validate 50,000 clips, achieving a Fleiss' Kappa score of 0.62, which balances scalability and reliability.\n3. The proposed Extended Reweighted Multimodal Contrastive Loss incorporates sentiment-based reweighting using KL divergence between unimodal emotion distributions. This aligns emotionally consistent embeddings across modalities, which significantly improves performance compared to using cross-entropy alone.\n4. The lightweight model was trained and evaluated on not only SpEmoC, but also MELD and CAER. This allows for a direct comparison of the quality of the datasets through consistent modeling, strengthening the claim that the balanced design of SpEmoC yields more equitable performance for minority emotion classes, such as Fear and Disgust."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. While the dataset includes 3,100 videos, 85% originate from scripted films/TV shows, limiting generalizability to spontaneous, real-world affect. Moreover, the paper provides no information on speaker-level demographics (e.g., gender, age), only coarse video-level ethnicity estimates. This omission hinders fairness and bias analysis, that critical in affective computing.\n2. The pipeline uses YOLOv8 for face/human detection, but the paper does not explain how the target speaker is chosen when multiple individuals are present. Without explicit speaker diarization or face-voice alignment, the emotion label (based on text/audio) may not match the visual subject, especially in group conversations.\n3. The proposed model combines frozen CLIP-ViT (with AIM adapters), HuBERT, and a simple MLP fusion head - a standard architecture in multimodal learning. Although efficient (~8.68M trainable parameters), it does not offer any architectural innovation, and serves primarily as a validation tool for the dataset, rather than a significant contribution to the field of modeling.\n4. The authors report F1 scores for MELD and CAER, but they do not compare them with existing state-of-the-art models. Therefore, it is unclear whether the performance differences are due to the quality of the dataset or the capability of the model. Consequently, the claim of \"strong results\" is not supported by the current literature.\n5. The ERMC loss is only compared to vanilla cross-entropy and not to other contrastive, focal, or rebalancing losses. Without these comparisons, the additional value of ERMC is uncertain.\n6. Although the authors use a movie-level split, emotional expressions in acted content can be stereotypical or dependent on the genre (e.g., fear in horror). If certain genres dominate the splits, the model may learn correlations between genres and emotions rather than genuine affective cues, leading to inflated generalization metrics."}, "questions": {"value": "1. In clips with multiple speakers, how is the subject of visual analysis aligned with the audio/text transcript? Has any form of facial recognition or voice identification been used?\n2. Can the authors provide speaker-level metadata, such as gender, age, and ethnicity, for the 30,000 refined clips? If not, how do they ensure that their model is not biased against certain groups in terms of representation?\n3. Why was the proposed model not compared to recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) systems on MELD and CAER datasets? The authors could have included such comparisons to determine whether performance improvements are due to improved data quality or the model design.\n4. Have the authors explored the use of alternative loss functions to address class imbalance and modality alignment in their experiments? If so, how does the ERMC model compare to these other approaches?\n5.

The empirical validation of the dataset’s effectiveness is too limited. In the main paper, only a single table (Table 4) reports results, and although some ablations are deferred to the appendix, there is no exploration of how SpEmoC benefits other downstream tasks. For a dataset contribution, readers expect broader evidence of utility, such as transfer to related tasks, pretraining gains for unimodal and multimodal backbones, or improvements in low-resource settings.\n\n2. If I understand correctly, comparisons across datasets are conducted on each dataset’s own train/test split, without cross-dataset evaluation. This setup prevents a clear assessment of generalization. For a large-scale dataset claim, the community typically prioritizes evidence of out-of-domain robustness over in-domain performance on the new dataset. High in-domain scores on same-source data may simply indicate that the collection is not particularly challenging.\n\n3. Results reported for the other two datasets in your tables are substantially below those in the literature. Stronger baselines should be selected and reproduced under comparable settings. \n\n4.
