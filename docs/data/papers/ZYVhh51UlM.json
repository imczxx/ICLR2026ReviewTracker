Existing generative methods operate on single modalities (transcriptomic or morphological alone) and condition on post-treatment measurements without leveraging paired control-treatment dynamics. We present **Pert2Mol**, the first framework for multi-modal phenotype-to-structure generation that integrates transcriptomic and morphological features from paired control-treatment experiments. Pert2Mol employs separate ResNet and cross-attention encoders for microscopy images and gene expression profiles, with bidirectional cross-attention between control and treatment states to capture perturbation dynamics rather than simple differential measurements. These multi-modal embeddings condition a rectified flow transformer that learns velocity fields along straight-line trajectories from noise to molecular structures, enabling deterministic generation with superior efficiency over diffusion models. We introduce Student-Teacher Self-Representation (SERE) learning where an exponential moving average teacher supervises student representations across network depths, stabilizing training in high-dimensional multi-modal spaces. Unlike previous approaches that require preprocessed differential expression vectors, Pert2Mol learns perturbation effects directly from raw paired experimental data. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the first successful multi-modal framework for phenotype-driven molecular generation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multi-modal generation", "Perturbation biology", "Molecular generation"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1db78ba2da21638d3b23186a60ad3db014445eb3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this work, the authors study the problem of generating chemical structures that achieve a target biological effect, conditioned on paired data from control and treatment samples.

The use of a transformer-based approximate vector field facilitates the incorporation of conditioning information via two mechanisms: cross-attention and adaptive normalization.

Molecular Representation: Could the authors describe this component in more detail? The text seems to present conflicting or incomplete information. The first reference points to \"RoBERTa\" which suggests a masked modeling objective. However, the second reference describes a contrastive learning method.

Furthermore, the paper states, \"Tokenization uses learned molecular motifs,\" but provides no details on how these motifs are learned. Please clarify the exact architecture and training objective of the molecular encoder.\n2. Student-Teacher Self-representation (SERE): Is this method a novel contribution of this paper? No references are provided in its description. Additionally, the description is contradictory. The text first implies that the student and teacher are different layers within the same transformer vector field. However, it later mentions \"higher-\" and \"lower-noise layers,\" which suggests a comparison across different denoising timesteps. Please clarify: (a) if SERE is novel, and (b) the precise mechanism of the student-teacher relationship (i.e., which layers or timesteps are being compared).\n3.
