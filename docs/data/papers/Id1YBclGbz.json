However, real-world robotic systems typically operate in environments with asynchronous signals, i.e. sensors that update at different frequencies. We model \\textbf{asynchronous environments} as an instance of a noise-parameterized family of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Our primary contribution, **Learning Across the Noise Spectrum (LANS)**, is a novel strategy that exposes the agent to multiple simulated noise regimes during training, implemented using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By sampling different asynchronicity rates, we encourage the development of robust estimators. We prove that LANS acts a _time-aware_ regularization term, equivalent to a Jacobian penalty along time-sensitive directions. Experiments on MuJoCo environments with simulated asynchronicity demonstrate that LANS outperforms alternative methods on a variety of tasks—up to a factor of $>1.5\\times$ in some instances—offering a solution for robotic systems that must operate with imperfect sensory information.", "tldr": "We study reinforcement learning in environments with asynchronous signals, proposing both a theoretical framework to tackle the topic and a novel learning algorithm that improves baselines alternative on asynchronous environments.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Robotics", "Regularization", "SAC", "RNNs", "Partial Observability"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7ff1fb1f2144a1e213016dbea68f6b7f13f02f24.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/18aed28aad787a66db79d9731cf953a245f63c2c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The works studies reinforcement learning in asynchronous environments, where agents receive only a subset of all available signals at each timestep.

In particular, in Sec. 2 some terms were introduced without being connected to the previous discussion. I believe the text can be polished for a smoother reading. (See my questions below for more details on this matter).\n\n- Originality: I am not very familiar with the field of RL for asynchronous signals. Is this the first work proposing to address such a matter? For example, aren't the works [1,2,3] somehow related? I would expect the authors to provide a discussion of these related works in Sec. 4 of the document, but it appears that the authors focused their attention on other areas. Maybe these works differ from the case considered by the authors; nevertheless, if that is the case, I think it is important that this is clearly explained in the document. The discussion in Sec. 4 feels rather too general.\n\n- Significance of the empirical results: in 3 out of the 5 tested environments the proposed method (LANs) performs similar to the other baselines. I believe this is not a reason to reject the paper alone; still, I believe the results to be a bit \"mixed\".\n\n\n[1] - http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1193736 \n\n[2] - https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11096\n\n[3] - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12759"}, "questions": {"value": "- line 113: What is the symbol after \"S=\".

I feel like this kind of information, if needed, is up to the agent to track it, no?\n- line 141: \"(...), we assume that the transition dynamics \\tilde{P}_a\" in the observation space (...)\" - what do you mean by transition dynamics in the obesrvation space? Transition dynamics are usually defined with respect to states, not observations. Also, $\\tilde{P}_a$ is not part of the definition of an AMDP.\n- \"AMDPs are not a special case of POMDPs\" - I am not convinced regarding this claim. In particular, why can't we create an \"extended POMDP\" where we also keep track of the $\\delta$'s in the state and then define the transition function to encode both the transitions between original states, as well as the $\\delta$'s. The transition function would actually be similar to (2) but where we replace the observations with the new states. Then, we can come up with a stationary observation function that just presents the relevant information to the agent at each timestep depending solely on the underlying state of the POMDP. Isn't this the case?\n- line 166: \"well-defined rate $\\lambda$\" - what do you mean by a well-defined rate? While reading the article it is the first time this word comes up. How does this relate to $p(\\delta)$'s? Is it that $p(\\delta) = \\lambda$ for every $\\delta \\in \\mathbb{N}.$\n- Eq. (7): Is $\\mathbb{V}$ the variance?

A “state space” must be constructed such that observations and state transitions are both Markov when conditioned on state. Therefore, this is a POMDP, but the “state space” is “S x \\delta”, and the transition includes p(\\delta) as well. Given that I think this result can be framed as a POMDP with an appropriate definition of state space, section 2.2 is confusing to me as well, because they are a subset of POMDPs with the appropriate choice of state space.\n\nA related error: In Eq 1, you write a transition function in terms of observation space but as written this is not well-defined, since it depends on the underlying non-null state.\n\nI am unclear on one aspect of the experimental results. Are the DAE results based on the recurrent baseline, or an MLP? If the latter, this is not an appropriate baseline as the problem is partially observable.\n\nI think the empirical results could have been more geared towards demonstrating asynchronous robustness. For example, results that swept over asynchronous-ness and show the other methods are more strongly affected. Also, generally, neither the results in figure 2 or 3 demonstrate clear superiority in the settings provided.\n\nI am not very familiar with the literature on handling sensor delays, however I do know that it exists.
