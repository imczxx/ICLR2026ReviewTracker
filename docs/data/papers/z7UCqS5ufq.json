However few tools exist for contextual evaluation for the alignment of decision agents with clinicians' workflows. Consequently, few methods exist to test properties of a contextually-optimal set of aligned agents to target for adoption. Contextual evaluation of decision models is particularly important in settings with few or no gold-standard decisions or preference alignment, such as clinical decision-making. Our work adopts the multinomial logit choice (MNL) model as a framework for evaluating agent-alignment and identifying an optimal agent-set. We assume the observation of selections among a set of agents according to a contextual MNL model, characterized by context-dependent preference parameters. We study a weighted, regularized local likelihood maximization estimator, providing a uniform convergence rate over a compact context space. Additionally, when agent-specific utility parameters or functions are known, we provide results for the identification of a utility-optimal assortment of agents. In this setting, we provide results to construct valid confidence bands on inferential objects of interest and the ability to perform asymptotically valid tests on the composition of this optimal assortment.", "tldr": "We provide methods for the contextual evaluation of decision-aid agents and the identification of a contextually-optimal set of agents, based on multiway comparisons data.", "keywords": ["optimal assortment", "model evaluation", "decision model", "nonparametric statistics"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3f4a36cb1d5c473a201f96ee46df92b5306c458b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this work, the authors propose a framework for contextual assortment optimization and inference.

The related work section clearly identifies the gap in prior work that is addressed by this approach -- i.e., Shen et al. (2023). Both the model and the target estimands (i.e., contextual marginal utility gap) are natural in a discrete choice setting, and the dependence of both the utility functions and preference function on x is beneficial for flexibility of the approach. Clear statement of theoretical assumptions and their limitations (e.g., that the multinomial logit choice model implicitly makes the independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption) is also a clear strength of the work."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "## Limited empirical validation\n\nIn its current form, the work has very limited empirical validation, consisting of a single simulation study in the appendix. Additionally, there are limited details of the setup, performance metrics, and results for this experiment. This makes the work incomplete in its current form. \n\nThis work is off to an excellent start; as the authors continue to refine it into its final form, I encourage the authors to substantially extend the scope of the empirical validation by adding further numeric experiments, as well as experiments with semi-synthetic or real-world data. This will provide important evidence for the empirical validity of the work. In experiments, I encourage the authors to illustrate how context-dependent estimation improves the empirical results. Ablations with context-dependent preference functions and utility functions would both be interesting, as would experiments that vary the assortment set size.  \n\n\n## Limited motivation \n\nIn its current form, there is also a strong disconnect between the motivation for the paper and its technical content. While the technical content of the work is sound, the authors repeatedly reference \"decision agents\" in the abstract, but drop this discussion in the introduction and the remainder of the main text. \n\nThroughout the abstract and introduction, a key thing I was missing is *why is this optimal assortment problem is important?* Further, I was looking for a more concrete motivation for why a decision-support tool developer might want to select a model on the basis of discrete choice preferences. Typically tool adoption decisions are made on the basis of some external outcome (e.g., utility/accuracy) based measure. \n\nWhile the proposed framework accounts for \"tool-specific cost or utility information”, typically in clinical settings preference information is used to characterize some some component of the decision subject preferences or decision outcomes. E.g., the canonical decision curve analysis characterizes tradeoff between the cost of false positive and false negatives. Similarly, while the authors claim that users' perceived value can differ by prompt, this seems to motivate that the choice of decision-making tool would vary depending on the prompt, which is not practically feasible. \n\nOverall, I am certain that this technical problem *is* important in some setting, and I invite the authors to either (1) provide a stronger support for why application to decision-support tool selection is a salient application area, or (2) switch to a different application area. I encourage the authors to pick a motivating application that is aligned with the domain of the semi-synthetic / real-world experiments. \n\n## Dense technical presentation\n\nWhile the current main text exposition provides good detail, it is prohibitively dense in its current form. I encourage the authors to provide more exposition surrounding key results, especially theorems 4.1 and 4.2. Further, while statement of assumptions in 2.1 is important, shifting these to elsewhere in the text would strengthen the flow leading into the problem formulation. Spending more time in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 describing the theoretical setup and target quantities would also help the reader understand the relevance and importance of this problem (see remarks above). Finally, in its current form, Section 4.3 reads as cursory and \"tacked on\". Given the importance of the hypothesis testing procedure, I invite the authors to spend more time outlining the estimation procedure, perhaps with pseudocode."}, "questions": {"value": "- Can you elaborate on how this work differs from Wang et al.

While there is no inferential method for contextual MNL model, is there any inferential method for MNL model without contextual consideration?

Lack illustrative examples for practical connection: The paper begins with an interesting practical challenge of identifying if new tools should be included in assortment of decision aids for clinicians, but the rest of the paper does not connect back to this motivating task. While the paper is largely methodological, I think illustrative examples are needed to demonstrate the proposed method in practical setting. I see two possible ways to go about this: (1) a case study with synthetic or real-world data generated with the process described in Section 2, then apply the proposed methods on this data to reveal insights about preference and assortment (2) without using actual data, describe a few application scenarios where observable data is available for estimation and discuss examples of relevant hypotheses to test in inference."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to my questions listed in the weaknesses.
