However, existing deep learning methods still face challenges in effectively capturing and learning both semantic and structural information from source code. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, \\textbf{GraWalkER}, designed to achieve more accurate code vulnerability detection.\nGraWalkER employs a two-stage approach for vulnerability detection. In the first stage, we introduce a novel \\textbf{Code Semantic Fusion Graph (CSFG)} to generate an enhanced code graph representation. This new graph structure incorporates multifaceted program properties from source code. In the second stage, we propose an \\textbf{Edge-aware Random Walk with Unifying Memory (ERUM)} method. ERUM extracts path features by weighting edge types during random walk processes, enabling comprehensive graph representation learning for precise vulnerability identification.\nWe conduct comprehensive evaluations of GraWalkER on three datasets covering both Java and C/C++ programming languages, comparing it against seven state-of-the-art vulnerability detection methods.

In absolute terms, some improvements are modest. For instance, on the SNOL dataset, GraWalkER's F1 score (90.1%) remains largely on par with the best baseline (90.3%), with gains primarily observed in precision and AUC. On Defects4J, despite a relatively larger relative improvement, the final F1 score remains only around 33%, indicating that numerous defects continue to be missed.\n\nIt would be beneficial to include some discussion or experimentation regarding computational costs. How does GraWalkER compare to typical GNNs or CodeBERT-based approaches in terms of training time or model size? If the random walk method incurs higher computational costs, is the improvement in accuracy justified?\n\nThis paper compares its own data fusion approach with three alternative methods. However, the comparative results suggest that this novel data fusion scheme does not appear to yield any significant advantages.

This paper lacks of comparison with some LLM-based approaches. Specifically, recent LLMs, such as Qwen series, Claude series, and GPT series models, and some LLM-based vulnerability detection approaches, such as GRACE [1] have shown remarkable performance on code understanding and vulnerability detection tasks. The paper only compares with medium-scale pretrained models, but not with current LLM-based methods, which limits the claim of SOTA performance.\n2. Another concern is about the complexity and scalability of the proposed method. The combination of CSFG and ERUM may be computationally heavy for large projects or real-time analysis. \nThe paper would benefit from runtime or scalability analysis to justify practical deployability.\n3. This paper is also missing some details on hyperparameters and architecture tuning. Specifically, this paper does not specify details. This limits the reproducibility and interpretability of the results.\n4. The ablation isolates CSFG and ERUM, but not finer components (e.g., impact of individual edge types). Additional experiments would better clarify what parts contribute most.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Guilong Lu, Xiaolin Ju, Xiang Chen, Wenlong Pei, and Zhilong Cai. 2024.
