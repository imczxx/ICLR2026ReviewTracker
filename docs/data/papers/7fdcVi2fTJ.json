While numerous embedding models have been proposed, their performance varies across domains. This variability motivates the use of ensemble techniques to combine complementary strengths. However, most existing ensemble methods operate on deterministic embeddings and fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, limiting their robustness and reliability in downstream applications. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC). UEC first transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones in a post-hoc manner. It then computes adaptive ensemble weights based on embedding uncertainty, grounded in a Bayes-optimal solution under a surrogate loss. Additionally, UEC employs an uncertainty-aware similarity function that directly incorporates uncertainty into the similarity scoring, providing a theoretically grounded and efficient surrogate to distributional distances. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that UEC consistently improves both performance and robustness by leveraging principled uncertainty modeling.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Probabilistic embeddings", "Embedding convolution", "Uncertainty-aware similarity"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/450d2f10d0f69c5cd6919f56289911f2c916d997.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the limitation of deterministic embedding ensembles, which fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, by proposing the Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC) method.

We appreciate that the reviewers acknowledged our contributions in the following aspects:\n1. **Principled and Well-Motivated Framework** : Reviewers highlighted that UEC introduces a clean, probabilistically grounded way to ensemble embedding models by converting deterministic embeddings into uncertainty-aware Gaussian representations and leveraging principled Bayes-optimal weighting.\n2. **Strong Theoretical Foundations** : The derivation of Gaussian embedding posteriors via Laplace Approximation, the Bayes-optimal ensemble coefficients, and the ranking-preserving link between probit similarity and Wasserstein/Jeffreys distances were noted as rigorous, meaningful contributions.\n3. **Practicality, Scalability, and Generality** : UEC was appreciated for being post-hoc, model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and directly applicable to large pretrained encoders—making the method both practical and broadly usable in real-world scenarios.\n4. **Comprehensive Empirical Validation** : Reviewers acknowledged the extensive experiments across retrieval, classification, STS, bitext mining, clustering, and reranking on large multilingual benchmarks (MMTEB, MIRACL), along with clear ablations, calibration diagnostics, and sensitivity studies demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines.\n\n\nDuring the rebuttal period, we have significantly revised and improved our manuscript by addressing the raised concerns. The major updates are as follows:\n1. **Significant revision of Section 3 for clarity** : We thoroughly reorganized Section 3 to improve clarity, readability, and theoretical precision. This includes rewriting Section 3.1 to provide a high-level, intuition-focused explanation of Laplace Approximation while moving derivations to Appendix A.1, expanding the intuition in Section 3.2, clarifying the transition from Eq. (2) to Eq. (3), adding missing retrieval-time constraints, and strengthening the Bayes-optimal interpretation with improved derivations and explanations.\n2. **Clarified surrogate-loss formulation and unique solution** : We added retrieval-specific justification for dropping document-dependent terms, cited relevant literature, explained why the resulting program remains convex and well-posed, and expanded the discussion of the inverse–variance weighting rule and its Bayesian interpretation.\n3. **Strengthened empirical validation of uncertainty quality** : To validate uncertainty quality, we added a new uncertainty-diagnosis subsection in the main text and expanded Appendix C with extensive calibration analyses, including ECE for probabilistic embeddings and Var-ECE for similarity variance. Furthermore, we evaluated uncertainty robustness across multiple LA configurations—diagonal vs. KFAC covariance, deeper curvature modeling (1/2/4/6 layers), and extensive data sparsity settings—showing that uncertainty estimates remain stable and well-calibrated under all perturbations.\n4. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis** : We added $\\beta$ and temperature $T$ sensitivity studies across MIRACL and MMTEB (Appendix D), confirming that UEC is stable and the optimal ranges are consistent across datasets.\n5. **Expanded multilingual and OOD robustness experiments** : We added multilingual evaluations (Appendix B.5) and conducted OOD tests, validating robustness when LA is fitted on MS MARCO and evaluated on MMTEB tasks.\n6. **Analysis of independence and diagonal assumptions**: We clarified how cross-covariances would affect the optimal coefficients and added comparisons with KFAC-based covariance structures, noting that while KFAC slightly improves calibration, diagonal LA remains far more efficient.\n\nWe hope these revisions have clarified our contributions and addressed the reviewers’ questions. The full responses to each comment are provided individually and all revised portions of manuscript are highlighted in magenta for clarity.\n\nOnce again, we thank the reviewers for their valuable feedback, which has been instrumental in improving the quality and clarity of our work."}}, "id": "7o0tZ4l7VL", "forum": "7fdcVi2fTJ", "replyto": "7fdcVi2fTJ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2291/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2291/Authors"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2291/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763714861802, "cdate": 1763714861802, "tmdate": 1763716376326, "mdate": 1763716376326, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes **Uncertainty-Driven Embedding Convolution (UEC)**, a post-hoc probabilistic ensemble method for text embedding models.
