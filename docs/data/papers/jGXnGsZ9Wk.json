In the context of cellular biology, prevailing approaches reduce 3D shape collections to static reconstructions or hand-crafted descriptors, which fail to capture smooth, multidimensional transitions. We present MorphCurveVAE, a two-stage pipeline for constructing continuous morphological trajectories from sets of static, segmented 3D cell images. Stage 1 learns a smooth, compact latent manifold of volumetric morphologies using a multi-branch convolutional variational auto-encoder (VAE) that can encode multiple correlated substructures into disentangled subspaces. Stage 2 extracts a constrained, topologically-aware principal curve through the augmented latent space to produce directional and correlated trajectories of the structures' dynamics. To demonstrate our framework, we apply MorphCurveVAE to a large public dataset (Allen Institute WTC-11) of segmented volumetric cell and nucleus images throughout the mitosis cycle. Our results indicate high-quality reconstructions, low projection errors to the fitted principal curve, and biologically and visually plausible continuous animations. These results suggest MorphCurveVAE as a practical tool for downstream generative modelling of morphological trajectories, and a methodological contribution for learning robust, ordered trajectories directly from image-derived latent spaces.", "tldr": "MorphCurveVAE: a pipeline that learns smooth latent representations of 3D morphologies and extracts meaningful principal trajectories.", "keywords": ["morphology", "autoencoders", "trajectories", "latent space", "dynamics", "stochastic sampling", "curve fitting"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/480f34ff6f027e172d4c41523c9ce647d09bcc6f.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3f3c0aa154f346966cb06e50045fefcf1cf8d553.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a latent embedding of 3D voxelized cell masks and extracts a continuous temporal trajectory that mimics the cell's morphological evolution.

An implicit function concerns data representation and may take more time to extract the explicit shape, but does not necessarily require more data to train. And in my opinion, if designed cleverly, it can still replace the low-resolution voxel representation and provide a continuous, smooth volume model within the current framework. On the other hand, diffusion-based methods can process both explicit and implicit representations, and the model structure falls into a different category. It is true that it requires more data to train, but there are trade-offs as well. The arguments related to implicit or diffusion appear rather short-sighted, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the relevant fields.\n\n- Figure 1 is too small, and uses various jargons without much explanation. For example, a phase can mean different things and needs to be clearly defined before use. The figure is also misleading as it shows 2D masks, but they are actually 3D masks.\n\n- The scaling in the work does not look appropriate and needs to be further verified. I've never seen such a formulation— augmentation and re-scaling while using a separate portion of the latent vector. The entire process appears very unique.\n\n- The label refinement needs more explanation.\n\n- The biggest concern about the framework is that the VAE only enforces the reconstruction of input data and a uniform IID Gaussian in the latent space, and does not consider temporal smoothness within the latent space. However, the work assumes that a principal curve can correctly follow the temporal trajectory. While the results appear reasonable for the presented method, it would be more appropriate to enforce necessary prior conditions, such as Lipschitz constraints. The centorid constraint (Equation (4)) may serve as a heuristic to overcome the limitations of the current VAE, which is rather hard-coded and may conflict with the embedding space without proper regularization during latent embedding learning."}, "questions": {"value": "- Which cubic spline are you using?

In addition, although the paper mentions signed-distance and diffusion-based methods as related work, none of these existing methods are included for comparison.\n4.

While the idea of modelling continuous transitions is intuitively appealing, the paper does not convincingly argue why this temporal interpolation is biologically necessary or what specific insights it yields beyond static latent representations in 3D. The introduction would benefit from a clearer justification of the biological or analytical value of trajectory inference in this context.\n- The discussion of prior literature on morphological representation learning is limited. Several recent methods have explored voxel-, mesh-, and implicit-function-based learning of 3D cellular morphology, as well as diffusion and generative models that achieve higher geometric fidelity. These should be more comprehensively reviewed and contextualised to clarify how MorphCurveVAE advances the state of the art.\n- The description of the multi-branch VAE is too concise to fully understand the information flow between the nucleus and cell branches. It is unclear whether each biological compartment is reconstructed independently or if there is a mechanism for learning shared or correlated structure between them. The manuscript should clarify whether the reconstruction and regularisation losses are computed per branch or jointly across all channels.\n- The quantitative evaluation of reconstruction quality relies primarily on voxel accuracy and Dice score. While these metrics assess segmentation fidelity, they do not capture perceptual or distributional similarity between reconstructed and real shapes. Incorporating established 3D generative metrics such as Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) or Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) would provide a more robust and comparable assessment of generative performance.\n- Figure 3, which shows only central 2D slices of 3D reconstructions, does not effectively convey the volumetric fidelity of the model outputs. Including orthogonal or multi-view renderings would more holistically illustrate reconstruction quality. \n- Although the paper emphasises trajectory inference from static inputs as a central contribution, there is no actual direct quantitative or qualitative assessment of this capability. I could be misled by the results of Table 2, but it remains unclear how accurately the model can infer or reconstruct a continuous morphological trajectory from a single static input, or how robust such inferred trajectories are across samples."}, "questions": {"value": "- What is a ‘heavily imbalanced’ volume?
