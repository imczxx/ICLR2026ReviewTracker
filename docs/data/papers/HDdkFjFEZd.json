Wouldn't this avoid going through the intermediate grid representation?\n\nWhat is the complexity of the forward pass? For the second class of 'volumetric' prediction methods, I imagine the scalability to larger structures is quite poor. How much does use of these discrete methods improve on that?\n\nThe basis sets used are quite large, and if I remember correctly, QM9 uses HCONF elements. Do the authors expect that this could eventually scale well to heavy elements where the number of basis functions would become even larger?\n\nWhat are the green circles in Fig. 1c? I looked at this subfigure for a while, since it seemed to be the 'visual explanation' that I was looking for, but am still confused.\n\nHow sensitive is the model to radial cutoffs? From what I've seen, MLIPs typically use smaller cutoffs (4-6 A) and Hamiltonian prediction models tend to use larger ones. Since the electron density is a more 'fundamental' quantity directly computed from Hamiltonian and density matrices, I'm wondering if electron density prediction models similarly benefit from larger cutoffs.\n\nCan the authors discuss the error metric a bit more in detail? They use NMAE, which weights all grid points equally. How is the error usually distributed among grid points? Is it concentrated in areas where the electron density has a higher spatial variation? How does the distribution of the error vary between models?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "qEGNltVoBd", "forum": "HDdkFjFEZd", "replyto": "HDdkFjFEZd", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19051/Reviewer_1d9S"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19051/Reviewer_1d9S"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19051/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761919341114, "cdate": 1761919341114, "tmdate": 1762931085096, "mdate": 1762931085096, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces Basis Overlap Architecture, an equivariant GNN-based model to predict ground-state electron densities.
