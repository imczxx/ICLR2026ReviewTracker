Recent unified models (UMs) can even craft interleaved images and text.\nHowever, the capacity of such models to support more complex, production-level\napplications remains underexplored. Multimodal webpage generation stands out\nas a representative, high-value, yet challenging instance—it requires the genera-\ntion of consistent visual content and renderable HTML code. To this end, this pa-\nper introduces MMWebGen to systematically benchmark the multimodal webpage\ngeneration capacities of existing models. In particular, MMWebGen focuses on\nthe product showcase scenario, which imposes stringent demands on visual con-\ntent quality and webpage layout. MMWebGen includes 130 test queries across\n13 product categories; each query consists of a source image, a visual content in-\nstruction, and a webpage instruction. The task is to generate a product showcase\nwebpage including multiple consistent images in accordance with the source im-\nage and instructions. Given the mixed-modality input-output nature of the task, we\nconsider two workflows for evaluation—one uses large language models (LLMs)\nand image editing models to separately generate HTML code and images (editing-\nbased), while the other relies on UMs for co-generation (UM-based). Empirical\nresults show that editing-based approaches achieve leading results in webpage in-\nstruction following and content appeal, while UM-based ones may display more advantages in fulfilling visual content instructions. We also construct a super-\nvised finetuning (SFT) dataset, MMWebGen-1k, with 1,000 groups of real prod-\nuct images and LLM-generated HTML code. We verify its effectiveness on the\nopen-source UM BAGEL. The benchmark and dataset will be publicly available.", "tldr": "MMWebGen-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal webpage generation.

Fills the gap in multimodal webpage generation for product showcase scenarios. Unlike generic webpage generation benchmarks, MMWebGen specifically targets high-value product showcase scenarios with 130 curated test samples across 13 product categories, using a tailored multimodal input to address real-world user needs.\n\n2. Establishes a comprehensive multimodal alignment evaluation framework. It proposes five targeted metrics (WIF, WDQ, WCA, VCIF, IPQ) covering both webpage (instruction following, design, content) and image (consistency, quality) dimensions, and validates their alignment with human evaluations."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Contemporary webpage generation works like Web2Code (NeurIPS 2024) leverage real existing webpages as foundational data for code generation, enabling alignment with real-world webpage structures, styles, and logic. In contrast, MMWebGen’s test samples and training data only rely on a single source product image plus textual instructions. This oversimplified data source fails to capture the complexity of real webpages (e.g., nested layout hierarchies, linked CSS/JavaScript files, cross-page resource dependencies). As a result, the webpage generation scheme proposed in this manuscript lacks relevance to practical production scenarios—generated HTML may only \"superficially follow instructions\" but cannot match the structural and functional integrity of real e-commerce webpages, undermining its practical value.\n\n2. Web2Code’s benchmark (e.g., WCGB) evaluates generated webpages by comparing them with real webpages (e.g., measuring structural similarity, style consistency, and functional equivalence to real-world counterparts). However, MMWebGen’s evaluation solely relies on comparing generated webpages against textual instructions and the source image—it lacks a \"real webpage baseline\" for reference. This evaluation design cannot verify whether generated webpages meet the standards of practical web development (e.g., whether the layout is consistent with common e-commerce webpage conventions, or whether CSS styles are compatible with mainstream browsers).\n\n3. The HTML code in MMWebGen-1k is generated via a \"GPT-4o draft → Gemini-2.5-Flash refinement\" pipeline, which fails to resolve inherent issues with synthetic data. Such as using GPT-4o as part of the LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. This creates a potential conflict of interest—GPT-4o may implicitly favor HTML structures similar to those it generated, introducing subjective bias into the evaluation results and reducing the credibility of performance claims for the fine-tuned model."}, "questions": {"value": "1. While the paper claims that \"the benchmark and dataset will be publicly available\", as of the review, no access links or release timelines are provided. Additionally, the code for model fine-tuning (e.g., BAGEL’s training configuration) and evaluation (e.g., LLM-as-a-judge implementation) is not disclosed. This lack of transparency makes it impossible for reviewers or other researchers to replicate the experiments, severely compromising the work’s scientific rigor.\n\n2. The manuscript evaluates generated HTML code solely by checking \"compliance with instructions\" via LLMs, without any ground-truth HTML for comparison. This approach has two critical issues: (1) LLMs may have inherent biases (e.g., favoring certain layout styles or wording), leading to inconsistent ratings. (2) \"Instruction compliance\" does not equate to \"practical usability\"—generated HTML may follow instructions but still be non-renderable."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "hKXDiotUys", "forum": "EkqlXe2Sut", "replyto": "EkqlXe2Sut", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10437/Reviewer_78iK"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10437/Reviewer_78iK"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10437/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761827367915, "cdate": 1761827367915, "tmdate": 1762921741650, "mdate": 1762921741650, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}, "comment": {"value": "Thank you very much for the time and effort the reviewers and area chair devoted to evaluating our submission.
