First, outcome reward suffers from the $\\textit{credit assignment problem}$, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.\nSecond, conventional discriminative process supervision is $\\textit{myopic}$, failing to evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. \nTo this end, we introduce $\\textbf{\\texttt{StepORLM}}$, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process supervision. \nAt its core, $\\texttt{StepORLM}$ features a co-evolutionary loop where a policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve on each other. \nThis loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive, outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic process evaluation from the GenPRM. \nThe combined signal is used to align the policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously refine the GenPRM. \nOur resulting 8B-parameter $\\texttt{StepORLM}$ establishes a new state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. \nMoreover, the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of both our own model and other existing LLMs. \nWe release our models and code to facilitate future research (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/StepORLM-BEA9/).", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Operations Research", "Self-Evolving Framework", "Generative Process Supervision"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a1c9363f9fef4268222e25e2fa1c0cd04b355c78.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes StepORLM, a self-evolving framework for modeling OR.

Table 3 shows that freezing GenPRM reduces performance by 3.7% on average, validating the co-evolution mechanism.\n\n**Strong Empirical Results: ** The framework's quality is supported by SOTA performance across six benchmarks. The 8B-parameter StepORLM is shown to outperform vastly larger generalist models and other specialized baselines."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Unclear Attribution Due to Ambiguities in the Data Pipeline:** The paper's SOTA claims are complicated by ambiguities in its data strategy. The 50K-sample SFT dataset is significantly larger than baselines like ORLM (30K) , and Figure 4 shows this SFT-only model is already exceptionally strong . This makes it difficult to attribute the final SOTA performance to the co-evolutionary method (Stage 2) rather than just the high-quality initial data (Stage 1). This ambiguity extends to the DPO phase. Section 3.3.1 is unclear whether the DPO phase re-uses these static 50K instances or regenerates new ones , hindering reproducibility.\n\n\n **Omission of Relevant Concurrent Work:** The literature review overlooks highly relevant concurrent work that addresses the same problem of intermediate-step validation. Specifically, Step-Opt[1] is directly relevant as it proposes a \"Stepwise Validation Mechanism\" with explicit checkers for variables, constraints, and programs . This structured, explicit validation is a conceptually similar (though different in approach) solution to the same problem that StepORLM's learned GenPRM aims to solve. Additionally, Lima et al.[2] on verifiable synthetic data is also relevant and should be discussed .\n\n**Backbone Choice Obscures Method Effects:** The paper's SOTA claims are ambiguous. StepORLM is built exclusively on Qwen3-8B , while principal baselines (like the 8B ORLM) rely on different 8B architectures (LLaMA-3-8B). Without cross-backbone controls (e.g., training StepORLM on the baseline's backbone), the comparison fails to isolate the method’s contribution from the backbone’s.\n\n[1] Wu Y, Zhang Y, Wu Y, et al.

While the credit assignment problem is intuitive and makes sense, the myopia PRM problem appears weak to me since many existing PRMs generate process-level supervision signals based on the holistic model output. The authors need to provide stronger evidence or clearer citations to support their claim and better differentiate their work from existing PRMs. \n\n2. There is an apparent disconnect between the paper's claim of using \"generative process supervision\" and the described implementation. Specifically, according to Algorithm 1 and Equation (1), the detailed, step-by-step process-level correctness scores are seemingly collapsed into a single, global weight $w_{\\tau_{w},\\tau_{l}}$ for the weighted DPO. This suggests that the fine-grained, process-level feedback is lost and not directly utilized to supervise the model's optimization, which contradicts the paper's central claims.\n\n3. Lack of Clarity on GenPRM Refinement: The methodology for refining the GenPRM is not described in sufficient detail. Key information about the training process is missing, particularly the exact format of the training data.\n\n4. The experimental comparisons in Table 1 are incomplete, making it difficult to fully assess the performance of StepORLM. The missing models include the base model Qwen3-8B, SOTA commercial reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o-series, Gemini 2.5) and SOTA open-source reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K2).\n\n5.
