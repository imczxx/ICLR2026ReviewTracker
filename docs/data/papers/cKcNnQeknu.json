However, existing deep learning methods still have key limitations: they can only process a single type of sequential trajectory data or homogeneous meteorological variables, and fail to achieve accurate forecasting of abnormal deflected TCs. To address these challenges, we present two groundbreaking contributions. First, we have constructed a multimodal and multi-source dataset named AOT-TCs for tropical cyclone forecasting in the Northwest Pacific basin. As the first dataset of its kind, it innovatively integrates heterogeneous variables from the atmosphere, ocean, and land, thus obtaining a comprehensive and information-rich meteorological dataset. Second, based on the AOT-TCs dataset, we propose a forecasting model that can handle both normal and abnormally deflected TCs. This is the first TC forecasting model to adopt an explicit atmosphere-ocean-terrain coupling architecture, enabling it to effectively capture complex interactions across physical domains. Extensive experiments on all TC cases in the Northwest Pacific from 2017 to 2024 show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in TC forecasting: it not only significantly improves the forecasting accuracy of normal TCs but also breaks through the technical bottleneck in forecasting abnormally deflected TCs.

The authors state that “MoE systems and reinforcement learning have been proven effective in enhancing reasoning capabilities”, but provide no examples from the literature. Since the proposed model integrates an MoE based architecture with RLHF, this topic deserves a more extensive review.\n- In Figure 2, the architecture of AOT-TCNet (particularly the green section) is difficult to interpret. According to the Appendix, the TC-Encoder uses LSTMs, while the AOT-Encoder uses 3D-UNets. It is unclear how the Feature Extractor is related to the 3D-UNet and how DATA is connected to the LSTM in the figure, as their placement below those components suggests some relation. Additionally, the figure seems to indicate that the LSTM output is fed into the 3D-UNet, an MLP, and another MLP, which adds to the confusion. The figure should be clarified to better illustrate these relationships.\n- The authors state that “the model samples or selects a expert from $\\pi$ and predicts a trajectory…”. which seems confusing. From the rest of the paper, I understand that the gating network learns to select the expert that generates the trajectory pattern most consistent with the current TC path, but the selection process is unclear. Does the gating network “sample” expert $E_i$ with probability $\\pi_i$ or does it select the expert with the highest probability? From Figure 2 (red box), it can be understood as for some cases the expert with the highest probability is chosen and multiple experts can contribute for other cases. Is that what should be understood?\n- Section 3.3 describes the RLHF system implemented on top of the MoE architecture, but this part is somewhat difficult to follow. In Equation 8, shouldn’t $r_{phy,i}$ be independent of $i$ based on the provided formulation? Also, the term $Y^{atm}$ is not clearly defined. In Equation 9, it seems the correct notation should be $r_{mode,i}$ instead of $r_{mode}$. Overall, this subsection would benefit from a clearer and more precise explanation."}, "questions": {"value": "- Please see the weaknesses section. Overall, the proposed architecture and dataset are interesting, but the manuscript is difficult to follow and lacks clarity.
