In this paper, we aim to disentangle the \"QiGan\" encoded by the AI model for Go, which has beaten top human players. Specifically, we disentangle primitive shape patterns of stones memorized by the value network, and these shape patterns represent the \"QiGan\" used to conduct a fast situation assessment of the current board state. To this end, we propose to use both AND interactions and OR interactions to obtain a more concise explanation of shape patterns. We further prove the universal matching property of AND-OR interactions to ensure the faithfulness and verifiability of the explained shape patterns.

This should be re-written from a more general introduction, down to the “case study” of the paper over the Go Game. \n\nSomething in lines of: 1. AI models have shown to out-perform human experts, yet understanding their inner workings is not clear. (followed by examples in protein folding, games, etc.) 2. In this paper we run a case study on the Challenging Go game, as one of the complex examples that the current models outperform humans.\n\nIt should motivate why we are looking at the Go Game and how complex it is, and why the case study is a good proxy for other tasks such as drug discovery etc. Without this, if the reader is not interested in the Go Game itself, they might skip the paper. This information is there, already in the introduction, but it keeps getting too detailed. For example, the footnote on AlphaGo not being accessible etc. absolutely does not belong to the first page! Similarly, the second paragraph which discusses the “value network”, “policy network”, or the Tree Search are all again too detailed for a non-RL-expert reader and belong to the Method/RelatedWork section.\n\nEven as someone who is familiar with the game of Go, Alpha Go, and general RL concepts, I was lost reading the second page of the introduction. \n\n\n\n**(B) Method Notation**\nI was able to follow most of the notations, although I think it can be made much shorter and less verbose. In a nutshell, the method section describes the principles of sparsity in terms of number of interactions, faithfulness in terms of interactions being able to mimic the value networks over different inputs (a distillation in a sense), and the two types of AND (prior work) and OR interactions (this work) between individual pieces. \n\nThis however should be communicated more efficiently. For example, see Eq. 6. Basically all of this notation wants to say that an OR operation over M boolean variables, can be explained as a $2^m$ AND operation, covering all possible states. This is something that can be communicated simply in words, and 90% of the readers would agree, and others can be referred to the Appendix for a detailed proof (also a simple visualization with three variables would suffice). But instead there is the extremely detailed math notation (Eq 6) which may throw off the readers.\n\nSimilarly, for example in Eq 7, every time the set $S$ is mentioned, it is followed by $\\neq \\emptyset$. This should at most be mentioned once at the beginning of the method section, and not be repeated in every equation.\n\n**(C) Method Implementation and Setup**\nThe method section goes in great detail over the defined interactions and its theorems. However, many key questions are not answered. \n\n- How are the interactions (and their $I$ values) trained? Do we have a multi-layer logic network? I.e interactions defined over the results of previous interactions?\n\n\n- Do we train our interaction scores $I$ per-game or do we have a collection of games and a dataset? i.e do we have different score values for the same interactions across games?\nIf we are learning the values of interactions **per-board**, I have a hard-time justifying the learned values would be any meaningful. Essentially we would be overfitting to a certain arrangement of 10 individual stones (line 307). This, as far as I understand, would not yield a general rulebook of patterns that the network uses.\n\n- How complex is the case-study model (i.e. KataGo’s value network)? How good are the extracted logic interactions in approximating it? Essentially, what is the final performance on Eq. 8 (as it’s a learning process)?\n\n- What are existing baselines? There is a ton of literature on pattern-mining, concept, and circuit discovery. Could the authors elaborate on why these do not apply here? Besides the AND-only prior work that this work builds on, what are other works trying to explain KataGo's knoweledge?\n\n\n**(D) Method Motivation**\n\nThe main contribution of the paper is centered around having OR interaction, e.g. assigning a score if (Stone A OR Stone B OR Stone C) is present. I really don’t understand how this would be a useful interaction to find. It is shown in Fig 2, that the introduction of OR interaction limits the total number of interactions needed, which I get why is desirable. However, does this encode useful information? Essentially this assigns importance values to individual stones and is not really a “pattern”. What would make sense to me is having OR interaction over patterns rather than stones (i.e if AND_interaction_A is present OR AND_interaction_B is present). Could the authors further clarify this?\n\nI tried looking for an example figure showing an interesting OR interaction in the paper, but couldn’t find any. The closest I got was Fig. 6, where the importance of different patterns are reported and compared, yet these are again all AND interactions as far as I understood.\nI also looked at the video supplement, but the video had examples that were not Go-related, and explained the concepts in terms of LLMs and vision models."}, "questions": {"value": "See concerns (C) and (D)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "OuwZXxmC9i", "forum": "yfhP1GZINZ", "replyto": "yfhP1GZINZ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22777/Reviewer_SPst"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22777/Reviewer_SPst"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22777/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762103839352, "cdate": 1762103839352, "tmdate": 1762942381629, "mdate": 1762942381629, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
