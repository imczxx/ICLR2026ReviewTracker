While recent localization-based methods demonstrate promise in identifying important nodes (neurons) to be unlearned, they fail to disentangle nodes responsible for forgetting undesirable knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions, risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic interpretability technique, and propose the **C**onflict-guided **L**ocalization for LLM **U**nlearning fram**E**work (**CLUE**). This framework identifies the forget and retain circuit composed of important nodes, and then the circuits are transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF).

The authors note that existing localization based methods, such as WAGLE and MEMIT, struggle to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting from those involved in retaining information. To overcome this limitation, they propose CLUE (Conflict-Guided Localization for LLM Unlearning), a framework that integrates circuit discovery and logical reasoning. Specifically, CLUE first uses circuit discovery to extract distinct “forget” and “retain” subcircuits, then transforms these circuits into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) using the Tseitin transformation. The CNF satisfiability problem is subsequently solved to classify neurons into three categories: forget, retain, and conflict. Finally, the framework applies a two-stage fine tuning strategy first fine-tuning the forget neurons using a forget loss, followed by fine-tuning the conflict neurons with both forget and retain losses. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as WMDP-Cyber, WMDP-Bio, and PKU-SafeRLHF, using Zephyr-7B and LLaMA2-7B models, demonstrate that CLUE achieves superior forgetting efficacy and retain utility while modifying significantly fewer parameters than previous methods like GA, NPO, PO, MEMIT, DEPN, and WAGLE."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "Clear theoretical grounding and stepwise formulation (Eq. 1–6).\nComprehensive experiments across tasks and metrics (1-Acc, MIA, ROUGE-L).\nDetailed ablations isolating the effect of forget/conflict masks and finetuning strategies.\nInsightful analysis of sparsity vs. faithfulness (Fig. 4) and neuron-type shifts post unlearning (Table 3).\nPublic anonymized code and strong reproducibility statement."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Circuits are treated statically; dynamic updates during finetuning could better reflect neuron shifts.\nComputational overhead of SAT solving and circuit extraction is not benchmarked.\nLimited discussion on scaling to models > 7 B parameters.\nRetain set selection sensitivity deserves deeper analysis (beyond Figure 3 trends).\nLanguage polishing could improve readability."}, "questions": {"value": "For multiple retain sets, could a multi-objective SAT formulation handle overlapping conflicts more gracefully?\nIs there a failure case where CNF becomes unsatisfiable for large overlapping circuits, and how is it handled?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Hsb9eoyytX", "forum": "jtRYvazBWv", "replyto": "jtRYvazBWv", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission188/Reviewer_tdd5"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission188/Reviewer_tdd5"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission188/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761470112923, "cdate": 1761470112923, "tmdate": 1762915465601, "mdate": 1762915465601, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the limitation of localization-based methods for LLM unlearning, and proposes a new method called CLUE.
