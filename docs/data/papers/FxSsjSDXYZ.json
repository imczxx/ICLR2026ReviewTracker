This inappropriate modeling approach prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a significant degradation in detection performance after *state variables* are integrated.\n\nTo address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel **ST**ate-aware **A**dapte**R** (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging *state variables* during the fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprises three core components: (1) We design an *Identity-guided State Encoder*, which effectively captures the complex categorical semantics of *state variables* through a learnable *State Memory*. (2) We propose a *Conditional Bottleneck Adapter*, which dynamically generates low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby flexibly injecting the influence of *state variables* into the backbone model. (3) We also introduce a *Numeral-State Matching* module to more effectively detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves.

The model complexity deserves further discussion. Compared with lightweight adaptation methods such as LoRA, the proposed STAR introduces additional components (state encoder, conditional adapter, and matching module), which may increase the computational cost and implementation complexity.\n2. The issue of handling numerical versus discrete state variables, while valid, might represent a relatively minor challenge within TSFM-based anomaly detection. Theoretically, a sufficiently generalizable TSFM could already accommodate such heterogeneity without explicit modeling. From the experimental results, the performance gains are not always substantial, particularly for combinations such as Moment + SMAP and Timer + SMAP. Therefore, whether such a design trade-off is justified in real-world deployment scenarios warrants further consideration.\n3. The experimental implementation details are somewhat incomplete.
