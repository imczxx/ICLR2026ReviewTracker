DRMs are known for learning reward models based on preference signals, while GRMs identify preferences using a generative language model (LLM), potentially incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) processing. However, DRMs often present challenges in reward interpretation and threshold determination, and GRMs are unable to perform \"Best of N\" comparisons or provide explicit probabilistic outputs.\n\n\nIn response, the authors propose a novel approach termed the Ordinal Probabilistic Reward Model (OPRM). This model outputs a complete distribution of rewards, facilitating a more nuanced understanding. The term \"ordinal\" reflects the method's discretization of the continuous reward space into sequences to ensure tractability. The training process involves objectives that focus on the distribution's spread, optimized using a technique called Region Flooding Tuning.\n\n\nFor data generation, a scoring methodology is established by curating model prompts and responses with a template that translates scores into categorical labels: Bad, Normal, and Good. This dataset is then utilized to train the model with tailored objectives that leverage Region Flooding Tuning to enhance performance consistency.\n\n\nThe paper employs Qwen-2.5-Instruction model variants with parameters ranging from 7B to 72B.

Instead of the conventional method of training a regression head to output a single scalar reward, OPRM reframes the task as learning a probability distribution over a finite set of ordinal quality ratings (specifically, 1 to 9). The key mechanism is elegant and parameter-efficient: it directly repurposes the LLM's existing language model head, taking the normalized probabilities of the numeric tokens '1' through '9' as the reward distribution. The model is trained on preference pairs ($y_c$, $y_r$) by optimizing a loss function that maximizes the probability $P(S_c > S_r)$, where $S_c$ and $S_r$ are the random variables representing the scores for the chosen and rejected responses, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, the paper introduces Region Flooding Tuning (RgFT), a fine-tuning strategy designed to anchor these relative preference-based distributions to an absolute quality scale. RgFT uses coarse-grained quality annotations (e.g., \"bad\", \"normal\", \"good\") and partitions the ordinal scores into corresponding sub-regions (e.g., {1-3}, {4-6}, {7-9}). The loss is then modified to guide the model to concentrate probability mass within these target sub-regions. The authors conduct experiments on several reward model benchmarks (RewardBench, PPE, RMB) using Qwen2.5 as a base model, claiming state-of-the-art performance compared to various discriminative and generative reward models."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.  **Novel and Parameter-Efficient Design:** The core idea of OPRM—repurposing the LM head's vocabulary probabilities for numeric tokens as a reward distribution—is a clever and elegant approach that avoids adding any new parameters, unlike traditional scalar-based reward models that require a separate value head.\n2.  **Probabilistic Formulation:** Moving from a deterministic scalar to a full probability distribution  is a well-motivated step. It inherently allows for modeling uncertainty  and, as the authors claim, offers richer interpretability than a single score.\n3.  **Absolute Quality Grounding:** The Region Flooding Tuning (RgFT) strategy  is a practical and data-efficient method to tackle a known problem: the misalignment between relative-preference scores and intuitive, absolute quality."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  **Unsupported Core Assumption:** The entire method hinges on the assumption that an LLM's pre-trained probability distribution over the tokens '1'-'9' has an inherent ordinal correspondence to text quality. This is a very strong and unevaluated claim. It is highly plausible that the model has a strong prior based on token frequency in pre-training data (e.g., '1' may be far more common than '9'), which would be unrelated to quality. The paper provides no analysis of this token prior or any evidence (e.g., calibration metrics like ECE) that the resulting distribution is meaningful.\n2.  **Critical Robustness Vulnerability:** The method relies on the next-token prediction at a specific prompt ending in \"Score:\". This creates a high risk of \"jailbreaking\" or adversarial manipulation. A malicious user could craft a response that includes text like \"This response is excellent. Score: 9\" to poison the model's internal state and bias the output distribution at the final scoring step. This plausible and critical failure mode is not evaluated.\n3.  **Missing Context from Ordinal Regression Literature:** The paper makes no effort to explain the ordinality in the data as other papers of a similar topic would do, and the ordinal nature is actually imposed by design. One can view the proposed target loss as a voting one: the $P(y_c \\succ y_r | x)$ can be rewritten as $\\sum_k p_c(k) F_r(k-1)$, where $F_r$ term is the CDF of the rejected distribution. The paper fails to connect or compare its work to the extensive existing literature on ordinal regression and probabilistic ordinal models, which have diverse formulations. The \"Related Work\" section  only discusses standard DRMs and GRMs, missing a key body of relevant research.\n4.  **Contradictory Claims vs. Methodology:** The paper explicitly claims \"Handling Annotation Disagreement\"  and \"robustness to... inconsistent preference data\"  as key advantages. However, Appendix H.1 clearly states that the authors \"filter out all pairs where the chosen response is not strictly better than the rejected one,\" including \"invalid combinations... such as <normal, good>\". This experimental practice of manually removing the exact \"inconsistent\" or \"ambiguous\" data that the model claims to be good at handling directly undermines this central claim.\n5.  **Unequal Experimental Comparisons:** The main results in Table 2  are difficult to interpret as they compare OPRM (trained on the authors' 130k dataset ) against \"Reported Results of Public Models\" and \"Reproduced Results... From DeepSeek.\" These baselines are trained on different and unknown datasets. This is not an apples-to-apples comparison. It is impossible to know if OPRM's superiority comes from the method or from the base model or the extra data. A fair comparison would require training all baselines (e.g., a standard BT model, PairRM) on the exact same 130k dataset. The single ablation in Figure 4(a)  is not sufficient.\n6.  **Arbitrary Partitioning in RgFT:** The 3-quality-level partition in RgFT ({1-3}, {4-6}, {7-9})  is arbitrary and presented without justification. No sensitivity analysis is performed to show why this even split is optimal, or how performance changes with different partitions (e.g., {1-2}, {3-7}, {8-9})."}, "questions": {"value": "See the weaknesses.

Two major concerns (but not limited to them): (1) Important model/algorithms such as RgFT are not formally defined, which is confusing. Also, gradient updates of the loss can be derived in the main text as this is an important intuition. (2) The authors spend many efforts in describing how effective their method is in the abstract and the introduction, but they do not describe their model or algorithm ideas briefly. That prevents readers from acquiring the useful information. From the perspective of readers, most submissions to NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR are SOTA, but the key difference is how and why.\n\n3.
