While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-term atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code can be found in the supplemental materials.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Crystal representation", "Invariance", "Pseudo-Particle", "Diffraction", "Reciprocal space", "Long-term interaction"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5a312f964923ab722f72357f11ff59a221ed7f04.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/46084a03148f2d46190d939dad70f2b367b1c129.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a new architecture for processing crystalline graphs.

I'm interested to see if incorporating this information to the GNNs would improve performance. As a baseline, you could just add some more generic parameters (e.g., equivariant layers) to the GNNs and compare to that.\n- Can you match the number of parameters in evaluations? Basically, if you can show that for a given number of parameters, it is better to use diffraction modules (or some mix of diffraction modules and attention layers), the results would be convincing.\n- How is the diffraction module different from the Fourier transform employed in [1]? I think yours is probably more elaborate, but you should take some paragraphs to explain this, since Fourier features have been used for a while now.\n- You could consider generative tasks, although this could be tight given the rebuttal timeline.
