Fortunately, auxiliary modalities can unveil these drivers, \\textit{e.g.}, sky images capture the illumination conditions that govern solar power generation. However, the most informative \\emph{future} auxiliary signals directly tied to the target time series are unavailable at inference, while integrating such data is further hindered by cross-modal heterogeneity and structural mismatch. To address these challenges, we propose FACTS, a Future-Aided Causal Teacher-Student framework for \\emph{multimodal} time series forecasting. The teacher network, used only during training, leverages future auxiliary data to disentangle the causal responses underlying temporal dynamics, while the student network, trained solely on historical data, learns such causal knowledge via our proposed causal-perturbation contrastive distillation. To accommodate heterogeneous inputs, we design a bilinear orthogonal projector that efficiently converts high-dimensional auxiliary data into a compact series over time, allowing us to model both auxiliary data and time series via a unified bidirectional attention backbone. Furthermore, we devise a lag-aware fusion to align cross-modal signals within a tolerance window and apply random modality dropout to enhance student's robustness to modality missingness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FACTS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 32.98\\% in MSE and 22.25\\% in MAE.

The key idea is to leverage future auxiliary modalities (such as images and weather data) during training to uncover causal factors that drive temporal dynamics, and distill this knowledge into a student network that uses only historical data at inference.\n\nThe method introduces three main components: (1) a Bilinear Orthogonal Projector (BOP) that converts high-dimensional auxiliary data into compact serialized time series; (2) a lag-aware multimodal fusion mechanism with random modality dropout to handle temporal misalignment and missing modalities; and (3) a Causal-Perturbation Contrastive Distillation (CPCD) objective that transfers causal knowledge from the teacher to the student.

The proposed teacher-student design, which leverages future multimodal signals to facilitate causal representation learning while maintaining a purely historical input during inference, is both conceptually elegant and practically impactful.

The model is comprehensively evaluated on several diverse and representative datasets, demonstrating the framework’s robustness and adaptability across various multimodal forecasting scenarios.\n\n3. The experiments include thorough comparisons against a wide range of baselines, covering both unimodal and multimodal forecasting methods, thereby providing convincing evidence of the model’s superior performance and general applicability.\n\n4.

The paper does not clearly specify the training schedule of the teacher–student framework. Is the teacher network fully trained to convergence before the student distillation begins, or are the two networks optimized jointly in an alternating or end-to-end manner?\n\n2. The Bilinear Orthogonal Projector (BOP) is primarily demonstrated on image data. Could the authors elaborate on its generality—specifically, whether BOP can be effectively adapted to other high-dimensional modalities such as text embeddings, audio spectrograms, or video streams? If not, what limitations might arise when extending it beyond visual inputs?\n\n3. How significant is the computational overhead incurred by using both teacher and student networks, especially when compared to alternative approaches? Could the authors provide quantitative estimates or benchmarks to clarify this aspect?\n\n4. The paper claims that random modality dropout enhances robustness when certain modalities are missing at inference time. Have the authors conducted experiments under more extreme or persistent missing-modality scenarios (e.g., complete loss of image data throughout inference)? Such evaluation would provide stronger evidence for the model’s robustness and practical deployability in real-world settings with unreliable sensors.\n\n5.
