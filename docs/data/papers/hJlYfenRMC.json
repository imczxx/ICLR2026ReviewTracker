MaMe works by dividing tokens into two sets A and B, calculating the cosine similarity with all tokens in set B for each token in set A, and merging tokens from set B using a weighted average if their cosine similarity is above a certain threshold. With experiments on image classification, applying MaMe directly to pre-trained ViTs, MaMe is shown to achieve a better speed-accuracy balance than existing token reduction approaches. When training a ViT with MaMe from scratch, the model performs worse than when applying MaMe to pretrained models. MaMe achieves mixed results on other tasks.

By focusing on token reduction in ViTs, the paper tackles a relevant problem. If an effective strategy is found to reduce the number of tokens processed by a ViT without causing a drop in accuracy, then the efficiency of the ViT would improve without compromising task performance. This could make the ViT model more suitable for various applications.\n\n2. The proposed method, MaMe, obtains a better speed-accuracy balance than existing token merging approaches in several settings. As shown in Tab. 1, MaMe obtains a higher accuracy and throughput than existing approaches EViT, ToMe and DiffRate across various model sizes and training strategies (DeiT & MAE). Similar improvements are obtained for zero-shot image classification in Tab. 2.\n\n3. The visualization of the progression of token reduction in Fig. 2 provides interesting insights in the effect of the token merging operations across different ViT layers. The visualization shows that MaMe is effective in merging tokens that belong to similar semantic categories, which is the intended behavior."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. There is no text in Sec. 4.5 (titled Ablation Study). There are several figures and tables with additional results (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Tab. 7), but these are not referred to in the paper. As a result, it is not clear what can be seen in these figures and tables, what the significance is of these results, and what conclusions can be drawn from them. Overall, the 'empty' subsection harms the presentation and readability of the paper.\n\n2. The technical innovation of the proposed MaMe method is limited. In its core, MaMe is a slightly more elegant, matrix-based implementation of methods that merge tokens when the cosine similarity of token embeddings is above a certain threshold, such as ALGM [a] for semantic segmentation. Like MaMe, the global merging module of ALGM also splits up tokens into two sets (like ToMe [b]), then compares each token in set A with each token in set B, and merges tokens if their cosine similarity is above a certain threshold. Like MaMe, ALGM and ToMe are also parameter-free and 'plug-and-play', so these claimed key innovations (L055-L069) are not unique. Comparing ALGM and MaMe, the only key operational difference is in the way the merged token embeddings are obtained, taking a simple average in ALGM and using a weighted average and summing with 'destination tokens' in MaMe. To properly demonstrate the value of MaMe, and show that the small nuanced differences between MaMe and existing methods constitute meaningful and effective innovations, the paper could (a) explain in text how MaMe differs conceptually from existing methods like ALGM and ToMe, and (b) compare quantitatively to existing threshold-based merging methods like ALGM. \n\n3. The paper does not demonstrate the positive impact of the fact that MaMe is fully differentiable, while this is a key contribution/innovation of the paper. The claim (L057-L060) is that MaMe being fully differentiable makes training from scratch more optimal. However, comparing Tab. 3 to Tab. 1, when training a ViT from scratch with MaMe, the accuracy drop from the baseline is significantly larger than when applying MaMe directly to a pre-trained ViT. In contrast, 'non-differentiable' method ToMe [b] *performs better* when trained from scratch, as shown in their original paper. These findings all contradict the claim/hypothesis that MaMe being fully differentiable is beneficial for training from scratch. Since this is one of the key contributions of the paper, this is a considerable weakness. To improve this, the claim should either be amended or supported with other experimental results.\n\n4. The abstract (L015) claims that Swin-S with MaMe obtains 47.0 mIoU on ADE20K, but this number does not correspond with the results from Tab. 4 (35.8 mIoU and 47.0 mAcc). Thus, this claim is unjustified and should be amended.\n\n5. Applying MaMe to Swin or Iwin leads to very large drops in accuracy. This is the case for both image classification (Tab. 3) and semantic segmentation (Tab. 4). These large accuracy drops make that MaMe will not be useful in those settings, in practice. These results show that the presented approach is not generally applicable to various Transformer-based backbones, which reduces the value of the work.\n\n6. The paper does not explain why the number of parameters decreases when applying MaMe to Swin and Iwin, in Tab. 3 and Tab. 4. If I understand the paper correctly, MaMe only reduces the number of tokens that are processed by the model. How is it possible that the number of model parameters also decreases as a result? This should be explained.\n\n7. The paper does not describe how it handles batching, in case different numbers of tokens are merged for different images in a batch. For instance, in Tab. 1, MaMe uses a threshold of 0.8 (L244), which can result in a different number of tokens being merged for each image, and the experiment uses a batch size of 1024 (L350). How are images batched in case the resulting number of tokens per image is different, due to threshold-based merging? Is any padding being used, which would negate some of the effect of token reduction? This should be explained.\n\n8. Several implementation details are not provided, which harms reproducibility. For instance, the paper does not mention (a) how the *source* and *destination* token sets are obtained (L148 only mentions that the strategy can very), and (b) what the hyperparameters are (learning rate, batch size, optimizer, etc.) for training the models in Tab. 3 and Tab. 4 from scratch. It would help if the paper had a separate subsection/paragraph in which these implementation details are specified.\n\n9. Tab. 1 does not provide the FLOPs results for the proposed MaMe method, while it does provide these results for the baseline and other token reduction methods. This means that there is not a full picture of the efficiency of MaMe compared to existing work, making it difficult to fully judge its performance.\n\n[a] Norouzi et al., ALGM: Adaptive Local-then-Global Token Merging for Efficient Semantic Segmentation with Plain Vision Transformers, CVPR 2024.\n[b] Bolya et al., Token Merging: Your ViT But Faster, CVPR 2023."}, "questions": {"value": "As the paper has a considerable number of weaknesses (see above) and relatively minor strengths, I give a *reject* rating.
