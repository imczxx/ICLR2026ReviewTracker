Wind speed forecasting, particularly at wind farm sites, is crucial for balancing power generation and scheduling backup energy sources. Most existing studies rely solely on time-series forecasting methods, while ignoring the physical nature of wind as a spatiotemporal phenomenon primarily driven by atmospheric momentum advection. In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages the surrounding wind field as context to capture the wind dynamics. By explicitly modeling wind advection, our method traces atmospheric momentum transport, enabling the forecast of future trends. We further introduce a multi-modal dataset consisting of wind speed observations from multiple geographically distributed sites and their associated background wind field data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over traditional time-series forecasting models and state-of-the-art methods that leverage wind field information.", "tldr": "We propose a novel physics-guided architecture that traces upstream advection in background wind fields to enhance local wind speed forecasting at meteorological stations.", "keywords": ["Time series forecasting", "wind speed forecasting", "physics-guided machine learning", "multi-modal learning", "context-enriched learning"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/599b9f556f61eedf99ccef3261ac1058e364c38b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes MoP, a forecasting framework that models wind speed by retrieving upstream background field patches and refining them via residual correction.

In terms of methodology, the model first constructs a cross-attention retrieval mechanism on spatiotemporal patches of the background field to identify upstream regions that exhibit time-delayed relationships with the target site, thereby achieving Advection Backtracking.

However, for the temporal channel, MoP adopts a concatenation and MLP approach, which is not equivalent to the previous Cross-Attention-based modal fusion mechanism and the Transformer method for time series. Given that the temporal patterns depicted in Figure2 are relatively simple, and considering that single-modal MLP and Mixer-based prediction methods in the Baseline section even outperform multimodal approaches in short-term predictions, we suspect that part of MoP's performance gain stems from its simple temporal feature extraction and cross-modal fusion approach. The authors should conduct additional supplementary experiments to rule out this possibility.\n\n3) The authors should provide results of simple baseline methods such as Persistence, Mean, and Clear Sky, similar to those used in FusionSF, since these baselines demonstrate whether the prediction task of Solar Power or Wind Speed is inherently challenging.
