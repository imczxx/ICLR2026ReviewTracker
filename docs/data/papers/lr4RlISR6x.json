To effectively capture this periodic heterogeneity, we propose PHAT (Period Heterogeneity-Aware Transformer). Specifically, PHAT arranges multivari- ate inputs into a three-dimensional \"periodic bucket\" tensor, where the dimensions correspond to variable group characteristics with similar periodicity, time steps aligned by phase, and offsets within the period. By restricting interactions within buckets and masking cross-bucket connections, PHAT effectively avoids inter- ference from inconsistent periods. We also propose a positive-negative attention mechanism, which captures periodic dependencies from two perspectives: periodic alignment and periodic deviation. Additionally, the periodic alignment attention scores are decomposed into positive and negative components, with a modulation term encoding periodic priors. This modulation constrains the attention mechanism to more faithfully reflect the underlying periodic trends. A mathematical expla- nation is provided to support this property. We evaluate PHAT comprehensively on 14 real-world datasets against 18 baselines, and the results show that it signif- icantly outperforms existing methods, achieving highly competitive forecasting performance.

To address this, the authors propose a bucket-based modeling framework that groups and models sequences according to their distinct periodic properties.

Positive-Negative Attention Mechanism: The proposed mechanism is conceptually sound; however, the paper would benefit from multi-level visualizations of the positive and negative components — at the sequence level, feature (patch) level, and attention level. Without such analyses, it remains unclear whether the originally negative correlations in the raw sequence might become positively correlated after complex linear projections. This visualization is crucial for validating the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.\n2. It is recommended that Table 3 include results on more datasets to enhance the persuasiveness and comprehensiveness of the validation.\n3. The results in Figure 5 and Table 3 could be presented in greater detail, with extended analyses provided in the appendix.\n4.
