In this work, we first provide a systematic categorization of eight representative malfunction scenarios, covering both detectable and undetectable cases.

UMC employs a two-stage training pipeline: the first stage learns strong baseline locomotion in undamaged environments, while the second stage fine-tunes the controller with mixed malfunction scenarios to encourage adaptive and robust behavior. For detectable settings, we introduce a masking strategy that explicitly filters corrupted signals, preventing error propagation and enabling policies to rely on functional joints. UMC is compatible with both transformer and MLP backbones. Experiments across multiple humanoid and quadruped tasks show that UMC consistently reduces failure rates and improves task completion under diverse damage conditions.

Clear problem framing and taxonomy.\n* The paper usefully enumerates eight realistic malfunction cases (sensor OK/broken x three joint degradations).

Missing the most relevant 2023–2025 fault-/damage-tolerant quadruped literature and novelty over the existing works.\n* The related work almost entirely stays in (i) generic legged RL (RMA, BodyTransformer, parkour / LeggedGym), (ii) transformer in robotics, and (iii) self-recovering. But it does not cite or compare to exactly the line of works that study fault-tolerant / damage-aware locomotion with explicit joint failures, such as the following list, just to name a few. These recent papers focus heavily on fault-tolerant learning policies and fault recovery strategies. The lack of comparison or discussion with these works is a critical oversight.\nFor instance, ICRA 2024 [2] proposed a random joint masking for quadrupedal robots in a way that’s directly related to this work, also utilizing a two-stage training method, similar to this paper.\n\n* [1] Ft-net: Learning failure recovery and fault-tolerant locomotion for quadruped robots, RA-L 23\n* [2] Learning Quadrupedal Locomotion with Impaired Joints Using Random Joint Masking, ICRA 24\n* [3] Meta Reinforcement Learning of Locomotion Policy for Quadruped Robots With Motor Stuck, T-ASE 24\n* [4] Multi-Task Learning of Active Fault-Tolerant Controller for Leg Failures in Quadruped robots, ICRA 24\n* [5] FT-CPG: Learning Central Pattern Generators for Fault-Tolerant Quadruped Locomotion Under Multi-Joint Failures, RA-L 25\n* [6] DreamFLEX: Learning Fault-Aware Quadrupedal Locomotion Controller for Anomaly Situation in Rough Terrains, ICRA 25\n* [7] Fault Joint Detection and Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Control of Legged Robots Under Joint Partial Failures, RA-L 25\n\n2. Missing comparison with the above works.\n* The paper would be much stronger if it included direct comparative experiments, benchmarking against the fault-tolerant models (i.e., the above-listed works). Without these, it is hard to determine if UMC is genuinely an improvement over recent solutions, or if it merely offers a rebranding of existing approaches.\n\n3. Missing real-world experiments.\n* Another critical difference with the above-listed works and the current paper is that the previous works all include real-world demonstrations that show each proposed method is valid in real-world robots. The paper also needs to include at least one demonstration."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the weakness parts."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "u99UeMOLyS", "forum": "154r7u3LTJ", "replyto": "154r7u3LTJ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9655/Reviewer_X7vm"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9655/Reviewer_X7vm"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9655/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761976930580, "cdate": 1761976930580, "tmdate": 1762921181833, "mdate": 1762921181833, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "nzMKbL8PSJ", "forum": "154r7u3LTJ", "replyto": "154r7u3LTJ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9655/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9655/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763271868355, "cdate": 1763271868355, "tmdate": 1763271868355, "mdate": 1763271868355, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces the Unified Malfunction Controller (UMC), a novel two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the robustness of legged robots under a wide range of joint and sensor malfunctions.

The idea behind this paper is very good—addressing how to maintain balance when a robot's joints are partially damaged. However, the definition of \"damage\" in the paper is not sufficiently detailed or logical. For instance, stating that sensors \"fail to provide correct observation and output only zeros (thus detectable)\" seems more like a communication failure rather than actual physical damage to the robot.\n2. The description of the tasks used to evaluate the model's performance is incomplete. Based on the figures in the paper, it appears that only locomotion training for the lower-body joints was conducted, with the upper body fixed. However, this point is not explicitly mentioned in the text, which does not align with the contributions claimed.\n3. The paper lacks real-robot demonstrations and qualitative examples. While physically damaging a real robot may be costly, adding noise to specific motors could simulate such scenarios.

The biggest weakness is the complete absence of real-robot validation. The paper is motivated by real hardware failures (broken sensors, weakened joints), but all results are in simulation, and there is no evidence that the proposed 8-case taxonomy and attention masking will transfer to real sensing/actuation noise or real-time constraints.\n2. The malfunction space is still hand-enumerated. Although the 8 scenarios are reasonable, there is no analysis of coverage (e.g., multiple simultaneous joint degradations, contact-related faults, time-varying degradation).\n3. The paper would benefit from a deeper analysis of when the policy fails in undetectable cases (where the sensor does not tell you which joint is bad), since those are the closest to real intermittent wear/faults.\n4.
