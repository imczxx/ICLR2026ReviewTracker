Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text generation, stories generated by LLMs still diverge from human-authored works regarding complex narrative structure and human-aligned preferences. A key reason is the absence of effective modeling of human story preferences, which are inherently subjective and under-explored. In this work, we systematically evaluate the modeling of human story preferences and introduce StoryRMB, the first benchmark for assessing reward models on story preferences. StoryRMB contains $1,133$ high-quality, human-verified instances, each consisting of a prompt, one chosen story, and three rejected stories. We find existing reward models struggle to select human-preferred stories, with the best model achieving only $66.3\\%$ accuracy. To address this limitation, we construct roughly $100,000$ high-quality story preference pairs across diverse domains and develop StoryReward, an advanced reward model for story preference trained on this dataset. StoryReward achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on StoryRMB, outperforming much larger models. We also adopt StoryReward in downstream test-time scaling applications for best-of-n (BoN) story selection and find that it generally chooses stories better aligned with human preferences. We will release our dataset, model, and code to facilitate future research.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Story Generation", "Story Reward", "Reward Bench"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8267474cbf296eb989a3ebd19ad9ccb78888a95c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the challenge that current reward models fail to capture human story preferences.

While STORYREWARD performs well on human–LLM preference classification, its performance notably declines on LLM–LLM preference pairs. The paper does not provide a clear explanation for this discrepancy. Further analysis is needed to understand why the model fails to generalize to LLM-generated comparisons, and what this implies about the nature of the learned preference signal.\n4. Given the degraded performance on LLM–LLM comparisons, the reliability of STORYREWARD for best-of-N sampling warrants further scrutiny. If the model struggles to distinguish higher-quality continuations among LLM outputs, it may not consistently guide the selection toward genuinely better generations."}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "I86NGw0Vzp", "forum": "a3JmkJtTDV", "replyto": "a3JmkJtTDV", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16346/Reviewer_ynpP"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16346/Reviewer_ynpP"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16346/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761691179545, "cdate": 1761691179545, "tmdate": 1762926479922, "mdate": 1762926479922, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper addresses the problem of reward modeling for story generation and makes three main contributions.

'Premise back-translation' doesn't really mean that; the authors create another premise from two similar stories and rank them by engagement. It could be called something else. Also, they have human-human story data from this method but it's not in Figure 2 so what the reward model's accuracy is on this set seems unclear.\n\n6.

An important research question in the current space of LLM-research is the performance degradation of reasoning-based models on creative tasks. StoryRMB provides a helpful dataset to test the creative-writing competencies of a model.\n- The authors made intelligent and targeted design choices in their data generation procedure to collect data for STORYREWARD.

Specifically, since premise-backtranslation and human-guided continuation only comprised of 10% and 6% of the final dataset in its entirety, I wonder how critical they are in the performance of STORYREWARD. I would have been interested in an ablation study where each data collection method was individually excluded/replaced during training to evaluate its contribution to the reward model’s performance.\n- The authors state that existing reward models often prefer LLM-generated stories over human-written stories. However, during the “human-guided continuation” data collection procedure, they choose to utilize the human-continuation to direct LLM-generations rather than include the human-stories themselves.
