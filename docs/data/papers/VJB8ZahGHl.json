However, existing systems are restricted to human timbres and have limited ability to synthesize voices outside the human range, which are increasingly demanded in creative applications such as video games, movies, and virtual characters. We introduce Non-Human Singing Generation (NHSG), covering non-human singing voice synthesis (NHSVS) and non-human singing voice conversion (NHSVC), as a novel machine learning task for generating musically coherent singing with non-human timbral characteristics. NHSG is particularly challenging due to the scarcity of non-human singing data, the lack of symbolic alignment, and the wide timbral gap between human and non-human voices. To address these challenges, we propose CartoonSing, a unified framework that integrates singing voice synthesis and conversion while bridging human and non-human singing generation. CartoonSing employs a two-stage pipeline: a score representation encoder trained with annotated human singing and a timbre-aware vocoder that reconstructs waveforms for both human and non-human audio. Experiments demonstrate that CartoonSing successfully generates non-human singing voices, generalizes to novel timbres, and extends conventional SVS and SVC toward creative, non-human singing generation.

This is a very new task, so baseline comparison is a bit meaningless. The baselines (VISinger 2 and SaMoye-SVC) are extremely weak under the experimental setup of the authors, so I cannot know how \"good\" the model is. The only way to perceive the model's performance is the demo page. However, even though the SIM metrics of the proposed model has reached the best, the generated voices still sounds very unpleasant. The authors may need to conceive a better metric to measure the quality of the generated audio. \n2. Continuation of Weakness 1: the proposed model has higher SIM scores, but, subjectively speaking, the voice generated is less pleasant than that of the baselines. This makes me wonder: do we really need a violin to sing poorly, just to be more like a human? This also leads to a new problem: the authors cannot control the extent to which the voice generated resemble the target musical instruments. \n3. The authors used Japanese datasets for training and evaluation, but there is no Japanese songs on the demo page. Also, MOS-T is not conducted on Japanese generations. I wonder why. \n4. According to the metric LF0 RMSE, the proposed model has worse pitch accuracy. There is no discussion about that."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
