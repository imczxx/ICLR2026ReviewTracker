However, it currently relies on expansive global HD maps that cannot adapt to dynamic road conditions. Recently, online perception (OP) maps have become research hotspots, providing real-time geometry as an alternative, but lack the global topology needed for navigation. To address these issues, Online Navigation Refinement (ONR), a new mission is introduced that refines SD-map-based road-level routes into accurate lane-level navigation by associating SD maps with OP maps. The map-to-map association to handle many-to-one lane-to-road mappings under two key challenges: (1) no public dataset provides lane-to-road correspondences; (2) severe misalignment from spatial fluctuations, semantic disparities, and OP map noise invalidates traditional map matching. For these challenges, We contribute: (1) Online map association dataset (OMA), the first ONR benchmark with 30K scenarios and 2.6M annotated lane vectors; (2) MAT, a transformer with path-aware attention to aligns topology despite spatial fluctuations and semantic disparities and spatial attention for integrates noisy OP features via global context; and (3) NR P-R, a metric evaluating geometric and semantic alignment. Experiments show that MAT outperforms existing methods at 34 ms latency, enabling low-cost and up-to-date lane-level navigation.", "tldr": "We introduce Online Navigation Refinement that enabled low-cost real-time lane navigation by fusing SD maps with perception maps via a new transformer (MAT) and dataset (OMA).", "keywords": ["online navigation refinement", "geographic information systems", "navigation", "standard definition map", "online perception map"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/100ad3ffec7f18d549a76e1a3575d0776d9a2ac5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/72fa79a15666ce782b7598c3c674f447e7552748.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new and important task for Online Perception Maps and SD map association.

This paper proposes a new and important task for the online perception maps association, which is valuable for real-world applications in autonomous driving. Assigning prediction lanes to SD road elements is essential for building topological relationships between lanes and roads, further benefiting navigation and planning.

For the subfigure Fig 2.(3), there are two junction curve lines connecting two crossroads. The mapping of such transition\n lines is ambiguous due to their connection attributes. How to solve this problem when constructing the ground truth assignment labels?\n2. As this paper also studies the noise of road elements and assignment with predicted lanes, a line of related works regarding the use of SDMaps and the noise problem for map perception should be included and discussed, such as SMERF [1],  TopoSD [2], P-MapNet [3] and etc.\n3. We know there are inevitably some cases with the absence of the SDMap road elements or shifting road geometry,  caused by the errors of GPS localization or map construction.  We would like to know how these factors affect the association process and how the proposed metrics maintain robustness when dealing with imperfect SDMaps. In particular, this concern applies to cases where the generated online maps are geometrically or topologically inaccurate, even though they are otherwise precise.\n\n[1] Luo K Z, Weng X, Wang Y, et al.
