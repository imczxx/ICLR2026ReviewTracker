Existing paradigms rely on either large-scale retrieval, which requires storing a large number of image embeddings, grid-based classifiers that ignore geographic continuity, or generative models that diffuse over space but struggle with fine detail. We introduce an entity-centric formulation of geolocation that replaces image-to-image retrieval with a compact hierarchy of geographic entities embedded in Hyperbolic space. Images are aligned directly to country, region, subregion, and city entities through Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning by directly incorporating haversine distance into the contrastive objective. This hierarchical design enables interpretable predictions and efficient inference with 240k entity embeddings instead of over 5 million image embeddings on the OSV5M benchmark, on which our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the current methods in the literature, it reduces mean geodesic error by 19.5\\%, while improving the fine-grained subregion accuracy by 43\\%. These results demonstrate that geometry-aware hierarchical embeddings provide a scalable and conceptually new alternative for global image geolocation.", "tldr": "HierLoc reformulates geolocation as image-to-entity alignment in hyperbolic space, with geo-weighted contrastive learning and cross-modal attention, enabling compact inference and achieving SOTA on OSV-5M with 19.5% lower error.", "keywords": ["Representation learning", "Multimodal learning", "Contrastive learning", "Manifold learning", "Hierarchical modeling", "Geospatial AI"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0db09ac13bdcbf32fbe13392acfefba710ab0666.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper trains on two datasets (OSV5M and MediaEval’16) but does not include an ablation showing how each dataset affects performance.\nPrevious geolocation works (e.g., PIGEON, RFM S, GeoDecoder) trained and evaluated using only one dataset, ensuring fair comparison.\n\nBecause HierLoc uses multiple datasets—OSV5M for one benchmark and MediaEval’16 for others—the reported gains may partly come from additional training data diversity, not just from the proposed hyperbolic embedding method.\nWithout a controlled experiment (e.g., training only on OSV5M and testing cross-dataset), it is unclear whether improvements are architectural or data-driven."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper is clearly written, with a logical flow.\nThe figures effectively illustrate the hierarchical process.\nEquations are well-defined and consistent with hyperbolic geometry notation.\nIntroduces the first explicit use of hyperbolic embeddings for visual geolocation, representing geographic hierarchies as hyperbolic manifolds.\nThe Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic InfoNCE (GWH-InfoNCE) loss incorporating haversine distance is novel and well-justified.\nReformulating geolocation as image-to-entity alignment instead of image-to-image retrieval is conceptually new."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.

The key weakness, which severely restricts the generalizability of the method, is that the proposed entity hierarchy relies heavily on the **coverage** of the dataset. That is, if a location in the test set never appears in any neighborhoods of an entity in the training dataset, the model will never be able to predict its location. This is no rare case -- both MP16 and OSV5M are highly spatially biased, i.e. most data concentrate in North America and Western Europe. This is already a known problem in traditional retrieval based methods such as GeoCLIP (see a recent NeurIPS paper https://openreview.net/pdf/c2d943add9cd78700f9acc1101286c2082105a70.pdf, Section 5.2 and Appendix A.7), and the entity hierarchy which simplifies 4 million candidate locations into 240k entities only makes the problem worse. In other words, the proposed method, on its very basis, can not handle spatially out-of-distribution cases. This is a huge weak point compared to recently developed generative geolocation models (RFM, LocDiff) which naturally generalizes to arbitrary locations on Earth.\n\nThis problem is covered in the paper because the authors only performed testing on the same datasets the models are trained -- i.e., if a model is trained on the OSV5M training dataset, it is evaluated on the OSV5M test dataset. It \"hides\" the generalizability problem.\n\n2. Errors in citations. Too many citations are in wrong formats -- e.g. throughout the paper, most citations are not properly put into parentheses.\n\n3.

Have you ever tested with cross-dataset experiments? For example, in GeoCLIP, the model trained on MP16 is evaluated on Im2GPS3k and YFCC, and obviously YFCC has much weaker performance because its data distribution is different from MP16. In your experiments, all test data seem to be a left-out of the training data. This will cover your generalizability issue, since the test locations are likely to align with the entity hierarchy you build from the training data."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "HfL1xKSFpp", "forum": "d5GmZP2qrd", "replyto": "d5GmZP2qrd", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9686/Reviewer_V4da"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9686/Reviewer_V4da"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9686/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761892236606, "cdate": 1761892236606, "tmdate": 1762921201010, "mdate": 1762921201010, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes to solve **geolocation as a hierarchical retrieval problem**.
