This paper studies a new scenario in treatment responder classification when abstention is allowed, i.e., practitioners can opt out of making uncertain classification on some individuals for further investigation. By revealing the implicit relation between causal misclassification risk with abstention and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), we develop a doubly robust method named $\\text{TRECA}$ to learn the classification rule under loose convergence conditions on nuisance parameters, and further propose a modification $\\text{TRECA}_+$ based on tight bound on responding probability to relax the monotonicity assumption. Rigorous theories and extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the theoretical and experimental guarantee on our methods in learning treatment responders classification rules with low regret at the cost of limited abstention.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Treatment Responder; Treatment Effect; Causal Decision Making; Abstention"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/32743e9adf6f07f4be47e48fa86ed9fbe7723751.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes an adaptation of abstention methods to treatment responder classification. \nThe authors present a principled method grounded in theory to correctly estimate the functions of interest and evaluate their approach over two existing datasets."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper's main strengths:\n\n1. The extension of abstention to the setting of treatment responder classification is very interesting\n2. The presented method is theoretically grounded\n3. The paper has the potential to be impactful"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The main concerns I have are:\n\n*Soundness*: The proofs rely on the unconfoundedness assumption, which is not properly discussed in my opinion. Indeed, a classical argument supporting abstention (as also acknowledged by the authors e.g., in lines 69-70; ) is the possibility of obtaining extra information on some difficult-to-classify instances. If new variables are involved, I think one might need an ad hoc notion of unconfoundedness.\n\n*Clarity:* The paper notation is very dense, and sometimes it also seems not very consistent. For example, it seems to me that both $\\mathbb{E}$ and $E$ are being used for denoting expected values (es within Eq. 1 and Proposition 1, respectively).\n\n\n*Empirical Evaluation:* I am not sure whether I completely understand how the empirical evaluation was carried out. \nIn particular, the authors state:\n\n> For fair comparison, we randomly abstain the samples on baselines to ensure the metrics are computed on the same amount of samples.\n\nI am missing the point here. Why not consider some naive \"abstention\" baselines rather than randomly abstaining? For instance, to better isolate the contribution of TRECA, it would be informative to include some abstention baseline that does not rely on the proposed doubly robust approach. For example, why not abstain when the uncertainty (e.g., using some ensemble for $\\tau(x)$ estimation or some variance measure) is too large (i.e, above a certain quantile)? This would clarify whether the observed performance gains stem from the causal abstention risk itself or from the underlying CATE estimation quality.\n\n*Relation to Prior Work:* I think the paper could benefit from adding another related work paragraph mentioning a few recent works that investigated (from different perspectives) abstention and causal inference. \nFor instance, [1] proposes to consider a *counterfactual score* of an abstaining classifier, defined as the expected performance of the classifier had it not been allowed to abstain.\nMoreover, some recent works connect causality and deferral (i.e., rather than simply abstaining, we involve another predictor in the decision): in [2] the authors propose a framework to \"causally\" evaluate classifiers that defer the decision to humans, while in [3] the authors propose an approach to learn deferral policy robust to confounding.\n\n I think discussing these works might better position the work in the current literature\n\n**References**\n\n\n[1] Choe, Yo Joong, Aditya Gangrade, and Aaditya Ramdas. \"Counterfactually comparing abstaining classifiers.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2023): 28281-28293.\n\n[2] Palomba, F., Pugnana, A., Alvarez, J.

I believe several sections of the text require revision.\n2. The authors should add an introductory paragraph explaining the notation used throughout the paper (i.e., the min and max operators, the O_p notation, etc.).\n3. In lines 132-134, the authors claim that the constraint formulation ensures generalization performance for their classifier. I believe this section requires clarification: generalization is guaranteed only for the subsets of P where the algorithm does not abstain. In other regions, performance may be arbitrarily poor.\n4. In Theorem 1, it is unclear why the abstention rule r^\\star necessarily belongs to the hypothesis set \\mathcal{R}.\n5. I suggest that after introducing Assumptions 4 and 5, the authors include a brief discussion characterizing the strength of these assumptions and providing examples that satisfy them. For instance, I question whether Assumption 5 (monotonicity) holds in medical scenarios. Specifically, prescribing a drug instead of a placebo to a non-patient does not always produce positive effects.\n6. In Theorem 2, the authors should explicitly state in the main text the dependence on problem-specific quantities such as \\delta and c, and clarify why this result advances the existing literature. For example, the conditions under which the \\epsilon_n quantity vanishes remain unclear.\n7. Algorithm 1 is clearly presented and well-written; however, no theoretical guarantee (theorem) establishes its convergence or convergence rate.\n8. In lines 312-313, the authors state that it is possible to derive differentiable upper and lower bounds for \\rho(x) with respect to \\tau, yet they subsequently employ \\max{\\tau/2, 0}, a function that is non-differentiable in \\tau at 0. Why does this non-differentiability at zero not pose a problem?\n9. In Theorem 4, the authors require that the predictor hypothesis class \\mathcal{F} have VC dimension larger than n. What about simpler classes, such as linear or logistic models? Do you have experimental or theoretical evidence demonstrating the performance of your method in these cases? I would expect the theoretical results to be parameterized by statistical quantities characterizing both the predictor class \\mathcal{F} and the abstention class \\mathcal{R} (such as VCdim(F,R)).\n10. In the experimental section (line 392), it remains unclear how the authors used the MLP to construct both the predictor and the rejector. How many parameters does this MLP contain? Additionally, why do the benchmark methods abstain at random locations rather than at the same points where your method abstains?"}, "questions": {"value": "1) See the above section.\n2) I believe a natural extension would be to consider the dual problem: minimizing the number of abstentions subject to maintaining low misclassification rates on the training set.
