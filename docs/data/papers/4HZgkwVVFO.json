The probabilistic backbone—the Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model—retains interpretability while enabling multimodal velocity representation, capturing correlations between speed and direction (Eq. 1–2). The use of SIREN-based temporal encoding is a strong design choice, effectively modeling daily periodicities and outperforming Fourier and discrete temporal grids in ablations (Table 3). Experimental validation is solid: the authors benchmark against multiple strong baselines (CLiFF-map, Online CLiFF, and STeF-map) and demonstrate both quantitative accuracy gains and significant efficiency improvements in training time (Table 2). The qualitative results are well-presented (Fig. 5), showing realistic spatio-temporal evolution of human flow patterns that align with semantic structure (e.g., benches, exits, corridors). Overall, the paper is technically rigorous, well-motivated, and carefully evaluated, making a strong contribution to spatio-temporal modeling in robotics."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The proposed implicit mapping formulation assumes a globally smooth function Φθ(x, t), which may be overly restrictive for environments with sharp spatial or temporal discontinuities (e.g., doorways, temporary barriers, or sudden event-driven flow changes). The model’s reliance on a fixed neural parameterization prevents local adaptation to abrupt changes, and the paper does not provide any mechanism (e.g., hierarchical grids or local residuals) to handle non-smooth motion transitions (Sec. 3.2).\n\n2. The periodicity assumption in time modeling (Sec. 3.2, lines 215–218) simplifies human motion to a daily cycle, which is unrealistic for many public spaces with irregular or event-driven patterns. The evaluation dataset (ATC) naturally exhibits strong daily regularity, but no experiment tests NeMo-map on non-periodic or transient patterns, making the claimed generality questionable. The model’s performance could degrade if queried outside the trained temporal domain or under distribution shifts in time.\n\n3. The evaluation metric focuses solely on negative log-likelihood (Sec. 4.4, Table 1), which measures statistical fit but not flow-level accuracy or spatial consistency—key factors for downstream robotic use. The paper reports no task-based or trajectory-level validation (e.g., motion prediction or navigation performance), making it difficult to assess whether the smoother velocity fields actually improve practical planning or prediction outcomes.\n\n4. While the authors emphasize NeMo-map’s faster training (Table 2), the comparison fairness is limited: CLiFF-map is retrained per hour and cell, while NeMo-map jointly trains across space and time with GPU acceleration. The paper does not normalize for total computation per prediction or per environment, so the reported “two orders of magnitude speedup” may overstate the practical advantage. Moreover, the ablation study (Sec. 4.6) isolates temporal encodings but omits critical architecture factors such as mixture component count (J) or grid resolution (Gs), leaving the method’s scalability characteristics underexplored."}, "questions": {"value": "please address the concerns above"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "P1HF2KA3GS", "forum": "4HZgkwVVFO", "replyto": "4HZgkwVVFO", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21314/Reviewer_ETtv"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21314/Reviewer_ETtv"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21314/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760599155554, "cdate": 1760599155554, "tmdate": 1762941690211, "mdate": 1762941690211, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new way to represent how humans move in an environment.

Therefore, additional experiments and performance evaluations on other datasets are necessary.\n\n- Since the proposed NeMo-map heavily relies on neural implicit representation, its internal representations are limited in terms of interpretability. Consequently, it is challenging to analyze the model’s decision-making process or evaluate its reliability in real-world robotic operation environments."}, "questions": {"value": "- In Line 146, the authors explicitly state that the proposed method is fundamentally different from trajectory prediction models. However, in Figure 1, to illustrate the application of MoD, the authors present results alongside existing human trajectory prediction models such as Social LSTM and MID. This raises the question of whether such comparisons should be included as part of actual experimental validation, rather than being presented merely as conceptual illustrations. Furthermore, as mentioned in Line 036, “a planner informed by MoDs can exploit prior knowledge of human motion patterns to generate a trajectory that aligns with the expected flow, allowing the robot to reach the goal safely and efficiently. MoDs can also be applied to long-term human motion prediction (Zhu et al., 2023). As shown in the right of Fig. 1, MoDs help predict realistic trajectories that implicitly respect the complex topology of the environment, such as navigating around corners or avoiding obstacles.” Given this description, it would be valuable to verify whether, in the field of human motion prediction or human trajectory prediction, the proposed approach indeed provides better priors that contribute to the performance improvements observed in “With MoD guidance” in Figure 1. Such experiments would substantially reinforce the credibility of the claim that MoD guidance effectively aids motion planning and human motion prediction.\n\n- The authors conducted experiments on the ATC dataset and included the analysis in Section 4.5 (Qualitative Results). However, the explanation could be more detailed. Figure 5 merely shows the dataset distribution across different time periods, but it would be insightful to elaborate on what specific human lifestyle patterns lead to certain behaviors or activities at particular locations and times. Moreover, it would be helpful to clarify under which scenarios(situations) or environmental conditions the model’s predictions are accurate and where they fail.

Its computational efficiency and smoothness could make it a practical alternative to existing grid-based approaches in large or dynamic environments."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited novelty and conceptual contribution: While the paper presents a “continuous” MoD via implicit neural functions, the underlying methodological idea—using an implicit neural field to map coordinates to local probabilistic parameters—is conceptually similar to existing implicit representation frameworks (e.g., NeRF, SIREN, and Neural Fields for flow estimation). The novelty primarily lies in adapting these tools to an existing MoD formulation rather than introducing fundamentally new modeling principles. In this sense, NeMo-map reads as an engineering refinement of the CLiFF-map rather than a conceptual breakthrough.\n\n2. Narrow experimental validation and lack of domain diversity: The evaluation is conducted entirely on a single dataset (ATC), which—while large—is limited to indoor pedestrian motion in a controlled shopping mall environment. The paper’s claims about generalization in spatio-temporal motion fields would be more convincing if validated across domains (e.g., outdoor crowd datasets, vehicle or mixed-agent motion). Testing only on ATC raises concerns that the model’s performance gains might be dataset-specific, particularly since temporal periodicity (daily cycles) is a strong prior in ATC but not in all motion environments. Expanding experiments to additional datasets (e.g., ETH/UCY or MOTChallenge) would considerably strengthen the generality claim.\n\n3. Lack of downstream evaluation or task relevance: Although the paper emphasizes applications such as socially aware navigation and long-term prediction, the evaluation is limited to negative log-likelihood (NLL) metrics. These metrics assess representational fit but not utility. It remains unclear whether the proposed NeMo-map actually improves downstream performance in motion planning, collision avoidance, or human trajectory forecasting compared with prior MoD-based methods. Including an evaluation in a planning or prediction pipeline—e.g., comparing robot navigation success rates or forecast accuracy using NeMo vs. CLiFF—would provide stronger evidence of practical benefit.\n\n4. Inadequate comparative visualization of results: The qualitative results (Fig. 5) present visualizations only for the proposed NeMo-map, without showing side-by-side comparisons with baseline methods such as CLiFF-map, STeF-map, or Online CLiFF-map. This omission makes it difficult for readers to visually assess the claimed advantages in smoothness, continuity, or multimodality. Including qualitative comparisons—e.g., overlaying the predicted flow fields of different models in the same regions—would provide a much clearer and more compelling demonstration of NeMo-map’s improvements."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could the authors provide qualitative visual comparisons between NeMo-map and the baselines (e.g., CLiFF-map, Online CLiFF-map, STeF-map)?\n2. How well does NeMo-map generalize to motion domains with very different spatial and temporal dynamics (e.g., outdoor environments, vehicle flows, or multi-agent interactions)?\n3.
