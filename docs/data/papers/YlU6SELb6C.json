While existing methods enforce constraints in every policy update, we demonstrate that this is unnecessarily conservative. Instead, each update only needs to progressively expand the feasible region while improving the value function. Our proposed algorithm, namely feasible policy optimization (FPO), simultaneously achieves both objectives by solving a region-wise policy optimization problem. Specifically, FPO maximizes the value function inside the feasible region and minimizes the feasibility function outside it. We prove that these two sub-problems share a common optimal solution, which is obtained based on a tight bound we derive on the constraint decay function. Extensive experiments on the Safety-Gymnasium benchmark show that FPO achieves excellent constraint satisfaction while maintaining competitive task performance, striking a favorable balance between safety and return compared to state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms.", "tldr": "Proposes a region-wise policy optimization method that monotonically improves safety and performance.", "keywords": ["Safe reinforcement learning", "feasible policy iteration", "region-wise policy optimization", "constraint decay function"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d96c3f6efa75c4701ed0a99372e6b1d85f525b06.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/0bfb7e9c5d4c91c50496fe63577a221c15a19bf7.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper talks about an efficient approach where, instead of enforcing the constraint satisfaction explicitly after every policy update, it talks about maximizing the Value function in the present feasible domain and then progressively expanding the feasible domain.\nIn particular, the paper solves the problem in two ways.

I am just curious to know that only FPO has the lowest uncertainty range in terms of cost. But its uncertainty range in terms of return is a little higher. So, if we run for long enough as you have for your experiments, why is the uncertainty range for other algorithms, such as PPO-Lag and FOCOPS, so vast? Because for PPO-Lag, there is a possibility that it can go less than 0.08 in cost while giving better value return. For example, if you check the Point Button plot, PPO-lag has supremely outperformed FPO.\n\n3.
