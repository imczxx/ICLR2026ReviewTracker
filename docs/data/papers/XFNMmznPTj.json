In real-world dynamic environments, such as cyber-physical systems, this assumption often breaks down due to delays in the interaction between the agent and the system. These delays can vary stochastically over time and are typically _unobservable_ when deciding on an action. Existing methods deal with this uncertainty conservatively by assuming a known fixed upper bound on the delay, even if the delay is often much lower. In this work, we introduce the _interaction layer_, a general framework that enables agents to adaptively handle unobservable and time-varying delays. Specifically, the agent generates a matrix of possible future actions, anticipating a horizon of potential delays, to handle both unpredictable delays and lost action packets sent over networks. Building on this framework, we develop a model-based algorithm, _Actor-Critic with Delay Adaptation (ACDA)_, which dynamically adjusts to delay patterns. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a wide range of locomotion benchmark environments.", "tldr": "We introduce a novel framework enabling RL agents to adapt on-the-fly to unobservable random delays.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning", "Delay", "Unobservability"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ca7643902ca7a5534ae39f55c4a084d69c40288b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/382bd7d69607010584b32a38303542d348f256cf.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the problem of reinforcement learning under random, unobservable interaction delays in cyber-physical systems.

The paper's most significant weakness lies in its comparative experimental design, as both the choice of baselines and their setup are unreasonable. The authors selected BPQL and VDPO, which are methods primarily designed for constant delay. However, in random delay environments, providing the worst-case delay as a priori knowledge to these algorithms is, in the reviewer's opinion, an unreasonable setup. The reviewer believes a more reasonable design would be to provide the mean of the random delay distribution as the priori delay knowledge for this class of methods; that is, the agent would be making decisions based on the average-case delay.\n2. Given the paper's focus on the random delay problem, the authors have omitted a comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods that also specifically address random delays, such as DFBT [1] and State Augmentation-MLP [2]. Benchmarking against this relevant class of methods would be necessary to further substantiate the claimed effectiveness of the proposed method.\n3. The paper's presentation is not good enough. The notation introduced is somewhat complex, and the process described in the text for Figures 2 and 3 is difficult to follow. For example, in Figure 2, the most recent observation received by the agent is labeled o_{t-2}, yet the description in lines 193-194 refers to o_t as the agent's observation, which is confusing. Furthermore, when Figure 3 is first introduced (lines 210-211), the definition for the counter c_t, which is essential to the figure caption, has not yet been provided, making it difficult to understand."}, "questions": {"value": "1. In lines 418-419, the authors state, \"we expect ACDA not to perform as well with the M/M/1 queue delays that fluctuate more.\" However, in Table 1, ACDA's performance under the MM1 Delay process is exceptionally strong, in most environments even exceeding its performance on the GE1,23 and GE4,32 processes. This result appears to contradict the authors' statement. Can the authors explain this phenomenon?\n2. The parameter L does not appear to be explicitly defined in the main text. The reviewer found in Appendix F.2 that L represents the \"prediction length,\" but how this parameter is determined is a significant concern for the reviewer. If L is set to the maximum value of the random delay, this implies an assumption that the maximum random delay is known, which would weaken the advantage of this work in handling unobservable random delays. If L is set as a fixed empirical value, the reviewer hopes the authors can provide the corresponding justification.\n3. A very interesting result in Table 1 is why DCAC, a method explicitly designed for random delays, performs so poorly in this random delay environment—far worse, in fact, than the constant-delay methods BPQL and VDPO. Is this poor performance attributable to the stochastic transitions induced by the authors' use of action noise, which perhaps DCAC is not well-suited to handle?\n\nReference\n[1] Directly Forecasting Belief for Reinforcement Learning with Delays.

The work is motivated by improving efficiency under delays; however, computing the action matrix itself is significantly more time-consuming than generating a single action at each timestep. In particular, while the agent executes only $T$ actions, the framework requires computing and transmitting $T \\times L^2$ actions over the network. As a result, many actions are never used, yet they add computational overhead, which could further increase delays in practice.\n\n\n- The presentation of the method needs improvement. I had to read some parts multiple times and cross-reference earlier parts to understand the details. Some sections include irrelevant discussions, while key aspects are missing. For example, the POMDP formulation is disconnected from the rest of the paper, and the claim that a single delay $d_t$ is equivalent to other types of delays is neither proved nor sufficiently discussed.\n\n- While the overall approach is novel, the two main components: generating sequences of actions and employing a model-based distributional agent, have been extensively explored in prior work. The idea of generating a sequence of actions is closely related to *action chunking*, an active research topic in the RL community. Similarly, model-based distribution agent idea has appeared in previous works on delayed RL[1, 2]. The authors could have focused more on explaining the unique contributions of their method rather than discussing previously established ideas in detail.\n\n- I also have concerns regarding the experimental evaluation. First, at least one baseline result does not match the values reported in prior work (see under *Questions*). Second, the choice of delay distributions appears to favor the proposed method. The constant-delay baselines, adapted to handle random delays, assume the worst-case delay at every step. Although the authors partially address this concern in the appendix by modifying the assumed delay upper bound (showing improved results for baselines) this adjustment still favors their method. A more fair evaluation would include the uniform delay distribution, where baseline methods operate under the correct assumption.\n\n[1] Wang, Wei, et al. \"Addressing signal delay in deep reinforcement learning.\"\n\n[2] Liotet, Pierre, et al. \"Learning a belief representation for delayed reinforcement learning.\""}, "questions": {"value": "- I assume L or h is the upper bound of the delay. What is the other variable?\n- What happens if an outdated action packet arrives at the action buffer?\n- It is not clear to me how $d_t$ replaces both observation and action delays. Could you elaborate? In particular, under both types of delays, there are timesteps where the agent receives no new observations. How is this situation equivalent in your formulation?\n\n- The reported DCAC performance on HalfCheetah-v4 is 35.60 for the MM1 delay process. Based on the MM1 process shown, all delays are less than 21, with a mean around 5. However, previously reported DCAC results [3] on constant delays of 5 and 25 are approximately 2000 and 600, respectively, on the same environment without noise. From my experience, introducing 5% noise is unlikely to cause such a large performance gap.
