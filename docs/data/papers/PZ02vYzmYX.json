While typically applied to image a single molecular species, cryo-EM holds great potential for structure determination of many targets simultaneously in a high-throughput fashion. However, existing methods typically focus on modeling conformational heterogeneity within a single or a few structures and are not designed to resolve compositional heterogeneity arising from mixtures of many distinct molecular species. To address this challenge, we propose CryoHype, a transformer-based hypernetwork for cryo-EM reconstruction that dynamically adjusts the weights of an implicit neural representation conditioned on each particle image. CryoHype establishes a new state-of-the-art on the challenging Tomotwin-100 dataset for compositional heterogeneity in CryoBench. We further introduce Sim2Struct-1000, a new synthetic dataset for compositional heterogeneity with 10 times more structures than previous datasets, where CryoHype improves $\\mathrm{FSC}_\\mathrm{AUC}$ by 67\\%. Together, these advances establish transformer hypernetworks as a scalable approach for extreme heterogeneity in cryo-EM reconstruction.", "tldr": "Reconstructing extreme compositional heterogeneity in cryo-EM is enabled by hypernetworks", "keywords": ["cryo-EM", "hypernetworks", "cryo-EM reconstruction", "implicit neural representations", "neural fields", "generalizable neural fields", "heterogeneity"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1503fee23270e02fac65e098e51145ed6af5ba18.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/dc7bd6142de0b53c9a30968a5b8b4a21d7783064.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduced CryoHype, a hypernetwork-based cryo-EM reconstruction method for complex compositional heterogeneity.
