The framework relies heavily on foundation models (GSAM 2 and DINOv2) that were pre-trained on massive datasets. It is highly probable that these models have already \"seen\" the object categories present in the BOP benchmark. Therefore, the \"zero-shot\" capability claimed is more a feat of the models' generalization than true segmentation of unseen objects.\n\nSecond, the innovation is incremental and best described as a clever engineering assembly rather than a fundamental advancement. The method is essentially a \"glue\" for existing model outputs, relying on a series of manually-tuned heuristics and hyperparameters. This questions the generalizability of the solution, as it appears more like a \"custom-fit\" for the BOP benchmark than a robust, general-purpose method.\n\nFinally, the system suffers from structural fragility and severe efficiency bottlenecks. Its performance is entirely capped by the quality of the upstream proposal generator (GSAM 2); any missed detection or poor segmentation is unrecoverable. Moreover, the paper notes considerable memory bottlenecks, as the computational load scales significantly with the number of proposals and objects, which may present scalability challenges for real-world scenarios."}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness above"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5R0EundVGV", "forum": "H8UFAU9gJ2", "replyto": "H8UFAU9gJ2", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9033/Reviewer_boL7"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9033/Reviewer_boL7"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9033/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761835827072, "cdate": 1761835827072, "tmdate": 1762920752438, "mdate": 1762920752438, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a novel training-free and RGB-only framework for zero-shot novel object instance segmentation that leverages the zero-shot capabilities of two pre-trained foundation models: Grounded-SAM 2 and DINOv2.

Lack of Novelty: It seems that the proposed method primarily relies on the integration of minor innovations (e.g., confidence and score aggregation) on top of existing foundation models. It is largely built upon prior works such as CNOS[1] and SAM-6D[2], resulting in limited incremental novelty.\n2. Although the Cyclic Thresholding (CT) mechanism is highlighted as a major innovation, its actual performance gain is extremely limited (0.512 to 0.516 in ablation), which is disproportionate to the attention it receives in the paper.\n3. The Introduction could be strengthened by more clearly identifying the key limitations of existing work to better clarify the motivation for the proposed method's innovations.\n4. Writing. Within Section 3.3, \"Appearance score with cyclic threshold,\" the two distinct contributions \"unbiased appearance score\" and the \"cyclic threshold\" lack clear separation, and the former is difficult to locate. We recommend that the authors use sub-headings or clearer structure to explicitly indicate the position of these two innovative points."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could the authors provide a visualization showing 'many-to-one' erroneous matches caused by repetitive textures (Line 055), and explain how the CT mechanism resolves this issue?\n2. The data (e.g., the jump from 0.412 at Line 385 to 0.464 at Line 438) suggests that the foundation model upgrade (from SAM to Grounded-SAM 2) provides a significant performance boost (as said in Line 454). To ensure a fair comparison, we strongly recommend using Grounded-SAM 2 as the foundation model for baselines like SAM-6D[2] and NIDS-Net[3]. This will nullify the effect of the model upgrade and allow for an accurate quantification of the net gain from the paper's own components.\n3. The NOCTIS technique, \"An unbiased appearance score that aggregates over all templates,\" sounds very similar to the CNOS[1] (Sec 3.3) technique, \"aggregating the similarity scores over all V templates.\" Could the authors explicitly state the key technical differences and advantages of the NOCTIS aggregation method compared to CNOS[1]?\n4. What is the theoretical or experimental basis for claiming the 'unbiased' appearance score (Line 077)? Could the authors justify this strong assertion in the paper?\n\n[1] Nguyen, V.
