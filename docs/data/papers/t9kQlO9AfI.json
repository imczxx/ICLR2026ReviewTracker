This method applied a widely-used jailbreak strategy (reasoning distraction) in the cross-modal setting, which lacks novelty.\n2. The paper claimed that \"CAMO decomposed harmful instructions into benign-looking textual and visual clues\", but from Figure 2, it seems that the visual input is still harmful (a bomb).\n3. This paper is only evaluated on AdvBench family datasets, which doesn't effectively prove the validity of CAMO.\n4. The baseline methods compared in the paper are not the current strong jailbreak methods. The authors should include comparisons with the latest strong methods (AutoDAN [1], UMK [2], and BAP Attack [3], etc.) to validate the effectiveness of CAMO.\n5. This method relies on a sensitive dictionary to select keywords, so if a harmful input is not included in this dictionary, the method may fail. Therefore, it seems to lack transferability.\n6. The paper evaluates the method only on models with over 70B parameters and does not test the attack on models with 7B, 8B, or 13B parameters. Since models with 7B/13B parameters seem unlikely to follow the Adversarial Prompt Template, the authors should include attack results on 7B, 8B and 13B models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack method on smaller models.\n7. The authors state in the abstract and introduction that CAMO achieves an attack success rate of 81.82% on GPT-4.1-nano and 93.94% on DeepSeek-R1. However, these are only ASR values for a single category from one dataset, and do not reflect the overall ASR. The authors should revise this and clarify it.\n8. In the 'Attack Against Defense' section, the perplexity filter, OCR, and OpenAI's moderation are not VLM jailbreak defense methods, and OpenAI's moderation has a very broad definition for harmful content. Therefore, these methods do not effectively test CAMO's robustness. The authors should include strong jailbreak defense methods for VLMs, such as Adashield [4] and BlueSuffix [5].\n9. The current evaluation only relies on ASR. The authors should include additional metrics, such as using the Perspective API, to provide a more comprehensive assessment.\n\n[1] AutoDAN: Generating Stealthy Jailbreak Prompts on Aligned Large Language Models.

The overall attack logic—hiding malicious intent through structured obfuscation and letting the model decode it internally—is not substantially new. The novelty thus feels incremental, focusing on implementation details rather than a fundamentally new attack paradigm.\n- Despite the paper’s claim that CAMO significantly reduces computational cost, it is unclear how such reduction is achieved, since the method does not seem to introduce any specific mechanism or contribution designed to lower computation. The reported token savings mainly come from comparing against baselines that require additional optimization or multi-turn generation steps. When compared to similar baselines that use lightweight single-query methods (e.g., FigStep), the efficiency advantage might be marginal.\n- The obfuscation appears to occur on the textual side, while the visual component mainly serves as an auxiliary lookup table. In practice, a safety filter could still recognize harmful semantics from the image itself. This raises questions about whether the approach truly provides multimodal stealth.\n- For the text-only method, masking long or compound attack target phrases (e.g., “bomb or explosives for killing someone”) might render the reconstruction impossible or misinterpreted. How can such lengthy-word attack queries be ensured to be reconstructed by MLLMs?\n- The paper assumes that once the model reconstructs the hidden harmful word, it will continue generating the harmful response. I wonder if it would also be effective against the output-side moderation filters, which might easily detect the reconstructed harmful words and reject the attack query.\n- In Table 1, why the proposed text-only attack shows significantly lower performance than the baseline (-20%) in KS scenario?\n\n[R1] Playing the Fool: Jailbreaking LLMs and Multimodal LLMs with Out-of-Distribution Strategy"}, "questions": {"value": "See above weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["Yes, Privacy, security and safety"]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "2lzVDgeJxY", "forum": "t9kQlO9AfI", "replyto": "t9kQlO9AfI", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5630/Reviewer_f6vV"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5630/Reviewer_f6vV"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5630/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761292776451, "cdate": 1761292776451, "tmdate": 1762918166230, "mdate": 1762918166230, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes to obfuscate sensitive words in harmful prompts using a combination of character masking with easy math problem solving.
