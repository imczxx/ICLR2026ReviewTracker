While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL series. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly but maintains prior knowledge. We study this phenomenon through learning dynamics by examining both the magnitude and direction of how training data influence prior knowledge. Our analysis shows that RFT mainly reinforces correct samples naturally aligned with the base model’s probability landscape, leading to weaker interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, training on RFT-simulated rollouts, which exert a small magnitude of influence and are well aligned in direction to prior knowledge, allows SFT to preserve prior knowledge better while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that distribution of training data, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Fine-Tuning", "Catastrophic Forgetting", "Data Distribution", "Learning Dynamics"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/aa65802f20c1160a0c126c3047a8eb48466d1436.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the differences between Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) regarding catastrophic forgetting.

Concerns are addressed below and in the revised paper, all the revised parts in the paper have been highlighted in purple.\n\n\n### **General Comment for More Experiments on Other Tasks and Models:** ###\n\nThank you for the reviewers’ suggestions. Our theory is indeed **not limited** to MLLMs. The mechanisms we study, such as data distribution and perplexity, apply equally well to unimodal language models and other tasks.\n\nTo support this point, we additionally provide experiments on the LLM Qwen2.5-Instruct here and in the revised paper, showing its forgetting behavior during post-training on math reasoning, along with the corresponding results. We hope these extra experiments can further **strengthen the generality and credibility** of our theoretical analysis and conclusions.\n\nNote that all figures mentioned here can be found in the revised paper.\n\n***Math Reasoning Dataset.***\n\nWe use the curated math corpus released by Open-Reasoner-Zero[1] as our large-scale reasoning-oriented training data, and randomly split it into $90\\%$ training and $10\\%$ held-out test data.\n\nWe refer to this held-out split as *ORZ Test*, which serves as a new target task for post-training.\n\nEach example is a competition-style math problem paired with a verifiable final answer, without any visual input.\n\n[1] *Hu J, Zhang Y, Han Q, et al.

The latter attains strong gains on the new ORZ task while keeping the performance on old tasks close to the base models, indicating the same hierarchy of forgetting severity, i.e., Non-Rea $>$ Rea-4o $>$ Rea-GRPO. \n\n**Table: Performance comparison across post-trained models of Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (math reasoning & instruction following).**\n| Task / Info        | 3B-Base  | 3B-RFT | 3B-SFT-Non-Rea | 3B-SFT-Rea-4o-Rollout | 3B-SFT-Rea-GRPO-Rollout | 7B-Base  | 7B-RFT | 7B-SFT-Non-Rea | 7B-SFT-Rea-4o-Rollout | 7B-SFT-Rea-GRPO-Rollout |\n|--------------------|----------|--------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------|--------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Training steps     | --       | 2,650  | 1,600           | 2,140                  | 2,140                   | --       | 2,650  | 1,600           | 2,140                  | 2,140                   |\n| ORZ Test (New)     | **21.3** | 35.0   | 23.4            | 35.4                   | 37.8                    | **32.1** | 49.3   | 30.3            | 45.0                   | 53.4                    |\n| GSM8k (Old)        | **84.1** | 83.4   | 15.1            | 79.9                   | 83.0                    | **90.1** | 90.2   | 21.8            | 85.8                   | 90.3                    |\n| Math-500 (Old)     | **42.4** | 55.2   | 19.4            | 50.8                   | 54.4                    | **66.6** | 64.8   | 26.4            | 57.2                   | 66.4                    |\n| IFEval (Old)       | **71.6** | 73.4   | 64.0            | 68.0                   | 72.7                    | **80.6** | 80.5   | 57.2            | 64.4                   | 80.0                    |\n***Analysis.***\n\nTo probe the underlying mechanism, we compute LBK between post-training samples and prior math knowledge during SFT. As shown in **Fig. 11** of revised paper, Non-Rea data consistently display much larger LBK values and Rea-4o also contains occasional high-LBK outliers, providing further evidence for the generality of our learning-dynamics analysis in **Sec. 5.4**. Moreover, **Fig. 12** of revised paper shows that Rea-4o-Rollout is concentrated in the high-perplexity region of the base models, whereas Rea-GRPO-Rollout lies closer to the low-perplexity region, mirroring our findings on jigsaw puzzles and supporting the low-perplexity training hypothesis in **Sec. 5.5** that post-training on model-aligned (low-PPL) reasoning trajectories mitigates catastrophic forgetting."}}, "id": "MmUa68M7qP", "forum": "tP01GCr0nS", "replyto": "tP01GCr0nS", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3775/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3775/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3775/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763643494047, "cdate": 1763643494047, "tmdate": 1763647339970, "mdate": 1763647339970, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper systematically investigate the impact of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) on prior knowledge retention in multimodal large language models (MLLMS) by introducing a jigsaw puzzle task as a novel learning scenario.

Limited Novelty of Core Insight\nGiven that [1] has already demonstrated that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting, the contribution of this work appears limited. In fact, [1] also conducted experiments showing that it is the on-policy training paradigm (e.g., RFT) that helps overcome catastrophic forgetting. The key distinction between the data used in SFT and RFT lies in whether they are on-policy or offline. Beyond the discussion in L153–L157, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison between their study and [1]. To me, this paper merely provides a possible explanation for why using on-policy data can help overcome catastrophic forgetting, rather than being the one that discovers this phenomenon.\n- In L55, the paper claims that RFT can “discover novel and useful problem-solving strategies.” However, I find it difficult to draw this conclusion from the preceding discussion about RFT, which merely states that “RFT requires several tens of thousands of training steps to successfully solve jigsaw puzzles.”\n- The paper lacks a detailed description of the construction process of the jigsaw puzzle task, such as the method used to shuffle the image tiles, and it also does not report the detailed training cost of the experiments. This omission makes it difficult for other researchers to reproduce the results.\n\n[1] Rl’s razor: Why online reinforcement learning forgets less\n\n2. Unjustified Focus on Multimodality\nWhile the study is conducted using multimodal models (MLLMs), the analysis and conclusions are not inherently tied to multimodal reasoning. The mechanisms explored—such as data distribution and perplexity—are equally applicable to unimodal language models, raising questions about the necessity of the multimodal framing.\n\n3.

Can you provide the experiment result using the standard GRPO recipe?\n- In the rationale shown in Figure 7, I noticed that the model’s reasoning process differs from how humans typically solve a jigsaw puzzle. As a human, I do begin by identifying the overall scene depicted in the image—similar to the reasoning shown in Figure 7—by observing the misaligned image tiles. However, my step-by-step reasoning primarily involves progressively determining the position of each tile. Once a tile’s position is confirmed, humans usually infer the positions of adjacent tiles based on the edge pixels of the confirmed piece. In contrast, the rationale presented in Figure 7 does not capture this gradual confirmation process.
