By modifying the Gibbs kernel, the entropy-based regularization guides the transport plan in a theoretically sound manner while simplifying the hyperparameter tuning process."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Despite its promising direction, the paper suffers from several critical weaknesses that question the validity and significance of its central claims.\n- **Omission of Spatial Coordinates:** The first concern is the disregard for Euclidean spatial distance in the OT cost function for both the proposed method and the baseline. For spatial data, the most direct and powerful prior is that cells cannot transport across the tissue in a short time interval. I believe it is important to penalize the physical distance between matched cells. The paper's \"spatial smoothness\" prior is an indirect and potentially weak proxy for this physical constraint. It is possible for two distant regions to have similar neighborhood expression profiles, which could lead to **biologically impossible long-range couplings.** The authors' claim in Appendix G.1 that ContextFlow can \"restrict transitions to within the same hemisphere\" is questionable when visually inspecting Figure 3(b). This figure still appears to show several long-range couplings that may not be biologically reasonable. One way to examine this is to evaluate the reconstructed spatial coordinates at hold-out time points.\n- **Inadequate Baselines:** As said, it seems that the spatial information is not incorporated into baselines, which may be unfair. I also recommend that the authors compare their proposed method against some newer flow-matching baselines, such as Metric Flow Matching [1], some neural-ODE baselines, such as DeepRUOT[2], and **methods specifically designed for mapping spatially resolved data**, such as moscot [3].\n- **Theoretical Gap Between Static Coupling and Dynamic Trajectory Generation:** The work relies on the Conditional Flow Matching framework, which assumes a linear interpolation path between two coupled endpoints. While ContextFlow constrains the choice of these endpoints, it provides **no guarantee about the validity of the path between them.** A straight line in high-dimensional gene expression space is likely to break those proposed constraints and induce biologically implausible transitions. This paper fails to provide any theoretical or compelling empirical justification for this point. I think the authors should examine the biologically implausible transitions along the whole trajectory instead of only endpoints.\n- **Hyperparameter Selection:** It seems that the paper does not specify the value of entropy regularization parameter $\\epsilon$ used in the experiments, nor does it describe the strategy for its selection or provide a sensitivity analysis. I assume this is an important parameter to constrain the OT coupling, so this omission is significant for the reproducibility and a full understanding of the method's robustness. I recommend providing a guidance on how to select all these hyperparameters in this paper for different datasets, and discussing the efforts for hyperparameter tuning.\n- **Minor Points:** \n    1. The notation CTF-C and PACM (or CTF-H vs. PAER) is a bit confusing. If they refer to the same concept, I recommend using one consistent term throughout the paper.\n    2. Equation 4, should that be $(x-\\mu_{t}(z))$?\n    3. Equation 9 should be more clearly stated. It is unclear how this is computed in practice.\n    4. The construction of the TPM involves neighborhood calculations and ligand-receptor interaction inference, which can be computationally intensive as the number of cells grows. The authors should provide runtime of the whole pipeline.\n    5. I think the concept of constrained OT is a well-established field.
