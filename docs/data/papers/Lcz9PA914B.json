In this work, we introduce the Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge—bilateral symmetry—to predict a “focus map” of diagnostically relevant asymmetric regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the residual error, focusing the network’s full capacity on refining these challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1–5 epochs—a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates data inefficiency and overfitting.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Deep Learning", "Medical Image Segmentation", "Mamba"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/825c1e3da63e30eb3ee68c8942fbd2e948f836a5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a \"predictive-corrective\" approach to medical image segmentation that uses anatomical inductive biases to reduce the effective capacity of a model, splitting inference into a \"predictive prior module\" (PPM) and then a \"corrective residual net\" (CRN), making it converge faster, require less training data, and perform better, tested on brain MRI segmentation tasks."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper is written and presented well, and organized in an understandable, digestible fashion. It is well-contextualized in the field and related work.\n2. The approach is intuitive, and it makes sense that certain medical imaging tasks could benefit from inductive bias assumptions based on key domain knowledge that makes things easier to learn, and with less data. Why use a sledgehammer when a regular hammer suffices?\n3. The experimental design is solid: a strong variety of evaluation metrics, strong baseline models, etc.\n4. Results on the evaluated datasets are strong: improvement over other models using many epochs is not huge but it is consistent, and those models are hard to beat (Table 1).

I feel that maybe taking this inductive bias assumption to make things a bit easier to train may only work so well for fairly simple individual dataset/modality scenarios with not as much variety in the data, and/or simple segmentation tasks. In the authors words: \"Our core insight is that a complex modeling task can be effectively decoupled into two simpler, more manageable sub-tasks\" it's unclear how well this intuition extends into other datasets, modalities, and tasks, as only brain MRI (which has unusually high spatial symmetry compared to many medical image analysis tasks) is evaluated, and the segmentation task is a fairly easy one at that. Overall, I am left wondering if this approach would generalize well to other scenarios, yet only this single modality and segmentation task is evaluated. The paper would therefore very much benefit from evaluating on another task in biomedical image segmentation, or at least a more challenging task in brain MRI, such as tumor segmentation, as the proposed simple model's superiority could be due to the evaluated task being fairly easy.\n    1. Another concern in regards to the generality of the approach: take a more challenging task also in brain MRI, of tumor segmentation (e.g. as in the BraTS challenge). Is the mask (eq 8) designed to filter out abnormalities prone to false positives in such scenarios, such that this approach would no longer work? Are there types of noticeable assymetries in brain MRI that are healthy?\n2. This was also touched on in my previous bullet, but overall, the generality of the proposed method as a useful tool for medical image segmentation would be much more substantiated if another modality/segmentation task was tested. \n3. The approach is quite computationally expensive (see Table 7) yet the limitations section discussing this isn't in the main text. As shown in Tab. 7,  the model is quite compute intensive, especially compared to U-Net which has solid performance, yet is orders of magnitude smaller and faster! The tradeoff of greatly increased computation for relatively small performance gains (Table 1) is not too convincing to me, although to be fair, in some medical imaging scenarios, training set size is the bottleneck, not compute resources. This is a key limitation and should be made clear in the main text, such as having dedicated sentences covering limitations in the conclusion section.  \n\n**Minor Weaknesses:**\n1. The proposed method's single epoch performance is impressive, although single epoch performance of other models (Fig 4) aren't that far behind.\n2. Sec 3.3/Table 3, data efficiency analysis: Seems promising but needs to be compared to some baseline models for the same training amount percentages to demonstrate that the model is more efficiency (which does seem to be implied by Fig. 4).\n3. Small formatting things: use \\citep{} for citations to make them parenthetical. Write quotations with ``x'' in LaTeX. The text in certain plots, e.g. Figure 1, is too small to read without significantly zooming in. Typo : \"The numben of train\" in Table 3.\n\n**Overall Justification of my rating and thoughts for revisions:**\nThe approach is technically solid and well-motivated for this domain. However, the limited scope of only being evaluated for a fairly easy segmentation task in brain MRI, and the possibility of the inductive biases used being constrained to only this evaluated scenario, makes the generality and impact of the work unclear. Also, the significant computation time (Table 7) needs to be addressed, as it is not mentioned in the main text, yet is a clear limitation. The approach has promise, and I think the most important way to improve the work and demonstrate its impact at the level of ICLR (as opposed to a venue like MICCAI, which it is more ready for in its current state) is via evaluation on some other medical image segmentation dataset/modality/task where these types of spatial inductive biases will be useful, or at the very least, on a harder task in brain MRI such as tumor segmentation (See e.g. the BraTS challenge)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Why is a mamba backbone used? could the contextual modulation factor multiplied with the hidden state (eq 6) be formulated for other model types/backbones? Since its just computed using the \"symmetry checking\" mask, I think this could be integrated into different models' feature maps/representations (e.g. CNNs, transformers) etc. I'm curious how for CNNs especially this could help further make the model simpler and faster, which could help with the high computational cost (Table 7).\n2. How does this perform under domain shift/how does the simplicity of the inductive bias affect overfitting to the training domain, and generalization?

The paper emphasizes faster convergence, but this is not evident from Figure 1. Visually, Figure 4(a) suggests that some methods take longer to reach their best DICE value, yet no quantitative metric for convergence is provided. How is convergence defined? For example, if we define it as the number of epochs required to reach a 5% margin of error and remain there, how many epochs does each method take? The claim would be more accurate if phrased as “better performance faster.” However, unlike the abstract statement that PCMambaNet “achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1–5 epochs,” Table 1 shows that for the small dataset, for better performance 200 epochs are required. I suggest the authors drop the convergence claim and instead explicitly frame these two objectives—(1) faster training and improved performance with enough data, and (2) improved performance with small datasets—as clear contributions in the introduction.\n\n2. **On writing clarity and textual issues**- Some sentences in the manuscript appear unfinished, unpolished, or inconsistent, which reduces readability and can confuse the reader. Please see the Minor Comments section below for examples. \n\n3. **On generality of claims versus experiments**-The method relies on a symmetry-based prior, but it is not clear for which organs or imaging domains this prior is appropriate. All experiments are conducted on brain MRI datasets, which suggests that PCMambaNet may be specialized for the brain, and its applicability to other organs or medical imaging tasks remains uncertain.\n\n**Minor Comments**\n\n-Plots in figure 1 are hard to read; the fonts are small.\n \n-Figure 3’s qualitative results are unclear: it is difficult to tell which segmentation corresponds to which method, and the column-dataset correspondence is ambiguous. The caption refers to arrows, but rectangles are shown in the images. Improving figure readability and clarifying labels would make the qualitative evaluation more interpretable.\n\n-There is no explicit mention of the segmentation task early in the paper. Readers should know the exact task sooner, as it helps understand the method better.\n\n-Table 3 does not include baselines, requiring the reader to cross-reference Table 1 multiple times to compare results. Including baseline methods directly in Table 3 would improve clarity and make comparisons more immediate.\n\n-There is this seemingly unfinished sentence in section 3.2 \"Role of the CRN.\" Did this intend to be the heading of a new paragraph? It currently reads like an incomplete sentence and may confuse readers.\n\n-The sentence “First, relying s egraded accuracy and boundary quality, underscoring the need for a refinement stage” in Section 3.2 is unclear and appears incomplete. It should be rewritten for clarity.\n\n-I had to go to the appendix to figure out which dataset was considered easy versus hard and how many samples were in each. This is core information that helps readers interpret Table 1 and should be in the main text.\n\n -It would have been more informative if the “data efficiency” experiments compared performance at each subset percentage against a baseline trained with the same number of samples.

Could you clarify what type of pathology, if any, is present in each dataset? It is unclear whether the MRBrainS13 brains include any pathological cases, which raises the question of how well the model is expected to perform on datasets without pathology. More broadly, can this method be applied to segment other organs with pathology? If so, why were only brain datasets used in your experiments?\n\n**Q2.** In Figure 3 (left column), I don’t see much difference in the qualitative results across methods. Am I missing something? which one is the ground truth?\n\n**Q3.** In Section 3.2 (Ablation Study), you claim that “On the small-scale dataset, removing the PPM or replacing it with a random mask causes a significant drop in performance.” I don’t see this for the case of removing the PPM. The improvement appears quite marginal—for example, for WM, the DICE score changes from 0.7468 without PPM to 0.7517 with PPM. Am I looking at the wrong row?\n\n**Q4.** Also in Section 3.2, regarding “replacing our high-capacity CRN with a standard convolutional block results in a noticeable performance decline,” what I see from Table 2 is that for the small dataset the improvement is not significant. Interestingly, you see more improvement for the larger dataset. Why do you think that is? Also I am curios, how many parameters the \"CRN\" component add to the model compared to a simple convolutional block?\n\n**Q5.** Could you provide a brief description of the dataset preprocessing steps? According to Section A4, MRBrainS13 contains only 20 subjects—how many training and test samples does this correspond to? Additionally, what image resolution is used as input to the network?\n\n**Q6.** Regarding the Dice score reported in the text (“our model reaches a Dice score of 93.11%”): from the numbers in Table 3, this seems to correspond to GM. However, when comparing with U-Net, the reported Dice value is 93.32%, which from Table 1 appears to be the DICE value for WM. Could you clarify which class each reported number corresponds to?\n\n**Q7.** In Section 3.4, I’m not entirely sure what the main argument is.
