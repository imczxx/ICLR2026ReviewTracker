Yet they remain brittle in long-horizon tasks that require extended sequences of interactions, where performance often deteriorates rapidly. Existing benchmarks provide only partial coverage of this challenge: manual or crowdsourced tasks are too short, tool-use benchmarks emphasize breadth over depth, and web-based evaluations rely on emergent rather than controllable complexity. To fill this gap, we introduce TaskWeaver, a rule-based, controllable platform for generating benchmark tasks with precisely adjustable difficulty and horizon length. At its core, TaskWeaver abstracts all tool use as file-read operations. This design choice removes superficial API complexities, allowing us to directly probe an agent’s core ability to reason and integrate intermediate results over long, dependent sequences. We instantiate the framework across three domains: document understanding and navigation, multi-modal information integration, and executable code analysis. Each domain probes a complementary aspect of agentic reasoning, and together they form a unified benchmark, LORE (Long-horizon Reasoning Evaluation). Empirical results show that even for the strongest models we tested, performance degrades significantly as task length and per-step complexity increase. Specifically, their accuracy approaches zero on tasks exceeding 120 steps, and on more challenging variants, performance collapses in fewer than 15 steps. These findings highlight long-horizon robustness as a central open challenge for future agent development.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["natural language model", "agent", "benchmark"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0323b4fd9860a536087092ecc3ec4322d6e8c6fc.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces TaskWeaver, a rule-based and controllable task generation framework designed to systematically evaluate the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of large language model (LLM) agents.\nBuilding upon this framework, the authors construct the LORE benchmark, which encompasses three subdomains: document understanding and navigation, multimodal information integration, and executable code analysis.\nTaskWeaver enables precise control over task length and difficulty through a formal dependency tree and a configurable operator set, allowing systematic investigation of model robustness in long sequential reasoning.\nExperimental results show that the performance of mainstream models, including the GPT series, declines sharply as task steps and complexity increase—accuracy approaches zero for tasks exceeding roughly one hundred steps.\nOverall, the work provides a promising framework and methodology for controllable evaluation of long-horizon reasoning in intelligent agents."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- The paper is generally well structured, with a clear methodological exposition that adequately describes the design principles of the benchmark generation framework and the experimental process.\n- The work targets a core problem in current agent research—evaluating long-horizon reasoning under controllable and scalable settings—which aligns well with recent research trends in agent benchmarking.\n- The proposed LORE benchmark covers multiple task types, including document understanding and navigation, multimodal information integration, and executable code analysis, demonstrating good diversity and representativeness in task design.\n- The framework exhibits strong theoretical generality, supporting various task structures and difficulty configurations, thereby laying a solid foundation for more systematic studies of long-horizon reasoning robustness in intelligent agents."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Questionable validity of the core assumption. The paper abstracts all tool calls as “file-read” operations. While this design makes task generation more controllable and formally analyzable, it also greatly simplifies the real-world complexity of API interactions, state changes, and error propagation. This abstraction departs from realistic multi-tool or industrial settings, potentially weakening the external validity of the evaluation. The authors should more clearly articulate the benefits and trade-offs of this abstraction, quantify the gap between this simplification and real-world scenarios, and explain why this gap does not materially affect their main conclusions.\n- Lack of systematic validation on framework stability and data reliability. The paper mainly presents successful examples of TaskWeaver’s task generation but does not discuss cases of potential failure or robustness limits. For instance, can the generation process produce unsolvable or non-unique tasks? How is the correctness and verifiability of generated data ensured? If abnormal or erroneous samples occur, is there an automated detection or filtering mechanism? These factors are critical to the benchmark’s trustworthiness and reproducibility.\n- Insufficient methodological description, affecting reproducibility.\n  - The predefined operator set is only briefly mentioned in individual domains and lacks a unified, fine-grained definition or illustrative examples. The paper does not explain how different operators control task complexity or compose hierarchical task structures.\n  - High reproducibility risk. Although some examples are provided in the appendix, they are not sufficient to fully reproduce the results. The framework’s parameters, task instances, and generation strategies are not systematically documented.\n  - Limited model coverage. The evaluation includes only four proprietary GPT models, with no open-source or reproducible baselines for comparison, making it difficult to assess the generality of the framework across architectures and scales.\n- Experimental analysis leaves multiple open questions.\n  - The cause of performance collapse with increasing task length is not fully analyzed—whether it stems from context-length overflow, memory degradation, or nonlinear reasoning-path expansion.\n  - The definition of “per-step complexity” is unclear. It seems to depend on operation count and difficulty but lacks a formal metric or clear growth pattern (linear vs. nonlinear).\n  - The attribution of performance degradation remains ambiguous. It is unclear whether declines arise from weakened long-term memory, limited reasoning ability, or the intrinsic design of the task structure.\n  - The representativeness and sufficiency of the three chosen subdomains need justification. Why only document, multimodal, and code? Do these domains adequately cover the key dimensions of long-horizon reasoning? Are they too few or redundant? A clear rationale or ablation would help.\n- Insufficient depth in related work comparison. Although the paper cites recent benchmarks such as AgentBoard and HiAgent, it lacks systematic comparison.

The framework intentionally removes \"superficial API complexities\" and avoids challenges like memorizing API syntax or handling heterogeneous interfaces. While this isolates the variable of reasoning length, it also means the benchmark fails to evaluate an agent's robustness to the messy, unpredictable, and error-prone nature of real-world tools and environments, which is a key part of the \"long-horizon\" challenge.\n\n2. The evaluation is exclusively limited to proprietary models, neglecting the open-source landscape. The experiments evaluate only \nfour powerful, proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-5, o1, and o3). This is a significant omission, as it provides no insight into how leading open-source models (like the Llama or Qwen families) or other closed-source models (like Claude or Gemini) perform on these long-horizon tasks. This limits the benchmark's utility and relevance for the broader research community that relies on and builds upon these models.\n\n3. The benchmark conflates task length with task complexity, as the individual steps remain simplistic. The \"file-read\" abstraction boils tasks down to solving dependency graphs. Even in the instantiated domains, the core operations are basic: arithmetic and string concatenation in \"Document Understanding\" , or simple call-tracing in \"Code Reasoning\". The \"LORE-Hard\" variants only add minor complexity (e.g., image distortion or race conditions ) rather than fundamentally complex reasoning. The benchmark primarily tests endurance at simple tasks, not the ability to perform complex reasoning over a long horizon.\n\n4. The \"file-read\" abstraction oversimplifies the task, turning it into a symbolic reasoning puzzle rather than a true test of agentic planning. By abstracting all tool use into a uniform \"file-read\" operation, the benchmark removes core agentic challenges like tool selection, handling API errors, or planning in an environment with side effects. The agent's task is not to decide what tool is appropriate, but simply to execute a predefined (though long) dependency tree. This makes it a strong test of working memory and state-tracking, but a weak test of the autonomous planning and decision-making capabilities implied by the term \"LLM agent.\"\n\n5. The benchmark's instantiated domains suffer from limited representativeness. While the paper instantiates three domains, their design remains limited in applicability . For example, the \"Executable Code Reasoning\" task appears to be primarily about tracing function call graphs and executing simple arithmetic operations. This feels more like a symbolic manipulation task rather than a genuine test of code analysis, which in the real world involves understanding complex logic, side effects, and the intent of the code.\n\n6. The framework's design places an overly strict reliance on exact-match symbolic File IDs. Based on the task examples, the agent's success hinges on its ability to generate and use precise file IDs. For instance, in the Document Understanding example, the agent must derive the exact ID v9%kLVvGzgVbD via string concatenation to use the read_document tool, and must perfectly calculate 186 to construct and read v4%186 . This reliance on exact symbolic matching makes the tasks more akin to \"symbolic computation\" rather than \"robust tool use,\" which in the real world often involves handling fuzzy matching, typos, or ambiguity."}, "questions": {"value": "1.The paper's experimental validation is limited to a narrow, proprietary set of models. The evaluation only includes \"four powerful, proprietary models\", namely GPT-4o, GPT-5, o1, and o3. This is a significant omission, as it provides no insight into how leading open-source or other closed-source model families perform on these long-horizon tasks, limiting the benchmark's utility and relevance for the broader research community.\n\n2.The \"Multi-modal Understanding\" domain seems to be a superficial addition rather than a test of deep integrated reasoning. The task still relies on the simple arithmetic/string-based dependency graph from the document domain. The only change is that some leaf nodes are replaced with images where the value must be counted (e.g., number of cyan circles) or read (e.g., a rendered formula). This doesn't test complex vision-language integration; it's a simple (Perception -> Value) lookup, which is then fed into the same text-based procedural task.\n\n3.The benchmark's core setup may be unfairly penalizing models for retrieval failures rather than reasoning failures. The \"file-read\" abstraction forces all intermediate results into a single, growing context history. The key failure mode, \"Degradation of Reasoning over Extended Contexts\" , describes an agent failing at simple arithmetic (c = a + b) when the values are scattered across a long and noisy context history. This seems less like a reasoning collapse and more like a retrieval failure that is an artificial product of the benchmark's design, which a real agent would mitigate using external memory or a structured scratchpad."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "7ezcwB47hg", "forum": "dAn82lpLx4", "replyto": "dAn82lpLx4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13939/Reviewer_tjCe"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13939/Reviewer_tjCe"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13939/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761653762207, "cdate": 1761653762207, "tmdate": 1762924441682, "mdate": 1762924441682, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces TaskWeaver, a controllable generation framework that turns every tool call into a standardized file read and uses formal operators to grow dependency trees, letting the authors synthesize arbitrarily long, verifiable tasks.
