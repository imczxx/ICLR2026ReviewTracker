Recent advancements have enhanced their storage capacity, retrieval speed, and error rates. However, the fundamental limits of their computational expressiveness remain unexplored. Understanding the expressive power of MHNs is crucial for optimizing their integration into deep learning architectures. In this work, we establish rigorous theoretical bounds on the computational capabilities of MHNs using circuit complexity theory. Our key contribution is that we show that MHNs are $\\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\\mathsf{TC}^0$. Hence, unless $\\mathsf{TC}^0 = \\mathsf{NC}^1$, a $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision modern Hopfield networks with a constant number of layers and $O(n)$ hidden dimension cannot solve $\\mathsf{NC}^1$-hard problems such as the undirected graph connectivity problem and the tree isomorphism problem. We also extended our results to Kernelized Hopfield Networks. These results demonstrate the limitation in the expressive power of the modern Hopfield networks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Circuit Complexity", "Modern Hopfield Networks", "Theory"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1bb7f4fc895bb0630bc3c4abfa84c8e622f35c32.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The submission studies the circuit complexity of two varieties of Hopfield Networks, specifically MHNs and KHNs.

What makes these results notable and of interest from a foundational perspective? There is no discussion whatsoever about the ideas employed to obtain the results. Based on the proofs in the paper and in the appendix, it seemed to me that all the individual proofs follow standard arguments and are neither challenging nor yield truly novel or surprising insights. To me, this forms the main weakness of the submission: without a careful and understandable discussion of the contributions, I find it very difficult to recommend acceptance.\n\nMinor weaknesses / suggestions for improvement:\n\n-The statements in the second paragraph (\"Understanding modern Hopfield networks’ computational capabilities and limitations is critical for their effective application. ...\") are too strong, especially since they are not substantiated by any reference. I agree that exploring their expressiveness is a worthwhile and interesting research direction, but the tone of the 2nd paragraph should be toned down.\n\n-A broader introduction is necessary before one can list the main contributions on page 2. Currently, there is a leap between the high-level text earlier and the sudden appearance of unexplained terms such as \"precision\", \"hidden dimension\", \"depth\", \"layers\" and \"kernelized HNs\" (which are different from MHNs but are not mentioned at all until suddenly appearing in the main contributions). Given the breadth of ICLR, one cannot assume that readers are familiar with Hopfield networks - the natural way to address this would have been to include one paragraph with a high-level, quick overview of what a (M)HN actually is. This high-level overview would then also make it easier for readers to digest the technical introduction of HNs in Subsections 3.3 and 3.4. \n\nAs a related point to the above, the pointer to Appendix A on page 2 should also mention that this appendix also discusses other works on circuit complexity and expressivity, and provides a brief introduction to AC0 and NC1. I feel that this part of the related work is in fact important and should appear in Section 2 (instead of the general related work on HNs or some of the proofs later on).\n\n-The phrasing of the sentences summarizing the two main contributions on page 2 is a bit off and should be revised. For instance, the first sentence has the structure \"... any ... networks ... is...\", which mixes plural and singular. In the second sentence, there's an additional issue regarding the quantification of \"a ... networks\" - it should be \"any\"."}, "questions": {"value": "in spite of the many references for the claim that MHNs can replace conventional layers, the references are almost all non-peer-reviewed sources (e.g., arxiv papers).

Moreover, if MHNs were introduced only in 2021, how come the references claiming that MHNs can replace conventional layers all appeared significantly earlier than in 2021? And do similar claims also carry over to the KHNs studied in the submission?\n\nNaturally, the authors may also comment on the listed weaknesses if they wish to do so."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "xm6Iyjd9Xx", "forum": "P0rW0xr3mT", "replyto": "P0rW0xr3mT", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2831/Reviewer_cE2B"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2831/Reviewer_cE2B"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2831/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761050729175, "cdate": 1761050729175, "tmdate": 1762916395837, "mdate": 1762916395837, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this article, the authors present new results about the computational complexity of Modern Hopfield Networks.\n\nThe main contributions are:\n\n- a positive result, showing that those Modern Hopfield Networks (including their Kernelized variant) are in a special family of circuits, called the DLOGTIME-uniform TC$^{0}$.

With bounded depth it just doesn't seem that surprising that an MHN, or indeed any bounded depth network, would be $TC^0$?\n\nMore in-depth version: the main drawback of the paper I think is its novelty / contribution. The paper by Chiang seems to be the source of results stating that certain primitives of networks are $TC^0$. With these established it seems straight forward that any finite composition of these primitives would be $TC^0$. As a result, the key results mostly feel like corollaries of prior work. Moreover, if this is the basic idea then why the focus just on MHNs? The proof technique doesn't seem to use anything that specific really concerning MHNs, therefore I think this focus may be obscuring the point. Once network primitives (e.g., matrix multiplication, ReLU, Softmax) are established as $TC^0$, then (roughly speaking)   would expect any bounded depth network should also be $TC^0$. What am I missing? In short, the bounded depth does a lot of the heavy lifting it seems to me here."}, "questions": {"value": "- What would you highlight as the key technical innovations you bring over the Chiang paper?\n\n- Why not just state your results for any model which consists of a constant depth network of $TC^0$ primitives?\n\n- Clarity around DLOGTIME and where it applies, i.e., training versus inference. DLOGTIME-uniformity means that there exists a single deterministic algorithm which, given the input size n, can construct or describe the wiring and gate types of the circuit in O(log n) time. If a class of networks is said to be DLOGTIME-uniform, this implies that for every network size n, there is a uniform, efficiently computable procedure that produces the threshold circuit implementing it. The parameters of the network though are typically the outcome of a data-dependent optimization or training process. Therefore, before seeing any particular trained MHN, we would have to possess a single log-time algorithm capable of generating the corresponding threshold circuit, including all its weight constants, for any possible trained network. This confuses me a bit, the learned parameters could depend arbitrarily on data for instance, how are they produced by a fixed DLOGTIME procedure? Is it then that while evaluating a fixed MHN might be DLOGTIME-uniform, simulating training / a trained network from data is not?\n\n- Do you need to also assume that your input data is bounded?\n\n- Are your results just for linear kernels?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "Not applicable."}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "KARyet9TMG", "forum": "P0rW0xr3mT", "replyto": "P0rW0xr3mT", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2831/Reviewer_a77z"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2831/Reviewer_a77z"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2831/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761924028164, "cdate": 1761924028164, "tmdate": 1762916393196, "mdate": 1762916393196, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
