To mitigate these limitations, we introduce two complementary models: DGSM-SCAM-GAT and MMT-ViT. The DGSM-SCAM-GAT model integrates dynamic gating, contextual aggregation mechanisms, and graph attention networks (GAT) to enhance temporal and structural modeling of API call sequences. Trained on a dynamic API call sequence dataset, it attains an accuracy of 99.31\\% and an F1-score of 99.64\\%, surpassing CNN-LSTM (accuracy: 98.92\\%). The MMT-ViT model employs multi-modal attention mechanisms and the pre-trained ViT architecture to effectively fuse features from assembly instruction sequences, binary grayscale images, and binary wavelet sequence features. Evaluated on a public dataset, it achieves 99.54\\% accuracy and 99.55\\% F1-score, outperforming Malcse (accuracy: 98.94\\%).

The comparison with the state of the art is confused and not very well referenced.

Also, authors should comment more on the performance drop that arises from removing components of the architectures.\n\nIn general, I would recommend reconsidering the overall structure of the paper: \n-\tExtend the state of the art and clarify your objectives: why is a new architecture needed to perform malware detection and classification? What are the open problems in these fields? \n-\tBetter describe the dataset used, stating that you renamed it “big2015” dataset in the paper. Moreover, the paper should better describe how the detection task is performed, since the referenced dataset is a malware classification one.\n-\tReport the standard deviation of each metric, especially when claiming a small improvement in accuracy with respect to the other works.\n-\tAdd statements in a Limitation section on why the adversarial robustness of the DGSM-SCAM-GAT architecture was not tested, for instance, by stating if such attacks exist or not, if they are implemented or not.\n-\tImprove captions of tables and images for a better understanding.\n-\tImprove the readability of the paper.
