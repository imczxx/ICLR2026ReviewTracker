While flow matching offers a natural framework for this task, its use has thus far primarily focused on the noise-to-data setting, while its application in the general distribution-to-distribution setting is underexplored. We find that in the latter case, where the source is also a data distribution to be learned from limited samples, standard flow matching fails due to sparse supervision. To address this, we propose a simple and computationally efficient method that injects stochasticity into the training process by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants. On five diverse imaging tasks spanning biology, radiology, and astronomy, our method significantly improves generation quality, outperforming existing baselines by an average of 9 FID points. Our approach also reduces the transport cost between input and generated samples to better highlight the true effect of the transformation, making flow matching a more practical tool for simulating the diverse distribution transformations that arise in science.", "tldr": "we identify that flow matching in the distribution-to-distribution setting is sparsity-challenged and address this with stochastic injections", "keywords": ["flow matching", "generative modeling", "AI for science", "distribution learning", "image translation"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/996cb227dedafcb94716d3a068c1b0bfe72cc7af.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a simple and computationally efficient three-stage method that injects stochasticity into the training process by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants. \nExtensive experiment is performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.\tThe proposed method is practical in real world with sparse supervision. \n\n2.\tThe method is intuitionally by the demonstration of toy experiments."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.

Thus it is not surprising that it improves upon the basic flow matching method.  Also the motivation of the paper is to deal with generative ability from few examples, however this aspect is not explored how the proposed model deal with the scarce of data, not even empirical study how the model improves for different level of data.\n\n2.The experimental comparisons in the paper is not very convincing. Not only some recent flow matching models such as CFM, Rectified are not included, and the image quality criteria with FID is not sufficient  for real image translation applications  The effectiveness of image translation method should be evaluated  either with image quality assessment (PSNR, SSIM) or with downstream task performance.   The paper also lacks runtime analysis, leaving uncertainty about the method’s efficiency in practice.\n\n3. Overall the paper is poorly written with many flaws.
