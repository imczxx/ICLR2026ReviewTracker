However, existing data-driven machine learning methods struggle to provide accurate medium-range meteorological predictions. As a result, precipitation forecasts regressed from these predictions are less accurate, making reliable medium-range precipitation forecasting difficult. The root causes of these issues are error accumulation in meteorological variable forecasts and a lack of effective variable interaction in the precipitation regression module. In this paper, we propose ResCast, a novel approach to global medium-range precipitation forecasting by combining meteorological residual diffusion modeling and precipitation regression.\nThe diffusion component consists of (i) the Details Network (DetNet), which captures global features, and (ii) the Multi-Attention U-Net (AttUnet), which generates residuals for meteorological variables to reduce prediction bias. Then, a precipitation regression module quantifies the influence of residual-enhanced meteorological variables on precipitation, improving forecast accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the ERA5, an established dataset from the ECMWF, using comprehensive metrics and compare global medium-range precipitation forecasts against four state-of-the-art baselines (such as ENS, GraphCast, etc.). The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.

A core motivation is tackling error accumulation, yet the mechanism by which the residual diffusion component mitigates this remains underdeveloped. The authors should provide a deeper analysis, perhaps by visualizing residual trends or quantifying the suppression of error growth in key variables (e.g., temperature, humidity), as the current explanation is relatively superficial.\n\n2. **Unclear Physical Significance of the Conservation Law Loss.** The physical significance of the proposed Conservation Law Loss ($L_{conservation}$) is not sufficiently clear. Although Appendix C.3 provides a theoretical derivation, its **connection to the practical impact** observed during training (e.g., the Energy Ratio in Figure 7) needs to be more explicitly established.\n\n3. **Weak theoretical grounding for the integration of residual and base predictions.**  \n  The paper does not sufficiently address a fundamental question: if the base predictor (e.g., ViT) were highly accurate, would residual correction still be necessary or beneficial? As illustrated in Figure 3, the proposed pipeline involves a multi-stage refinement process. However, it remains unclear whether **errors or biases introduced at intermediate stages** could propagate and potentially degrade the final prediction—especially if the residual model itself learns to compensate for systematic flaws in the base model rather than genuine physical residuals.\n\n4. **Vague Definition of \"Global Trend Knowledge\".** The concept of \"global trend knowledge,\" which DetNet is purported to capture, is **vaguely defined** and lacks a precise formulation.\n\n5. **Insufficient Ablation Studies.** The ablation studies are not comprehensive enough to isolate the contributions of key components. The analysis is limited to DetNet and the Conservation Law Loss, while the **contribution of AttUnet is not analyzed at all**. Critically, the paper lacks a direct comparison against a baseline *without* the residual mechanism (e.g., only the ViT backbone) for both the base variables and the final precipitation forecast. This omission makes it difficult to clearly ascertain the **independent contribution** of the residual diffusion component."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Given that ResCast is a multi-stage model with potentially high training overhead, could the authors provide further clarification on the computational cost (e.g., GPU-hours, memory usage) and how it compares to baseline models like GenCast?\n\n3. The paper claims that ResCast addresses two key limitations: error accumulation in meteorological variable forecasts and insufficient variable interaction in the precipitation regression module.

The precipitation evaluation using ERA5 shown here should really be seen as a placeholder for more accurate precipitation data.
