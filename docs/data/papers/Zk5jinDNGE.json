Finally, experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["stochastic zeroth-order optimization", "quadratic regularity", "skewed Hessian spectra"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/52980119f394614b44d04c02b15fdd4d2315ed1f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies the zero-order SGD with gaussian gradient estimation.
