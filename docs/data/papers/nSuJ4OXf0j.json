This difficulty is amplified in more complex causal structures: where interactions involve colliders, mediators, and their hybrids, methods tailored for handling confounders may incur substantial errors, especially in the presence of latent factors. In this paper, we propose a novel causality discovery algorithm of Conditional Independence Test on Time-Lagged Backdoor Pathways ($\\textbf{CIT-TBP}$). This approach intelligently leverages backdoor pathways induced by time-lagged causation to indirectly infer causal relationships, effectively eliminating the influence of various forms of complex interactions. Furthermore, by incorporating causal information flow, our method significantly reduces the impact of latent variables. We theoretically prove the rationality and effectiveness of the algorithm and experimentally validate it on several synthetic and real datasets. The experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our CIT-TBP against state-of-the-art methods. Compared with contemporary optimization-based methods, our causal discovery framework does not involve any black-box optimization process, and thus the causality derived are more direct and have a wide range of potential applications.

The existence of latent variables is not formally acknowledged until Section 3.2.2, where information entropy is introduced as a tool for latent factor exclusion. Besides, the paper never formally defines the scope of the latent variable problem it claims to solve. Can latent variables be mediators? Can they have time-lagged effects? This lack of definition makes it impossible to evaluate the theoretical claims. \n2. The main text is based on a highly restrictive assumption that the system is a first-order Markov process and all causal lags are uniform and singular. It significantly limits the practical applicability of the proposed approach.\n3. The two main theorems are fundamentally based on the restrictive Assumption 2. For a heterogeneous lag scenario, the conditioning strategy of Theorem 1 is no longer sufficient to block all non-causal paths. Similarly, the paper provides no discussion or proof that Theorem 2's logic holds in a heterogeneous-lag setting. \n4. What is the definition of $C^{t_\\tau}_{X_i}$ in Theorem 1?\n5. The novelty and contribution are limited. Theorem 1 is directly based on the restrictive assumption. The use of transfer entropy is also a standard, well-known method. \n5.

Additionally, if there are multiple latent variables interacting (e.g., two latent variables respectively influencing $X_i$ and $X_j $), does the computational logic of $\\Delta CTE$ fail?

I would think that Markov assumption is usually about how child node is independent of grandparent nodes given grandparent. However, the Markov property in your paper is much stronger, such that it also imposes constraints on time lag. If my understanding is correct, this assumption prohibits multiple time lag values coexisting between two nodes. That is, if there is only one edge where X1 causes X2 with time lag of 3, then it is allowed by this assumption. However, if X1 causes X2 through two mechanisms, one with 1 time lag and the other with 3 time lags, then it will not be allowed. With such assumption, the fundamental finding of this paper in 3.1 seems rather trivial, as authors artificially eliminate complicated paths from the past nodes. Then if CIT-TBP is built on this very assumption, then it already has the prior knowledge that there can only be one possible time lag allowed, so it will only examine limited set of conditional independence relations compared to other constraint based method (say, PCMCI), and unsurprising it performs better because checking fewer relations reduce the possibility of type 1 and 2 errors. Therefore, it seems that the contribution of  Time-Lagged Backdoor Pathway is built upon this assumption. This assumption limits the scope of the application significantly and makes the originality rather trivial\n\n2.\tMy second concern is about utilizing entropies to detect latent variables. In Theorem 2, authors imply that if improvement of entropies is “significantly greater than zero”, then there is latent factor. However, it is unclear whether the authors can define a uniform condition of “significantly greater”, otherwise this contribution is just an intuition rather than applicable tool. Furthermore, what if in true underlying causal graph X1 can only explains a small portion of variation of X2, such that all unexplained part is purely caused by some extremely distributed white noises. In this case, the improvement in entropy may still be small but at the same time there is no latent variable. \n\n3.\tMy third concern is simulation setting. The choice of number 3/5,1/5 and choice of functional equation seems to be arbitrary. Also, the author doesn’t clearly explain what is “Error-Score”. Also, the author shows comprehensive comparison in Table 1 but not in other tables. \n\n4.\tMy fourth concern is with the writing. The paper heavily relies on Appendices, but a good paper should be self explanatory within the page limit of this conference. Especially in Section 3.2.2, I find no clear intuition or definition of conditional transfer entropy. Also, Section 3.2.3 seems to be abrupt and may be merged with Section 3.2.2, as it is just explanation of previous theorems."}, "questions": {"value": "1.\tFollowing my first concern, can you explain why you define Markov assumption in this way such that it limits the number of possible time lags. At least in PCMCI related papers, such assumptions are not there. I think your Assumption 2 artificially makes the confounder elimination process easier, such that your algorithm can exploit the fact that it only needs to check a fewer set of conditional independence relationships (say, only the nodes of previous time lags -\\tau, rather than all other nodes of further previous time lags of -2*\\tau). Do you think you can still show the advantages of your proposed methods without such condition of not allowing different time lag values? Also, do you think it is fair to compare this algorithm with other constraint methods given those other methods need to test further combinations of conditional independence relationships?\n\n2.\tFollowing my second concern, what is “significantly greater than zero” in your Theorem 2? Also, suppose in true causal graph, X2 only has one true parent X1, but the relation of X1 and X2 are weak (X1 can only explain a partial variation of X2 because X2 has an extremely distributed white noise), then will the entropy improvement be close to zero such that your algorithm thinks that there is latent variable?\n\n3.\tIn your simulation result Table 2 and 3, can you also show the performance of other baselines in Table 1 (say, the performance of GOLEM)? Also, in Table 1(b), Case1, LPCMCI+ seems to perform much better than your method (SHD = 1 vs SHD = 10), how to explain that?
