Understanding how platforms interact, when market equilibria exist, how outcomes are shaped by model-provider, platforms, and user behavior, and how social welfare is affected is critical for fostering beneficial market environment. In this paper, we formalize a three-layer *model-platfrom-user* market game and identify conditions for the existence of pure Nash equilibrium. Our analysis shows that market structure, whether platforms converge on similar models or differentiate by selecting distinct ones, depends not only on models’ global average performance but also on their localized attraction to user groups. We further examine welfare outcomes and show that expanding the model pool does not necessarily increase user welfare or market diversity. Finally, we design and evaluate best-response training schemes that allow model-provider to strategically introduce new models into competitive markets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Generative model competition", "Nash equilibrium", "Welfare analysis", "Best-response training"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/284fffd27ee12198d224a23af013fe3868fed3ff.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/cff83bd8becd9335729d6f43f8abe5385067b751.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies the game-theoretical formulation and its Nash equilibrium (NE) of the \"model-platform-user\" market exemplified by LLM applications.

The decomposition of platform utility into attraction and deviation components show when platforms converge on a single model versus when they diversify across different ones.\n\n3) Section 5 is also notably original, introducing a strategic perspective on model training.

Platforms Limited to a Single Model:\n\nThe modelling assumes that each platform selects one model provider. This does not reflect the papers motivation where platforms like Azure and Bedrock host multiple foundation models simultaneously. As a result, the framework cannot capture strategies such as model bundling, which are important for platform differentiation and for covering diverse user needs. This is not a major weakness, but it would be useful if the authors could discuss how multiple-model selection could be incorporated into the current framework.\n\n2. Inconclusive Welfare Insights (Section 4);\n\nThe findings in Section 4 are somewhat unclear. Figure 3 illustrates that adding a new model can reduce user welfare, highlighting the “paradox of competition.” At the same time, the authors provide sufficient conditions under which welfare increases. However, it is not clear how frequently these conditions are met in practice, and in the experiments (Section 6) user welfare appears to increase as more models are added. This makes it difficult to draw a consistent, general conclusion about the effect of competition on welfare."}, "questions": {"value": "- Please address the question raised in the weaknesses, particularly regarding platform model choice.

Here is some of my thoughts:\n1. The model seem to me is too stylistic. The hardmax user choice model is overly simplified, it would be more interesting to consider softmax or other alternative stochastic choice model and see if similar observation holds. If hardmax is a necessary simplification to derive theoretical results, I believe some discussion or simulations on alternative user behavior models will strengthen the paper. \n\n2. I do not see a main theoretical claim (there are lots of proposition, lemmas and corollaries, but no theorems). And those results seems to be straightforward and lacks insights. For example, \n - non-existence of PNE is standard as in my understanding these types of games can only be shown to have PNEs if it has a concave or potential structure. I would expect a deeper understanding like if the PNE does not exist, what would a typical best-response loop look like and how it reflects some phenomenon in reality. \n- Corollary 3.5 conveys a very intuitive message but if unfortunately it rely on a seemingly too restrictive set of assumption. I'm wondering how rare the situation happens when a model has a clear advantage over all other models for the majority user group, while performs similar to other models for all remaining user groups. \n- Lemma 4.2 does not contain any quantitative result. Isn't it trivial to simply saying the welfare at equilibrium can be less than the globally optimal welfare? It is just the definition of the price of Anarchy.\n3. The three-layer model does not seem to be tied to the nature of GenAI. The exact same model can be used to study the content creation market as well, if we view the model providers as content creator and candidate models as potential topics or genres of content creation strategies. That said, the proposed model is claimed to capture the market of genAI models but does not actually capture any nuance of the power of GenAI nor how it adds anything special to the market. I might have missed something, if so, I'd appreciate it if the author reemphasize how the competition model is uniquely relevant to genAI.  \n4. Section 5 provides little conceptual contribution. I'm not sure how practical the optimization procedure can be actually adopted by a GenAI model provider to determine the new market entry strategy, as it rely on transparent information of all the factors in the market. And one thing it fails to consider is the cost, which should be a very important factor for new players.\n5. Limitations in experiments. CIFAR-10 setting is somewhat toy-level and I believe results on language or multimodal models would better reflect generative model ecosystems. Results are lack of statistical significance as well, no error bar seen in figures. And also investigation on the sensitivity of results to various user distributions would be highly appreciated.\n\nMinor issues:\n1. typo in Definition 2.1 (Nash Equilibirum) -> Nash Equilibrium"}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to my questions raised in the weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Ej7urJZiY2", "forum": "T7c5LXuebY", "replyto": "T7c5LXuebY", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10090/Reviewer_vtm9"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10090/Reviewer_vtm9"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10090/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762121935845, "cdate": 1762121935845, "tmdate": 1762921474637, "mdate": 1762921474637, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
