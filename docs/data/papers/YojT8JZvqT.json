First, most architectures ingest FC via node-centric propagation or global attention, leaving higher-order edge interactions implicit. Second, evaluations are inconsistent across seeds, atlas choice, preprocessing, and hyperparameter budgets, which obscures true gains.\n\nWe propose a simple edge-image encoder that applies dual atrous spatial pyramid pooling to features and connectivity, coupled with a low-rank quadratic block that makes edge-edge effects explicit and efficient. Beyond design, we introduce a unified protocol with five fixed seeds, harmonized preprocessing, and multiple standard atlases, and we re-run recent GNN and transformer baselines under identical settings. Under this protocol, our model **EdgeQuad** attains the best mean performance on curated functional atlases for ABIDE and ADNI, while on unsupervised parcellations such as Ward and KMeans rankings are mixed, highlighting sensitivity to atlas construction. The quadratic block realizes localized degree-2 interactions with provable stability, explaining robustness. The model is lightweight and computationally efficient. To facilitate rigorous comparison, we release code, exact configs, and per-seed logs via an anonymous link.", "tldr": "dgeQuad encodes fMRI connectivity as an edge image: dual ASPP + low-rank quadratics capture multi-scale edge interactions.

The overall structure is difficult to follow. The Introduction reads like a method paper—emphasizing technical design and mathematical formulation—whereas the Experiments section reads more like a benchmark report with minimal methodological discussion. \n2. Doubtful experimental results. The reported AUC values are unusually higher than ACC across multiple datasets, which is atypical for balanced binary classification tasks. Normally, these metrics are relatively close, yet in this paper, the model with the highest AUC is often not the one with the highest ACC. This inconsistency raises concerns about the evaluation procedures and metric computation.\nFurthermore, compared to prior works using the same datasets—e.g., [1] and subsequent follow-ups [2, 3]—the reported PPMI 4-class accuracy is notably lower than the >60% achieved in those studies. The authors should investigate possible causes and clarify how their setup diverges from established benchmarks.\n3. Inconsistent performance advantage. The proposed EdgeQuad model does not consistently outperform baselines across datasets and atlases. Some competing models achieve similar or better results, calling into question whether the quadratic formulation provides a general performance advantage. \n4. Lack of interpretability analysis. A key shortcoming is the absence of ROI-level or network-level interpretation. Identifying discriminative brain regions or subnetworks is crucial for clinical translation. The paper should include visualization or attribution analyses to illustrate how EdgeQuad makes decisions and whether it highlights meaningful biomarkers related to the target conditions.\n5. Missing computational efficiency comparison. Since EdgeQuad is described as “lightweight,” a concise table summarizing parameter counts, FLOPs, and inference time compared with baselines is necessary to substantiate this claim. Quantitative evidence would make the efficiency argument more convincing.\n6.

However, although these settings may differ across papers, each study has performed experiments under a consistent configuration as in its own framework, allowing fair comparisons within that context. Therefore, the claim that existing results are neither reproducible nor comparable may be overstated. \n\nWeakness in Problem Definition 2) The current manuscript lacks a comprehensive discussion of related work, particularly regarding recent studies addressing similar problems or employing comparable methodologies. Specifically, the second existing limitation raised by the paper is Edge modeling, namely that recent studies mainly focus on node attributes and higher-order edge interactions are implicit. However, recent approaches [1,2,3] that rely solely on edge attributes have been actively studied, together with the analyses of their higher-order topological structures. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss how their formulation differs from or relates to the proposed edge-centric method and to provide experimental comparisons with these methods. Given the growing number of graph studies, I believe that the authors could find more edge-based methods with open source codes to strengthen the contribution of the proposed method.\n\n[1] Park et al., “Convolving Directed Graph Edges via Hodge Laplacian for Brain Network Analysis”, MICCAI 2023.\n\n[2] Fuchsgruber et al., “Graph Neural Networks for Edge Signals: Orientation Equivariance and Invariance”, ICLR 2025.\n\n[3] Lecha et al., “Higher-Order Topological Directionality and Directed Simplicial Neural Networks”, ICASSP 2025.\n\nWeakness in Presentation) In Fig. 1, it would be more intuitive to illustrate the conceptual mechanisms of each component rather than listing every model layer. Moreover, the formulations in the Method section are somewhat unclear; please refer to the related questions in Q2 and Q3.\n\nWeakness in Lack of Experiment 1) This paper asserts that the proposed method with a low-rank quadratic interaction can avoid deep message passing and thereby handle over-fitting and over-squashing issues caused by deep layer stacks in existing studies. However, there is no experimental evidence to support this claim, e.g., performance comparison with baselines across the number of model layers. \n\nWeakness in Lack of Experiment 2) Moreover, since the paper accentuates that the model is ‘lightweight’, comparisons on computational efficiency (e.g., number of trainable parameters and training time) would be expected but are not provided.\nMinor Weakness - Many notations (e.g., $\\mathbb{E}, f(\\cdot), h(\\cdot), H^{l}, W^{l}$) in preliminary section 2.2 is not explicitly defined, which makes it difficult for readers to fully understand the mathematical formulation without background knowledge on GNNs and Transformers.

In FC matrices, each element represents the connection between two brain regions, so adjacent elements do not necessarily correspond to anatomically or functionally adjacent areas. The ROI order is usually defined by the atlas and does not guarantee true spatial continuity in brain, which makes the assumption of locality in 2D convolution questionable.
