Existing approaches often exploit DDIM invertibility to watermark tabular diffusion models, but tabular diffusion models suffer from poor invertibility, leading to degraded performance. To overcome this limitation, we leverage the computational efficiency of tabular generative models and propose a multi-sample selection paradigm, where watermarks are embedded by generating multiple candidate samples and selecting one according to a specialized scoring function.\n    The key advantages of MUSE include (1) Model-agnostic: compatible with any tabular generative model that supports repeated sampling; (2) Flexible: offers flexible designs to navigate the trade-off between generation quality, detectability, and robustness; (3) Calibratable: theoretical analysis provides principled calibration of watermarking strength, ensuring minimal distortion to the original data distribution.\n    Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that MUSE substantially outperforms existing methods. Notably, it reduces the distortion rates by 84-88% for fidelity metrics compared with the best performing baselines, while achieving 1.0 TPR@0.1%FPR detection rate.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Watermark", "Tabular Generative Model"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a7f3136ee53bbb527d6a5bce394c94f42cc47e70.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ebdbfd70b975eaea1698a5fa2566c2ec71d841ee.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a tabular watermark method that assigns a pseudorandom score to each row of the table based on the hash of selected column values and a secret key.

It is unclear how to determine a predefined threshold for the detection. From Theorem 4.1, we can see the False Positive Rate control depends on the gap between  the expected score of an unwatermarked sample and the expected score of a watermarked sample obtained via repeated samples. However, in practice this gap is usually unknown since the unwatermarked sample is not necessary from the detector. Also, it does not make sense to consider the \"optimal distribution\" in Theorem 4.1 since this is in fact the best case. However in practice the unwatermarked table does not always have such nice property."}, "questions": {"value": "NA"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "NA"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "HXbsqKjuM4", "forum": "R1QuNKyVOw", "replyto": "R1QuNKyVOw", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12783/Reviewer_6Ns1"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12783/Reviewer_6Ns1"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12783/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761862737028, "cdate": 1761862737028, "tmdate": 1762923591322, "mdate": 1762923591322, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a novel approach to watermarking synthetic tabular data agnostic to the underlying generative model while maintaining high fidelity and robustness to attacks.
