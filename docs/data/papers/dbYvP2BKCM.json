This setting is challenging due to unobserved confounding, which can bias causal estimates. One approach to address this issue—in statistics, econometrics, and epidemiology—is to use instrumental variables (IVs) within two-stage regression frameworks. An IV is a variable that influences the treatment but has no direct effect on the outcome or influence from unobserved confounders. However, across many applications, suitable and valid IVs are difficult to find or may not be available at all. We propose a method for decomposing the observed variables to find a representation which satisfies the standard IV assumptions of relevance, exclusion restriction, and unconfoundedness. To implement this decomposition, we introduce a deep learning model, ZNet, with an architecture that mirrors the structural causal model of IVs and is compatible with a wide range of two-stage IV estimators. Our experiments demonstrate that ZNet can (i) recover ground-truth instruments when they exist and (ii) construct proxy latent instruments that reduce bias due to unobserved confounding when no explicit instruments are available. These results suggest that ZNet can be used as a plug-in module for causal effect estimation in general observational settings, regardless of whether the (untestable) assumption of unconfoundedness is satisfied.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["instrumental variable regression", "learning instruments", "unobserved confounding", "structural causal models"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/80dd8ef679e4e5b06b3dfc312b066aa4805cd889.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ZNet, a novel deep learning framework that addresses the critical challenge of unobserved confounding in causal effect estimation from observational data. Its primary contribution lies in automatically constructing valid instrumental variables (IVs) by decomposing observed variables into latent representations that satisfy core IV assumptions—relevance, exclusion restriction, and unconfoundedness. Unlike existing methods that require pre-specified candidate IVs, ZNet's architecture explicitly encodes the structural causal model of IVs, enabling it to function as a plug-in module for various two-stage IV estimators.

Several prior works have the explicit goal of generating valid IVs from observed covariates without pre-specified candidates, using variational and mutual information-based approaches. The architectural difference of ZNet—learning a decomposition based on an SCM—is a technical contribution but does not constitute a paradigm shift.  \n\nA more critical weakness is the exclusive reliance on semi-synthetic datasets for experimental validation.   While useful for controlled testing with known ground truth, this setup fails to demonstrate the method's applicability to real-world problems. Furthermore, the absence of an evaluation on a real-world dataset with no ground-truth effect (e.g., a standard observational causal inference benchmark) leaves the practical utility in doubt.

Similarly, exclusivity and relevance cannot be satisfied. Crucially, how does the author ensure that f(X) and g(X) capture the confounding factor C and the instrumental variable Z, respectively?
