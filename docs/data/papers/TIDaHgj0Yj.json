These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present Osiris, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. Osiris systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 64,200 circuit variations generated with Osiris, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)–based baseline method that exploits Osiris for analog design optimization.", "tldr": "Osiris is a scalable pipeline for generating analog IC datasets comprising circuit variations and performance metrics enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation.", "keywords": ["electronic design automation", "analog circuits", "reinforcement learning", "layout design", "parasitic-aware", "dataset generator"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2d99a495afa7efc472bcb23f031a54e1a2484760.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work presents a synthetic pipeline that can generate large volumes of analog circuit layouts.
