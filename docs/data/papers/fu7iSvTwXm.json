While hyperbolic embeddings offer a theoretically grounded approach to representing hierarchies in low-dimensional spaces, current methods often rely on specific geometric constructs as embedding candidates. This reliance limits their generalizability and makes it difficult to integrate with techniques that model semantic relationships beyond pure hierarchies, such as ontology embeddings. In this paper, we present RegD, a flexible Euclidean framework that supports the use of arbitrary geometric regions---such as boxes and balls---as embedding representations. Although RegD operates entirely in Euclidean space, we formally prove that it achieves hyperbolic-like expressiveness by incorporating a depth-based dissimilarity between regions, enabling it to emulate key properties of hyperbolic geometry, including exponential growth. Our empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets shows consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates RegD’s potential for broader applications such as the ontology embedding task that goes beyond hierarchy.

However, the theory all uses specific cases involving balls and boxes. To make a claim about arbitrary regions, the theory and proofs should be generalized to arbitrary regions.\n- It is claimed that \"only the relative order of the scores matters\" based on the F1 score and Hits@k relying solely on the ranking. However, in other hierarchy embedding papers (e.g., [1, 2]) distance-based metrics such as the distortion are often reported as well. I think this should either be included in the evaluation or its exclusion should be motivated.\n- The authors claim that their method and this framework are simpler then existing hyperbolic frameworks (lines 165-170 & lines 480-481). It is not completely clear to me why this is the case and I think it requires some more motivation. \n\nI also noticed that the results in Table 2 seem to be a combination of the results from Table 5, picking the best configuration for most experiments. This seems a bit dishonest to me. If you want to pick the best configuration depending on the experiment, then these values should be considered hyperparameters and included in the hyperparameter search instead of being presented as an ablation. \n\nLastly, I think the paper could benefit from a bit more proofreading. For example, $g(x) = k \\cdot x + b$ should probably be $g(x) = k \\cdot x$ in Proposition 2, given Definition 1.\n\nDespite these weaknesses I want to reiterate that I think the proposed method and the new perspective on hyperbolic geometry are interesting enough for the paper to be accepted.

Citation format errors: many of the citations should be in brackets.\n\n2. The authors motivated the choice of a Euclidean alternative to the traditional hyperbolic embedding by saying \"However, as shown in Table 1, hyperbolic methods often rely on specialized constructed objects as embedding candidates, limiting their generalizability to data that encodes richer semantics beyond hierarchy\" (Line 51-53). This is a very vague, descriptive motivation that may confuse readers -- does a specialized constructed object necessarily mean bad generalizability to non-hierarchy structures? Is there any theoretical support in literature for your motivation?\n\nYou may consider referring to this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16641?) -- the \"curvature\" of a subspace you need to sufficiently embed a certain size of hierarchy relies on the *capacity* of the subspace. There is trade-off between capacity and numerical stability -- that is, it is beneficial to use a subspace that has just adequate capacity. This can be a good support for your motivation -- your method effectively allows users to specify sub-exponential distance (i.e. between linear distance in Euclidean spaces and exponential distance in hyperbolic spaces) so that the capacity of subspaces match the sizes of hierarchical structures.\n\n3. As Sala et al. (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/sala18a.html) discusses, equipping a coordinate space with exponential distance metrics (e.g. Poincare ball model or Lorentz model) poses an upper limit of numerical stability -- the reflective boundary. Due to the finite digits of float numbers, the depth of the hierarchy that can be losslessly embedded is limited -- i.e., the practical expressiveness of hyperbolic spaces is not infinite as the theory permits. What is the limit of numerical stability of the proposed Euclidean space alternative? From how I understand it, there is trade-off between how fast the depth-dissimilarity increases and how deep a hierarchy the method can stably embed. What is the trade-off for your method?\n\n4.
