We introduce \\textbf{\\textit{Lang-Prune}}, a drop-in, language-aware extension to structured pruning that computes per-language importance on small calibration sets and aggregates it to protect units critical to any language. Evaluated on \\texttt{aya-expanse-8b} across nine languages and multiple sparsity levels, Lang-Prune consistently improves both average and worst-case performance. At 70\\% sparsity, it reduces average perplexity from 188.49 (original pruning method) to 70.85, surpassing the monolingual baseline (83.08) while lowering the worst-language error. Interpretability analyses reveal higher retention of language-specific capacity (81\\% vs 66\\%). Ablations demonstrate robustness across model types (e.g., \\texttt{Qwen3-8B}), improved post-training headroom, and strong transfer to out-of-distribution languages.

However, the rest of the methodology is directly inherited from LLM-Pruner, which limits the overall novelty of the work.\n\n* W2: Relatedly, the experiments are confined to LLM-Pruner. This raises the question of whether the proposed importance estimation is a general technique or if its benefits are specific to LLM-Pruner's structured pruning approach. It would be valuable to see its effectiveness when applied to other methods, such as unstructured pruning with Wanda.\n\n* W3: The method for aggregating importance scores is largely heuristic. While the use of the $\\max$ operator is intuitive, the paper lacks a theoretical analysis of the potential bias it might introduce. Following the visualization in Figure 1, the method effectively computes the max-envelope of the per-language importance curves. It remains unclear how well this envelope approximates a \"true\" multilingual importance distribution or how the resulting neuron rankings compare to a hypothetical ground truth.\n\n* W5: The size of the per-language calibration dataset seems to be a critical hyperparameter, as it directly influences the per-language importance estimation and, consequently, the aggregated scores. The paper would be strengthened by an ablation study on the impact of this dataset size.\n\n* W6: The evaluation relies heavily on perplexity. In contrast, prior work often emphasizes few-shot or zero-shot performance on a diverse set of question answering (QA) benchmarks. The inclusion of only HellaSwag for QA evaluation is limited; a more comprehensive assessment on other QA datasets would be more convincing.\n\n* W7: The experimental scale is somewhat limited. Whereas prior works like LLM-Pruner and SparseGPT validate their methods across various model families and sizes, this study is restricted to two models of the same size (8B).\n\n* W8: The description of Figure 1 (Lines 130-132) appears to contradict the visualization.

My current positive judgement assumes that these points can be addressed:\n\n1. LangPrune often even outperforms mono-lingual pruning. To me that seems the most surprising insight. However, there is one potential other explanation which is that for their monolingual experiments only 100 sequences are used for calibration, whereas LangPrune uses 9x100=900 sequences. Thus a potential explanation for LangPrune's improvement could simply be the larger calibration size. I would thus kindly as the authors to also produce monolingual runs with 900 calibraion examples for each sequence.\n\n2. I acknowledge that mode compression and pruning are very active research fields, which is probably sufficient to motivate this work. However, I think one should always put numbers in perspective and clearly state whether this method is practically useful yet. Therefore I want to see perplexity numbers on a **dense** smaller model. For example for the Qwen3 experiments we could confront the numbers with dense `Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B` and `Qwen/Qwen3-4B`. \nI would guess that those dense models are much better (given the similar parameter numbers) than the pruned 8B model. I can promise to not decrease my rating because of that, but I think in order to progress science we need to keep those inevitable baseline in mind. \n\n3. [less important to my assessment] The post training experiments of Figure 2 a) don't show any meaningful differences between LLM-Pruner and Lang-Prune IMO. They both seem to converge to a similar loss, meaning that the choice of pruned structures does not actually matter much when fine-tuning.

Thus, a neuron that is uniquely capable of addressing the needs of one language, is more likely to be pruned that a neuron that serves multiple languages.\n\nTo remedy this problem, the author propose to calculate importance of neurons for each language separately.\nSimilar to LLM-Pruner, importance is calculated for groups of inter-dependent neurons.\nThe authors refer to the lang-prune paper for the calculation of the importance metric, however it is not clear how exactly the calculation is done, since Lang-Prune mentions they use the \"activation attributable to each group\", while the LLM-Pruner paper uses loss gradients.\nImportance metrics are further rescaled with min-max normalization so as to make them comparable between languages.\nA critical difference with LLM-pruner and other techniques lies in the way that multi-lingual importance is defined as the *max* (not the average) of language-specific importance.\nThis ensures that a group that is critically important, even for a single language, is less likely to be pruned.\n\nExperimental results are shown for two base LLMs (Qwen3-8B and aya-expanse-8b) and exhibit superior results for Lang-Prune over LLM-Pruner.\n\nThe authors also show the results of applying (LoRA-based) post training to the prune model in order to recover the loss incurred by pruning.\nThey show the Lang-Prune enables mildly faster recovery, although the difference is not hugely significant.\n\nIn the last part of the paper, the authors evaluate the method on out-of-distribution languages, and show superior results against the LLM-Pruner baseline."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper is nicely written.\n\nThe proposed method is tested in multiple contexts (2 base language models)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "In equation (1), the \"activation attributable to $C_j$\", denoted as $f_{C_j}(x)$, is never defined.

It is therefore unclear how $f_{C_j}(x)$ is calculated. Since this is a major part of the method, this would need to be explained very carefully in the final version of the paper.\n\nThe advantage of Lang-Prune over LLM-Pruner after post-training is, though not negligible, hardly significant.\n\nThe authors should compare their work against other baselines; for example:\n* Multilingual Brain Surgeon (LREC 2024)\n* Pruning Multilingual Large Language Models for Multilingual Inference (EMNLP 2024)\n\nThere is little theoretical justification for the proposed method; to compensate for the relative lack of theoretical grounding, we would like to see more experimental studies.
