How should the step sizes be selected in practice? Have the authors conducted any sensitivity analysis to evaluate how the choice of step sizes affects the empirical performance and convergence?\n5.

Since this is the main contribution of the paper, and the algorithm itself is not very surprising, I am inclined to reject the paper in its current form.

Would it be possible to consider a stochastic variant of the algorithm, where each optimization step uses a new sample so that $T$ and $n$ are coupled? This might lead to a simpler and more interpretable result, since the trade-offs between optimization and generalization would coincide. It could also remove the “overfitting” behavior seen in Figure 2, where the error decreases and then rises as $T$ grows. This is not a major issue, but it could better bring other aspects such as the utility-privacy trade-off on the centerstage.  \n\n4. The motivation for the IVaR setup remains somewhat unclear. Can the authors give concrete examples of real situations where one can actually observe or construct the full dataset $(z, x, y)$ required for the two-stage regression?
