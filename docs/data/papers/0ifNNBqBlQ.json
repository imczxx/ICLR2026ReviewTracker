The Intro/Related Work sections emphasize general existing papers but do not properly situate against the above frequency modeling papers. Especially, I found the motivation in line 52-80 is largely overlap with Fredformer, a proper discussion and citation are needed. The paper itself claims most prior frequency models “process the spectrum as a whole,” but seems like several work explicitly departs from that. Overall, it is unclear what the actual new motivation of this paper is and what gap (or technical motivation) it is trying to fill beyond existing frequency modeling forecasting methods.\n\n**Related work is insufficient.**\nMost papers discussed in Related  Works section are in 2019–2023 with limited discussion of 2024–2025 frequency-oriented methods.\n\n**Necessity of Gini.**\nThe method hinges on Gini coefficient as the imbalance metric (plus a learned GAU). The paper does not compare against other standard measures (e.g., spectral normalization or band-energy ratios), nor does it provide theory showing Gini is uniquely suitable for forecasting or optimization stability. Ablation is mainly w/ w/o GAU and fixed splits/thresholds. More comparisons across multiple imbalance metrics is needed.\n\n**Model-agnostic framework.**\nArchitecturally, GiPFE is a pre/post decomposition with auxiliary heads and a residual path; this design is close in spirit to prior model-agnostic preprocessing/adaptation modules (e.g., RevIN/SAN/FAN). The paper compares with these three (Table 3/6), but the claim of being a general framework would be more convincing if (i) it robustly handled distribution shift (as RevIN/SAN aim to), (ii) it showed task-level generality beyond standard long-horizon forecasting, and (iii) it demonstrated compatibility with diverse frequency methods beyond simple addition to FITS. For me, GiPFE is better characterized as a plug-in feature extractor, not a full framework.\n\n**Benchmarks and analyses are not yet sufficient.**\n* ETT family: only ETTh1 is reported; standard practice evaluates ETTh1/ETTh2/ETTm1/ETTm2, or at least the four ETTh/ETTm variants for completeness and frequency diversity.  \n* variance/robustness: no std/error bars across runs; frequency-space methods are known to be sensitive to seeds and horizons.\n* compute efficiency:  I think the improvements are margin compared to running time. Seems like general iTransformer can win the game in the Traffic dataset, but there is double inference time w/ GiPFE in Table 2.\n\n\n**Minor** Several phrasing/style issues (e.g., “progres-” line breaks, small grammar nitpicks).\n\n-------------------\n- [1] Piao et al, Fredformer: Frequency Debiased Transformer for Time Series Forecasting, KDD 2024.\n- [2] Yi et al, FilterNet: Harnessing Frequency Filters for Time Series Forecasting, NeurIPS, 2024.\n- [3] Wang et al, FreDF: Learning to Forecast in the Frequency Domain, ICLR 2025."}, "questions": {"value": "please refer to the above weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "zQTyPmNFKl", "forum": "0ifNNBqBlQ", "replyto": "0ifNNBqBlQ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9246/Reviewer_gtry"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9246/Reviewer_gtry"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9246/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761753378340, "cdate": 1761753378340, "tmdate": 1762920901843, "mdate": 1762920901843, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces GiPFE, a model-agnostic framework designed to address spectral energy imbalance in time-series forecasting.

In the empirical evaluation of accuracy and efficiency, it is recommended to include a comparative analysis with the one-shot retention of high-energy frequency bands approach. As this method is widely adopted in existing models and GiPFE represents an advancement for the same task, a comprehensive comparison between the two is warranted.\n2. In efficiency experiments, the use of a computationally intensive model like PatchTST, which nearly doubles the inference time across most datasets, challenges its characterization as a lightweight approach. It is recommended to expand the efficiency comparison by including other competitive methods, rather than solely benchmarking against the original backbone model.\n3. Figure 5(b) demonstrates that increasing the number of extraction layers (d) does not monotonically improve forecasting performance, with noticeable degradation observed in certain configurations. This non-monotonic relationship may stem from potential over-decomposition of frequency components or accumulated prediction errors from multiple auxiliary heads. Furthermore, as the analysis currently relies on a single backbone model and dataset, we recommend expanding the experimental validation to include additional architectures and datasets to better assess the method's generalizability.\n4. The paper heuristically assigns high-energy components to lightweight MLP heads and low-energy residuals to the backbone model without empirical or theoretical validation of this design choice. The assignment of MLP heads to high-energy components is justified by the statement they \"tend to exhibit simple and clear trends\" (Sec. 4.1). However, high-energy components could represent complex periodic patterns or sudden spikes that are not easily captured by simple MLPs. Conversely, some low-energy components might be simple noise.\n5. The framework assumes high-energy components are inherently \"simple\" and low-energy components are \"complex,\" but this may not always hold in practice. There is no analysis that validates this energy-complexity correlation across different datasets.\n6. The sequential extraction process might create artificial boundaries in the frequency domain, potentially disrupting important inter-frequency relationships. Each stage isolates components based solely on energy thresholds (Eq. 6-7; Sec. 4.2), but adjacent frequency bins that are separated into different stages might have important phase relationships or joint patterns that are lost in this decomposition. The method doesn't preserve or model cross-component dependencies during prediction."}, "questions": {"value": "see weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "RLVBkIoYjp", "forum": "0ifNNBqBlQ", "replyto": "0ifNNBqBlQ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9246/Reviewer_sGQf"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9246/Reviewer_sGQf"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9246/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761961538903, "cdate": 1761961538903, "tmdate": 1762920900845, "mdate": 1762920900845, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
