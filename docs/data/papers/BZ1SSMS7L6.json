This problem is inherently challenging as it requires balancing three highly interconnected and competing objectives: satisfying safety constraints, maximizing rewards, and adhering to the behavior regularization imposed by the offline dataset. To tackle this trilogy challenge, we propose a novel framework, the Q-learning Penalized Transformer policy (QPT). Specifically, QPT adopts a sequence modeling paradigm, learning the action distribution conditioned on historical trajectories and target returns, thereby ensuring robust behavior regularization. Additionally, we incorporate Q-learning penalization into the training process to optimize the policy by maximizing the expected reward and minimizing the expected cost, guided by the learned Q-networks. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the advantages of our approach by aligning with optimal policies under mild assumptions. Experimental results across 38 tasks further validate the effectiveness of the QPT framework, demonstrating its ability to learn adaptive, safe, robust, and high-reward policies. Notably, QPT consistently outperforms strong safe offline RL baselines by a significant margin across all tasks. Furthermore, it retains zero-shot adaptation capabilities to varying constraint thresholds, making it particularly well-suited for real-world RL scenarios that operate under constraints.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["offline RL", "safe RL"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/45a37c20e7175173965cc89f370b05b325df5d41.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes QPT (Q-Learning Penalized Transformer), a safe offline RL method that integrates Q-learning with a Transformer-based policy to jointly optimize reward, cost, and behavior regularization.

The $Q$-functions are trained using the n-step Bellman equation. How does the proposed method handle the out-of-distribution (OOD) action issue, which is a well-known challenge in offline RL? Without explicit regularization or behavior constraints, it is unclear how stability is maintained when extrapolating beyond the dataset’s support.\n\n2. The data augmentation technique appears to be directly adopted from CDT. What is the motivation for reintroducing this component in Section 3.4 and performing an ablation study on it, given that its empirical benefits have already been established in the CDT paper?\n\n3. Regarding the main results and zero-shot adaptation to varying cost thresholds, several key baselines are missing, including TREBI (already cited in the references), CAPS [1], and CCAC [2]. TREBI leverages diffusion models for zero-shot generalization, while CAPS and CCAC are value-based methods that also achieve zero-shot generalization. The absence of these comparisons makes it difficult to fully assess the claimed effectiveness of the proposed approach, especially since CDT has already demonstrated that transformer-based policies conditioned on cost can achieve similar generalization.\n\n4. As shown in Table 2, the variant trained without $Q_c$​ still maintains safety performance. Does this imply that the primary factor contributing to safety satisfaction comes from the transformer-based policy architecture rather than the proposed cost-related $Q_c$ components?

Central claims\n\n1. The challenging problem in SORL requires balancing three highly interconnected and competing objectives: (1) constraint satisfaction, (2) reward maximization, and (3) OOD problem imposed by offline dataset. This is the indisputable consensus of all safe offline RL articles. \n2. This paper replaces the third problem to “behavior regularization”. Although behavior regularization is one of methods to mitigate OOD problem, it is not accurate representation here since other methods can also address the OOD problem, such as trajectory augmentation or generation (TREBI [1], OASIS [2]).\n   1. Further explanation are shown in **3. Reward work** part.\n\n3. Besides, the detailed claim of this paper is not clear (At least, it hasn't been clearly written). The above challenge is the largest and most general challenge for all Safe Offline RL algorithms. This challenge cannot reflect the specific contribution of QPT different from other methods. \n\n### 2. Method\n\nThis paper is an incremental paper of CDT (Section 3.2 and part of 3.4). This paper mixed **preliminary** and **methodology** section together to one **methodology** section. The contribution of this paper is limited after excluding the **preliminary** content:\n\n1. Section 3.1 should belong to **preliminary** section since it is problem setup rather than proposed by this paper. \n2. Section 3.2 also belongs to **preliminary** section, since it is a description of CDT without any improvement. \n3. Section 3.3 is the main contribution of this paper while the core idea is similar to ADT, which improve stitching ability by Q-network in Offline RL. \n4. Section 3.4 partially belongs to CDT and partially belongs to the contribution.\n   1. **What is your improvement on data augmentation compared with CDT.**\n   1. **Algorithm 2 in this paper seems to be totally same as the Algorithm 1 in CDT.**\n   1. **At least, the differences are not explained clearly**\n\nPlease move all parts of previous work to a independent **preliminary** section so that reviewer can clearly know your contribution.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. For Q-networks\n   1. In online setting, the n-step rewards/costs come from the current policy via sampling online to make sure all values are from the same policy. However, the n-step rewards/costs come from the policy to collect the dataset (behavior policy) rather than the current policy in this paper. How to explain this issue? Is there any influence? Why is 1-step not suitable in this paper?\n   2. CDT avoids the OOD action problem since it does not utilize any Bellman backup procedure. However, QPT trains the two Q-networks with Bellman backup procedure. How to address the corresponding OOD  problem since it is one of the challenging problem in central claims?\n\n### 3. Related work\n\n1. In offline RL, the major challenge is not distribution shift. RL is an optimization method. To be optimized, RL must shift the distribution from behavior policy to optimal policy. The reason why offline RL needs to constrain the target policy near the behavior policy is **to mitigate the OOD problem**. This problem happens during the bellman backup procedure when bootstrapping. The target Q function may wrongly estimate the state-action pairs not in the dataset. Please read the BCQ [3] paper (pioneering work in offline RL) carefully again to understand the main problem in Offline RL.\n   1. This paper claims that BCQ [3] paper proposes the major challenge of \"distribution shift between learned policy and the behavior policy\", which necessitates behavior regularization in line 53 page 1 and line 88 page 2.\n   2. However, the central claims of BCQ is to address the OOD-action problem since exploration is not allowed in offline setting.\n   3. The concept of \"distributional shift\" is the main concern in Offline to Online (O2O) RL rather than Offline RL [4].\n      1. The prior trained policy with offline data should be continually trained online.\n      2. Offline data and online data may have \"distributional shift\".\n\n2. The writing lacks logic. For example,\n   1. the last sentence in Offline RL has little relationship with the form writing. Why do you jump to it directly?\n   2. why do you mention model-based RL in Safe RL? Is it an important part in this paper or related to QPT? Model-based RL can be applied in any RL fields. \n   3. what is the meaning of \"zero constraint violation\"? It can be explained as \"Constrained problem\" ($C(\\tau)\\leq k$) or \"Persistantly Safe problem\" ($C(\\tau)=0$). This confusion is related to your experiment in the following.\n\n[1] Lin, Q., Tang, B., Wu, Z., Yu, C., Mao, S., Xie, Q., ... & Wang, D. (2023, July).

It is not to ask QPT to compare all other baselines. However, the baselines are mainly from 2019-2023.\n\n2. FISOR is published in 2024 but it focuses on a different problem.\n\nNewest and suitable baselines include:\n\n1. Methods adapted to various constraints without retraining\n   1.

The cost threshold is 1 in Table 1 and Figure 1 while Table 4 describes cost threshold as 10. Is there any problem?\n\n### 3. The constraint selection are not aligned with the problem. \n\n1. We hope the author to clarify the differences between \"Constrained Problem\" and \"Persistantly Safe (or Zero Cost) Problem\". \n2. This paper focuses on Constrained problem (in problem setup) while the main results focus on \"zero cost\", which set cost threshold to 1. \n3. This setting may follow FISOR's setting. However, FISOR focuses on \"zero cost problem\". \n4. To be focused on the constrained problem, most existing paper selects three thresholds (better in different ranges, such as 10, 20, 40) and test average performance.  \n\n### 4. Hyper parameter anaylsis\n\nThe hyper-parameters ($\\eta_1$ and $\\eta_2$) lacks general applicability in Figure 1. For example, $\\eta_1\\leq0.01$ is suitable for SwimmerVelocity but is not for HopperVelocity when $\\eta_2=0.01$.\n\n1. Does the results on Table 1 follow the same $\\eta_1$ and $\\eta_2$? \n2. Or is it specially finetuned for each task?\n3. Please list the value in Table 4 no matter what case.\n\n### 5. Ablation of different component\n\n1. The data augmentation is not the contribution of this paper. Why do you introduce it in Table 2?\n\n### 6. Ablation of zero-shot adaptation\n\nFor ablation of zero-shot adaptation, the cost range a little bit narrow (from 1 to 6). In the offline dataset, The cost ranges of Velocity task are from 0 to 200, 250, or even 300. The cost range utilized in the ablation is to narrow to reflect the adaptive ability to different costs without retraining.\n\n[5] Chemingui, Y., Deshwal, A., Wei, H., Fern, A., & Doppa, J.

In different RL fields, similar notations may represent a wide range of meanings. It is better to explain it before used in the paper.\n2. If some notations are from another paper, please also introduce the notations.\n\n### 2. Binary assumption\n\n1. Most rewards do not satisfy the binary rewards assumption.\n2. While the costs are binary in tested benchmarks, costs can also be continuous value.\n\n### 3. Analysis result\n1. This paper focus on Constrained MDP, where the costs only need to satisfy the constraint rather than minimization.\n   1. However, this paper only provides the probabilities of selecting actions with maximum reward or minimum cost.\n   2. The analysis on the probabilities of constraint satisfaction is not provided.\n\n\n2. In Eq (8), the loss function or the objective does not include any constraint satisfaction loss, but only focus on reward maximization and cost minimization.\n   1. If reward maximization and cost minimization are conflicting with each other, how to guarantee that QPT will first guarantee constraint satisfaction?\n3. The weight of reward maximization and cost minimization loss is controlled by $\\eta_1$ and $\\eta_2$, which are predefined. \n   1. Given the theoretical analysis, how to determine the suitable value before testing online since offline RL does not allowing any online finetuning.\n   2.
