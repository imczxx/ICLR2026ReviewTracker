While recent work has developed methods to identify these most influential sets, no formal theory exists to determine when their influence reflects genuine problems rather than natural sampling variation. We address this gap by developing a principled framework for assessing the statistical significance of most influential sets. Our theoretical results characterize the extreme value distributions of maximal influence and enable rigorous hypothesis tests for excessive influence, replacing current ad-hoc sensitivity checks. We demonstrate the practical value of our approach through applications across economics, biology, and machine learning benchmarks.", "tldr": "We provide theoretical foundations and procedures to test the impact of most infuential sets", "keywords": ["attribution", "robustness auditing", "causal inference", "fairness", "least squares", "extreme value"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f86dce98af051381d78f0e6583cf6afdee594174.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper develops a statistical framework to distinguish natural sampling variation from excessive influence in most influential subsets.
