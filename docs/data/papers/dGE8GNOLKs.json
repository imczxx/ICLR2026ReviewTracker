To address these challenges, we introduce OmegAMP, a framework designed for reliable AMP generation with increased controllability. Its diffusion-based generative model leverages a novel conditioning mechanism to achieve fine-grained control over desired physicochemical properties and to direct generation towards specific activity profiles, including species-specific effectiveness. This is further enhanced by a biologically informed encoding space that significantly improves overall generative performance. Complementing these generative capabilities, OmegAMP leverages a novel synthetic data augmentation strategy to train classifiers for AMP filtering, drastically reducing false positive rates and thereby increasing the likelihood of experimental success. Our in silico experiments demonstrate that OmegAMP delivers state-of-the-art performance across key stages of the AMP discovery pipeline, enabling us to achieve an unprecedented success rate in wet lab experiments. We tested 25 candidate peptides, 24 of them (96%) demonstrated antimicrobial activity, proving effective even against multi-drug resistant strains. Our findings underscore OmegAMP's potential to significantly advance computational frameworks in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.", "tldr": "OmegAMP improves AMP discovery by providing controlled, targeted generation enabled by versatile conditioning & bio-informed encoding.

Scoring generated samples with the authors’ own classifier inevitably introduces system-internal consistency bias (despite providing HydrAMP-MIC as a secondary scorer). It is recommended to include more external independent classifiers or larger-scale blinded experimental test sets to reduce evaluator–generator coupling.\n2. While “random/shuffled” negatives are reasonable, introducing only five point mutations does not necessarily render sequences inactive, leading to potential mislabeling. Although the paper uses a weighted loss to down-weight non-EV data, it is advisable to quantitatively report sensitivity of performance to mislabeling rates, or increase mutation strength/proportion as a control, to more robustly define non-AMPs.\n3. The generative model’s “large-scale general peptides” are derived from Peptipedia’s predicted label set (non-EV), which may be noisy. Although the authors acknowledge and distinguish this, they should more clearly quantify how such noise affects the generative distribution and controllability (e.g., a training ablation without that data).\n4. The “conditioning vector” for subset conditioning includes only global attributes (length, net charge, hydrophobicity, AMP tag), without explicitly encoding species/strain information or sequence motif/positional patterns. If species selectivity relies on finer sequence–structure features, aligning global distributions alone may be insufficient.\n5.
