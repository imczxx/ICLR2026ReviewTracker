However, existing methods are limited by the assumption of static environments. In practice, they often fail in everyday scenarios with dynamic objects and transient distractors that resulted in floating artifacts, geometric distortions, and view-dependent appearance errors in 3D reconstructed models.\nWe propose a robust surface reconstruction framework that leverages Gaussian models together with a heuristics-guided distractor masking strategy. Unlike prior methods that rely on MLP-based uncertainty modeling for distractor segmentation, our approach uses multi-view feature consistency to separate distractors from static content. This allows us to obtain precise distractor masks in the early stage of training. To further improve reconstruction, we introduce a pruning mechanism that evaluates the visibility of each Gaussian across views. Specifically, it resets the transmittance of unreliable points and thus suppresses floating artifacts to yield a more compact representation while preserving rendering quality. Finally, we design a multi-view consistency loss that enforces both structural and color coherence across views to improve the fidelity of Gaussian splats in distractor-heavy scenes.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art geometric accuracy and rendering fidelity while remaining robust in dynamic and cluttered environments. The code will be made publicly available on paper acceptance.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Gaussian Splatting"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/668c65ee1fc2b2850342c43475d650e39a741c07.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MVGSR, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework for 3D surface reconstruction that effectively handles dynamic objects and transient distractors in real-world scenes. The method’s core contributions are threefold: 1) Distractor Masking Strategy: A coarse 3DGS model is first trained, and DINOv2 features from reference and neighboring views are compared. Feature inconsistencies generate an initial distractor mask, which is refined using SAM. 2) MV-Prune Mechanism: A multi-view pruning strategy evaluates each Gaussian’s cumulative transmittance contribution across views to remove floating artifacts. 3) Photometric Consistency Loss: A multi-view NCC-based loss enforces structural and color consistency in non-distractor regions."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The paper contributes a new dataset specifically designed to evaluate the robustness of interference, which is valuable to the community.\n3. The paper is easy to understand."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. It has limited novelty. The photometric consistency loss derived from MVS has been adopted by many existing works. While the use of DINO feature consistency is interesting, similar concepts have already been explored in prior studies, which employ MVS network features instead of DINO features.\n2. The ablation results in Table 3 demonstrate a substantial improvement in geometric accuracy when $Mask_{sam}$ is added to $Mask_{mv}$. This suggests that SAM is not merely refining boundaries but is actually responsible for the primary segmentation. Consequently, the contribution of $Mask_{mv}$ appears to function mainly as a coarse prompt for SAM.\n3. SLS serves as a strong reconstruction baseline specifically designed for 3DGS. However, both the experimental results (e.g., PSNR values in Table 2) and the authors’ own statements show that MVGSR often underperforms SLS in key rendering quality metrics. Although the method achieves better geometric accuracy, it performs worse in rendering. This trade-off is insufficiently discussed, and the authors fail to justify why such a compromise is acceptable or beneficial.\n4. Why are surface reconstruction results on the Tanks & Temples dataset not presented? Showing results only on DTU is insufficient for current surface reconstruction research, as DTU is considered too simple to fully demonstrate a method’s effectiveness.\n5. In summary, this paper appears to pursue innovation for its own sake. It combines relatively simple techniques while presenting them as a solution to a new problem, yet it contributes little genuine originality."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Regarding the role of SAM: The ablation results in Table 3 show that SAM yields a substantial improvement in CD, strongly indicating that it does more than merely refine boundaries. Could you provide a quantitative evaluation of $Mask_{mv}$ (before applying SAM), such as its IoU with the ground-truth distractor mask? Is it possible that the DINO feature comparison primarily serves to generate noisy cues for SAM, which is in fact performing the actual segmentation?\n2. It claims that MV-Prune outperforms the standard 3DGS pruning strategy. However, standard 3DGS also performs pruning based on opacity. Could you provide a more direct ablation study comparing your MV-Prune with the standard 3DGS pruning method, while keeping all other factors (mask and loss) identical?\n3. The masking strategy is based on comparing the real image $I_r$ with an image $I_n$ rendered from a coarse model trained on noisy data. Could you elaborate on why this comparison is valid? If the 7k-iteration model is already heavily corrupted by noise, making $I_n$ an inaccurate representation of the static scene, wouldn’t the feature distance $Distance(p_r, p_n)$ become unreliable?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "e2u5zi7Gv3", "forum": "Q3LPPs4XOZ", "replyto": "Q3LPPs4XOZ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7377/Reviewer_jLVC"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7377/Reviewer_jLVC"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7377/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761772785937, "cdate": 1761772785937, "tmdate": 1762919506293, "mdate": 1762919506293, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "MVGSR targets robust surface reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting in scenes containing dynamic or transient distractors.
