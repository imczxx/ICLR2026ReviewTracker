Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant attention in education due to their extensive knowledge base and reasoning capabilities, they still face challenges in personalized education, where the generation of correct, but one-size-fits-all responses fails to adapt to individual students’ cognitive states, limiting their ability to support further heuristic learning.\nTo address these challenges, we propose an adaptive tutoring framework consisting of two stages, integrating collaborative cognitive diagnosis with dynamic instructional adaptation.\nThe first stage aims to model the student’s cognitive state through collaborative cognitive diagnosis. The teacher utilizes a successor-first method to efficiently generate diagnostic questions, ensuring their accuracy through an expert-assistant-verifier pipeline. In the second stage, based on the estimated cognitive state, the teacher uses slow-thinking-based methods to select teaching strategies from a strategy pool to guide the student in solving problems. \nTeachers continuously monitor students' responses to provide feedback and track cognitive changes to ensure the most suitable strategies are used for effective tutoring.\nEvaluations on the Gaokao dataset demonstrate significant improvements in critical thinking stimulation (+18.7\\%) and task completion rates (+22.4\\%) compared to baseline models.", "tldr": "A novel adaptive tutoring framework that combines collaborative cognitive diagnosis with dynamic instructional adaptation to personalize education.", "keywords": ["dialogue state tracking", "task-oriented", "applications"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/34ea0266bc7765c54d8e8e90d78f03cbfb0f4697.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a703b9d3e51994badb2002832364353600795edc.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work presents an adaptive tutoring framework consisting of two stages, integrating collaborative cognitive diagnosis with dynamic instructional adaptation.

It is unclear what the unique strength of this proposed model is and why it should be, compared with prior models. The introduction and related work sections briefly stated that prior work can not do something, but the detailed research gap and how this work addressed such gap are unclear.\n\n2. The current framework is meaningful, but there is no fundamental breakthrough or unique insights in algorithms or model side. It is more like a manually crafted application system in education with prompt-engineering.\n\n3. Dataset Scale. There is only one dataset with only 184 questions. \n\n4. The main experiment used simulated students for evaluation, which does not seem to be convincing. It is also unclear how many simulated students were generated, the differences among the simulated students, and rationales for such design. Without such details about student settings in the experiment, it is hard to evaluate the rigor and effectiveness of this work.\n\n5. Lack of statistical tests (such as t tests) for most tables to show the significance.\n\n6. Main Experiment: The experimental measurements may not really support the claimed contribution in line 107: \"stimulating critical thinking\". Which metrics measure how the tutoring system improves the critical thinking of students in either simulation or real student study?\n\n7. Real Student Experiment: \n\nThe real student experiment is unclear and does not look like a formal study. Is it a between-subject design or within-subject design or a mixed study design? \n\nFor this statement: \"one of six tutoring methods is randomly selected (with equal probability) to tutor the student\", does it mean that each student only receives one tutoring method (between-subject design) or each student receives different tutoring method for different questions? If so, how do you control so many human factors like different students in different questions with different tutoring methods? If one question is delivered to different students in different tutoring methods, how do you know the result difference is due to student subject difference or due to the tutoring method difference? \n\nParticipant scale and limited samples: So many human factors usually need larger-scale user study rather than N = 67. The authors can report the power via power analysis to show the statistical significance with the current participant number. Moreover, for this statement \"The student who selected the most questions chose 12, while the student who selected the\nfewest chose 2\", does it mean that each student only tested 12 questions at most? This limited sample size is probably not convincing to show its effectiveness.\n\n\nStudy design and metrics: Another concern is that the current study design and metrics may not really support the claim of enhancing tutoring performance. Most metrics are subjective (e.g., Appropriateness, Sentiment, Inspiration) and do not provide a very objective measurement. The success rate may be better quantified and more convincing, but Pelican's success rate (87%) is lower than simple step-wise methods (87.3%).\n\n\nMinor Issues:\n\nThere are some typos."}, "questions": {"value": "Please check my concerns and questions in Weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "8GTNfCYoK8", "forum": "NIvqiJ8R4J", "replyto": "NIvqiJ8R4J", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11211/Reviewer_eUTL"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11211/Reviewer_eUTL"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11211/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761590177947, "cdate": 1761590177947, "tmdate": 1762922360295, "mdate": 1762922360295, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an adaptive tutoring framework called PELICAN, which is designed to address the limitations of existing LLMs in personalized education.
