This is mainly due to the difficulty of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, a limitation prevalent in the languages spoken across the African continent and other regions. Current approaches, such as automated translation and synthetic data generation, frequently yield outputs that lack fluency or even orthographic consistency. In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on  retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer. Drawing inspiration from benchmarks such as MMLU in task definition, InstructLR has facilitated the creation of three multi-domain instruction benchmarks: **ZarmaInstruct-50k**, **BambaraInstruct-50k**, and **FulfuldeInstruct-50k**.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["InstructLR", "Benchmarks", "low-resource languages", "instruction datasets", "RAG", "human-in-the-loop"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3b3029cabef4913b9deaab7e5bdc5b3a17dbbcce.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a pipeline to create instruction following samples in low-resource languages.
