Such information would be valuable for subsequent research to better understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.\n2. The paper does not report the API or inference costs associated with each method. As neuro-symbolic approaches often introduce additional inference and interaction steps when addressing GPS problems, it is important to assess whether these extra costs are justified by the observed performance improvements. Additionally, it would be worthwhile to investigate whether simpler techniques, such as self-consistency, could achieve similar performance gains within comparable evaluation budgets.\n3. The discussion of related work could be expanded. In particular, the paper should cite and analyze earlier neuro-symbolic methods for mathematical reasoning problems, such as [1], [2], [3], and [4].

First, in MPF, the text parser $M_t$ should properly cite InterGPS (Line 214). Second, in Line 274, the authors state that \"solving algebraic relations remains out of its scope\". However, in my understanding, AlphaGeometry adopts a DD + AR symbolic reasoning engine, where AR stands for algebraic reasoning. Therefore, the DSR module appears highly similar to the DD + AR reasoning engine of AlphaGeometry, as well as to the hypergraph expansion component. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify the unique innovations of AutoGPS.\n2. Since MPF heavily relies on the diagram parser (PGDPNet), which is trained solely on PGDP and Geometry3K-style data, it may struggle to seamlessly generalize to other styles of geometric diagrams. This limitation further constrains the scalability of AutoGPS.\n3. The compared methods are limited. The authors should include comparisons with more recent neuro-symbolic approaches, such as FGeo-HyperGNet [1].\n\n[1] FGeo-HyperGNet: Geometric Problem Solving Integrating FormalGeo Symbolic System and Hypergraph Neural Network"}, "questions": {"value": "Besides the weakness above, I wonder what the average time cost of AutoGPS is for solving a geometry problem compared to other baselines."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "QIXbludNf4", "forum": "PVtZnUh04m", "replyto": "PVtZnUh04m", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16384/Reviewer_U8MK"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16384/Reviewer_U8MK"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16384/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761757199585, "cdate": 1761757199585, "tmdate": 1762926506069, "mdate": 1762926506069, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper propose AutoGPS, a neural symbolic plang geometry problem solver.

As I know, using hyper graph in solving plane geometry probelms (PGPs) was already explored by FGeo-HyperGNet [1], this paper not give appropriate discussion on this previous work, what is the difference of the hyper graph between AutoGPS and HyperGNet. Meanwhile, HyperGNet achieved 91.99% on Geometry3K which is higher than AutoGPS with 81.6.\n\n2. To this end, the contribution of this paper is limited, as the diagram parsing mainly relies on PGDP and the hypergraph has already been used in other work. Despite the author proposing a deductive symbolic reasoning framework to assemble these modules and give stepwise solutions that are easy for humans to read, I think this paper does not satisfy the bar of the ICLR community.\n\n3. The description of symbolic solvers is not appropriate. Indeed, symbolic solvers do not directly output the results without solution steps, like Inter-GPS, which was proposed along with the Geometry3K dataset. Inter-GPS uses a theorem predictor (also has a search algorithm) to predict the theorems at each step, and based on these theorems, to conduct symbolic reasoning on the existing problem conditions to get the final target answer. And the reliable interpretability is one of the advantages of symbolic solvers. The author said symbolic solvers are hard for humans to read, it is easy to tackle by using an LLM to translate the symbolic solution steps into human language, which will be used to understand.\n\n4. Limited experiment dataset, benchmark. This paper only conducted experiments on the Geometry3K and PGPS9K, while actually PGPS9K was expanded from Geometry3K. It is necessary to conduct experiments on popular benchmarks in the PGP solving area, such as Math-Vista Geo, Math-Verse. The current experiments are not convincing. \n\n5. Limited generalization ability of AutoGPS. As mentioned in the above weakness, I am wondering if AutoGPS is hard to solve other domains of PGPs, such as GeoQA, which is also a foundation dataset for the research of solving PGPs, as the diagram parsing module in the AutoGPS is leveraged from PGDP, which is a delicate model designed for parsing diagrams in the style of Geometry3K. If AutoGPS is not able to solve problems in GeoQA and other benchmarks, the scope of this work is not sufficient for ICLR.\n\nRef:\n\n[1] FGeo-HyperGNet: Geometric Problem Solving Integrating FormalGeo Symbolic System and Hypergraph Neural Network, in IJCAI 2025."}, "questions": {"value": "I would like to see what is the performance of the diagram parsing in AutoGPS by using the feedback and refinement process, comparing to the original PGDP work, which already achieved 99% accuracy on the PGDP5K dataset."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ZCCTpmDW3M", "forum": "PVtZnUh04m", "replyto": "PVtZnUh04m", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16384/Reviewer_bJ89"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16384/Reviewer_bJ89"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16384/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761993363770, "cdate": 1761993363770, "tmdate": 1762926505291, "mdate": 1762926505291, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
