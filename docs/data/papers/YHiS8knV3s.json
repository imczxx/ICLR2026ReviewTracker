Sampling-based techniques like Sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo generate diverse scenarios but often lack focus on specific high-risk outcomes, leading to inefficient exploration. In contrast, Deep Reinforcement Learning methods optimize sequential decision-making effectively but tend to converge on a narrow set of high-reward scenarios, limiting diversity. To address these shortcomings, we propose using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), which naturally learn to sample according to a predefined reward distribution. Our approach systematically generates diverse and realistic tail-risk scenarios by explicitly defining rewards that prioritize high-risk, impactful financial scenarios. Experiments on real-world financial data show that our GFlowNet-based method significantly enhances scenario diversity and realism, effectively capturing the complex nonlinear dependencies typical of financial markets. These findings demonstrate the potential of GFlowNets as a robust framework for financial risk modeling, offering actionable insights into rare but critical market events.", "tldr": "We apply GFlowNets to the exploration of large continuous state spaces, demonstrating our approach's capabilities by discovering financial risk scenarios.", "keywords": ["GFlowNets", "risk analysis"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4a7dd23439c2271be85dd49bdefbaf4a4363b2e7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces GRID, a method based on Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), for discovering diverse and realistic financial tail-risk scenarios. The authors present this as a sequential decision-making problem where a GFlowNet policy is trained to sample trajectories of macroeconomic variables. The sampling process is guided by a reward signal provided by a pre-trained “Oracle” model, which aims to sample trajectories in proportion to their predicted risk, specifically large negative S&P 500 returns. The paper claims that this approach offers a superior trade-off between scenario diversity and risk-severity discovery compared to standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) or MCMC baselines.\n\n\nSoundness\nThe central claims of the paper are not adequately supported by the evidence, and the research methodology appears to be unsound. The paper's effectiveness depends substantially on the quality of the Oracle-provided reward signal. However, the paper's own evidence (Table 2) reports negative R² values for the Oracle, indicating its predictions are worse than a trivial mean-baseline. This makes it difficult to validate the value of the reward signal, making subsequent experimental results uninterpretable. Furthermore, using two different Oracles for training and testing is a non-standard approach that complicates the comparison.\n\nPresentation\nThe paper is generally well-written, but the presentation of the core methodology is confusing and omits important information. The experimental setup involving two different Oracles is not convincingly justified, and the performance metrics for the main (test-time) Oracle are not presented. This makes it difficult for the reader to validate the experiment and assess the reliability of the results.\n\nContribution\nWhile the idea of applying GFlowNets to risk discovery is novel and well-motivated, the paper's execution does not provide a sound or convincing validation. Due to fundamental issues in the experimental setup, particularly the unvalidated reward signal and the non-standard train/test mismatch, the evidence presented is insufficient to substantiate the claimed contributions.

The authors state they use a simple MLP Oracle for training and a different ensemble Oracle for testing (evaluation). This is not standard practice and introduces problems:\no\tTrain/Test Skew: It is likely to introduce a distributional shift in the objective function itself. The agent is optimized to find scenarios that exploit one reward model (the MLP) and then evaluated on its ability to find scenarios that score well on a different reward model (the ensemble).\no\tUninterpretable Results: This makes the results in Table 3 uninterpretable.

Multiple reviewers raised concerns about negative R² values and questioned how GFlowNets trained on \"unreliable\" rewards could discover realistic scenarios. We address these fundamental concerns below.\n\n**Understanding R² in Financial Prediction Context**\nOur Oracle achieves R² values of -0.48, 0.09, and -0.86 across the three crises (Table 2). While negative R² indicates predictions worse than a constant mean baseline on held-out data, this metric must be interpreted in context. Financial market prediction, particularly for 12-month S&P 500 returns during crisis periods, is fundamentally challenging due to nonlinearity, regime changes, and the inherent unpredictability of tail events. Our Oracle's MAE values (2.92-12.81) demonstrate meaningful signal despite limited variance explanation. \n\nMore importantly, R² measures unconditional variance explanation and is not necessarily indicative of a model's utility. In Hou et al. (2013) [1], the authors prove theoretically that in rational models, R² is independent of how much information is incorporated into predictions: “the return R² is independent of the amount of information available”. Moreover, low R2 values are common in relevant academic literature. Studies published in top tier journals in the fields of finance and asset pricing report R2 values similar to ours, and sometimes even lower [2].\n\n**Imperfect Oracles: Core GFlowNet Design Principle**\nThe reviewers' concerns do not take into account a major aspect of GFlowNet methodology. GFlowNets were explicitly designed to operate with imperfect reward proxies. This is not a limitation of our work - it is the central motivation for using GFlowNets.\n\nAs stated in the GFlowNet Foundations paper (Bengio et al.,[3]): \"In contexts where a cheap proxy for the true reward function exists, GFlowNets have been used to surface samples under which to query the proxy before more expensive evaluation under the true reward function. In these settings, the diversity of samples generated by GFlowNets can be used for robustness to proxy misspecification\".​\n\nIn  [4], the authors explicitly note that GFlowNets are valuable \"especially in scenarios of very large candidate spaces where we have access to cheap but inaccurate measurements or too expensive but accurate measurements\". This directly describes our financial forecasting setting.​\n\nThe original NeurIPS 2021 paper introducing GFlowNets [5] states: \"Diversity of the generated candidates is particularly important when the oracle is itself uncertain, e.g., it may consist of cellular assays which is a cheap proxy\". Furthermore, the paper demonstrates \"the ability to capture the modes, even in the absence of the true oracle\". \n\nThe work of [6] explicitly addresses imperfect oracles: \"Diverse candidates capturing the modes of the imperfect oracle improve the likelihood of discovering a candidate that can satisfy all (or many) evaluation criteria\"\n\n**Why GFlowNets Succeed Where RL Fails**\nUnlike reinforcement learning methods that maximize expected reward and thus over-exploit Oracle predictions, GFlowNets sample proportionally to reward. This fundamental difference is critical: RL agents trained on noisy oracles converge to exploit spurious high-reward modes, while GFlowNets maintain broad exploration that discovers scenarios the Oracle may undervalue. This is precisely why our REINFORCE and SAC baselines, despite using the identical Oracle, achieve lower median performance and collapse to narrow solution sets (Figure 2, Table 3).\n\nWe updated our submission to better explain these important points.\n\n[1] Hou, Kewei, Lin Peng, and Wei Xiong.

The paper redefines financial tail-risk discovery as a proportional sampling problem rather than an optimization problem, which is a conceptual innovation. Technically, it is the first to successfully apply GFlowNets to large-scale continuous state spaces, breaking through the previous limitation to discrete domains only. Particularly clever is the design of using heterogeneous distribution families for different environmental variables (Beta for VIX, Gaussian mixtures for interest rates). This feature-aware modeling is unprecedented in the GFlowNet literature and provides new insights for multi-variable modeling in scientific domains.\n\n2. The experimental design is excellent: testing on three real financial crises with strict temporal splits ensuring no data leakage (Oracle trained only on pre-crisis data). Baseline selection covers classical probabilistic methods (SMCMC) and modern deep RL (REINFORCE, SAC). The dual evaluation framework—reward metrics (median, Q90) and diversity metrics (DTW trajectory distance, terminal-state Euclidean distance)—provides a comprehensive perspective. The normalized diversity score (Equation 9) reveals that SAC's apparent diversity actually stems from instability rather than true exploration. Using an ensemble Oracle (4 models) during testing while training with a single MLP effectively prevents overfitting. Each method undergoes 30 independent runs with 6,000 trajectories total, demonstrating strong statistical robustness.\n\n3. Addresses a critical practical problem: tail-risk events cause enormous losses (2008 GFC exceeded $10 trillion), yet traditional VaR models systematically underestimate their probability. The multimodal distribution shown in Figure 2c perfectly illustrates the value of diversity: multiple distinct pathways can lead to market crashes (liquidity crisis vs. inflation shock), and risk management requires stress testing against all pathways.

This creates a fatal circular reasoning problem: if the Oracle cannot accurately predict market crashes, how can a GFlowNet trained on Oracle rewards possibly discover realistic tail-risk scenarios? The reward function $R(s_T) = \\max(0, -\\mathcal{O}(s_T))$ becomes meaningless when $\\mathcal{O}(s_T)$ is unreliable, and the entire sampling distribution $P_F(x) \\propto R(x)$ is essentially learning from incorrect targets.
