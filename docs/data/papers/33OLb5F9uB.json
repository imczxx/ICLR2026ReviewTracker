Although quantum noise is often viewed as a major challenge in quantum computing, it also offers a unique opportunity to enhance privacy. In particular, quantum noise can serve as a natural source of randomness that reduces the need for additional classical noise without compromising the privacy budget while potentially improving model utility. However, the integration of classical and quantum noise for privacy preservation remains unexplored. In this work, we propose a hybrid noise-added mechanism, HYPER-Q, that combines classical and quantum noise to protect the privacy of QML models. We provide a comprehensive analysis of its privacy guarantees and establish theoretical bounds on its utility. Empirically, we demonstrate that HYPER-Q outperforms existing classical noise-based mechanisms in terms of adversarial robustness across multiple real-world datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["differential privacy", "privacy amplification", "quantum machine learning", "quantum noise", "adversarial robustness"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9fbf1640fdd2a5bc220ac806acb69305d6b9207a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/230554f169949be56bd03589f094d2b8fd73dac1.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The manuscript proposes a hybrid privacy mechanism that combines classical differentially private input noise with depolarizing noise (quantum) to amplify differential privacy in quantum machine learning.

Leveraging the quantum noise as a DP mechanism is like realizing a foe can be a friend. But the formulation in the manuscript seems simpler than the actual noise scenario that is in quantum world.  It starts with the scope of the paper which considers only the depolarization noise. Before moving into the discussion of the theoretical formulation aspect, this umbrella assumption itself is flawed/incomplete.  The mathematical properties are not universal, although acknowledged, one of the most critical aspects is considered as future work.\n\nFor example, let’s just take some unavoidable temporal ones, like, amplitude damping noise (T1) or phase damping (T2). T1 is not a uniform contraction of the Bloch sphere. It asymmetrically pulls the state towards the ground state. It does not have the simple convex combination form. Another dangerous one is coherent noises. They contradict the whole concept of randomness; they are systematic. \n\nIt is highly plausible that these noises might create a new vulnerability by systematically shifting outputs in a predictable way.\n\nIf the authors aim to show a proof a concept that the quantum noise has the potential to show DP properties, then, as per my judgment, it has already been done rigorously in the literature. The adaptation of quantum noise as an amplifier to classical form is a novelty but not enough. \n\nExperiments: Datasets selected are although suitable for a first proof of concept, they are considered as the toy-datsets by the community; Mnist, FashionMNIST (just an extension with same dimension 28x28, and features as grayscale pixel value), and USPS. More complex, at least something like Cifar-10 is expected.  This might steer in a new direction, say more qubits requirements. Adding qubits to a circuit generally reduces fidelity and forces η upward, quickly negating the dimensional advantage. Will privacy–utility curve changes shape? My intuition says it will.  \n\nClarification required regarding the narrative “HYPER-Q improves robustness in QML models.” \nThe experiment compares HyperQ (0.1, 0.3) against classical-DP applied to the same QML model. While the HYPER-Q-protected QML model wins under very strict privacy budgets, it seems outperformed by a standard classical ResNet-9 when the privacy budget is relaxed. This suggests that the quantum advantage shown is not inherent to the QML model itself, but rather an artifact of the classical model being \"over-penalized\" by extreme noise. Is this happening?

This is a highly simplified noise model. Real quantum hardware is dominated by other, more complex noise channels (e.g., amplitude damping, phase-flip, crosstalk) for which these proofs do not hold. Therefore, the paper's claims about providing privacy guarantees for \"intrinsic quantum noise\" are not general and may not apply to any practical quantum device.\n2.\tAll experiments are conducted on a 5-qubit simulator. This is a \"toy model\" scale. It is well-known that QML model performance and trainability are highly dependent on scale. There is no evidence provided that the utility improvements (e.g., in Figure 2) will hold for QML models with a practical number of qubits (e.g., 50-100+). The claims of \"practical viability\" are severely undermined by this lack of scaling analysis.\n3.\tThe proposed mechanism requires setting the quantum noise level η. The experiments show this choice is critical: η=0.1 works well, but η=0.3 leads to poor performance. The paper provides no principled method, algorithm, or even a strong heuristic for selecting an optimal η. This is a major methodological gap. A user cannot apply HYPER-Q without an expensive, brute-force grid search, making the method impractical.\n4.\tThe theoretical utility bound (Theorem 3) is difficult to reconcile with the empirical results. The bound includes terms that explicitly increase the error as η increases, suggesting quantum noise is always detrimental to utility.

Does this not suggest the bound is too loose to be practically informative?\n3.\tSince your entire analysis is specific to the depolarizing channel, can you comment on the validity of your framework for more realistic noise models like amplitude and phase damping? Is it not the case that the claims of \"guaranteeing privacy\" are limited to a theoretical, idealized noise model?\n4.\tThe paper shows η=0.1 is good and η=0.3 is bad.
