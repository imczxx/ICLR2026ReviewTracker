Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37\\% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically, when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established neural pathways with 88\\% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to identify these canonical circuits in over 99\\% of subjects. Furthermore, our network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically shifts its primary causal hub—recruiting executive or salience networks depending on the stimulus—a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains undetected by traditional methods.

The paper fails to articulate a distinct, impactful core innovation. The two-stage approach (BOLD deconvolution + causal graph inference) is not inherently novel, as decomposing hemodynamic inverse problems has been explored in prior work (e.g., DCM variants, Granger causality adaptations, Trasfer Entropy, Attentive Transfer Entropy). The \"Conditional Mamba\" component is described but not positioned as a transformative advancement -- its incremental value over existing state-space models or conditional modeling techniques (e.g., FiLM, hypernetworks) is undefined. Without a clear articulation of how the framework addresses unmet needs beyond incremental engineering, the scientific contribution remains ambiguous.\n3.

The two-stage decomposition in CausalMamba introduces strong modeling assumptions. In Stage 1, the model assumes a fixed double-gamma HRF form and a simple LFP-like neural event model. While biologically motivated, this may not capture the full diversity of real neural or hemodynamic responses. Since Stage 1 is trained solely on synthetic data, its deconvolution may not generalize well if real HRFs or neural patterns deviate from the assumed forms.\n\n2. In Stage 2, temporal features are averaged into static node embeddings. While this simplifies the mapping, it discards precise timing information of neural events, potentially losing important cues for causal inference.\n\n3. The \"dominant direction\" rule used in evaluation to resolve bidirectional predictions avoids double-counting but may discard smaller yet real reverse influences, introducing bias in the results.\n\n4. The identifiability of HRF and neural signals is not sufficiently discussed. The model learns HRF parameters and latent event parameters by minimizing BOLD reconstruction and event losses, but different HRF-neural pairs could produce identical BOLD signals. The paper does not verify whether inferred HRFs match ground truth or known physiology.\n\n5. The framework diagram is overly simplified and information-sparse, failing to clearly convey the model's structure and key pipeline. Its layout and aesthetics are suboptimal, undermining the clarity and readability of the core method.\n\n6. The overall causality assumptions are problematic. The model outputs a full N×N matrix of coupling strengths and delays without imposing constraints or priors, and it lacks mechanisms to handle unobserved confounders. In fMRI, hidden brain regions and common drivers are ubiquitous, yet CausalMamba assumes the measured ROIs form a closed system. Negative couplings are interpreted as inhibition and positive as excitation, but their statistical meaning remains unclear.\n\n7. Ablation results show only marginal differences between conditional GRU and conditional Mamba, suggesting limited incremental benefits from the proposed module. It is recommended to include a t-test and report statistical significance to determine whether the proposed method is significantly superior to competing baselines.\n\n8. The selected baselines are largely classical and dated; the lack of comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods diminishes empirical persuasiveness and limits the external validity of the claims.\n\n9. The structure of the Abstract is problematic as it lacks a clear research background, making it difficult for readers to quickly grasp the paper's direction.\n\n10. The Related Work section is relatively brief, providing neither a concise summary of existing methods nor a clear discussion of their limitations or shortcomings.\n\n11. The experimental section uses a limited selection of baseline methods and an insufficient number of metrics to comprehensively demonstrate model effectiveness. The model was trained on a small number of datasets that are not widely adopted, undermining the credibility of the results.\n\n12. The paper lacks descriptions of specific implementation details, hindering the reproducibility of the experimental findings.\n\n13. Final estimates of causal connection strength lack uncertainty calibration or confidence intervals, making it difficult to distinguish reliable causal effects from spurious associations potentially driven by noise.\n\n14. The whole-brain analysis results on 360 regions mentioned in the paper are only referenced in internal tests, without specific performance data or detailed analysis provided in the main text or appendix, weakening the persuasiveness of its scalability claims."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The methodology lacks a mathematically precise description. The description and the dimensionality of variables is not sufficient to understand what is going on in Figure 1. The figure wastes a lot of white space and could have a more compact representation.  From my reading, the dimension variables are never defined in the text. \n The algorithm for conditional Mamba is very hard to parse as a commented pseudo code. \n\nEvidence is limited because from what I can tell throughout the work there is only one model trained on simulated and tested on real data.\n\nCompared to the main body, there is much information and detail in the appendix. From the reading the simulation was set up to follow the real data to some degree with designing the HRF and other neuroscientifically motivated choices. While I appreciate that it is still simulated data, training it to infer causal connections and then testing it on real data, seems to be a form of distant supervision. Obviously, if the simulation did not match the real as much I would expect the results to be lower. Thus, this proposed methodology does not seem to be able to be applied without strong a priori assumptions. While there has no doubt substantial effort put into the design of the simulation, the real world applications are directly tied to the simulations. Furthermore, the extensive list of alternative methods show that the proposed architecture change (which itself is hard to decipher) provides gains but not substantial. Finally, the ablation study reveals that end-to-end training already outperforms the other methods. This leads me to believe that any end-to-end training is going to overfit and the additional gains from the proposed architecture will not generalize. It is hard to tell why exactly the proposed approach works well, besides the fact that it was trained for a very similar task. \nThese multiple issues are intertwined and it makes it hard to see if this as a general tool for neural causal inference."}, "questions": {"value": "Sentences are hard to parse as references are not correctly typeset.

I'm very familiar with conditional VAE and conditional GAN, but the other prior works are not given with sufficient detail to understand.  In the context of conditioning, is the ROI-specific parameters input? Or a version of the model for each ROI? This is especially important because conditional Mamba is used repeatedly Figure 1 and 2.\n\nLine 92. It would be useful to define what 'selective mechanisms' are.\n\nI don't know what B, N, L represent... What is the range of the ROI Index.

There seems to be potential for large gap.\n\nLooking at Table 2 it appears the first strategy that maps \"BOLD to Causality\" outperforms all baselines.
