We present Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a lightweight, label-free test-time method that constructs a steering vector from sparse features extracted by a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on the model’s internal activations. On CIFAR-100, CUB-200, and Tiny-ImageNet, VS2 improves the top-1 accuracy of the CLIP zero-shot baseline by 4.12\\%, 1.08\\%, and 1.84\\%, respectively. Since not all features learned by the SAE are equally important for classification, we introduce VS2++, a retrieval-augmented variant that selectively amplifies relevant sparse features using pseudo-labeled neighbors retrieved from an external unlabeled corpus at inference time. With oracle positive and negative sets (upper bound), VS2++ achieves absolute top-1 gains over the CLIP zero-shot baseline of up to 21.44\\% on CIFAR-100, 7.08\\% on CUB-200, and 20.47\\% on Tiny-ImageNet, highlighting the potential of steering vectors when relevant feature selection is accurate. VS2 and VS2++ also improve per-class accuracy by up to 25\\% and 38\\%, respectively, indicating that sparse steering disproportionately benefits visually or semantically similar classes. Finally, VS2 includes a built-in reliability diagnostic based on SAE reconstruction loss, which is absent in common steering vectors, signaling when steering may underperform and safely triggering a fallback to the baseline.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Sparse Autoencoders", "Steering Vectors", "Unsupervised Adaptation", "Image Classification"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7d5137fceb3a5bfa2cbf247c7b97feacb33c3ce0.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents an unsupervised steering technique (VS2) to adapt vision models.

The current related work section does not mention any literature from UDA, despite its strong relevance.\n\n**W2.** Missing unsupervised adaptation baselines: The paper, which primarily tests the approach on a UDA problem for pre-trained FMs, lacks a comparison against popular baselines such as test-time augmentation (TTA) (fully training-free). \n\n**W3.** Missing unsupervised adaptation datasets: Typically, test-time adaptation addresses distribution shifts.

There is no evidence provided that this method can generalize to other vision foundation models or other tasks beyond classification. This discrepancy makes the general claim of \"steering\" appear to be an overclaim. The method is more accurately framed as a test-time adaptation technique for CLIP zero-shot classification.\n- **Misleading \"Test-Time\" Claim and Practicality Issues:** The method is presented as a \"test-time\" approach, but this is a bit misleading. Its effectiveness hinges on a pretrained SAE that must be trained on the in-domain activations of the target dataset's training split. This requirement has several critical weaknesses:\n    - The method cannot work as a \"plug-and-play\" method, as it requires substantial, dataset-specific computation and full access to the (unlabeled) training set before any test sample can be processed.\n    - The authors' own experiment with a \"generalized SAE\" (trained on the union of datasets) in Section 4.4 confirms this limitation, as it fails to generalize and underperforms the baseline on CUB-200. This reinforces the method's strong dependency on in-domain data.\n    - This \"pre-training\" step on the training set blurs the line between a true test-time method and a form of unsupervised domain adaptation.\n- **Contradictory Premise for Data-Scarce Scenarios:** The chosen experiment setup, CLIP zero-shot classification, is most valuable in data-scarce (e.g., few-shot or long-tail) domains where training data is limited. However, these are precisely the scenarios where VS2/VS2++ would be least applicable.\n    - VS2 would fail because there is insufficient in-domain data to train a reliable SAE.\n    - VS2++ would be even more likely to fail, as it requires a large high-quality retrieval corpus, which is unlikely to exist in a data-scarce setting.\n- **Unvalidated Reliability Diagnostic:** The \"built-in reliability diagnostic\" is presented as a key advantage but is not empirically validated as a practical tool. The analysis in Section 4.4 and Table 3 only demonstrates a dataset-level correlation (i.e., CUB-200 has high average FVU and low accuracy). It fails to provide evidence that this works on a per-instance basis, which is necessary for it to function as a useful fallback mechanism."}, "questions": {"value": "- **Generalizability:** Given the claim of \"steering vision foundation models,\" could the authors elaborate on a concrete way to apply VS2 to (a) non-CLIP models like DINOv2 and (b) non-classification tasks like VQA or image generation, where the concept of a single \"CLS token\" or \"classification accuracy\" may not directly apply?\n- **Sensitivity to Data Scarcity:** How does the SAE's reconstruction error (and the final VS2 accuracy) degrade as the proportion of the training set used for SAE training is reduced? Would VS2 work well under data-scarce setting where CLIP zero shot classification is often considered?\n- **Missing Experimental Details:** Could the authors please clarify the setup for the \"CLIP classifier\" used for pseudo-labeling? Is this a standard zero-shot classifier? If so, what text prompts were used? These details are essential for reproducibility.\n- **Validating the Fallback Mechanism:** To validate the *per-instance* utility of the reliability diagnostic, would it be possible to bin the test instances by their reconstruction loss? A plot showing accuracy per bin would confirm if instances with higher loss are indeed those where VS2 underperforms. Following this, have the authors experimented with implementing the actual fallback mechanism (i.e., if loss > threshold, use the baseline prediction)? This would show if the diagnostic practically improves the final accuracy.\n- **More Baselines for VS2++:** For the VS2++ setting, where access to the unlabeled training set is assumed, there could be simpler but potentially stronger baselines. How does VS2++ compare against:\n    - (a) A simple k-NN classifier using retrieval (i.e., a majority vote of the pseudo-labels from the top-k retrieved neighbors)?\n    - (b) A lightweight linear probe trained on the training set's CLS tokens and their corresponding pseudo-labels (or in oracle setting, labels)?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "CfGxMZuO2d", "forum": "8HZzPtMcZo", "replyto": "8HZzPtMcZo", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21095/Reviewer_qejr"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21095/Reviewer_qejr"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21095/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761905654562, "cdate": 1761905654562, "tmdate": 1762941253719, "mdate": 1762941253719, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a test-time method that improves zero-shot image classification by steering vision models using sparse features from an autoencoder trained on internal activations—no labeled data required.

The paper primarily compares against CLIP zero-shot and reconstruction baselines but lacks comparisons with other test-time adaptation methods (e.g., TPT, DiffTPT, or prompt-based adaptation techniques). The single comparison with SpLiCE (Table 8) is helpful but insufficient to position the work within the broader test-time adaptation literature.\n2. While VS² shows consistent improvements on CIFAR-100 (3-4%), the gains on CUB-200 (0.93-1.08%) and Tiny-ImageNet (1.5-1.84%) are marginal. The paper hypothesizes this stems from features learned for reconstruction not aligning with classification needs, but does not provide sufficient analysis or solutions beyond the prototype-based approach in Appendix K, which requires labels during SAE training.\n3. The paper states that VS² is \"lightweight\" but provides no runtime or memory comparisons. Training SAEs requires processing all layers across entire datasets, and the inference-time reconstruction steps add overhead. Quantitative efficiency analysis relative to the zero-shot baseline would strengthen practical applicability claims.\n4. While the geometric intuition is clear (amplify sparse features -> steer toward salient directions), the paper lacks formal analysis of why autoencoding objectives should discover classification-relevant features, or under what conditions this alignment holds. The empirical observation that it works on CIFAR-100 but struggles on CUB-200 suggests important gaps in understanding.\n5. Evaluation scope limitations: All experiments use CLIP ViT backbones; generalization to other architectures (ConvNets, other VLMs) is unexplored. Only classification tasks are evaluated; applicability to detection, segmentation, or other vision tasks remains unclear. The VS²⁺⁺ non-oracle results (Table 1) often show smaller gains than standard steering vectors, undermining claims about SAE superiority when supervision is noisy\n6. The term \"contrastive data\" is used loosely (the method doesn't require labeled positives/negatives but still uses contrastive loss in training).
