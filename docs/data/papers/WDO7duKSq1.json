Prior research has indicated the possibility of enhancing the performance of SAM2 by modifying inference strategies. For instance, SAMURAI utilizes Kalman-based test-time optimization, and FS-MedSAM2 applies few-shot reference learning.\nIn this paper, we delve into this emerging trend within the realm of high-dimensional medical image segmentation tasks. Firstly, we put forward three novel inference modules:\n(1) Breadth-First Search memory collection, which gives precedence to central slices containing high-information content;\n(2) Multi-dimensional result voting, designed to stabilize predictions and mitigate bias;\n(3) a self-growing prompt mechanism that generates new visual prompts during the segmentation process.\nOur experimental outcomes surpassed all baseline tuning-free methods, and the relative gain is on par with fine-tuning. Additionally, we explore the self-correction potential of SAM through tuning. We also introduced a learnable meta-prompter to extend the capabilities of our inference modules. We carried out multi-round self-distillation based on the outputs of the proposed inference framework. In most scenarios, distilled model's performance can be enhanced without additional annotation. \nCollectively, these results highlight a practical approach for implementing foundation models in real-world medical segmentation tasks with minimal annotation requirements.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Medical Image Segmentation", "Self-distillation", "Prompt-based segmentation"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
