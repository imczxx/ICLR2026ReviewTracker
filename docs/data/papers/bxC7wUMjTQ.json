Inspecting possible biased behaviors is mandatory to satisfy the constraints of the regulations of the EU Artificial Intelligence’s Act. Regulation driven audits increasingly rely on global fairness metrics, with Disparate Impact being the most widely used. Yet such global measures depend highly on the distribution of the sample on which the measures are computed. We investigate first how to manipulate data samples to artificially satisfy fairness criteria, creating minimally perturbed datasets that remain statistically indistinguishable from the original distribution while satisfying prescribed fairness constraints. Then we study how to detect such manipulation. Our analysis (i) introduces mathematically sound methods for modifying empirical distributions under fairness constraints using entropic or optimal transport projections, (ii) examines how an auditee could potentially circumvent fairness inspections, and (iii) offers recommendations to help auditors detect such data manipulations. These results are validated through experiments on classical tabular datasets in bias detection.

A supervisor ($S$) is meant to check that this subset is representative. For this, $S$ gets access to $E$'s complete dataset. \n\nMy concern is: if $E$ is potentially dishonest and manipulates the subset it gives to $A$, why would it not manipulate the (presumably) complete data it provides to $E$? Is there a realistic setting where this setup applies? Also, why would $E$ choose to manipulate the data *distribution* and then sample from it, instead of creating a truly adversarial dataset (as e.g. in [Konstantinov et al, JMLR 2022] for fair learning)? \n\n* Scientific contribution\n\nI find the technical depth of the contribution limited. The four presented methods are straight-forward realization of the principle of finding a distribution with certain (fairness) constraints, where only the similarity measure between distributions changes. Most interesting is Proposition 3.2, which provided explicit expressions, which however are the result of applying a previously existing theorem to the special case of fairness. \nThe Wasserstein construction (Section 3.3) would be intersting because of its ability to move probability mass to samples not in the reference set, but in the chosen setup where the reference set is available to the auditor, this becomes easily detectable. \nThe remaining two methods consist of elementary flips of labels or protected attributes. \n\nBesides the technical depth, also the presentation of the methods could be improved. It relies mostly on textual descriptions and remarks, where technical precision would benefit from formal definitions and theorems. Also, in several places special cases are discussed, but afterwards a claim is made that more general cases could also be handled. \n\nSection 3.4 on detection method is too superficial. It mentions statistical tests, but fails to discuss them properly, such as what exactly such a test can determine, the role of test power or significance levels.\n\n\n* Experimental evaluation\n\nThe setting of the experiments makes sense, but the description is insufficient for reproducibility. For the statistical test, the significance level is not reported. \n\n+ reported numeric values lack uncertainty/error bars\n+ the absolute numbers of samples is not reported, only percentages\n+ the plots have too small fonts in captions and legends\n+ the description repeatedly makes statements such as \"verify the null hypothesis\". Statistical tests can *never* verify the null hypothesis. Either they reject it, or they lack power to reject it. \n\n\n* Additional Comments\n\n+ \\citep and \\citet should be used appropriately\n\n- The paragraph \"Entropic distributional projection\" (Section 3.2) looks like an almost verbatim copy from (Bachoc etal, 2023), including the phrase \"stress deformation\" which is central in Bachoc's work but does not appear in the submission otherwise. \n\n- Several reference point to not actually existing papers. Specifically I spotted e.g. (Aivodji et al, 2019, (Anders et al, 2020), (Shamsabadi et al 2023), (Le Merrer et al, 2020), where at least author list, title and/or publication venues do not match. This hints to the use of LLMs in the preparation of the related work section, which isn't explicitly declared. \n\n- The work describes multiple methods to actively mislead a privacy audit, while spending almost no effort on improving detection methods. This clearly raises ethical concerns, and the provided ethics statement does not do a good job to dispell these. Also, it argues that the manuscript deliberately omitted full implementation details, but the effect of this is simply that the work becomes not reproducible."}, "questions": {"value": "- could you give an example where the described problem setting (see concern in \"Motivation\") could apply to a real-world setting?\n- has an LLM been used to create references?\n- what's the significance level of the statistical tests, e.g. of Table 3?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["Yes, Potentially harmful insights, methodologies and applications", "Yes, Research integrity issues (e.g., plagiarism, dual submission)"]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "1) Potentially harmful insights, methodologies and applications\n\nThe manuscript describes a method to actively support a malicious party to manipulate fairness audits.\n\n2) Research integrity issues (e.g., plagiarism, dual submission)\n\nThe paragraph \"Entropic distributional projection\" (Section 3.2) looks like an almost verbatim copy from (Bachoc etal, 2023), including e.g. the phrase \"stress deformation\" which is central in Bachoc's work but does not appear in the submission otherwise."}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "pK05iuMQqC", "forum": "bxC7wUMjTQ", "replyto": "bxC7wUMjTQ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3404/Reviewer_PYiv"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3404/Reviewer_PYiv"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3404/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761941646181, "cdate": 1761941646181, "tmdate": 1762916706402, "mdate": 1762916706402, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
