Current state-of-the-art approaches for optimizing exoskeleton controllers require extensive human experiments in which participants must walk for hours, creating a paradox: those who could benefit most from exoskeleton assistance, such as individuals with mobility impairments, are often unable to participate in such demanding procedures. We present Exo-plore, a simulation framework that combines neuromechanical simulation with deep reinforcement learning to optimize hip exoskeleton assistance without requiring real human experiments. Exo-plore can (1) generate realistic gait data that captures human adaptation to assistive forces, (2) produce reliable optimization results despite the stochastic nature of human gait, and (3) generalize to pathological gaits, showing strong linear relationships between pathology severity and optimal assistance.

Fine-tuning exoskeletal control parameters is often hard, and Exo-plore might help developing faster and more reliable controllers.\n\n2. I find convincing the definition of the total reward, and I especially appreciate the level of detail and reasoning behind it. Often times, papers neglect the proper presentation of the rationale behind the reward function. However, reward shaping is fundamental and has a very-well known impact on the performance of learning algorithms.\n\n3. The idea of the resistance-minimization hypothesis is compelling and somehow novel in this context. I found this a strength of the proposed work, which differentiates it from the state-of-the-art.\n\n4, The paper is clearly presented, and it provides a significant step forward in the development of realistic lower-limb musculoskeletal models capable to reproduce multiple gait patterns and different assistive scenarios."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Authors could improve the literature on human-in-the-loop optimization for exoskeletons. The group of Prof. Elliott Rouse at the U. Michigan has done extensive work on the topic on both prostheses and exoskeletons, but I could only find 1 work from his group in your references. Consider extending your literature review and include also this relevant portion of literature.\n\n2. In neuromechanical simulations, authors should briefly mention the fact that Hill-type muscle actuators are an approximation of the actual muscle behavior. More specifically, Hill never designed the muscle model to be used for complex musculoskeletal models but only to investigate the force-speed relationship in human individual muscles. As a consequence, many other features of muscle dynamics are not captured by it. Nonetheless, most musculoskeletal models employ Hill-type muscle models ''carelessly'' believing that it gives a complete representation of human behavior. This aspect can lead users of such models to incorrect insights on the actual human musculoskeletal system.\nPlease consider mentioning this aspect in your digression.\n\n3. It would be nice if you could provide some measure of similarity (or distance) between the simulated and experimental behaviors - both at the joint and muscular level, as well as for the other results presented in the paper. For join trajectories, I agree that the hip internal rotation is the one presenting the largest difference, while the other joint angular trajectories are closer to the behavior of human subjects. Nonetheless, some differences might be physiologically relevant. For example, in Figure 2 - Knee Flexion panel, you can observe that the simulation generates: (i) an overall smaller knee flexion peak during swing, and (ii) a practically negligible knee flexion during stance. Why is that? The knee flexion peak during swing is fundamental in normal walking to reduce the risk of stumbling and potentially falling, while the knee flexion peak during stance is important for shock absorption purposes. Is there any insight on why the model is not able to capture these features? Analogous observations could be done for the ankle dorsiflexion or hip abduction. I would greatly appreciate if you could comment more extensively on these results. (Similar comments are reported in the Questions also for Figure 5)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Is metabolic rate efficiency i.e., energy efficiency, the 'holy grail' of gait? Most of the existing research focuses on developing lower-limb exoskeletons that lower metabolic cost. However, humans do not always plan for most efficient behavior. It might be worth discussing this aspect in the paper. I also recommend having a look at this interesting (and recent paper): https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-023-00091-2\n\n2. Equation (1) is clear but I struggle to understand why you apply a torque proportional to the difference in sine of the hip angles? Why not applying a torque proportional to the actual difference between the angles? What's the need of the sine function? Moreover, 'k' has the dimensions of a stiffness, thus making your controller equivalent to an impedance control system. Is that correct? If so, I would mention it.\nLast but not least, delayed-feedback control can become unstable. Have you considered this aspect?\n\n3. While I understand the need to have an overall goal for the optimizer, why do most papers focus on metabolic cost minimization? Is this the actual human underlying goal during walking/gait? I think this is a non-trivial question. I don't expect you to answer quantitatively to this point - but it might be beneficial to specify somewhere that the metabolic cost minimization is only one of the possible goals of walking/gait, but other goals might exist.\n\n4. In Figure 4, the step frequency and step length results are also interesting. I invite the authors to compute any form of error, similarity or distance metric between experimental and simulated results. I agree the similarity is good, but I also wonder what the discrepancies are telling us. For example, we can observe that the simulations present the best fit at 4 km/h, while they tend to diverge at the extremes (either higher or lower). Why is that? Is this a bias of the training or is this an indicator that some other aspects of the musculoskeletal system need to be included? (Also, but a minor point, the font of the plot labels (in most figures) is very small - can you slightly increase it?)\n\n5. In page 7, line 377, you write (k,\\Delta_t) = (8 Nm, 0.25s). But wouldn't 'k' represent physically a stiffness i.e., its unit of measurement shouldn't it be Nm/rad?\n\n6. You write that the overall trends in Figure 5 match reasonably well between simulation and human subjects, and this is true especially for the exo assist moment. However, if we look at the hip flexion angle we observe that the simulation does not capture the fact that at the increase of the walking speed the hip flexion angle presents a left-shift. Why isn't the simulation capturing this? Is this something the simulation can or cannot capture? What is the source of this dissimilarity? \nMoreover, the overall exo assist power is underestimated (in the simulation) by almost a factor of 4 or even 5 at times. Why is this happening? Furthermore, why did you not compute any form of similarity metric between experimental and simulated results?\n\n7. Lines 388-389, there are two small typos: (i) \"an downward-opening\" should be \"a downward-opening\", (ii) \"a upward-opening\" should be \"an upward-opening\".\n\n8. Line 978-979. Can you clarify why do you need to add a minimum mass constraint to stabilize the simulation? This aspect is unclear.\n\n9. Table I.4. Please see my previous comment on the unit of measurement of ‘k’. Shouldn’t that be a stiffness? If not, please explain why.\n\n10. Line 1121-1122.
