This poses ethical and legal threats to individuals, creators, and organizations. Audio watermarking addresses these threats by embedding imperceptible identifiers in the audio. In this paper, we introduce FRELA, a frequency-layered audio watermarking method that distributes the localized watermark across multiple layers of the frequency domain. Each layer is watermarked on the basis of its spectral properties, enabling some to resist audio attacks while others may degrade. This layered redundancy enables partial watermark recovery even when the host signal is distorted. Experimental results demonstrate that FRELA preserves high audio quality while significantly enhancing robustness compared to existing techniques, even under adverse conditions including noise, speed and volume variations, dynamic changes, sampling distortions, temporal modifications, Encodec compression, and most notably, pitch shifting and frequency band filtering. Furthermore, FRELA remains effective in scenarios involving lossy transmission or partial signal degradation, making it suitable for real-world applications in copyright protection and content authentication.", "tldr": "We introduce Frela, a frequency-layered audio watermarking method that enhances robustness and audio quality by distributing the watermark across multiple spectral layers.", "keywords": ["Audio watermarking", "frequency-layered watermarking", "voice cloning prevention", "signal processing", "audio security", "copyright protection"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/af810cdb5aa7f35b57aa51ab59b165e0121e4430.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposed a 1-bit watermark called FRELA, which splits the target audio into disjoint but contiguous sub-bands then applies AudioSeal to each sub-band signal.

Those watermarks are designed for hiding specific message (>10 bits) within an audio. In contrast, proposed method is equivalent to 1-bit watermarking (watermarked or not), claiming superiority over those works is not proper since the problem setups are different. A fair comparison should be made to other 1-bit watermarking, or refine the statements in the introduction.\n\nAnother concern is the lack of detail, which impacts reproducibility and forbids future investigation from other researchers. For example, there's no information about parameter B, N, nor the STFT hopsize. The information on the detector is also lacking. Although readers can infer that it's probably a classifer network, but that's all and nothing more.\n\nThe detail about evaluation is also lacking. While in L362 it says \"Following the same attack and evaluation procedure as AudioSeal\". However, the detection score in original AudioSeal included computing the hamming distance between the recovered message and the original message, which is clearly not an 1-bit scenario. Moreover, some types of attack are not exist in AudioSeal (e.g. \"Mask\", \"Pitch Shift\", \"ReSample\", \"Downsample\", \"Crop\", \"Concat\"). Some of the attack parameters are even different than AudioSeal (e.g. the speed up is 1.25x in AudioSeal, but 0.8/1.2x in the evaluation of proposed work). In a later section(sect 4.3, L438), it suddenly mentioned about \"partial degradation\" without explaining what it is.\n\nIn the end, the lack of information makes the manuscript and evaluation result unconvincing due to missing necessary information.
