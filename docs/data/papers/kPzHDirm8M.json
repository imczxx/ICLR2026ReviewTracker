The attempt to apply a classic cognitive science theory (Bloom's Taxonomy) to evaluate the CoT data quality of large language models is an innovative research angle. Compared to traditional evaluation methods that focus merely on accuracy or the length of the reasoning chain, this paper seeks to explore the cognitive depth of the reasoning process itself.\n\n2. The paper provides a quantitative analysis of the cognitive distribution across multiple existing CoT datasets, revealing a potential problem: a widespread lack of higher-order cognitive capabilities (e.g., \"Evaluating\" and \"Creating\"). This finding is insightful for the future construction of high-quality reasoning datasets."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limitations of the Theoretical Framework: Relying on Bloom's Taxonomy as the sole theoretical foundation may oversimplify the multifaceted nature of cognitive processes in complex reasoning. Bloom's Taxonomy is primarily designed for classifying educational objectives. It is questionable whether it can sufficiently and accurately capture the complex cognitive activities manifested in LLM-generated CoT (e.g., analogical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, or optimization under multiple constraints). \n2. Reliability of the Evaluation Methodology: The core methodology of this paper relies on using an LLM (Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) as an annotator (LLM-as-Judge) to perform the cognitive classification of CoT. Although Table 1 provides a consistency check (Cohen's Kappa), this cannot fully substitute for rigorous methodological validation. Given the inherent subjectivity and complexity of classifying cognitive levels, the methodological validity and reliability remain a major weakness of this study. \n3. Issues with Framework Granularity/Discrimination: The empirical results show that most CoT datasets are concentrated at similar cognitive levels (\"Applying\" and \"Analyzing\"). This raises a critical question: If datasets known to perform differently on downstream tasks appear highly similar under this framework, does it imply that the classification framework lacks sufficient granularity to distinguish between reasoning processes of varying quality? \n4. Limited Contribution of the \"Data Enhancement Approach\": The proposed \"cognitive-guided data enhancement approach\" appears to be more of an empirical observation (i.e., that a small amount of high-order CoT data improves performance) rather than a systematic, reproducible method. The paper fails to provide a concrete, operational procedure to guide researchers on how to generate, identify, or select this \"high-order cognitive CoT data.\" Therefore, designating it as an \"approach\" is insufficient. \n5. Potential Confounding Variables: The experiment (Figure 6) suggests that high-order CoT data leads to performance gains. However, this phenomenon is likely confounded by other variables. High-order cognitive tasks often imply higher problem difficulty, longer contexts, or more complex logical structures. The study fails to adequately disentangle these factors, making it impossible to clearly attribute the performance improvement solely to the \"cognitive level\" itself. \n6. Presentation and Clarity: The manuscript's presentation requires improvement. For instance, while the six cognitive process dimensions and four knowledge type dimensions from Bloom's Taxonomy are introduced, they are not sufficiently operationalized or illustrated with clear examples within the text. This makes it difficult for readers to understand their specific application in the CoT evaluation. Furthermore, there is unnecessary repetition in the abstract and the experiment section ( e.g., line 23-27 of the abstract; repeating the RQs in Section 4)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. In Observation 5, the authors state that \"distilled CoT data achieves alignment with human cognitive patterns.\" Could the authors please provide a precise operational definition of \"human cognitive patterns\" in this context? Furthermore, could they elaborate on how Figure 3 is interpreted to support the conclusion of \"Human-Aligned Coupling\"? \n\n2. Observation 2 states that \"Existing CoT datasets exhibit systematic mismatches between cognitive and knowledge dimensions that contradict human learning patterns,\" whereas Observation 6 notes that \"All datasets demonstrate cognitive transitions that adhere to human cognitive hierarchies.\" There appears to be a tension between these two observations. Could the authors clarify this potential contradiction? If the fundamental cognitive-knowledge pairings are mismatched (Obs. 2), how can the cognitive transitions simultaneously adhere to human cognitive hierarchies (Obs. 6)? \n\n3. Regarding the methodological reliability of the LLM-as-Judge, can the authors provide further validation beyond the Kappa scores? For example, a detailed qualitative error analysis of the LLM's annotations, a comparison with established annotation protocols in cognitive science, or citations of relevant literature to support the LLM's validity for this specific cognitive classification task."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "9vL1Zjzkcb", "forum": "kPzHDirm8M", "replyto": "kPzHDirm8M", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22431/Reviewer_WDuK"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22431/Reviewer_WDuK"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22431/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761561340010, "cdate": 1761561340010, "tmdate": 1762942217246, "mdate": 1762942217246, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addressed the problem: \"Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data quality assessment methods neglect the quality of underlying reasoning processes, leading to ineffective LLM reasoning capabilities,\" and as a solution, proposed a CoT data quality assessment framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy, evaluating both cognitive process dimensions (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating) and knowledge dimensions (Factual, Conceptual, Procedural, Metacognitive)."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper proposes that the integration of Bloom's Taxonomy to analyze CoT data quality from a cognitive perspective is a highly novel and insightful approach.

Also, it develops a thorough evaluation framework, including both instruction-level and trajectory-level cognitive annotations. The use of LLMs (Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) for annotation, validated by human experts with high Cohen's Kappa scores ($\\kappa > 0.88$), suggests a robust and scalable method. The detailed analysis revealing systematic distributional biases in both human-authored and LLM-distilled CoT datasets (concentration in intermediate cognitive processes and misalignment of cognitive-knowledge dimensions) is a really good contribution.
