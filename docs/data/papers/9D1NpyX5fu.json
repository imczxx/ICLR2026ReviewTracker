However, mismatches often happen between the internal expectations of the agent regarding the influence of its issued actions and the actual state transitions in the environment, a phenomenon referred to as **agent-environment misalignment**. While prior work has invested substantially in improving agent strategies and environment design, the critical role of the interface still remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that agent-environment misalignment poses a significant bottleneck to agent performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose **ALIGN**, an \\underline{A}uto-A\\underline{l}igned \\underline{I}nterface \\underline{G}e\\underline{n}eration framework that alleviates the misalignment by enriching the interface.\nSpecifically, the ALIGN-generated interface enhances both the static information of the environment and the step-wise observations returned to the agent. Implemented as a lightweight wrapper, this interface achieves the alignment without modifying either the agent logic or the environment code. Experiments across multiple domains including embodied tasks, web navigation and tool-use, achieve consistent performance improvements, with up to a 45.67\\% success rate improvement observed in ALFWorld.
