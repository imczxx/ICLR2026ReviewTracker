In this work, we present LHM++, an efficient large-scale human reconstruction model that generates high-quality, animatable 3D avatars within seconds from one or multiple pose-free images.  At its core is an Encoder–Decoder Point–Image Transformer architecture that progressively encodes and decodes 3D geometric point features to improve efficiency, while fusing hierarchical 3D point features with image features through multimodal attention.  The fused features are decoded into 3D Gaussian splats to recover detailed geometry and appearance. To further enhance visual fidelity, we introduce a lightweight 3D-aware neural animation renderer that refines the rendering quality of reconstructed avatars. Extensive experiments show that our method produces high-fidelity, animatable 3D humans without requiring camera or pose annotations. Our code and models will be released to the public.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Human Avatar", "3D Gaussian Splatting"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7bec3a7ed7bd5ad89d17e7a48cfd26861fb0f54b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3c7c21663c5aa4a148bb7835b23eb589d0a729c6.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents an advanced version of LHM that accepts multiple images and produces high-quality, animatable 3D avatars with a large feed-forward model.

Why is this design choice necessary? Although the authors extend LHM to multi-image input, the paper shows limited gains beyond 16 images (e.g., Table 2/5 at 64 views). This raises the question of whether the multi-image extension offers meaningful benefits at higher view counts. In particular, the paper notes that “the gains become marginal with an increasing number of views” (Line 431), which is counter-intuitive if more views should provide more information. Please clarify.\n\n- The overall framework feels close to LHM: both use multimodal transformers to fuse 3D geometry with image features inside the network. The technical contribution beyond LHM on model design is not entirely clear from the framework description.\n\n- In Model Design, the paper highlights LHM’s quadratic attention complexity O(N_points + N)^2, but in Point–Image Attention the complexity remains quadratic after token merging, while N reduced to N/r. This suggests limited improvement as N grows large. A more detailed complexity analysis would strengthen the efficiency claim.\n\n- There is no visualization of avatar on canonical pose.

These operations only reduce the time cost by a constant factor.\n\n* The proposed LHM++ is presented as an improvement over LHM; however, it is unclear where this improvement originates. The main contributions of the paper appear to be (1) the PIT block with the “token merge” mechanism and (2) the neural renderer. Since the “merge” and “unmerge” operations inevitably introduce information loss, they are more likely to degrade rather than enhance visual quality. Additionally, the paper’s ablation study in the appendix shows that the neural renderer only marginally improves PSNR and SSIM.
