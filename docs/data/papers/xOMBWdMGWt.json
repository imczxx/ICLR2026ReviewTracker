A Unified Bias-Aware Loss for Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning", "abstract": "Long-tailed semi-supervised learning (LTSSL) suffers from class imbalance-induced biases in both training and inference. Existing debiasing methods typically rely on distribution priors, which fail to capture two critical dynamic factors: the pseudo-labeling-induced shifts in effective priors and the model’s intrinsic evolving bias. To address this limitation, we propose Bias-Aware Loss (BiAL), a unified objective that replaces static distribution priors with the model’s current bias. This straightforward substitution enables BiAL to generate plug-and-play bias-aware variants of cross-entropy/logit adjustment and contrastive heads, thereby unifying prior correction across diverse network architectures and training paradigms. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we prove that our BiAL provides a singular, unified mechanism to align training with model’s evolving state and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Long-tail recgonition", "Semi--supervised learning", "Bias-aware loss", "Debiased energy"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3aec495536917247cde5139bab281cbbd0820cf4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4b4a56568cef8fba65c1ba2880a99915726409a1.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper attempts to address the issue of dynamic bias in long-tailed semi-supervised learning (LTSSL).

However, if the original training dataset contains correlations between plain backgrounds and specific classes, the model may learn these spurious associations.
