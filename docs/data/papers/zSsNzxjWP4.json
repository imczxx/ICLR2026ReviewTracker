While compressibility and robustness have each been studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound, revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $\\ell_\\infty$ and $\\ell_2$ robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved - whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics. Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and safe.", "tldr": "We show that training methods that induce structured compressibility are likely to produce adversarial vulnerability.", "keywords": ["compressibility", "compression", "adversarial robustness", "generalization", "safety"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4b6b14f85fa115bc25fdfc7d848d076e9b4f25f8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d17ce2987ae9164ace128943984d004f9c165c08.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "To understand the impact of model compression on adversarial robustness, this paper presents an adversarial robustness bound that interprets how structured and spectral compression induce adversarial vulnerability through their effects on the model's Lipschitz constant.

In particular, for the former case, model compressibility is closely related to the feature representations of the training dataset in terms of model capacity. I would assume that the considered compressibility is restricted to a fine-tuning procedure; however, a clearer introduction to the model compression setup is needed before the discussion of compressibility.\n\n**W2: Representation of sensitivity along a small number of directions.**\n\nThe authors claim that structured compression induces high sensitivity to adversarial perturbations along a small number of directions. However, this conclusion cannot be directly drawn merely from the observed correlation between compressibility and adversarial robustness. Lines 216–223 explain that the potent attack directions are determined by interlayer alignment; however, these directions are neither visualized nor formally defined.\n\n**W3: Unclear explanation for the amplification of adversarial attacks in the representation space.**\n\nThe authors attribute the high adversarial vulnerability of compressed models to amplification along certain sensitive directions.

However, many prior approaches achieve better preservation of both standard accuracy and adversarial robustness simultaneously during structured model pruning [1,2,3].
