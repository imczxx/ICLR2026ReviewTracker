An Investigation of Search Methods on Expensive Black-box Optimisation Problems", "abstract": "Many real-world optimisation problems are black-box in the sense that the structure of their objective function is not accessible or exploitable. Some of such Black-Box Optimisation (BBO) problems are also expensive, thanks to the use of simulations, experiments or costly computations to evaluate a solution (i.e., calculate its objective function value). Despite the prevalence of expensive BBO, different practical scenarios may require different computational resources and search budgets. In some scenarios, evaluating a solution may take hours or days (e.g., in drug design), allowing generating only a few hundred solutions at most, while in some other scenarios, the budget is more generous in which evaluating a solution takes a couple of minutes (e.g., in software configuration tuning), hence allowing a few thousand solutions to be generated. Consequently, a relevant question is that among various popular search methods for BBO (e.g., Bayesian optimisation and evolutionary algorithms), which one is the first choice for practitioners to use under different levels of tightness of their budget, and also what if some domain knowledge of the problem (e.g., ruggedness level of the search space) is available. \n\nIn this paper, we aim to answer these questions. Through an extensive experimental study on a suite of test functions with various features, we observe that some methods which were believed unsuitable for expensive BBO are actually competitive under certain circumstances; for example, Nelder Mead on small-size problems with simple landscapes under fairly tight budgets (e.g., 200--800 evaluations) and CMA-ES on medium-sized problems under fairly generous budgets (e.g., $\\geq$800). On the other hand, Bayesian optimisation methods perform consistently well under very tight budgets (e.g., $\\leq$200) regardless of problem attributes and characteristics.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Black-Box optimisation", "Search methods", "Bayesian optimisation", "Evolutionary algorithms", "Local search"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/53993097cd68ff8e02e00c57766761aa213df75d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the problem of choosing the right algorithm for black box optimisation problems.

I assume, based on the sparsity of information, that the authors have simply used whatever settings (acquisition function, GP kernel etc) are provided out of the box. While this is not necessarily unreasonable (many - perhaps even most - users will apply BO precisely like this, for better or worse) I feel it is important to at least describe these settings. For example is \"vanilla-BO\" using EI (expected improvement)?  GP-UCB (GP upper conficence bound in one of its many variants)? Thompson sampling? I'm also guessing the kernel (covariance) is an SE kernel with lengthscale tuned for log-likelihood, based both on experience and comments on line 362, but this really needs to be defined explicitly.\n\nOne other (related) point of weakness is section 4.3. In BO, knowledge of problem characteristics is often used to achieve a substantial speedup (or just avoid a slowdown). In particular kernel selection should reflect knowledge of the problem domain - eg smooth functions are well suited to an SE kernel, whereas if you have \"sharp edges\" then a (lower-order) Matern may be preferred; separable variables may lead you to prefer a Laplacian kernel or a product of kernels on different axis; and awareness of local structure may lead you to use some variation of kernel localization.

For instance, if the time complexity of each function evaluation is less than O(n^3) - the time complexity of BO, then its advantage in the tight budget setting is questionable. \n- Overall, the paper is well-written, but a few minor points could be improved.

The benchmarks used are synthetic and noise-free.

In a real scenario, a user may not know these properties of their objective function upfront. What do the authors suggest for a practitioner to identify, for example, that their problem has a “weak global structure” or is “highly conditioned”?
