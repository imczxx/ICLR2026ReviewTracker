In this work, we introduce a multi-modal framework that integrates sequence embeddings from a pre-trained protein language model (e.g., ESM-C) with topology-informed descriptors derived from peptide conformations. We generate peptide conformers using molecular dynamics simulations and RDKit-based methods, and from these conformations we compute persistent homology invariants, Betti numbers, geometric statistics, and residue connectivity measures. These topological features are then fused with sequence embeddings through a cross-attention mechanism, allowing the model to capture both local sequence patterns and global conformational organization.

The key idea is to fuse information from two distinct modalities: sequence embeddings from a pre-trained protein language model (e.g., ESM-C) and topology-informed structural descriptors. To obtain the topological features, the authors first generate 3D conformers of the peptides using RDKit. From these conformations, they compute a suite of descriptors, including contact maps, interface geometry, distance statistics, and, most notably, persistent homology invariants. A sophisticated fusion mechanism is proposed to integrate these two modalities. It employs a bi-directional cross-attention module to align the token-level sequence embeddings with the topology features (represented as pseudo-tokens). The outputs are then combined using an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) layer and a final gating mechanism. The authors evaluate TopoMHC on a curated dataset for the HLA-A*02:01 allele. The results demonstrate that TopoMHC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong sequence-based baselines like NetMHCpan-4.0.

This makes the work reproducible and the architecture easy to understand.\n\n3. The ablation study (Table 2) provides clear evidence that the multi-modal fusion is effective. The performance of the full model is demonstrably better than the strong ESM-only baseline, confirming the utility of the topological features."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.The model is only evaluated on a single MHC allele type. The MHC system is characterized by extreme polymorphism (thousands of alleles), and pan-allele generalization is the central challenge in the field. The paper's own introduction criticizes older models for \"generalizing poorly across alleles\", yet it provides no evidence that TopoMHC performs well on any allele besides the one it was trained on. This severely limits the scope and impact of the SOTA claim.\n\n2. The topological feature pipeline adds substantial computational cost (generating 10 conformers per peptide, running UFF optimization, computing persistent homology). It is debatable whether the modest gain (over NetMHC)  justifies the significant increase in computational and methodological complexity for practical applications like large-scale screening.\n\n3. There is a major contradiction in the paper's description of its inputs, which raises some questions about the methodology. This is detailed in \"Questions\" below."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Is this model for peptide-MHC binding or antibody-antigen binding? If it is for peptide-MHC, why do the methods sections repeatedly refer to \"antibody\" and \"antigen\"? If $S_a$ is the peptide and $S_g$ is the MHC, the method for obtaining and using the MHC structure to calculate interface features is completely missing from the conformation generation section. Please clarify this fundamental point, as it is currently impossible to be certain what the model is actually doing.\n\n2. Given the single-allele type evaluation, how do the authors expect the model to generalize? The topological features appear to be generated from the peptide alone (per Sec 3.3 ).
