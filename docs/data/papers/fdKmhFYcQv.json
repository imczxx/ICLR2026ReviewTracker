Multi-agent LLM frameworks such as TradingAgent and FINMEM augment these models to long-horizon investment tasks by leveraging fundamental and sentiment-based inputs for strategic decision-making. However, these approaches are ill-suited for the high-speed, precision-critical demands of *High-Frequency Trading* (HFT).\nHFT typically requires rapid, risk-aware decisions driven by structured, short-horizon signals, such as technical indicators, chart patterns, and trend features. These signals stand in sharp contrast to the long-horizon, text-driven reasoning that characterizes most existing LLM-based systems in finance. To bridge this gap, we introduce **QuantAgent**, the first multi-agent LLM framework explicitly designed for high-frequency algorithmic trading. The system decomposes trading into four specialized agents, *Indicator*, *Pattern*, *Trend*, and *Risk*, each equipped with domain-specific tools and structured reasoning capabilities to capture distinct aspects of market dynamics over short temporal windows. Extensive experiments across nine financial instruments, including Bitcoin and Nasdaq futures, demonstrate that QuantAgent consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher predictive accuracy at both 1-hour and 4-hour trading intervals across multiple evaluation metrics. Our findings suggest that coupling structured trading signals with LLM-based reasoning provides a viable path for traceable, real-time decision systems in high-frequency financial markets.

High-frequency trading typically involves sub-second decision cycles, co-location services, direct market access, and ultra-low-latency infrastructure, none of which are present here. Therefore, the “high-frequency” claim is misleading. The proposed setup resembles a conventional daily-trading or intraday backtesting framework, and if without the HFT label, some existing benchmark and baselines (such as FinMem, FinAgent) should be added to support the claim.\n\n>Yu, Yangyang, et al. \"Finmem: A performance-enhanced llm trading agent with layered memory and character design.\" IEEE Transactions on Big Data (2025).\n\n>Zhang, Wentao, et al. \"A multimodal foundation agent for financial trading: Tool-augmented, diversified, and generalist.\" Proceedings of the 30th acm sigkdd conference on knowledge discovery and data mining. 2024.\n\n- Follow up the previous point, the framework still lacks proper baselines. Even ignoring the incorrect HFT framing, there are no comparisons against standard quantitative-trading strategies such as pairs trading, mean-reversion, or momentum-based methods, nor against reinforcement-learning-based trading agents. Without such baselines, it is impossible to gauge how the framework performs relative to established approaches.\n\n- The evaluation design is weak. It does not include core backtesting metrics such as Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, or maximum drawdown, and ignores essential trading factors like commission fees, slippage, and liquidity limits. This omission makes the profitability results unreliable and economically meaningless.\n\n- There is no report of latency or computational timing to justify the system’s claimed high-frequency capability. The entire “multi-agent” loop (analyst–trader–evaluator) could take seconds or minutes per decision, yet the paper provides no latency measurements or runtime analysis. Without this, the HFT claim collapses.\n\n- There is no ablation or sensitivity analysis, and the multi-agent design lacks clear justification. The paper does not test how many agents are necessary, whether they provide complementary perspectives, or if a single-agent setup would yield comparable results. The agent roles appear arbitrary and unverified. This weakens the overall methodological credibility and suggests the “multi-agent” design may add unnecessary complexity without real gain."}, "questions": {"value": "- What is the actual latency (in milliseconds or seconds) of a full agent loop from market data input to trade decision?\n\n- Why are H1 and H4 intervals referred to as “high-frequency”?

Fundamental Misnomer of \"High-Frequency Trading\". This is the paper's most significant flaw. The title and abstract claim the system is for HFT, which in finance implies microsecond-to-millisecond-level operations based on order book data. The experiments are conducted on 1-hour and 4-hour bars. This is not HFT; it is, at best, \"intraday\" or \"short-term\" algorithmic trading. This misrepresentation undermines the paper's framing, as the latencies of this system are completely unaddressed and would be orders of magnitude too slow for true HFT. \n\nThe paper completely ignores the computational cost and, more importantly, the end-to-end latency of this system. A pipeline that chains multiple LLM calls, including image generation and multimodal analysis, likely takes several seconds to run. This is a critical omission for a paper claiming relevance to high-speed trading.\n\n2. Key Logic is Unexplained (Risk/Decision): The logic for the two most critical agents is poorly defined.\nThe RiskAgent \"predicts\" a risk-reward ratio from a fixed range of [1.2, 1.8]. How? This is a crucial parameter for profitability. Is it a random choice? Is the LLM prompted to \"pick a number\"? This is left entirely to the reader's imagination.\nThe DecisionAgent's prompt (Appendix B.4) provides high-level heuristics (\"Act only on confirmed, aligned signals\") but doesn't formalize how conflicts are resolved, which is the entire purpose of an aggregation agent.\n\n3. The benchmark models. There are several classic model such as AS model and GLFT model in HFT. You may want to use these to compare the performance. \n\n4.Unspecified Chart Generation Parameters: The patterns agent performance is fundamentally dependent on the chart it \"sees.\" A critical parameter for this is the lookback window."}, "questions": {"value": "What is the end-to-end latency for the full QuantAgent pipeline (from new bar data to final decision)?
