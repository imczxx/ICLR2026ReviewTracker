Efficiently selecting the correct LoRA adapter for a given input remains a challenge, particularly in secure environments where supervised training of routers may raise privacy concerns. Motivated by previous approaches, we formalize the goal of unsupervised LoRA routing in terms of activation norm maximization, providing a theoretical framework for analysis. We demonstrate the discriminative power of activation norms and introduce SEQR, an unsupervised LoRA routing algorithm designed to maximize efficiency while providing strict routing guarantees. SEQR provably identifies the norm-maximizing adapter with significantly greater efficiency, making it a highly scalable and effective solution for dynamic LoRA composition.

The paper's formalization of unsupervised routing as an activation norm-maximization problem provides a clear and valuable framework. The subsequent theoretical analysis, including proofs that SPECTR and SEQR are norm-maximizing while ARROW is not, adds significant rigor and clarifies the behaviors of these methods.\n\n2. SEQR demonstrates a significant improvement in computational and storage efficiency over existing methods that offer similar routing guarantees, as shown in the complexity analysis and empirical measurements. This makes the method highly practical for real-world scenarios involving large libraries of LoRA adapters, directly addressing a key challenge in the field."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The entire SEQR framework is built upon the assumption that a single, frozen, randomly initialized A matrix is sufficient for training diverse adapters. While the paper shows this holds for the tested tasks, this constraint might limit performance when fine-tuning for highly dissimilar or complex tasks where a unique A matrix could capture important task-specific input transformations.\n\n2. The paper posits activation norm-maximization as the primary goal for unsupervised routing. While intuitive and empirically supported, this objective may not be universally optimal. It is possible for an adapter to produce the highest activation norm without yielding the best task-specific performance, especially in cases of model miscalibration or overfitting.\n\n3. SEQR requires an offline calibration step that computes and stores the mean (µ_i) and standard deviation (σ_i) of activation norms from each adapter's training data. While this avoids training a cross-silo router, these statistics themselves are derivatives of the private data and could potentially leak information about the data distribution.\n\n4. According to Table 3 and footnote 5, the average performance improvement of SEQR over LAG (k=3) is small (93.5 vs 92.9), and the difference is not statistically significant (p=0.096). This suggests that SEQR's primary advantage is its efficiency, not necessarily superior task performance over a well-configured LAG.\n\n5. The paper compares SEQR (which requires a shared A) against baselines like ARROW and LAG. It is unclear if these baselines were evaluated using adapters with unique A matrices (their standard formulation) or shared A matrices in the final performance table (Table 3), which impacts the fairness of the storage and computational comparisons."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "Null."}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "73hKlUw92V", "forum": "xHR7UJSURC", "replyto": "xHR7UJSURC", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14474/Reviewer_jhfQ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14474/Reviewer_jhfQ"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14474/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761411279323, "cdate": 1761411279323, "tmdate": 1762924874829, "mdate": 1762924874829, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "In secure environments, supervised router training may lead to privacy leakage.
