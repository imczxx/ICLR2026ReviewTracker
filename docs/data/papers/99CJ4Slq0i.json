Existing VTA methods either offer multi-modal control with weak temporal alignment or achieve strong alignment while lacking reference audio conditioning and semantic precision. FoleyGenEx bridges this gap through three key innovations: a conditional injection mechanism enabling audio-controlled VTA and Foley extension, a multi-modal dynamic masking strategy preserving synchronization during multi-modal training, and an adverb-based data augmentation algorithm leveraging signal processing and large language models to enrich audio representations and textual supervision with nuanced semantic cues. Experiments on AudioCaps, VGGSound, and Greatest Hits show that FoleyGenEx delivers competitive performance in controllable VTA generation, achieving strong temporal fidelity, versatile multi-modal control, and fine-grained semantic precision compared to existing methods.

The proposed model is based on MMAudio and is modified to accept reference audio as input for audio-conditioned video-to-audio generation. For training, the authors also propose a new data augmentation strategy to enhance the controllability of the model. This strategy focuses on several specific types of adverbs appearing in the text prompt and augments both the text and the corresponding audio so that the augmentation process creates another pair of text and audio with different characteristics in terms of the semantics specified by the target adverb.

Maybe this is due to an insufficient amount of samples containing such adverbs in the text prompt.\n  - The proposed augmentation boosts the model’s performance on the dedicated test set (Table 6), but this is expected since the model is trained to perform well on such datasets. I'm not that convinced that this test set is represetative of real-world scenarios for controllable video-to-audio.\n  - Therefore, to demonstrate the significance of the proposed augmentation, providing empirical evidence on the importance of adverbs is essential.\n- Since the architecture of the proposed model is largely based on MMAudio, it would be beneficial to include a list that explicitly describes the modifications made to MMAudio."}, "questions": {"value": "- Why do the authors focus on adverbs for higher controllability?\n  - How did the authors choose the specific set of adverbs shown in Figure 4?\n- Could you provide a list of modifications from MMAudio?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "OJyryOGNTa", "forum": "99CJ4Slq0i", "replyto": "99CJ4Slq0i", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9395/Reviewer_KTNo"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9395/Reviewer_KTNo"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9395/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761609141913, "cdate": 1761609141913, "tmdate": 1762921004618, "mdate": 1762921004618, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces FoleyGenEx, a model that extends MMAudio to incorporate audio conditioning for reference-based video-to-audio synthesis and foley extention.

Lack of Clarity in Model Architecture and Training: The paper's illustrations and descriptions of the model are insufficient for reproducibility and full comprehension. Figure 2, which should clarify the training process, is confusing; the data flow is not apparent, and the purpose of the block labeled \"Flow\" is ambiguous. It is also unclear whether the method involves full fine-tuning or a parameter-efficient approach with frozen components. Figure 3 suffers from similar clarity issues, as the input configurations for different conditional modes (e.g., (2) vs. (3)) are visually indistinguishable. The precise definitions and differences between key feature notations, such as F_S and F_{RS}, are not adequately explained.\n\n2. Insufficient Technical Detail and Unclear Novelty: The paper's primary contributions—the conditional injection mechanism and the dynamic masking strategy—are not described in enough technical detail. The current descriptions are too high-level, and it is difficult to understand their precise implementation. Established techniques like concatenation with latent variables or cross-attention are widely used for conditional control. The paper fails to articulate what makes its proposed mechanisms novel compared to this extensive body of prior work. This ambiguity fundamentally undermines the paper's claimed contributions.\n\n3. Questionable Validity of Data Augmentation: The proposed data augmentation method, which involves speeding up audio clips, is not convincingly justified. Altering the speed of an audio signal can easily introduce significant artifacts and degrade acoustic quality, potentially providing a noisy or misleading training signal. The authors provide no analysis to demonstrate that this technique preserves the essential foley characteristics or that the augmented data is of sufficient quality to benefit the model.\n\n4. Limited Perceptible Improvement in Audio Quality: A subjective listening comparison of the audio samples provided for FoleyGenEx and the baseline (MultiFoley) reveals no clear or significant improvement. The qualitative results are highly similar, which calls into question the practical effectiveness of the proposed method. This lack of a discernible advantage in the final output fails to support the paper's claims of superiority."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

In Figure 3, could you explicitly define the feature representations F_S and F_{RS} and explain how they differ in each of the illustrated modes? For example, what is the exact input difference between mode (2) and mode (3)?\n\n3. I strongly recommend a thorough revision of Figures 2 and 3 to ensure they are self-contained and clearly illustrate the data flow, the state of inputs (e.g., zeroed-out, masked), and the role of each component.\n\n4.

To substantiate your claims of novelty, please add a subsection to the paper that explicitly compares your proposed mechanisms to prior work, highlighting the specific architectural or functional innovations.\n\n6.

The paper would be strengthened by including evidence of the augmentation's validity. This could be in the form of objective quality metrics or a small perceptual study comparing original and augmented audio samples.\n\n7. Given that the audio samples sound qualitatively similar to the baseline, could you point to specific acoustic characteristics (e.g., temporal alignment, texture, clarity) in your results that demonstrate a clear improvement?
