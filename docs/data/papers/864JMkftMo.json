However, a fundamental limitation of any single spectroscopic modality is that it provides an inherently circumscribed and fragmented view, capturing only specific facets of the complete molecular structure, which is often insufficient for unequivocal and robust characterization. Consequently, the integration of data from multiple spectroscopic sources is imperative to overcome these intrinsic limitations and achieve a comprehensive and accurate structural characterization. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{MSpecTmol}, a novel \\textbf{M}ulti-modal \\textbf{Spec}trum information fusion learning framework for \\textbf{Mol}ecule structure elucidation. By extending information bottleneck theory, our framework provides a principled and adaptive approach to fusing spectra. It designates a primary modality to extract core molecular features while leveraging auxiliary inputs to enrich the representation. To validate the end-to-end effectiveness of our framework, we design a two-fold evaluation: molecular substructure classification to probe its discriminative power in identifying substructures, and extends this knowledge to reconstruct plausible 3D structures. Our results not only demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in molecular substructure classification but also achieve near-experimental accuracy (\\textasciitilde 0.68\\AA) in molecular conformation reconstruction. These findings underscore the model’s capacity to learn interpretable features aligned with chemical intuition, thereby paving the way for future advances in automated and reliable spectroscopic analysis.

The key claim is that other models only use individual spectroscopic, which didn't consider models like DffSpectra, SpectraLLM, MMST, and older models such as spec2struct.

In this case, you should compare similar multimodal models. \n2. For the classification tasks, the F1 score is not enough, especially for imbalanced datasets. The paper should show more metrics under this reason, and analyze the dataset distribution \n3. The design ofthe primary-auxiliary encoding module may be sensitive to the primary modality. The paper didn't analyze the effectiveness of the symmetric fusion for these two modalities. The selection of modalities is also important , such as why we select the IR as the main modality. In conclusion, the paper's ablation study is still weak, leak the design rational of each module in the framework.4.Some writing tips: the equation (9) is a repeatition of (1), you can just reference equation (1); the font in the figure should be consistent with that in the main text, it is better to use selectable text format in the figure (e.g. using pdf format for figure), otherwise some tiny text can not be seen in the figure."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

The generalization of the model to larger or noisier molecules remains unclear.
