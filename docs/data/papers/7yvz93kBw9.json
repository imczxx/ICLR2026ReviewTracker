However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework \\modelname{}, comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality and robustness under sparse view conditions.

The method relies heavily on manually designed depth thresholds, which may limit its adaptability to scenes with large domain variation.

Beyond analyzing the Gaussian distribution differences, more mechanistic experiments are needed to explain the underlying reason for the improvement.\n\n3. The observation in Figure 1 regarding the depth distribution of Gaussian primitives is presented as a single example and lacks statistical analysis, making it insufficient to demonstrate the generality of the phenomenon.\n\n4. The method relies on monocular depth estimation to generate masks and compute drop ratios; however, it does not account for potential inconsistencies between monocular depth maps across multiple input views, which could cause conflicting depth values and adversely affect Gaussian dropout and reconstruction quality.\n\n5.
