While hierarchical approaches attempt to address this by decomposing tasks into high-level subgoals, most existing methods rely on two-level architectures with separate networks, leading to fundamental limitations: they generate only a single intermediate subgoal, leading the low-level policy to act without awareness of the final goal when misled by erroneous subgoals, and prevent end-to-end optimization due to separate training objectives. We discover a novel solution to these challenges through chain-of-thought reasoning from large language models. Building on this insight, we introduce the Chain-of-Goals Hierarchical Policy (CoGHP), a new framework that reformulates hierarchical control as autoregressive sequence generation within a single unified architecture. CoGHP generates a sequence of latent subgoals and the primitive action in a single forward pass, where each subgoal acts as a \"reasoning token\" encoding intermediate decision-making. To implement this chain-of-thought approach in hierarchical RL, we pioneer the use of the MLP-Mixer architecture. This design enables efficient cross-token communication through simple feedforward operations and captures consistent structural relationships essential for hierarchical reasoning. Experimental results on challenging navigation and manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that CoGHP consistently outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for long-horizon offline control tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Offline Reinforcement Learning", "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9568a91caa45b96a0e3c5ff3c4fb502b6117f8f8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6031caa15f257c4f098367418e28f88006d6c451.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Chain-of-Goals Hierarchical Policy (CoGHP), a framework for offline goal-conditioned RL.

These gains are consistent with the claim that multi-step intermediate guidance helps long-horizon tasks.\n\n* The ablations are helpful.

The chain-of-thought analogy is evocative, but the subgoals are supervised by fixed k-step future states from trajectories. This is closer to structured imitation with value-based weighting than to learned reasoning.\nThe methodology introduces potential train–test mismatch. Training uses teacher forcing with ground-truth subgoals, while inference relies on the model’s own subgoal predictions. The paper acknowledges teacher forcing but does not quantify error accumulation or compare against scheduled sampling or consistency regularizers designed for autoregressive rollouts.\n\n* Some comparisons and analyses feel underdeveloped. The claim that Transformers are less suitable is asserted and supported by a single ablation, but hyperparameter parity and capacity normalization are not deeply probed. It is also unclear how sensitive results are to the choice of k for subgoal extraction, to the advantage temperature, and to the exact weighting between subgoal and action losses. The experiments report strong headline numbers, yet each environment evaluates only five predefined state–goal pairs and success rates are averaged across eight seeds, which makes the statistical picture somewhat narrow. More per-task breakdowns or success-vs-horizon plots would improve confidence.\n\n* On the representation side, most subgoals are encoded future states.

For example, report success when the policy is rolled out with its own predicted subgoals but trained without teacher forcing, or include scheduled sampling. A plot of success vs rollout depth of predicted subgoals would clarify compounding error.\n\n* What is the effect of the causal mixer relative to simpler positional encodings or strictly triangular masking without learnable mixing? An ablation that replaces the causal mixer with fixed lower-triangular averaging could isolate the benefit of learnability.\n\n* How fair and capacity-matched are the Transformer baselines? Please provide layer counts, parameter totals, token dimensions, and training curves for Mixer vs Transformer across tasks to rule out under-tuning.\n   \n* Do results hold when evaluating on larger sets of randomly sampled state–goal pairs and under distribution shift in goals?
