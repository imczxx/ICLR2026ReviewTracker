However, most existing FL frameworks assume that clients train on static local datasets collected in advance or that the data follows a fixed underlying distribution, which limits their applicability in dynamic environments where data evolves over time. A parallel line of research, online FL, removes all assumptions and adopts an adversarial perspective, but this approach is often overly pessimistic and neglects the structured, partially predictable nature of real-world data dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose SFedPO, a streaming federated learning framework that incorporates a prediction oracle to capture the temporal evolution of client-side data distributions. We theoretically analyze the convergence bounds of SFedPO and develop two practical sampling strategies: a Distribution-guided Data Sampling (DDS) strategy that dynamically selects training data under limited storage by balancing historical reuse and distribution adaptation, and a Shift-aware Aggregation Weights (SAW) mechanism that modulates global aggregation based on client-specific sampling behaviors. We further establish robustness guarantees under prediction errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFedPO effectively adapts to streaming scenarios with distribution shifts and significantly outperforms existing methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["federated learning", "prediction oracle", "distribution shift"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a053f2083a1faa643aa3b3c6c128a94d7fe91bca.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/aa461e692af4ab3aaaee80e2d04cdcefad630974.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes SFedPO, a framework designed for FL under streaming data distributions by leveraging partial predictions about clients' data distribution shifts to guide both local data sampling and global aggregation.
