However, there is limited research assessing multiway information interactions in the brain and deep neural networks, particularly regarding how information changes in each layer of neural networks. In this study, we explore redundancy representation in biological and standard deep convolutional neural networks. Firstly, we demonstrate that multiway information interaction, it can be quantified using  total correlation, which indeed take precedence over pairwise metrics. Secondly, we propose that the data processing inequality holds in both biological vision and deep neural networks, and it confirms parallel information processing in the visual brain and deep neural networks. Furthermore, we observe that redundant information dominates in the early layers of the visual brain, while synergistic features gradually emerge in both the deeper layers of the visual cortex and deep neural networks, suggesting that general convolutional neural nets exhibit behavior similar to sensory information encoding in the primate visual brain.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["multiway information interactions", "redundancy representation", "total correlation", "data processing inequality", "synergistic"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b3357bb671f38869401ff388de1a5332697ec79d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes to measure total correlation (TC) in cortical and artificial neural networks to understand information processing from the perspective of redundancy.

Indeed, information-theoretic analyses of (deep) learning systems are promising avenues to better understand neural networks, and papers on redundancy/synergy are still on the rise. Hence, the topic is absolutely timely. Furthermore, the inclusion of neurological data is a welcome addition."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I have several comments that currently prevent me from recommending acceptance:\n- The paper only presents anecdotal evidence, as results are presented for only a single ANN and with only a single dataset. It is hence unclear if these results generalize to other architectures and tasks. While this anecdotal evidence is certainly interesting, I have the feeling that it does not meet the bar of a top-ranked conference yet.\n- In parts, the conclusions seem to be conflicting. For example:\n   - In Fig. 4 it is claimed that MI estimates are not reliable. At the same time, these MI estimates are used to show the DPI in Section 3.2.2. Does that mean that the results in Section 3.2.2 are unreliable?\n   - The statement \"we observe [...] in both the visual brain and DNNs [...] growing tendency to incorporate synergistic features\" is in conflict with the numbers, which are negative for the visual brain but positive for the DNN. Did I misunderstand something?\n- Some of the claims are not supported by sufficient evidence. For example, \n   - With reference to Fig. 4, for MI no theoretical value is plotted. Hence, the conclusion that \"the estimations from MI are incorrect and have less sensitivity to connectivity\" is not supported. Indeed, MI and TC are different concepts, and it is clear that one could be more strongly influenced by connectivity than the other. It is important, though, to compare the estimators of MI and TC with their ground truth value to see if they can be reliably estimated. Whether one _should_ estimate MI or TC is a different question, but that question can not be answered by comparing estimators only to the theoretical values of TC.\n   - Any statement about synergy is unsupported. Synergy is not the opposite of redundancy, indeed, partial information decomposition considers redundant, synergistic and unique information. A reduction of redundancy can be due an increase of synergy or an increase of unique information.\n   - The statement \"deeper layers [...] foster a smooth interaction that boosts overall perception\" is vague (what does smooth interaction mean? what does boost perception mean?) and speculative. If at all, it better fits inside the discussion section.\n- The mathematics are not always clear. For example:\n  - (3) could be derived in some appendix, or the reference to Laparra et al. could be more concrete, pointing to a theorem or an equation there. Similarly, the same holds for the offset equation  ($TC= C+J-J_m$) between (6) and (7). The terms $J$ and $J_m$ should also be defined in equations, and not only in text. In (7), the sum apparently runs over both logarithms, so brackets are missing.\n   - An important missing investigation is how the TC-RBIG estimate is affected by the dimensionality of the latent representation. Total correlation in itself is affected by the dimensionality of the data (at least under the assumption of almost lossless transformations). In addition, it would be important to study how the estimate of TC is affected by dimensionality. I understand that the dimensionalities used in Fig. 4 are quite small compared to those in the experiments, so a sensitivity analysis on synthetic data (where the true TC is known) is essential.\n   - The experimental setup, i.e., how TC estimates are calculated precisely, is missing. As such, the experiments are not reproducible from the text.\n- The writing style is sloppy at some occasions and requires revisions (e.g., lines 256-262).\n\nMinor points:\n- In Fig. 1 it is not clear how subfigure B is related to TC, as claimed in the caption.\n- The abbreviation DNN is introduced but only rarely used in the paper.\n- The text around eq. (1) apparently assumes continuous RVs/distributions, but this is not stated explicitly.\n- In (4) a line break seems to be missing.\n- log should be replaced by \\log.\n- In Fig. 4, the legend entry \"I-RBIG\" is not clear.\n- citet is consistently used throughout the paper, while in several occasions citep is more appropriate."}, "questions": {"value": "Please mainly respond to the weaknesses above, which have some implicit questions.

Laparra et al. (2025) who proposed the RBIG estimator used by the authors also applied their total correlation RBIG estimator to visual area data.  \n    - Claimed contribution 2 “Demonstrated the limitations of pairwise metrics by showing their insensitivity to capturing high-order dependencies” that pairwise values can be misleading is straightforward\n    - contribution 3 “Revealed functional parallels and distinctions between deep neural networks and the visual brain through high-order redundancy analysis, offering new insights into their internal representations.”  My understanding was that the parallels were not functional (that may have been hinted through the set up and presentation).  There was a single data set used and no discussion on findings from the neuroscience community were discussed. \n\n\n- Section 2 “THEORETICAL ANALYSIS” appears to be entirely background material\n    - 2.1 is total correlation (from (Watanabe, 1960))\n    - 2.2 is a total correlation estimator from Laparra et al. (2025)\n    - 2.3 is just stating the classic data processing inequality.\n\n- Section 3.1 appears to be two pages for a single toy synthetic system, where the main conclusion is that total correlation is different than Pearson correlation.\n\n- Section 3.2.2\n    - a feedforward CNN will satisfy the DPI by its design.  It is unclear why this is measured, unless the intention is to draw connections (not discussed in the section) about how the values might relate between the two tables.  \n    - the question of how information flows in the visual cortex has been studied by neuroscientists for decades but there is no discussion of even classic let alone recent neuroscience findings on the human visual system.  \n    -  I do not understand the point of using the same stimuli for both the CNN as was used to collect the fMRI data for the point of assessing DPI.  \n- ‘redundancy’ in particular and ‘synergy’ as well are referred to throughout the paper, but I don’t think were formally/clearly defined.   \n    - Line 362 mentions that for Table 4 “positive increments indicate a sort of synergy.”\n- Claims made are too strong for the level of exploration carried out.  Line 388 “From numerical and real experimental results, it was proven that TC are superior to pairwise metrics. Subsequently, we applied them to solve real biological problems and discovered some very interesting issues.”\n## Minor\n- lines 057-059 “our primary objectives include quantifying redundant information in both t the brain and DNNs,”  is far more ambitious of a objective than the work done supports.\n- lines 61-62 what is “independent redundancy”?\n- The figures need revision – several are low resolution (esp Fig 4 and Fig 5), have fonts that do not match main paper font sizing\n- Fig 1\n    - I do not understand what is being shown.  There is clearly visual distinctions between each element, but eg what do Venn diagrams, which show overlap between sets, depict higher-order interactions (namely, the figure should make it clear what the sets are such that the intersection corresponds to something to be conveyed)\n    - for (A), why are neuron interactions depicted as undirected (hyper) edges?  Aren’t edges directed in biological and artificial neural networks?\n\n- Fig 5\n    - Sizing/resolution issues\n    - There are too many different parts to this image, I find it challenging to read/understand.  At the least this could be broken up into parts with better labeling.\n    - is the depiction of the human supposed to show an analog of the CNN architecture?  If so, that is not clear.\n   - what do the numbers in the boxes of “Pairwise” and “Higher-Order Triadic” information mean?  Is the point of that just to show there are many more possible triads than pairs (105^2 pairs and 105^3 triplets)\n    - for those boxes, shouldn’t it be $n \\choose k$ instead of $n^k$? eg for pairwise there is no notion of order (equivalently mutual information is symmetric in its argument).   Or is the ordered counting supposed to be based on directed edges (that say the bottom left subfigure with edges T1 $\\to$ T2 and vice versa are ordered, and you want to emphasize I(T1:T2) captures both?  If so, then how the triadic enumerations (6 orderings of {T1, T2, T3}) correspond to the colorings of the edges in the figure in the bottom row is unclear to me.  \n\n## Very Minor\n- the authors use in text citations throughout in places parenthetical citations should be used.  eg linke 037 should be “… brain functions (Wang et al., 2023; Li et al. …)”\n- Fig 1 text in the image font size should be increased\n- line 257 “is way more appropriate”\n- line 316 “Considering that the internal representation may contain some amount of noise,” which of the systems is that referring to? AlexNet?\n- line 385 “The representation of access information”\n- line 388 “Therefore, TC were applied”"}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 0}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Ib3WLjPu2y", "forum": "26Ix0Yz4bW", "replyto": "26Ix0Yz4bW", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8196/Reviewer_GVvC"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8196/Reviewer_GVvC"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8196/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762223596865, "cdate": 1762223596865, "tmdate": 1762920150941, "mdate": 1762920150941, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
