Items in datasets are reduced to labeled entries, disregarding the multidimensional properties they reveal when examined across model populations. Models, in turn, are summarized by overall scores such as accuracy, neglecting performance patterns that can only be captured through diverse data item interactions. To address this gap, this paper conceptualizes LLMs as composed of invisible memes, understood as cultural genes in the sense of Dawkins that function as replicating units of knowledge and behavior. Building on this perspective, the Probing Memes paradigm reconceptualizes evaluation as an entangled world of models and data. At its core lies the perception matrix, which captures interaction patterns and enables two complementary abstractions: probe properties, extending dataset characterization beyond labels, and phemotypes, revealing fine-grained capability structures of models. Applied to 9 datasets and 4,507 LLMs, Probing Memes reveals hidden capability structures and reveals phenomena invisible under traditional paradigms (e.g., elite models failing on problems that most models answer easily). This paradigm not only supports more informative, extensible, and fair benchmarks but also lays the foundation for population-based evaluation of LLMs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Meme", "Large Language Model", "Evaluation", "Probe", "Paradigm"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1aa51d3d5b553be1334da2c4a510cb2bd37169c1.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d0f4fc32a792ea8781b6f00a1938c800bbc7b9e2.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Probing Memes, an evaluation paradigm that jointly considers individual samples in the dataset and models evaluated on them, in contrast to the previous convention that only looks at a single model's performance aggregated over samples.

The novelty of this paper lies in the proposed two-dimensional (sample-model) evaluation. However, the novelty may be undermined by the fact that previous work has been using such analysis for specific purposes. For example, [a] defines and calculates the difficulty of samples in benchmark datasets, along with 52 LLMs of different sizes, to investigate emergent abilities. This raises concern about the insufficient discussion of and distinction from related work.\n\n2. This proposed paradigm relies on the assumption that there have been sufficiently many LLMs evaluated on the target dataset. If the number of LLMs is \"not enough,\" the values of probes will become unreliable. On the other hand, with more LLMs evaluated on the target dataset, the values of probes and phenotypes will change since they depend on the tested LLMs.\n\n3. I am concerned about this paper's framing. Terms like \"meme\", \"probe,\" and \"phenotype\" might be a bit distracting and imprecise. \n\n4. Discussions on experiments and findings seem not deep. For example, it is no surprise that there are samples with high surprise value in MMLU-pro. Can your paradigm help answer why this happens? Arguments for the practical value of this paradigm are insufficient and unclear. Another example: Given you find that \"probes in IFEval, GPQA-Diamond, and BBH exhibit relatively high uniqueness\" (line 431), what can we do next to make it not only a \"good to know\" thing?

Can you make a comparison of the definitions of memes in this paper and in The Selfish Gene? It's unclear to me how this term can be borrowed from the book.\n\n2. My current understanding regarding 1. is that a meme is a facet of LLM's ability (by line 79, \" From this perspective, the abilities of LLMs are conceptualized as composed of latent memes\"). In this case, are the proposed 7 kinds of probes only a small subset of an unknowingly big set of all memes?\n\n3. In Section 2.2, you define **uniqueness** through the averaged conditional entropy of two probes and define **ϕ-coefficient** to calculate the similarity of two probes. It seems to me that entropy (e.g., JS entropy) is also a natural metric to determine whether two probes should have an \"edge\". Is my understanding correct?\n\n4. In Figure 6, can you explain why Astuteness has nearly identical weight distribution over the three datasets?\n\n5. In line 429, you mention MMLU-pro has many samples with high surprise. Is this possibly due to the nature of MCQs? Assume a challenging question where a frontier LLM gets wrong. If a low-ability LLM simply randomly guesses all samples and thus picks the correct choice by chance, the surprise value of this question will be high.\n\n6. The statement in lines 461-462 is a bit abrupt and without any supporting argument. You can move this statement to the earlier section and support it with concrete examples—text only is ok; quantitative experiments are a huge improvement.\n\n7.

Several relevant papers have not been cited or referenced in this work. Flexibly defining new properties based on evaluation needs and the observation that datasets “contain a large number of seemingly simple questions that are nevertheless answered incorrectly by some elite models” are both insights established in [1]. Then, “models with similar accuracy may succeed on very different types of items” is adopted from [2]. Several of the meme probe properties are established frameworks already: difficulty has been defined and used in [3] as as the IRT model in [4](cited elsewhere in the paper), the  . Other forms of capabilities are tested by works such as [5].\n\n3. This work only considers binary (0,1) evaluations. Other works [1,4] take into consideration heterogeneous metrics such as accuracy (0/1), BLEU score ([0,1]) which is a more realistic setup, ensuring that the framework of evaluation takes into consideration all datasets.\n\n4. There is no insight into whether the phemotypes are correlated to each other and to what extent. This paper would benefit from quantitative studies to determine this.\n\nMinor\n1. Figure 5 and 6 are not easily interpretable, more details and insights would be beneficial.\n2. T-sne is known to result in spurious clusters. UMAP, on the other hand, preserves both local and global structure in the data and is a better algorithm for data visualisation. \n\n[1] Ghosh et al.
