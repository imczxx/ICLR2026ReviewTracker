We initially analyze the factors limiting diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: \\textbf{1)} the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and \\textbf{2)} the overly-sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Built on these insights, we propose \\textbf{DiverseAR}, a principle and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution across different sampling steps, resulting in a smoother prediction distribution and improved diversity. To mitigate the potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments highlight that DiverseAR can unlock greater diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Generative Model", "Autoregressive Image Generation", "Image Synthesis"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6c3a1a42c2377eaba931993f7fc52d3803529092.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/da419bafe07a6a83340cc15dd25a0170fbf7c4a9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces DiverseAR, a framework designed to enhance image diversity without sacrificing visual quality in bitwise autoregressive image generation models.

It would be helpful to discuss or analyze why improving diversity can simultaneously enhance visual quality in this setting.\n- In section 4.1 implementation details, the paper stated that \"For the remaining ones, we use argmax sampling to select the highest-probability bit at each position.\" Why is it different from the baseline which uses \"a fixed sampling temperature of 0.5\"?
