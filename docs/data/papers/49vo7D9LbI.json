In particular, they tend to experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data to further \"instantiate\" reasoning problems on potential variations. In this work, we instead focuses on the strategy of ``abstracting'' reasoning problems. This not only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. Focusing on GSM, we find that this abstraction process is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method, AbstRaL---which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular abstraction data---significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent GSM perturbation benchmarks. Besides, improving GSM robustness via AbstRaL is shown to also implicitly benefit LLMs' capabilities on OOD mathematical and general reasoning tasks, indicating that abstract thinking broadly enables better generalizability.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["large language models", "abstract reasoning", "robustness", "reinforcement learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cc239e2e8102d68f6e31bcda2af53e08d6bb6a91.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a novel reasoning technique that abstracts mathematical problems *before* solving them.

Instead of relying on extensive data augmentation (\"instantiation\"), the authors propose to explicitly teach LLMs to first generate an abstract representation of a problem. This abstraction, being invariant to surface-form variations, is intended to make the model more robust to OOD shifts like changes in numbers, names, or the addition of distractors. The core of the method involves a new, fine-grained data format called GranulAR and a RL scheme built on top of SFT.

The creation of the GranulAR data format, which blends socratic decomposition with symbolic abstraction, is a clever way to make the task more tractable for LLMs. The use of reinforcement learning with a custom symbolic distance reward (`rsymbolic`) to enforce faithfulness is a significant and novel part of the method."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  The framework's dependence on a vastly more powerful model (Llama-3.3-70B) for critical data generation steps is a major weakness. Both the initial \"Condition Recognition\" and the subsequent \"Abstract Reasoning Chain Rewriting\" are performed by this moel. This raises the concern that the improvements seen in smaller models are largely due to knowledge distillation from a superior model, rather than the inherent power of the AbstRaL learning scheme itself. \n\n2. The method is evaluated exclusively on grade school math problems, where the underlying abstractions (arithmetic operations) are simple and well-defined. It is highly uncertain how this framework would translate to more complex domains with ambiguous or non-mathematical abstractions, such as legal reasoning, commonsense planning, or scientific hypothesis generation. The paper does not discuss these limitations or provide a path toward generalization.\n\n3.   The primary comparison is between AbstRaL (SFT + RL) and baselines that are either prompting-based (CoT-8S) or SFT-only (CoA, AoT). The `w/o RL` ablation in Table 2 shows a massive performance drop, suggesting that the GranulAR data format with SFT alone is not very effective. A more direct and fair comparison would be between \"AbstRaL-SFT\" and other SFT-based abstraction methods. Furthermore, for the stronger Qwen2.5-Math-7B model, AbstRaL underperforms CoT-RL on the original, in-distribution data (91.0 vs 96.0), indicating a potential trade-off where improving OOD robustness comes at the cost of ID performance.\n\n4.  The paper claims that AbstRaL \"implicitly benefit more general reasoning capabilities.\" However, the results in Table 3 show that the improvements on general reasoning benchmarks like MMLU are marginal at best. The most significant gains are on other math-related datasets (MATH, AIME24), which is less surprising and does not fully support the claim of broad generalizability."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  How can you be sure that the performance gains are not primarily a result of distilling its superior reasoning capabilities into the smaller models? Have you tried using a weaker model as the oracle to see how that affects the final performance?\n\n2.  The `w/o RL` ablation shows that SFT on GranulAR data performs poorly, often worse than simple CoT prompting. Does this imply that the proposed abstraction format is too difficult for models to learn via SFT alone and that the complex RL setup is a necessary crutch? \n\n3.  Regarding the scalability to other domains: What do you foresee as the main challenges in applying AbstRaL to problems where the \"abstraction\" is not a simple mathematical formula? For example, in a commonsense reasoning task, what would the \"conditions\" C and the \"abstraction\" A look like, and how would they be reliably extracted?\n\n4.  For the strongest models, AbstRaL seems to trade in-distribution performance for OOD robustness (e.g., Table 1, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Origin 100). Do you consider this an inherent trade-off of the method? Why do you think this performance degradation on the original task occurs?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "zUyHwurYGC", "forum": "49vo7D9LbI", "replyto": "49vo7D9LbI", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13089/Reviewer_wvec"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13089/Reviewer_wvec"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13089/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761976174575, "cdate": 1761976174575, "tmdate": 1762923814323, "mdate": 1762923814323, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Authors introduce AbstRaL (Abstraction Reinforcement Learning), a framework that uses abstract intermediate representations to improving the robustness of LLMs in math word problems.
