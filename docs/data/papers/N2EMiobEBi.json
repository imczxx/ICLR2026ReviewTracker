Existing strategies waste interactions on uninformative behaviors, hindering sample efficiency. We introduce Split Decisions, an exploration framework that leverages semantic priors from vision-language models (VLMs) to guide VLAs toward more promising regions of the action space. In our approach, the VLM serves as a high-level planner that proposes subgoals, while the VLA acts as a low-level controller that samples and executes actions aligned with those subgoals. This structured guidance improves both the efficiency and quality of exploration, enabling policies to discover rewarding strategies more quickly. We evaluate Split Decisions on robotic manipulation tasks in SimplerEnv under both online and offline RL settings. In online fine-tuning, it achieves up to a 31\\% gain in task success with the same interaction budget, while in offline training, datasets collected with Split Decisions provide a 27.5\\% improvement over prior methods.

The ablation and generalization experiments are insightful and good addition to support the claims made in the paper."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The experimental evaluation setup used for comparing SplitDecisions with OpenVLA + gaussian noise sampling for action exploration seems unfair comparison. It is unclear whether explicit action exploration similar to proposed method SplitDecisions is required for autoregressive baselines like OpenVLA. In order for the experimental results and comparisons to be meaningful I would like to see the following baselines:\n    1. OpenVLA RL on the same benchmark without any gaussian perturbations and explicit exploration i.e. RLVLA instantiated exactly as set up in original paper\n    2. OpenVLA RL on the same benchmark with gaussian perturbations and explicit exploration as proposed in the paper\n    3. SD guidance based RL training.\n    \n    The paper already has results for b & c but we need results for baseline a to understand whether the gaussian perturbation approach used for exploration for baseline b is actually helping or hurting the performance\n    \n2. Figure 4 only presents results of finetuning all models for ~300k steps which is quite less training steps or experience to make meaningful conclusions from. I would like the authors to train all 3 baselines described in point 1 atleast until saturation of a larger budget of 1M-5M training steps. Making conclusions from models that have not converged seems like a unfair comparison especially for changes in training methods. In addition, I would like to see the average success plot for all tasks combined in figure 4 rather than just per task breakdown of RL training curves.\n3. The experimental evaluation setup used in the paper is also quite concerning. The paper only uses 4 tasks from SimplerEnv for training from Google Robot scene and 4 tasks from BridgeData in two separate experiments. My understanding is this is not the exact same setup as used in RLVLA paper. The RLVLA paper claims to use 16 tasks each for tasks randomized across following axes: Vision (16 tables), Semantics (16 objects), and Execution (perturbations of object and receptacle poses). I would like the authors to use the same task and dataset setup for a fair comparison and if they cannot do that I would like to understand why this is not possible. My biggest concern right now is that performance reported for RLVLA in experiments in the paper do not follow similar trend as the ones from original paper. Due to this difference I can’t be confident whether the reported improvements of SplitDecisions hold true when RLVLA is replicated accurately\n4. The method section doesn’t describe how top-K sampled actions during exploration stage/SD guidance stage where K > 1 are used for policy update in standard PPO algorithm. The vanilla PPO implementation requires 1 rollout per task where each step has only 1 action and for each task execution we have single task reward. When sampling more than 1 action at each timestep how are the complete task rollouts collected and incorporated in the PPO update needs to be explained in detail in methods section. With the details reported in the paper I don’t understand how the ablation presented in table 3 is conducted. If at each step there are 20 candidate actions that a agent takes then the number of rollouts for each task is going to increase exponentially with steps.\n5. The paper should also add additional details on how did the authors control for samples/FLOPs per update to make the comparison fair. From my understanding, SplitDecision can include greater than 1 action per timestep for updating the policy which increases the number of samples per rollout/update that can be used for RL. For the three baseslines I mentioned in point 1 authors need to control for training updates or samples for a fair comparison."}, "questions": {"value": "Mentioned in weaknesses section.\n\nMy main concern with the paper in its current state is the experimental setup and baseline instantiation used for comparison. Due to lack of proper motivation on augmenting a relevant baseline RLVLA with random sampling for exploration and missing baselines that do not incorporate vanilla RLVLA I am not confident in the results presented in the paper. I recommend the authors to run the relevant baselines for fair comparison. In addition, the method section doesn't include some details about how multiple action samples per step are used during training which is critical information for the paper.
