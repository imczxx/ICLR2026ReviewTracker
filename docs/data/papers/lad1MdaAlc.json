However, this work presents several counterexamples where Hessian-based sharpness can be manipulated. We derive a formula for the Hessian trace, revealing its dependence on several key factors: the norm of network weights, activation frequency, and the entropy of the output distribution. By manipulating these factors, we construct scenarios where models reside in flat minima yet exhibit overfitting and poor test performance. Moreover, Gaussian noise injection  reduces Hessian trace within the first epoch and can even yield arbitrarily flat minima without corresponding improvement in generalization. This suggests that sharpness may be correlated with  generalization without being causally responsible for it.", "tldr": "This paper provides several counterexamples for the correlation between flat minima and generalization, proving that the sharpness metric can be manipulated.", "keywords": ["generalization", "shaprness", "hessian", "activation sparsity", "activation frequency", "data augmentation"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8c22f4c337eb766c3c51729cc3088422d9c4f965.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors investigate the relationship between sharpness and generalization. In particular, they provide two expressions for the trace of the Hessian, an approximation by focussing on the Gauss-Newton part of the Hessian and neglecting the residual part, and an upper bound of this approximation based on the spectral norm and Jensens inequality. From their expressions, they identify factors that might impact sharpness: weight and activation norms, activation frequency, the entropy of the softmax distribution. They provide experiments with interventions targeting those factors, where sometimes higher sharpness leads to better-performing models (and vice versa).

Writing and Clarity:  \nI find the paper hard to read and to follow. I see several reasons for this: i) The central ideas are communicated poorly, ii) often, it is unclear which message a certain Section should convey, and how Sections are connected, iii) the captions of the Figures typically do not explain the message of the Figures, iv) Section 3 introduces the expressions without any context, and it is unclear to the reader where the upper bound and the centered decomposition come from. \n\n\n2. Doubts about expressions:  \nThe authors already state that the upper bound is “relatively loose”, yet claim, that it “remains informative”. It is unclear why it would remain informative, if the bound is loose. Further, there is work claiming that the residual part of the Hessian should not be neglected when analyzing sharpness [1]. Furthermore, for their analysis in Section 5, the authors set the backpropagation matrix M to the identity matrix. I do not see reason why this would be a valid approximation: In my understanding, M captures all the weight and activation derivatives between some layer and the output logits, and by setting it to the identity matrix, one is effectively assuming the network does not exist. \n\n\n2. Inconclusive experiments and logical fallacies:  \nI find many of the experiments and arguments inconclusive. For instance, \n- in section 3.2 the authors argue about how weight norms and activation norms and sparsity might affect the bound, but also admit that they might indirectly influence the $\\lambda_{max}$, so the overall effect on the bound is unclear\n-  Appendix A3 shows that the results about activation frequency are inconclusive, as there, the Hessian trace decreases with increasing activation frequency in once case (Fig. 7), and shows no clear trend with decreasing activation frequency in another case (Fig. 8)\n- similarly, Appendix A4 shows that the mask / unmask experiments show no clear trend for the ResNet-18: while the hessian trace decreases for the masked case, lambda-max increases, again not revealing a clear trend\n- Section 5 aims to argue that, given controlled network norms, the sharpness can be manipulated by changing the entropy of the softmax / impurity. However, I struggle to find evidence for this from the results in Section 5.2, as i) for the first three rows in Table 2, sharpness changes strongly, but the impurity barely changes, ii) data augmentation leads to better generalization and lower sharpness (as expected by the conventional sharpness-generalization assumption), iii) by increasing R from 1 to 5 (90 epoch setting), generalization improves and sharpness decreases. Overall, I see no evidence for a causal relation between the impurity and sharpness from those experiments\n- Section 5.3 investigates overfitting via data leakage  in order to create overconfident outputs. However, the causal chain in the arguments seems flawed to me: By introducing the data leakage, the model is essentially solving a different task (MNIST instead of CIFAR classification). Why should we think that we can draw any conclusions from this, other than that an MNIST model might be flatter than a CIFAR model? It is also not surprising that the confidence for MNIST classification is higher, as it is a simpler task. \n\n\n3. Experimental setup:  \nThe presented experiments are typically done with a single model and dataset, and a single seed, and thus limited in the conclusions that can be drawn from them. For the cases where different setups are investigated (e.g. Fig 7 and 8), there is often no clear trend, questioning the reproducibility of the presented results in other setups. Overall, the investigated setup (mostly VGG-small on very easy datasets, without BatchNorm) is extremely simple, and it is unclear how the results would translate to more realistic settings. \n \n4. Novelty:  \nI see the novelty of this work as very limited. That Sharpness can be manipulated has been shown before [3], that weight scale plays a role has been shown [3,4,5], and that logit normalization might be relevant has also been discussed [4,6]. Finally, there is extensive experimental evidence of examples where sharpness does not correlate well with generalization [6]. \n\n\nMinor remarks: \n- Table 2: Why mention N, if N=0 for all datapoints, and what are the rows? The first three rows are after epoch one, for the others it is unclear (after epoch 90?). Also, why is DA only specified for two rows?\n- it would be good to report test accuracy in Table 3\n- often there is either the trace or the lambda-max reported, and it is unclear to me why one or the other and not both are reported\n- in Figure 5, it is not clearly indicated what is with and without normalization\n- in 6.2: the authors claim that 99% train accuracy is achieved, yet 89.22 is reported in the Table\n- “According to our theory, it is reasonable to hypothesize that in the early stages of training, the model tends to memorize the data, leading to a strong dependence between inputs and outputs and consequently a sharper loss landscape” it is unclear to me how this is derived from the provided theory\n- Appendix A6: “Can noise injection achieve the same effect as SAM?” This has been studied, e.g. in the original SAM paper, or in [2]. While random perturbations can bring some improvements, they are typically significantly smaller than gradient or momentum-based perturbations.\n\n\n\n[1] Dauphin, Y., Agarwala, A., and Mobahi, H.

The motivation of the study is interesting, and exploring different perspectives on existing theories around sharpness helps to provide new insights into deep learning and generalisation.\n2. The study considers a range of different empirical experiments (approximately 6) to provide counterexamples for the causal relation suggested with generalisation and flatness (Hessian-based) measures, some of which are quite interesting. \n3. Showing the impacts of different experimental conditions across different datasets and architectures is an important aspect of the work.\n4. The study of activation frequency and generalisation is interesting, and I have not seen this angle explored in current literature; however, I feel the results in this section could be strengthened (please see weaknesses below)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Sharpness measures**: The central question of the paper 'Is Hessian-based sharpness truly a reliable indicator of generalization?' does not appear to me to be a novel one. Indeed, the work done by Petzka et al. [1] shows that Hessian-based flatness measures using the trace of the loss-Hessian are not reparameterisation invariant and, therefore, not a reliable indicator of generalisation. [1] does, however, show that Relative Flatness [1] and Fisher Roa norm [2] are Hessian-based measures which are reparameterization invariant. As a result, the focus on measures such as the Trace of the Hessian ($Tr(H)$) and the Max Hessian ($Hλ_{max}$) appears odd, as for at least one of these metrics, it is known that it is not a reliable indicator of generalisation. As a result, I would like to see experiments conducted looking at the experimental setups' impact on the Relative Flatness and Fisher Roa norm measures of sharpness to confirm the findings observed in the paper.\n\n2. **No average of results or Standard Error of the Mean reported**: In all tables and figures presented, there is no average or Standard Error of the Mean [3] reported; this is basic scientific practice and provides an improved reliability of the findings. Without this, it is hard to assess how reliable your empirical experiments are. \n\n3. **Activation Frequency Results**: In section 4.1 from Figure 2, it can be observed that activation frequency can change the value of the Hessian trace; however, I am not so certain about the correlation you identify between the activation frequency and the Hessian Trace. For example, when the perturbation is (approximately) -0.1, the activation frequency increases from the previous point, but it can be observed that the Hessian trace is reduced, showing that an increase in activation frequency does not perfectly describe the increase in Hessian trace. Can you provide a plot showing the impact of perturbation between 1 and 1 in 0.1 intervals? The trends observed are quite sparse with lots of deviation between points, so this would help to better support your points between this relation and make the figure clearer.\n\n4. **Feature Map Masking at 70%**: What motivated the feature Map masking value of 70%? This value feels arbitrary. It would be useful to provide a range of mask percentages, perhaps between 10% to 100% in 10% intervals, that show that as the percentage of masking is increased, $Hλ_{max}$ decreases. Also in Appendix A.4, you present the results for the ResNet18 with the $Tr(H)$ and $Hλ_{max}$  but do not present the $Tr(H)$ in the main body for the masking - is there a reason for this? \n\n5. **Unfair comparison for Figure 3**: Not keeping the training budget equal for your comparison of data augmentation and non-data augmentation does not make sense. Instead, you should provide both models with the same training budget and then compare their sharpnesses at the end of this, such that it is a fair comparison.\n\n6. **Table 2**: The results in Table 2 are hard to parse. What is the rationale behind comparing the sharpness after a single epoch? I see no benefit in doing this, and it takes away from the results below.\n\n7. **Flatness from Noise Injection**: This experiment is very unclear. I believe that a figure would be useful to display what the training samples look like once they have been transformed for this case. Also, I would avoid using terms such as (L402) 'diverging significantly' if no significance tests have been conducted. For Figure 6b, the authors state that (L437) 'when the noise variance exceeds 0.3, training becomes impossible yet sharpness continues to decrease.' but provide no evidence for the lack of model convergence at a noise level of 0.3. \n\n8. **Misc** All figures could be made larger to enable improved readability. Figure 4 has inconsistent labelling. Also, should the label be 'R', as it is in the table, instead of 'inner loop'? Finally, (L439) 's experimental results are provided in Appendix A.4. These experimental results do not seem related to the noise injection results but the masking results - please check this reference is correct. It would be good to include a reference to other works that have also challenged the notion of flatness, such as [4] and [5].\n\nOverall, I find some of the experiments and their results interesting; however, due to the lack of empirical rigour of this work, I find that it requires significant improvements to have an adequate impact on the community. Additionally, focusing on fewer experiments in the main body could allow for improved clarity to fully explain the results/rationale for experiments."}, "questions": {"value": "**Q1**: You state (L215) 'the natural rate of ReLU death in standard convolutional layers is relatively low.' Can you please elaborate on this and provide an explanation as to why you believe that this occurs in convolutional layers and what you think the difference is with other layers, such as MLP layers?\n\n**Q2**: In Appendix A.4, you state that 'largest eigenvalue only reflects sharpness along a single direction and does not represent the overall sharpness.' Why then do you consider this metric throughout the paper if it does not truly represent the overall sharpness of the model? Would it not be better to use other metrics that do? \n\n**Q3**: What is the motivation behind using the ImageNet subset over TinyImageNet [6]?\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Petzka, H., Kamp, M., Adilova, L., Sminchisescu, C. and Boley, M., 2021.
