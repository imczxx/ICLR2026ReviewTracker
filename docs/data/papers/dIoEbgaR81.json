We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation framework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and solving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat evaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized to create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others' weaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability, open-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and scalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable tasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited programmatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial reasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and scalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set code-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible framework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking system, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that:\n(1) weaker models can score stronger ones consistently, reliably differentiating between them, and\n(2) LLM-based systems are capable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with their own capabilities, and\n(3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained capability differences between models.\nOur findings are an important step towards general, scalable evaluation frameworks which can keep pace with LLM progress.", "tldr": "We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation framework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and solving verifiable tasks for one another.", "keywords": ["automated evaluation", "scalable evaluation"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f55301698e90f35b9b78fec4648421c69b1b10ae.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/1e04781f971c9e31e3333fa0d43030fdb6c2815b.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a judge-free evaluation where models set and solve verifiable tasks (i.e., code output prediction MCQs) and are then ranked with TrueSkill while controlling option/order noise and near duplicate questions.

While the authors claim that COP tasks provide \"a general substrate for evaluating model capabilities,\" this paper provides zero empirical evidence that SKATE can work with other task types. The COP tasks tested here don't even resemble a typical coding evaluation where models' generation or algorithmic problem-solving capabilities are tested. Any model with code execution tools could solve COP tasks. Without demonstrating SKATE generalisation ability on more diverse verifiable tasks (such as mathematical proofs, puzzles), the claim is questionable.\n\n2. Although COP tasks can be verified through code execution easily, the authors provide no evidence that general verifiable tasks can have similar guarantees. For instance, if a model generates a mathematical problem as a challenge (the task itself is verifiable with ground-truths but extremely hard with only models), verifying the correctness of the answer may be non-trivial or even intractable.\n\n3. While collective knowledge from multiple models works well for training scenarios, using it for evaluation may be problematic because it provides no ground-truth anchor—evaluation results depend entirely on which specific models are included in the cohort. The experiments in Section 6.2 only test adding models sequentially by capability order, which is insufficient to establish robustness. A rigorous validation would require testing with diverse model combinations to show rankings remain consistent, or anchoring the evaluation with human-verified questions to provide external validation.\n\n4. The empirical findings presented in Section 6, while technically sound, lack novelty and offer limited new insights into LLM capabilities. The observation that weaker models can reliably score stronger ones, and models prefer their own questions, have been found two years ago."}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "wC8UD21Q5T", "forum": "dIoEbgaR81", "replyto": "dIoEbgaR81", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1728/Reviewer_3DNS"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1728/Reviewer_3DNS"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1728/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761953088999, "cdate": 1761953088999, "tmdate": 1762915870918, "mdate": 1762915870918, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
