Our mechanism elicits bids and textual prompts from the advertisers, and composes them into a score function that drives a reverse diffusion process that generates the banner. Then, it implements Monte Carlo sampling to calculate approximate VCG-based payments to incentivize high-welfare images. Extensive experiments on a diverse 20-prompt dataset with up to 3 agents demonstrate key economic properties. Our mechanism achieves: (1) bid monotonicity; (2) efficiency improvement of up to 20.7% higher welfare than a single-winner VCG baseline; and (3) approximate incentive compatibility, with average regret as low as 7% when deviating from truthful bidding. These benefits are achieved while preserving high image quality. Our study establishes a principled and scalable bridge between auction theory and controllable image diffusion, laying a foundation for economically aligned, multi-stakeholder image generation in advertising and beyond.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diffusion Models", "Online Advertising"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/920c2c8ee112c3c3cb2ce2468c73f0f4b1c5a5fd.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/25fe92e922860807c4a8d924ff82e043fce40fa9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)-based bidding mechanism for diffusion-based image generation.
