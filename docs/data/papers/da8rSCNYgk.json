While recent approaches have attempted to align modalities by modeling conditional or higher-order statistical dependencies, they often fail to capture the structural coherence across modalities.\nIn this work, we propose a novel multimodal alignment method that augments existing contrastive losses with a geometry-aware Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance-based regularization. \nTo this end, we encode intra-modality geometry with modality-specific similarity matrices and extend the GW distance to minimize their discrepancies from a dynamically learned barycenter, thereby enforcing structural alignment across modalities beyond what is captured by InfoNCE-like mutual information objectives.\nWe apply this optimal-transport-based alignment strategy to robot perception tasks involving underexplored modalities such as force and tactile signals, where modality data often exhibit varying sample densities. \nExperimental results show that our method yields superior inter-modal coherence and significantly improves downstream robot perception tasks such as robot and environment state prediction.

It seems aligning each modality’s similarity matrix individually to its embedding counterpart would better encourage encoders to capture the topological structure, while still maintaining O(M) complexity rather than relying on a combined consensus? And the encoders are already aligned across modalities through L_c.\n- Lines 260-262 mention that modalities such as vision and force–torque are in incomparable metric spaces but have meaningful internal geometries, which is crucial in robotics.

To address this limitation, the authors introduce a Gromov–Wasserstein distance–based regularization, which explicitly maintains intra-modality geometric consistency while aligning multiple modalities. The proposed method is applied to representation learning across vision, force, and tactile modalities—domains that are relatively underexplored yet critical for robotic perception and manipulation.

The main concern with this paper lies in its experimental setup. Aligning representations between vision and low-dimensional, robotics-related modalities (such as tactile signals or end-effector (EEF) positions) may not be conceptually sound. Visual observations inherently contain richer, high-level semantic information — including environmental context, object appearance, and background — whereas proprioceptive or tactile data capture only limited, low-dimensional physical aspects of the same scene. Aligning these representations risks degrading the generality and expressiveness of the visual embeddings, as the model may overfit to the less informative modalities. Similarly, the task of aligning vision and audio modalities seems somewhat unnatural in the given robotic context, and its motivation should be better justified.\n\n2. The paper’s central idea of maintaining intrinsic structural relationships is conceptually appealing, but modeling these relationships in high-dimensional visual feature spaces remains an open challenge. The choice of RBF kernel to define distances in such complex, semantically rich spaces is not particularly promising — while it has shown effectiveness in early low-level computer vision applications, it may not adequately capture the nuanced semantic geometry of deep visual embeddings. A deeper discussion or alternative strategies (e.g., learned metrics or graph-based structures) would strengthen this aspect.\n\n3. It is unclear why the proposed method is designed specifically for three or more modalities. The idea of using Gromov–Wasserstein regularization to enhance two-modality contrastive learning (e.g., in vision–language pretraining) could be impactful, given its broader applicability and relevance to large-scale multimodal learning. Exploring or discussing such extensions could significantly increase the practical and theoretical contribution of this work. The key remaining challenge would be to properly model intra-modal structures for high-semantic modalities like vision and language, which would make the approach more meaningful and generalizable."}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ZCVYUN5Jds", "forum": "da8rSCNYgk", "replyto": "da8rSCNYgk", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19497/Reviewer_h36B"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19497/Reviewer_h36B"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19497/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761925628504, "cdate": 1761925628504, "tmdate": 1762931399999, "mdate": 1762931399999, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a framework designed to achieve geometry-aware alignment across multiple heterogeneous modalities such as vision, force, tactile, proprioception, and audio in robotic perception.
