Traditional AI/ML approaches have primarily tackled these problems in isolation, solving narrow tasks within the broader operational pipeline. In contrast, the emergence of AI agents and large language models (LLMs) introduces a next-generation opportunity: enabling end-to-end automation across the entire asset lifecycle. This paper envisions a future where AI agents autonomously manage tasks that previously required distinct expertise and manual coordination. To this end, we introduce AssetOpsBench—a unified framework and environment designed to guide the development, orchestration, and evaluation of domain-specific agents tailored for Industry 4.0 applications. We outline the key requirements for such holistic systems and provide actionable insights into building agents that integrate perception, reasoning, and control for real-world industrial operations.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Agentic AI", "Industry 4.0", "Time Series"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9af7c411a26b04a3c7059e8c88facf8c8e17f317.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/8040d6a517dd57753834f31c75be321b9a8209ab.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces AssetOpsBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on task automation in asset operations and maintenance. The authors argue that existing benchmarks do not adequately address the unique challenges of this domain, such as the diverse data modalities and the complex, collaborative nature of tasks. The paper curates a new multi-source dataset from data center operations , a set of 141 human-authored, intent-driven scenarios , a catalog of domain-specific agents (IoT, FMSR, TSFM, and WO) , and a simulated environment for evaluation. The paper conducts a comparative analysis of two multi-agent architectures, \"Agent-As-Tool\" and \"Plan-Executor\", and employs a rigorous three-pronged evaluation methodology combining an LLM-based rubric, reference-based scoring, and manual expert verification. A key finding is that the Agent-As-Tool approach generally outperforms Plan-Execute in task quality, though at a higher computational cost, and the work also presents a systematic procedure for identifying emerging failure modes in these agent systems."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The paper studies an important problem of deploying LLM Agents in asset management."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- There is an unverified claim in the introduction. On line 94, the paper said “domain complexity in industrial settings necessitates a multiagent approach. ”. However, the authors did not provide a direct comparison between multi-agent and single-agent approaches to empirically prove the necessity of a multi-agent approach for handling domain complexity.\n\n- The paper is not very organized. For example, in section 3, you first talk about AssetOpsBench but then start to discuss AssetOps Agent in the next paragraph. It is unclear why you need to discuss the proposed framework in problem definition. The second paragraph does not help understand the definition of your problem. More importantly, the symbols like \\tau, \\pi introduced in this paragraph are never used again, which makes them not very meaningful. \n\n- The results section lacks insights. Most results are well-established across most all modern LLM benchmarks. (e.g. proprietary LLMs outperform open-source counterparts. Removing in-context examples would decrease performance) The paper could be strengthened if dive deeper into some deep analysis. For example,\n\n\t- Why does Plan-Execute fail? The paper speculates about \"over-planning\" or \"brittle plans\" but provides no concrete examples. It doesn't show a failing plan from Plan-Execute and contrast it with a successful \"thinking\" trace from Agent-As-Tool for the same task\n\t- Direct comparisons with single-agent system\n\t- Why adding distractors improve performance? why would it trigger more deliberate reasoning in LLM? \n\n- The paper is not easy to read due to the high density of acronyms and jargon. Additionally, there are too many places where the authors refer the readers to the appendix. \n\n- While the creation process of the benchmark is solid, the paper lacks a critical, quantitative assessment of the data's realism. The paper would be more sound if some user study or human evaluation on the data realism can be shown.\n\n- Typos and wrong citation issues:\n\t- Line 56 “triggering acti mkons.”\n\t- Line 87 incomplete sentence?\n\t- Almost all the citation in \\cite should be in \\citep \n\t- Some of the citations are wrong. For example, on line 62 you are citing “agent-based systems”\n\t- There are some other related work missed by the paper.
