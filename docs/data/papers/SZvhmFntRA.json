Recent advances leveraging implicit neural representation (INR) have achieved great progress by modeling coordinate-to-pixel mappings. However, the efficiency of these methods may suffer from repeated upsampling and decoding, while their reconstruction fidelity and quality are constrained by the intrinsic representational limitations of coordinate-based functions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ContinuousSR framework with a Pixel-to-Gaussian paradigm, which explicitly reconstructs 2D continuous HR signals from LR images using Gaussian Splatting. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming upsampling and decoding, enabling extremely fast ASSR. Once the Gaussian field is built in a single pass, ContinuousSR can perform arbitrary-scale rendering in just 1ms per scale. Our method introduces several key innovations. Through statistical analysis, we uncover the Deep Gaussian Prior (DGP) and propose DGP-Driven Covariance Weighting, which dynamically optimizes covariance via adaptive weighting. Additionally, we present Adaptive Position Drifting, which refines the positional distribution of the Gaussian space based on image content, further enhancing reconstruction quality.

The core idea is a Pixel-to-Gaussian paradigm: instead of repeatedly upsampling and decoding features as in coordinate-based implicit neural representations (e.g., LIIF, CiaoSR), the method builds a single continuous Gaussian field from which HR images at arbitrary scales can be rendered in ~1 ms per scale.\n\nThe authors propose three technical components:\n\n1. Deep Gaussian Prior (DGP) – a statistical observation that Gaussian parameters from natural images follow a bounded Gaussian distribution.\n\n2.

Memory usage is also markedly lower, enabling high-scale rendering (×32–×48) where prior INR methods run out of memory."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "Ultra-Fast Arbitrary Scaling: The proposed method eliminates iterative upsampling, achieving real-time rendering at arbitrary scales (≈1 ms per scale after one forward pass). This is a ~20× speedup over implicit models when generating a continuous zoom or multiple outputs, making it highly attractive for practical use where efficiency is crucial.\n\nHigh Reconstruction Quality: It delivers superior super-resolution fidelity across a wide range of scales. On multiple benchmarks (e.g. Urban100, Manga109), the approach surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin (~0.8–0.9 dB PSNR improvement at 4× upsampling), and also achieves better SSIM and FID scores, indicating improvements in perceptual quality. The Gaussian representation better preserves structure and details (sharper textures, as shown in qualitative examples) compared to coordinate-MLP approaches.\n\nInnovative Use of Gaussian Splatting with Deep Prior: The paper cleverly integrates Gaussian splatting (recently popular in 3D/NeRF tasks) into image SR, and addresses its training difficulties via a Deep Gaussian Prior. By pre-characterizing the typical covariance range of natural images, the method avoids converging to poor local optima and reduces the solution space. This DGP-driven covariance weighting mechanism and the adaptive position drifting are novel contributions that improve modeling flexibility (allowing anisotropic Gaussian shapes and content-aware placement) while keeping the optimization stable.\n\nExcellent Memory Efficiency: The continuous Gaussian framework uses memory proportional to the number of Gaussians (which is tied to input resolution) rather than the output pixel count. Consequently, the method can handle very large scale factors (e.g. 16×, 32×) without running out of memory, unlike prior methods (LIIF, CiaoSR) that exhaust GPU memory at high scales. This efficient scaling is beneficial for ultra-high-resolution outputs and demonstrates a well-designed pipeline.\n\nThorough Evaluation: The authors validate their approach on seven diverse datasets and include extensive comparisons to nine prior methods (including recent ones like GaussianSR and GSASR). They also perform ablation studies to justify each component, and even test a joint deraining+SR scenario to show the model’s robustness in adverse conditions. This thorough experimentation strengthens confidence in the method’s effectiveness and generality."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Complex Training Pipeline: The solution introduces multiple components (DGP-based kernel dictionary, adaptive weighting network, position drift module, etc.), making the overall pipeline more complex than some prior approaches. Training requires careful setup – for instance, deriving the DGP involved 700 GPU-hours of optimization on external data, and the model must learn to combine predefined kernels and offsets correctly. This complexity might make the approach harder to reproduce or extend without the provided code, and it suggests a heavy computational cost in pre-processing and training (though inference is efficient).\n\nHeavily Engineered Solution: While effective, the novelty is somewhat incremental in that it builds upon known ideas from related domains (e.g. using Gaussian splats instead of coordinate MLPs, which was explored by GaussianSR and GSASR). The main contributions lie in engineering a workable solution (using a learned prior and adaptive modules) rather than fundamentally new theory. The approach may be viewed as a clever combination of existing techniques (INR networks, Gaussian rendering, learned priors) tailored to overcome a training hurdle, which, despite being valuable, might not be conceptually groundbreaking.\n\nAssumptions of the Deep Gaussian Prior: The method’s efficacy leans on the assumption that natural image content adheres to the learned Gaussian parameter distributions. If an input deviates from this prior (e.g. very sparse or non-photographic images), the fixed kernel dictionary might become suboptimal. The paper does not explore how sensitive the model is to the DGP assumptions or how it would perform on out-of-distribution data (such as medical imagery or vector graphics). In other words, the generalization of the DGP to all image types remains a potential concern.\n\nLimited Discussion of CGM and Color Fidelity: The Color Gaussian Mapping component is not described in detail, leaving some ambiguity about how color from the LR image is transferred or refined in the continuous representation. If color assignment to Gaussians is naive (e.g. directly using LR pixel colors), it could limit the method’s ability to add high-frequency color details. More explanation is needed on how color is handled and whether the model can recover color nuances at high scales. This lack of clarity is a minor presentation issue but also a technical point that could affect the perceived color fidelity of results.\n\nPotential Minor Artifacts: Representing an image as a sum of Gaussians could inherently introduce smoothing, especially if a Gaussian’s covariance is large. The paper focuses on PSNR/SSIM, which favor fidelity, but it’s unclear if there are any artifacts such as slight blurring or spatial shifts due to APD. For example, Adaptive Position Drifting moves Gaussian centers for better alignment; however, without constraints, this might risk slight geometric distortions (if many Gaussians shift from their original pixel locations). The authors do not report any artifacts, but a discussion on how APD balances flexibility with spatial accuracy would strengthen the work.\n\nMarginal quantitative gains: The reported PSNR improvements over GSASR (≈0.08–0.18 dB) are small; hence claims of a “new paradigm” feel overstated given access to those prior results.\n\nAblation gaps: Table 4 compares DGP to uniform sampling but omits a baseline with directly learned covariances (no dictionary), leaving uncertainty about DDPW’s absolute necessity."}, "questions": {"value": "Q1. Novelty vs Prior Work: How does ContinuousSR fundamentally differ from GaussianSR (which already models each pixel as a Gaussian field) and GSASR (which performs scale-aware 2D Gaussian Splatting)? Beyond eliminating per-scale decoding, what conceptual innovation justifies a new paradigm claim?\n\nQ2. Can you clarify whether DGP is fixed or fine-tuned during training? How would results change if covariances were learned end-to-end without the predefined dictionary?\n\nQ3: How is the Color Gaussian Mapping (CGM) implemented and how crucial is it for final image quality? For instance, do you simply assign each Gaussian an RGB value from the LR feature map, or is there an additional refinement to predict high-frequency color details? A clearer explanation of CGM’s role would help understand how color fidelity is maintained for large upscaling factors.\n\nQ4: Does each input pixel strictly correspond to one Gaussian, or can multiple Gaussians represent a single pixel/region? The current description implies one Gaussian per LR pixel. If so, have you considered allowing a more adaptive number of Gaussians (e.g., splitting a pixel’s Gaussian to capture complex textures, or merging in flat areas)? This might further improve representation capability for highly textured regions.\n\nQ5: How sensitive is the model to the assumed Deep Gaussian Prior if applied to very different data distributions? For example, would a model trained on natural images struggle with domain-specific content (such as medical images or line drawings) because the covariance distributions differ? Would fine-tuning the DGP (or the predefined kernel set) be necessary in such cases?\n\nQ6: What measures are in place to ensure that Adaptive Position Drifting does not distort the image structure? Since APD shifts Gaussian centers based on content, do you impose any regularization or limits on these offsets? Clarification on how much drift is typically learned (e.g., fraction of a pixel) and its effect on alignment with ground-truth details would be helpful.\n\nQ7: Can you elaborate on the rendering performance in extreme cases? The reported 1 ms rendering is impressive – what output resolution and hardware does this refer to? If one were to render an extremely high-resolution image (say 4K or 8K) from a small LR input, does the rendering remain near-instantaneous, and are there any memory or precision considerations with the GPU rasterizer at those scales?\n\nQ8.
