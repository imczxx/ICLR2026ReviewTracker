However, current reinforcement learning methods lack PT in decision learning, leading to state traps caused by the lack of planning ahead, further reducing the data efficiency. This paper proposes a novel ProSpec RL method, which is the first to incorporate prospective decision learning to model-free RL for efficient and safe exploration. Specifically, to incorporate PT into model-free RL, we propose a flow-based reversible dynamics model, which predicts future n-stream trajectories based on the current state and policy. \nMeanwhile, to prevent the entrapment in state traps, we propose a prospective mechanism using model predictive control with value consistency constraint, enabling the learning to plan ahead then execute, to avoid ``dead ends\" caused by high-risk actions. Additionally, to improve data efficiency, we present a cyclical consistency constraint, which generates a large number of accurate and reversible virtual trajectories to further enhance state feature representations. Comprehensive evaluations of ProSpec on DMControl and Atari benchmarks demonstrate the significant accelerations in the model decision learning and the state-of-the-art performance in 4 of 6 DMControl and 7 of 26 Atari games.

The core novelty seems to lie in proposing a new planning objective (changing the return formulation from \\sum \\gamma^i (\\sum_{j<i} r_j + Q_i}, to \\sum \\gamma^i Q_i.\n* Moreover, notion of \"safety\" does not align with safe RL literatures.\n\n* **I think the framing of the work should be reconsidered**, specifically clarifying 1) whether it is fundamentally model-free or model-based., 2) safety of the exploration.\n\n**W2. Concern about the validity of the objective.**\n* The new objective for planning also looks like a hack rather than a solid objective.\n* Simply, it is removing the reward term from the $\\lambda$-returns (with $\\lambda=\\gamma$), or weighting rewards differently as explained in Appendix D.3, which does not align with the true objective for RL.\n* While authors claim that it helps the agent to escape from “state-trap”, and concrete example has been shown, I think we need a justification on this, specifically why this planning can still give the optimal policy (or near-optimal policy)."}, "questions": {"value": "**Q1. Clarification on the framing of the work**\n* Given that the method involves planning with world models, should this work be categorized as model-based RL? \n* Aligning with prior planning-based methods (e.g., TD-MPC[1] for planning, CoPlanner[2] for planning + exploration) could help contextualize the contribution more accurately.\n\n**Q2. Theoretical justification**\n* Is there a derivable lower bound or theoretical guarantee showing that optimizing the proposed objective approximates the optimal policy?\n\n**Q3. Experimental baselines (Atari100k)**\n* The Atari100k experiments include limited baselines. \n* Including model-based works (e.g., DreamerV3) would provide a more comprehensive comparison, given the similarity in approach.\n\n**Q4.

The proposed method does not perform impressively, especially when compared with SOTA methods.

Besides, there is an error in Table 1: for Cheetah, run (100k steps), the best-performing method is Dreamer-V3 (536), which is much higher than ProSpec (477), yet ProSpec (477) is mistakenly marked as the best.\n\n4.
