We further analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Model;Benchmark;Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/09f6932356f199bfbf69193d8710ab298d34bbc8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/2c229101778779d63042147556da5890a1036cca.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper considers the problem of designing benchmarks for reinforcement learning post-training of LLMs. Using two base models from the Qwen family, it shows experimentally on four datasets that the performance is similar when trained on the training set and test set (characterized by a proposed metric called Oracle Performance Gap), suggesting that current experimental protocols are not sufficient.

However, I am uncertain about the novelty and clarity of the communication of these results; and am particularly concerned about misleading presentation. The experiments also lack statistical rigour.\n\n### “Novel Diagnostic Framework.”\nThe paper claims a core contribution of the paper is its “Novel Diagnostic Framework”. However, I find the aggregate statistics that are introduced to be not particularly novel, and potentially misleading. Presenting the raw data would arguably have been less confusing and less likely to mislead readers.\n\n#### I think the 'Average Cross-Difficulty Generalization' metric may be misleading.\nIf I am understanding Figure 3 correctly, the 'Average Cross-Difficulty Generalization' metric excludes each model's own training level from the average. This means the L1-trained model is evaluated on the average of Levels 2-5 (mostly harder problems), while the L5-trained model is evaluated on the average of Levels 1-4 (mostly easier problems). This creates an inherent bias in the comparison - the L5 model appears to 'generalize better' simply because it's being tested on an easier set of problems. The monotonic pattern highlighted in the paper would (as far as I can tell) still appear if the same model was used across all data points. Please could the authors clarify whether I have misunderstood this figure?  \n\n#### The “Oracle Performance Gap” is similar to \nSimilarly, the “Oracle Performance Gap” is not particularly helpful relative to just reporting raw numbers on train/test set. Further, I’m not clear on why the “oracle performance gap” is actually different to just reporting the difference between train/test performance: they in fact fine tune on the “test set” and report performance on the test set, but this is effectively just a new train set.\n\n### Missing statistical significance\nThe paper presents empirical findings without adequate statistical analysis. There are no confidence intervals, significance tests, or multiple seeds reported for key experiments. Statistical tests are essential for a paper aiming to improve evaluation rigour. \n\n### Additional concerns:\n#### Normative framing.\nRather than presenting empirical observations and letting readers evaluate their implications, the authors make prescriptive claims about benchmark design. They introduce \"principles\" and assert that benchmarks \"must\" include certain features, without establishing clear criteria for what constitutes good generalization or why their specific recommendations follow from their findings. \nI think Principle 1 does this relatively well: the paper says evaluations “must be balanced and stratified” in order to prevent “masking”. However, it essentially restates the well-established practice of disaggregated reporting. Principle 2 is more problematic, declaring that \"faithful\" benchmarks must test distributional robustness without justifying why this is necessary. Of course, in many applications, robustness to distributional shifts is important. However, a simple normative claim that distributional robustness should be measured does not add value to the paper.\n\n#### Counterfactual test \nFinally, the counterfactual test reveals an interesting limitation of LLMs but doesn't specifically relate to RL methods or benchmark design."}, "questions": {"value": "* Have I understood Figure 3 properly?

A major problem that I have with this submission is that this paper assumes low OPG means \"benchmark is broken\" but never validates this interpretation. Consider: (a) RL might genuinely learn more robust features than SFT, (b) the test set might be easier than assumed, or (c) benchmark saturation is happening for different reasons than claimed. So for me, here's an alternative interpretation:\n(1) RL's low OPG might indicate \"good\" generalization, not benchmark failure\n(2) SFT's high OPG might indicate \"poor\" generalization, not correct behavior\nThe authors never tested whether RL actually learned robust policies vs memorized patterns. I would like to propose a simple experiment to validate this: train RL on 10% of train set --> evaluate on the remaining 90% of train set vs. test set. If performance on both is similar, that's genuine generalization. The current setup in this submission can't distinguish this.\n\n2.

Section 3.2.1's entire Distribution Test uses Euclidean distance in t-sne space as \"semantic distance\" (in appendix D). I think there is a flaw here as t-SNE only preserves local neighborhood structure, not global distances. Hence I feel that conclusions from Table 3 may be unreliable.\n\n5. The authors used a single llm (gemini 2.5 Pro) to annotate difficulty (in appendix B.1) with zero validation, inter-rater agreement, or comparison to existing labels, like MATH benchmark already has difficulty levels 1-5.\n\n6.

Moreover the authors never experimented with a more challenging benchmark (even if it is from math domain, like FrontierMATH)."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
