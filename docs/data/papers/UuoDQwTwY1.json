Despite this surge of interest, the theoretical underpinnings of AR diffusion remain largely unexplored.\nThis work, for the first time, investigates the inference complexity and underlying mechanisms behind AR diffusion's strong performance. Building on the sequential patch-by-patch generation paradigm, we formalize the inference process as a series of stage-wise conditional distribution samplings. This formulation yields that, when conditional components are learned accurately, the resulting approximation to the full joint distribution becomes highly precise. Our theoretical analysis establishes the AR diffusion inference complexity bound for a general number of stages $K$, requiring only minimal smoothness assumptions on the score functions and their estimation error.\nThe complexity includes an additional factor proportional to the number of stages, reflecting the model's sequential architecture. On the other hand, we show that this stage-wise design can be advantageous for learning specific conditional dependencies between patches, which may be overlooked by conventional diffusion models that focus primarily on joint distributions. Subsequent experiments on synthetic data validate this theoretical insight.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["auto-regressive models", "diffusion models", "condition capturing"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ddb47d4edc53d724d9ee8536b4a9ee19608c3a3b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies AR diffusion, which reverses a patch-wise diffusion model with conditioning from already sampled patches.

The toy examples also confirm the intuition that the AR formulation explicitly learning conditional distributions can be helpful when the patch decomposition aligns with the data-generation process."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "A large portion of the paper (pages 1-6) is just rewriting the standard formulations of diffusion models (such as Chen et al. (2023b)) into AR-based formulations. The essential contributions of the paper seems to be the results in Section 4, but it has the following weaknesses:\n- [W1] The complexity obtained in Theorem 1 (and its remark) seems to be just $K\\times$ complexity of standard diffusion. Technically, it seems to be just a combination of stage-wise estimates of standard diffusion models. Furthermore, while the authors state \"Moreover, we prove that, in certain regimes, AR diffusion can better capture some conditional dependencies among patches compared to standard diffusion\" in Introduction, the \"regime\" is described only as $\\epsilon(K)\\ll K^{1/2}\\epsilon(1)$, and it is far from characterizing the situation (in terms of data and/or network) where AR diffusion is more efficient.\n- [W2] **The results in Section 4.2 is quite misleading.** First, for Lemma 4, the conditional KL divergence is bounded by using the conditional loss $L^{SM}(\\theta|x_{[1:k]})$ and the authors state it can be arbitrarily small. However, in the loss functions such as Eq. 14, this conditional loss is taken expectation regarding the choice of $x_{[1:k]}$, and there is no reason that $L^{SM}(\\theta|x_{[1:k]})$ is uniformly small for each $x_{[1:k]}$. Similarly, in Lemma 5, the right-hand side can be large when $\\lVert x_{1:k}\\rVert$ is moderately large, but in the example constructed by authors (in Appendix C), $\\lVert x_{1:k}\\rVert$ **tends to be very small**, since it follows a centered Gaussian with variance of order $O(\\epsilon^2/M^2)$. Thus, \"unbounded KL divergence\" stated by the authors in Introduction is an inappropriate exaggeration of the result. Indeed, from the chain rule of KL divergence, the conditional KL divergence is small in expectation, if the joint KL divergence is small.\n\nOverall, I believe that the paper's theoretical contribution is only in Section 4.1, which gives a bound for AR diffusion models. While the result follows the intuition, it does not explain the competence of AR diffusions in a certain setting. I do not think the additional empirical findings in Section 5 are strong enough to get the paper accepted.\n\nTypos etc:\n- L56: learns -> learn\n- L87: \"regimes ,\" -> \"regimes,\"\n- L129: a coefficient (i.e., 2) of $s_\\theta$ is missing\n- L138: What is $\\theta_{df+1, k}$?

It is established that in AR models, sampling errors from one stage can propagate and compound, significantly degrading the quality of subsequent generations. This is especially critical for long-horizon tasks like video generation. The paper lacks a formal analysis of this effect, which **significantly undermines the soundness** of its complexity claims, as the derived bounds may not hold in a practical, recursive sampling setting.\n\n* **Apparent Flaw in the KL Decomposition (Line 916):** The aforementioned lack of error analysis may stem from a specific flaw in the KL decomposition (Line 916). The derivation appears to **incorrectly condition on ground-truth samples** from the previous stage ($x_{k-1}$) instead of the **model's own generated samples** ($\\tilde{x}_{k-1}$). This is a critical distinction: the analysis seems to be based on a \"teacher-forced\" setting, not the true, auto-regressive inference process where errors would naturally accumulate.\n\n* **Questionable Smoothness Assumptions:** The paper's theoretical results hinge on smoothness assumptions that are likely **violated in many practical AR settings**. For example, in video generation, the objects' motion follows physical laws, making the conditional distribution of the next frame given the previous one **nearly deterministic (i.e., approximating a delta distribution)**. For such sharp distributions, the smoothness assumptions no longer hold.

As noted in the draft, when the analysis is specialized to the non-AR case ($K=1$, $T \\approx 1$), the resulting sampling error $\\tilde{O}(L^2d \\eta)$ appears to be the same as the bound in [Chen et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11215). This seems to suggest that the AR framework does not introduce fundamental technical challenges that necessitate a new analysis framework.\n2. **Out-of-Date Comparisons**: As mentioned in 1, the paper's theoretical bounds are benchmarked against the [Chen et al., 2022] result. This comparison is severely out-of-date, as the field has advanced significantly. Recent works have established much tighter convergence guarantees, often under weaker assumptions. For example, [Li et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18959), establishes an $O(d/T)$ convergence rate in total variation distance under minimal assumptions. The submission completely lacks a discussion of these state-of-the-art results, making it impossible to assess the significance of its own bounds.\n3. **Strong and Unusual Assumptions**: The analysis requires an upper bound on the Hessian norm (in Assumption A2). This is a strong condition that is not standard in related literature. For instance, [Chen et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11215) only requires an L-Lipschitz score function and finite second moments. The paper fails to provide a clear justification for why this much stronger assumption is necessary for the AR setting."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could the authors please clarify the necessity of the Hessian norm upper bound in Assumption A2? Why do standard assumptions (e.g., L-Lipschitz score) suffice for non-AR models, but this stronger condition is required for the AR analysis?\n2. What is the primary technical difficulty or novelty introduced by the autoregressive setting? The proof techniques seem to closely mirror those in [Chen et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11215), and the resulting bound for $K=1$ is identical. A clearer articulation of the novel technical contribution is needed.\n3. The paper's results are benchmarked against [Chen et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11215). Could the authors provide a comprehensive discussion and comparison of their bounds with more recent, state-of-the-art results, such as those in [Chen et al., 2023](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23q/chen23q.pdf) or the $O(d/T)$ bounds in [Li & Yan, 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18959)? Contextualizing the work within these recent advancements is crucial.\n4. The paper's analysis is based on a \"sequential patch-by-patch\" factorization. This setup seems to differ from successful practical models (e.g., [VAR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02905)) that rely on a \"coarse-to-fine 'next-scale prediction'\" or upscaling structure.
