These simulations seem consistent with the above theoretical insights."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "### Model Issues\n- The authors note early in the paper that \"most existing fair clustering methods are based on the K-means clustering and thus\nrequire the distance between instances and the number of clusters to be given in advance,\" but the matching map and \"energy\" is directly a function of distances between matched points. It seems contradictory to re-introduce such a major dependency when the paper claims to be avoiding the limitations of $k$-means. If a reasonable distance is difficult to define, then this prior becomes just as ill-defined as a $k$-means objective. This seemingly undermines one of the paper's central motivations--please correct me if I am wrong on this.\n- The space of matching maps is massive and while verification checking may be fast, it seems the methods noted in the paper (like swapping in MH) would likely get stuck in local optima. The authors note that for faster convergence, they need to partially initalize $\\mathcal{T}$ using optimal transport, which suggests that they are aware of this serious limitation in the methodology.\n- The theoretical results seemingly breakdown unless very strong assumptions are imposed when $r > 0$. To circumvent the issues here, the solution is seemingly a \"heuristic modification\" or a very strong cardinality assumption (Proposition A.2). Thus, seemingly the main breakthroughs of this formulation fail to hold in the more common/general settings encountered within fair clustering.\n- The lack of extension to new data points (not in training data) is seemingly a major practical limitation. A new test point has not corresponding clustering assignment under the matching map, so the model-based clustering algorithm seems severely weakened for practical utility beyond the fixed dataset.\n\n### Missing Literature\nThe authors cite very few of the fair clustering papers, making it difficult to situate this result in the current landscape of known results. Specifically, it's odd that the authors note the main problem of fair clustering as pre-specification of the number of clusters, but many existing lines of work circumvent this exact issue. For example, fair hierarchical clustering is a major object of study in fair clustering that does not require such pre-specification but is not mentioned in this work.

These methods typically require (1) the number of clusters ($k$) to be specified in advance and (2) a pre-defined distance metric, rendering them inflexible for datasets with an unknown cluster structure or non-trivial data types (e.g., categorical data). To solve this, the authors propose a \"Fair Bayesian Clustering\" (FBC) model.  The core technical innovation is a \"fair prior\", constructed to put its mass only on fair clusters, ensuring that the model's posterior distribution naturally favors solutions that satisfy group fairness with moderate violations. They develop an efficient MCMC algorithm for posterior approximation. Experimental evidence on an extend number of datasets show the method to beat most benchlines, achieving high fairness with minimal loss in performance.

The inflexibility of fixed $k$ is a major hurdle in real-world applications. The move to a Bayesian mixture model is also a natural and powerful way to solve these problems. The ability to infer $k$ is a significant advantage for exploratory analysis, and the model-based framework is inherently more adaptable to diverse data types than distance-based algorithms.\n\nThe idea of a \"fair prior\" is very appealing. Instead of enforcing fairness as a hard constraint during optimization (which can be computationally complex) or as a post-processing step (which can be suboptimal), this approach bakes fairness directly into the model's assumptions. If the prior is well-designed, the MCMC sampler will naturally explore a \"fair\" solution space.\n\nThe authors explicitly acknowledge the difficulty of MCMC on constrained spaces and present their \"matching\" prior as a solution. This focus on developing a novel prior that also leads to an efficient MCMC algorithm is a key strength.\n\nFinally, the empirical evidence is strong in the sense that the inferred number of clusters is mostly correct, and it achieves comparable performance with the previous methods in the best scenario, with even less running time."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Despite the earlier claim that the paper focuses on the \"perfect fairness\" scenario, in section 2.1.2., when $n_1 = \\beta n_0 + r$, the fairness constraint can actually be moderately violated.

The mapping set $\\mathcal{T}$ that you are constructing seems to be equivalent to the definition of all possible decomposition of fairlets.
