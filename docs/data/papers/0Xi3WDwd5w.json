Thus, the observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences, which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal WO meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones, we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.", "tldr": "We develop a novel overlap-weighted Neyman-orthogonal meta-learner for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation over time.", "keywords": ["causal inference", "heterogeneous treatment effects", "time-varying treatments", "meta-learners", "machine learning for healthcare"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/492af11fe54c6969bccdfc3f14318ab40755a398.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles the challenge of estimating HTEs in time-varying settings, where treatment sequence overlap decreases with longer horizons.

Estimating HTEs over time is crucial for personalized medicine, and the issue of exponentially decreasing overlap is a core, practical barrier that the paper directly confronts.\n* **Methodological Novelty:** The proposed WO-learner is methodologically novel and sound. The key idea of designing a population risk function that explicitly minimizes an *overlap-weighted* oracle risk, while simultaneously enforcing Neyman-orthogonality, is the primary technical contribution.\n* **Theoretical Guarantees:** The method is supported by strong theoretical guarantees. The proof that the weighted population risk is Neyman-orthogonal with respect to all nuisance functions (including the newly defined weight functions) is a non-trivial and important result.\n* **Experimental Design:** The paper presents a broad set of experiments, including four synthetic datasets designed to isolate specific challenges (low overlap, complex nuisance functions, small sample size) and a semi-synthetic experiment based on real-world MIMIC-III covariates."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* **Marginal Absolute Improvement:** While the paper reports large *relative* improvements the *absolute* improvements in RMSE are often in the $10^{-2}$ magnitude. The practical significance of such a small absolute gain is questionable, especially given the significant added complexity of estimating the new WO pseudo-outcomes and weight functions.\n* **Flawed Real-World Validation:** The validation on real-world data is fundamentally flawed. The authors state this is a \"real-world outcome estimation\" task, which is a standard *prediction* (supervised learning) task, not a *causal inference* (HTE estimation) task. Demonstrating that the WO-learner is \"not worse\" than baselines on a predictive task provides **no evidence** of its efficacy for its stated purpose (HTE estimation). This experiment does not support the paper's core claims and raises questions about the method's applicability.\n* **Omission of Key Baselines:** The paper omits a crucial and common baseline: a standard DR learner or IPW learner with **propensity score truncation (clipping)**. This is a very common heuristic to handle low-overlap regimes. It is unclear if the WO-learner's complexity is justified over this much simpler, strong baseline.\n* **Lack of Intuition for Key Formulas:** The derivation of the key components, particularly the WO pseudo-outcomes $\\xi_{t}^{\\circ}$ and the weighting term $\\rho_{t}^{\\circ}$ in Definition 4.2, lacks intuition. They appear to be complex formulas derived to make the orthogonality proof work, rather than being motivated by a clear, first-principles-based explanation. This makes the method difficult to understand and build upon.\n* **Unclear Practicality of New Nuisance Function:** The new weight function $\\omega_{j}^{\\overline{a}}$ (Eq 11) is itself a complex expectation of products of future propensity scores. The practical challenges and stability of estimating this new, non-trivial nuisance function (especially for long horizons $\\tau$) are not sufficiently discussed.\n* **Missing Discussion of Failure Cases:** The paper does not adequately discuss the potential failure cases or limitations of the WO-learner. When would this method *not* be preferred? How does it behave in very high-dimensional or extremely sparse data settings? A \"Limitations\" section is missing.\n* **Overall Impression and Presentation:** Overall, while the problem is valid and the method is technically correct, the contribution feels incremental. The solution is an orthodox application of established causal inference principles (weighting, orthogonality) to the time-series setting, but the practical gains appear marginal, and the real-world validation is not fit-for-purpose. The work lacks a \"surprising\" element. Furthermore, the paper's presentation is overly dense, and it notably lacks a \"Conclusion\" section, which weakens the paper's summary and impact."}, "questions": {"value": "**CATE vs. CAPO Weighting:** Why is the overlap weight for CATE (Eq 10) defined as the *product* of the individual propensity weights ($\\omega^{\\overline{a}}\\omega^{\\overline{b}}$)?
