The statement “IRL … is shielded from compounding errors” is not accurate and overstates IRL's capabilities. IRL helps mitigate compounding errors, but it doesn’t guarantee avoidance. If the learned reward is misspecified/ambiguous, if the discriminator overfits, or if optimization stalls, the learned policy can still drift into regions where its behavior is poor and errors cascade.\n\n2. The method, NGT, is defined in the intro, but the logic behind the chosen name is left to multiple pages into the manuscript, and remains unclear to the reader until then. Please consider aligning the explanation with the method's name. \n\n3. The last paragraph of the introduction is not cohesive. The text keeps referring to Figure 3, and tries to justify or explain the results. The introduction is better off by focusing on high levels, and explaining specific results can be done in the experiments. It could also benefit from being split into two paragraphs. Maybe consider a more structured, cohesive, and to-the-point version of this paragraph? \n\n**Related work** \n\n4. The authors perhaps misuse the LaTeX's \\cite and \\citep commands, and make the related works section harder to follow. \n\n5. Some abbreviations are defined multiple times (like OT), and some are defined and never used again, like Maxent IRL.\n\n6. The related work section could also use some structure, like categorizing the previous work based on their main perspective or application.\n\n**Background**\n\n7. What does it mean to reset $\\gamma$? Isn't the discount factor fixed while learning?\n\n**Methodology**\n\n8. The definition of actor-critic methods belongs more to the background than the methodology, the same for reply buffer and SAC. \n\n9. Equation (1) is far from any density estimator, not only because it doesn't integrate to 1, but because it varies based on different seeds, scaling, etc. Given this, is calling it a pseudo-density still justified? \n\n10. In Equation (2), the authors basically reparameterize the discriminator as a frozen random network + predictor, but it’s still optimizing \na divergence between expert and agent distributions. There’s no clear reason why this avoids vanishing gradients. Don't gradient magnitudes depend on how the predictor generalizes, not on its target’s randomness? A clarification on this is indeed needed here. \n\n11. Why choose an exponential function of potential for the reward (other functions can provide positivity and a suitable range)? Exponentiating the reward makes the system exponentially sensitive to small changes in the potential, which can happen based on noise or initialization.  \n\n12. The reward is a derived quantity, not a general potential. There’s no guarantee this mapping can represent all 1-Lipschitz functions.\nIt’s actually a highly restricted subset of functions shaped by the architecture of loss and the initialization of networks. So how is this an effective search within 1-Lipschitz functions? \n\n13. Upon reading the proof of Theorem 4.1, I believe that there is an ambiguous logic applied in the last line, where the comparison switches from less than or equal to an equality without any justification. Can you elaborate on this? \n\n14. In addition to the previous concern, I think the basic properties of Lipschitz compositions are known, and Theorem 4.1 merely restates them? It’s useful to state, but the framing reads stronger than it is, more like part of the paper's contributions. Can you justify this?\n\n**Experiments**\n\n15. Running for only 4 random seeds could be insufficient, especially for low-data regimes with higher uncertainty. Is the low number of seeds due to computational problems of the method / baselines? \n\n16. On the previous note, I expected to see larger error bands for fewer demonstrations, but the plots in the main text do not follow this trend. Why is this the case? And why does lower data not cause higher uncertainty in the predictions, not only in NGT but also across other baselines?"}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the weaknesses, and justify the comments / answer the questions.

The proposed ideas seem novel and worth exploring."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "While the idea of the paper is interesting, I believe that the execution is lacking in presentation and experimentation. Overall, I find the paper poorly written and often unnecessarily hard to digest. Several sections are very long-winded, and explicit mathematical notation is often missing. A clearly written background would have significantly improved the clarity and impact of the paper. Additionally, I find some claims overly bold and the experimental section to be insufficiently rigorous. I address some specific concerns below:\n\n1. Section 4.1 is very unclear. The paper does not motivate or introduce “learning from random priors”. A short background on this would greatly improve the clarity and impact of the paper. On line 133, “By the properties of neural networks,” is also a very vague reasoning. If I understand correctly, this is true only given infinite data and if the function is trained till global optimality. This assumption is clearly violated in the data-sparse settings that this paper analyses. Please correct me if I am mistaken.   \n\n2. On line 168, “Methods based on GANs optimise a JS-divergence between distributions $P_{expert}$ and $P_{agent}$, which suffers from mode collapse and vanishing gradients” is again an unsupported and potentially incorrect statement. If I am not mistaken, optimising the Jensen-Shannon divergence is not necessarily the root cause for GAN instabilities. Rather, the issue likely arises because of perfect discrimination and poorly aligned supports [1, appendix E in 2].\n\n3. Could you please clarify how Eq 2 is different from the apprenticeship learning setup (Eq 6 in [3])? To my understanding, your objective of “distinguishing the expert and agent distributions” is closely aligned with several prior works in IRL. If this is the case, I request the authors to rewrite their claims to mention that their method is a reformulation of the distribution matching idea (but from an OT point of view). \n\n4. The core functionality of this paper is quite close to Adversarial Motion Priors [4], a method that uses the WGAN style loss for adversarial IL. I believe that this is important prior work that should at least be mentioned in the analysis of this paper (and potentially used as a baseline). \n\n5. The experiments in this paper only use 4 random seeds per task. In my opinion, this is quite low and not rigorous enough to rule out the possibility that the reported results are due to random fluctuations or chance rather than consistent underlying performance differences. A larger number of seeds (10+) would help to claim statistically significant improvements.\n\n6. On line 460, the authors state that “we did not carry out per-task tuning for any method.” I believe this is a flawed methodology. Each method should be tuned individually for each task, or alternatively, all methods should be tuned to achieve the best average performance across all tasks. Using the same hyperparameters across tasks that differ significantly in dynamics, reward formulations, and optimal expert policies leads to an unfair comparison and potentially misleading conclusions. Different environments naturally require distinct exploration strategies and hyperparameter settings. Consequently, applying a fixed hyperparameter set across all tasks may cause some baselines (such as DiffAIL) to underperform relative to their true potential. I therefore request that the authors clarify their hyperparameter tuning strategy—specifically, for which environments the methods were tuned and for which they were kept fixed.\n\n**Clarity Concerns:**\n\n1. In section 3 (lines 110-117), could you please include the full expressions for the transition dynamics $P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$ and reward function $r(s,a)$. The line “policy π(a|s) maps states s ∈ S to distributions over actions a ∈ A, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards” is incorrect as the policy does not map states to distributions. It *is* a distribution over actions conditioned on a given state. Also, the RL objective is to maximise the *expected* cumulative reward (unless your work sets up the problem differently). Additionally, could you please clarify the line “We work in the episodic setting, where γ resets to 0 upon episode termination”?\n\n2. The beginning of section 4 (lines 121-137) is phrased very awkwardly in my opinion. I would prefer if the terms are defined explicitly in mathematical language (eg: $r_{\\zeta}: \\mathbb{X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{R}$ where $\\mathbb{X}$ is either $\\mathbb{S} \\times \\mathbb{S}$ …). Please also explicitly define $P_{expert}$ and $P_{agent}$. The definitions will change depending on $\\mathbb{X}$ (eg: $P_{agent}(s,a) = \\pi(a|s) \\sum_{t} \\gamma^t P_{agent}(s)$). I believe that, unless necessary for the rest of the paper, the explanation of the actor-critic methods can be relegated to the appendix. \n\n3. I don’t find Figure 1 particularly informative. From what I understand, it is an aggregation of all the curves in Figure 2. However, such aggregation across different tasks loses any nuance/meaning. I also don’t understand how the normalization is done in this figure. Do you consider mean expert performance across tasks? If so, how do you account for the fact that all environments have different max expert performances? Further, the dotted lines in Figure 1 aren’t labelled, nor is Figure 1 referenced in the text. Could you also explain why the humanoid results were omitted? \n\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Arjovsky M, Bottou L.
