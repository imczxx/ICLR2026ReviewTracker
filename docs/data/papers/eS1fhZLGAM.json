Case studies in software agent design", "abstract": "LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains, they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose a framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands, collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case studies around how three agent design decisions---choice of LLM backbone, planning strategy, and memory mechanisms---impact developer satisfaction rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing confidence intervals by 40\\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find substantial discrepancies in-the-wild results with benchmark performance (e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and GPT-5, underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and identify opportunities for better agent designs.", "tldr": "Benchmarks don't tell the full picture about agent utility to humans.", "keywords": ["evaluation", "human-AI interaction", "coding agent"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a2d8b033334806406692e8e8ffc709b1dac75afc.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b3e19130ef2b403a7708566be9d030ad0e3110ae.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper makes an effort to build a comprehensive assessment of human-agent interactions.

This can result in a biased sample that does not represent the average user. It would be better if the authors acknowledged this limitation and discussed how this potential bias might influence their results.\n\n2: The computational cost analysis is missing. The authors mentioned it is cost-effective in memory management part, but the paper lacks the API cost for gpt-5, claude-4-sonnet and alcude-3.7-sonnet.

As the authors themselves note, prior work has already explored predicting user satisfaction in multi-turn dialogue using explicit user ratings. Extending this paradigm to software agent interactions is incremental and does not yield new theoretical insights.\n\n2.Lack of reproducibility and data accessibility. The empirical findings rely entirely on proprietary user data that will not be released due to privacy concerns. Without access to the dataset or a simulator, one cannot verify, reproduce, or extend the study, substantially reducing its community impact.\n\n3.Simplistic feedback signal and sparse coverage. The reliance on a 5-star scale at ~5% response rate introduces concerns about signal quality and representativeness. While the authors aggregate ratings across work segments to increase granularity, the fundamental sparsity may limit the model’s ability to capture satisfaction drivers. Incorporating implicit behavioral signals (dwell time, edit patterns) could strengthen the supervision signal.\n\n4.Underdeveloped baseline comparisons. The study claims that the trained ML models “significantly outperform state-of-the-art LLMs across all metrics,” while providing only raw trajectory data to the LLM-as-a-Judge baseline, without any structured context management, prompt decomposition, or summarization. This setup limits the LLM’s ability to reason over long histories and identify latent satisfaction cues.\n\n5.Questionable validity of semi-supervised inference. The PPI extension relies on the assumption that the prediction model f(X) is unbiased or has bounded bias. Given the low label response rate (~5%) and potential selection bias, the extent to which this assumption holds warrants further investigation. Sensitivity analyses varying the labeling rate or testing on held-out labeled data could strengthen confidence in the pseudo-label quality.\n\n6.Limited scalability and generality. The framework’s dependence on large-scale real user deployment restricts its applicability. It is unclear how the approach would generalize to domains lacking constant human traffic or how to replicate such evaluations without a similar data infrastructure."}, "questions": {"value": "1.Would releasing anonymized summaries or a simulator allow the community to reproduce at least part of the results?\n\n2.Could richer feedback signals (e.g., implicit behavioral metrics like dwell time or edit frequency) enhance satisfaction prediction beyond the 5-star scale?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "HQ60fOi5kW", "forum": "eS1fhZLGAM", "replyto": "eS1fhZLGAM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13759/Reviewer_tAbp"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13759/Reviewer_tAbp"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13759/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762092364703, "cdate": 1762092364703, "tmdate": 1762924290861, "mdate": 1762924290861, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
