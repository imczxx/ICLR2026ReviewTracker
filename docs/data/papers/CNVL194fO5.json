Scalable Time Series Forecasting via Local Cross-Variate Modeling", "abstract": "Effectively modeling cross-variate dependencies is a central, yet challenging, task in multivariate time series forecasting.\nWhile attention-based methods have advanced the state-of-the-art by capturing global cross-variate dependencies, their quadratic complexity with respect to the number of variates severely limits their scalability. In this work, we challenge the necessity of global dependency modeling. We posit, through both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, that modeling local cross-variate interactions is not only sufficient but also more efficient for many dense dependency systems.\nMotivated by this core insight, we propose VPNet, a novel architecture that excels in both accuracy and efficiency. VPNet's design is founded on two key principles: a channelized reinterpretation of patch embeddings into a higher-level variate-patch field, and a specialized VarTCNBlock that operates upon it. Specifically, the model first employs a patch-level autoencoder to extract robust local representations. In a pivotal step, these representations are then re-conceptualized as a 2D field constructed over a \"variates × patches\" grid. The VarTCNBlock then applies depthwise 2D convolutions across this field to efficiently capture local spatio-temporal patterns (i.e., cross-variate and temporal dependencies simultaneously), followed by pointwise convolutions for feature mixing. This design ensures that the computational complexity scales linearly with the number of variates. Finally, variate-wise prediction heads map the refined historical patch representations to future ones, which are decoded back into the time domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VPNet not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks but also offers significant efficiency gains, establishing it as a superior and scalable solution for high-dimensional forecasting.", "tldr": "This work shows that local cross-variate dependency capturing is effective for dense time series and introduces VPNet, which reinterprets patch embeddings as a variate–patch 2D field to enable accurate, scalable forecasting with linear complexity.", "keywords": ["Time Series Forecasting", "Time Series Analysis", "Deep Learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d37b1bef2435f1b9f45c055e831cb45ee1051383.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e3fbcbd5db1bbe42ddf7c086adbc8ff6c5ecb3e9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes VPNet, a multivariate time-series forecasting framework that models localized cross-variate interactions via depthwise 2D convolutions on a variate–patch representation.

The paper provides a clear and well-motivated perspective questioning the necessity of global dependency modeling in multivariate forecasting. By framing the problem through the Local Sufficiency Hypothesis, the work contributes a conceptual shift that has relevance for both theory and practical model design.\n2.

This design reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear with respect to the number of variables while preserving modeling capacity.\n3.

Lack of discussion on scenarios where locality may be insufficient.\nWhile the model performs well on the evaluated datasets, it is unclear how it behaves in settings with strong long-range or sparse inter-variable dependencies. Without an analysis of potential failure cases or applicability boundaries, the generality of the proposed approach remains uncertain.\n3. Limited interpretability analysis regarding learned dependency structure.\nGiven that the core contribution concerns how the model captures local cross-variate relationships, the paper would benefit from visualizations or interpretability studies (e.g., patch importance, receptive field inspection).

The theory assumes random variate permutations when quantifying the probability that a local window contains an informative neighbor. Real systems often have structured (and non-exchangeable) dependencies; the proof does not address such structure nor provide guarantees beyond dense regimes.\n2. While the paper claims robustness to different orderings in one setting, the practical definition of “local neighbors” depends on variate ordering. More systematic analysis (beyond a small-kernel, shallow-stack case) is needed, including learned or data-driven orderings and lag-aware neighborhoods.\n3.

The title in the manuscript is different from that of the submission page. I think it should be revised. \n2. I wonder how we define the \"appropriately chosen finite local neighborhood\" in Local Sufficiency Hypothesis. The variates naturally do not have orders and are permutation-invariant. Although the ablation study provides some results on the effect of variate reordering. I feel that might not be valid on all datasets. Some orders are better than others on some datasets. However, I do not observe some patterns/insights on the results - e.g., which order we should use for which dataset. \n3. I am curious how performance may change if we vary the input length.
