Limited by the scarcity of observations, tabular datasets often exhibit critical deficiencies, such as class imbalance, selection bias and low fidelity. To address these challenges, building on recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper introduces team-then-trim, a framework that synthesizes high-quality tabular data through a collaborative team of LLMs, followed by a rigorous data quality control (QC) pipeline. In our framework, tabular data generation is conceptualized as a manufacturing process: specialized LLMs, guided by domain knowledge, are tasked with generating different data components sequentially, and the resulting products, i.e., the synthetic data, are systematically evaluated across multiple dimensions of QC. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in producing high-quality tabular data, highlighting its potential to support downstream models when direct data collection is practically infeasible.", "tldr": "We introduces team-then-trim, a framework that synthesizes high-quality tabular data through a collaborative team of LLMs, followed by a rigorous data quality control pipeline.", "keywords": ["Large language models", "Tabular data", "Data generation", "Data quality control"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2e397f2880a8892f83fa5a74620896c19ed3e86a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes the team-then-trim framework for tabular data generation in low-data regimes (n<100).\n\nIt’s two parts (1) Multi-agent synthetic data generation & (2) QC pipeline.\n\nAssessed on different tabular data settings vs other generative and LLM based synthetic data generators.\n\nCore contribution: LLM decomposition via multi-agent workers and a different curation mechanism (not the idea of the generation+curation pipeline itself, which prior work proposed)"}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "- Significance: Tackles an important and well-studied problem with high impact in many domains\n\n- Originality: Proposes an interesting idea of multi-agent synthetic data generation + a multi-step QC pipeline.\nThe idea of feature decomposition and the generation to respect dependencies is great.\n\n- Quality: Good set of experiments in many scenarios: (imbalance, incompleteness, noise, scarcity) + multiple downstream models.\nSeems to outperform existing methods on the settings tested (albeit minimally)\n\n- Clarity: clearly written paper"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "(1) Limited novelty: basically the same idea as CLLM, just with a multi-agent approach + different QC approach.

Moreover, ‘team-then-trim’ has some similarities with [1] in terms of using specialized model components per column/subset of columns (MoEs for [1], worker LLMs here), so it is also important to compare and contrast the pros and cons in related works.\n\n- [**Experiment on model sizes**] Varying model sizes will be interesting to understand its importance on data quality. Questions around design choices such as “Larger/smaller task manager + smaller/larger role specialists” i.e do we need more capable task manager with average workers or an average task manager with highly capable workers; will be interesting to understand. \n    - Questions like “how’s varying model size affects data quality” will also come under this experimental design choice. \n\n- [**Experiment on model families**] Related to above and a follow-up one would be to look at different families of LLMs for Task Manager and role specialists. Will there be any bias coming up due to collaborations among LLMs coming from different families?\n    - Eg: in LLM-as-a-judge literature, there’s bias associated with model preferring responses given by it’s family [4] i.e self-preference bias. So, any analysis and observation in that direction would be interesting. \n    - Appendix E is an interesting starting point for addressing this kind of follow-up questions.\n\n- [**Discussion on time complexity**] Please add time complexity analysis for proposed framework. The size of task manager and role specialist workers (if they are different), number of columns and rows to be generated, number of LLM workers to be used, costs associated with data quality checks (clustering) etc; contribute to overall time complexity. As some of it is data-specific (columns) and task-manager specific decisions (how many workers to assign), it is important to understand the time complexity from practical standpoint beforehand. \n    - [Question, L804] Please add more details in this section in terms of how many samples were generated for each dataset?\n\n- [**Discussion/Experiment on additional metrics**] Inclusion of additional metrics such as MLE (Machine Learning Efficacy) [5], DCR (Distance to closest record) [6], Discrimination [7] is important for discussions associated with privacy preservation, synthetic-vs-real data quality validation. \n    - This will complement some of the discussions in Sec 2.2, especially for objective and diversity cost assessments.\n    - Consider adding descriptions of various metrics in Appendix (including AUC, Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall etc;) complementing sec 3.2.2.\n\n- [**Discussion/Experiment on construction and evaluation of `G`**] From Fig 5 (L760-765), I see that task manager LLM is responsible in forming the relationships among data (i.e construction of `G`, eq. 1), and would like to know how it fairs with manual-human graph construction and assignment of worker LLMs. And how can one evaluate the quality of `G` i.e discard it or regenerate the work assignments.\n\n- [**Discussion/Possible Experiment**] How can one extend the framework for their use case specific requirements for which LLMs doesn’t have enough domain knowledge, let’s say rare data which LLMs didn’t learn in their training process? For example, to generate UUIDs, distinct IDs which is rare/might be spurious from training process. Is it possible to do some fine-tuning with the current framework to get reliable predictions? \n\n- [**Discussion/Experiment on column dependencies**] Following up from previous point, how does the conditional order of data generation affect in scenarios when columns has a bidirectional relationship i.e there can be different choices to resolve a scenario such as: \n  - Generate column A, then column B vs \n  - Generate column B, then column A or \n  - Generate both A and B together. So, understanding how task-manager (LLM) and human might resolve role conflicts would be interesting.   \n    - A quick experiment would be to pick a dataset and have task-manager generated roles and human generated roles and compare the performance differences on role conflicts and worker assignment differences. \n    - Consider adding discussion on different scenarios i.e “independent columns, unidirectionally causal columns and bidirectionally causal columns”.\n\n1.
