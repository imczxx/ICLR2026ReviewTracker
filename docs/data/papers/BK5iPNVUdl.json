To address these issues, we propose a novel SID paradigm that leverages the ODE formulation of diffusion models. Rather than reconstructing images, our method analyzes the probability flow trajectories from data distributions to a Gaussian prior. We show that the discrete-step distances on the Wasserstein manifold inherently encode reconstruction error, and that real and synthetic images diverge most significantly in the early half of the diffusion inversion. Real images exhibit higher curvature variance with extreme deviations, whereas synthetic ones follow smoother, more consistent trajectories. Building on this insight, we introduce curvature features of probability flow trajectories as a new discriminative signal.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit probability flow curvature for SID. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generalizes robustly to unseen models, achieves SOTA results across multiple benchmarks, and does so with less than half the computational cost of full diffusion inversion.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Synthetic Image Detection"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c839f295f93ff581966787dfdb3d7ae5b41d9399.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7f0a789dbe63f561cf1c96cf0f50a31edca66ff2.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tackles the task of synthetic image detection.

The abstract reads \"We show that the discrete-step distances on the Wasserstein manifold inherently encode reconstruction error\" and discussion in Section 4.1 mentions that existing observations regarding the overall reconstruction error, when combined with Theorem 2, imply that synthetic trajectories tend to be straighter than those of real images (line 236). As I understand, Theorem 2 links W2 between intermediate marginals to the velocity, saying nothing about the reconstruction error obtained via inversion. Can the authors clarify?\n\n2. As I understand, curvature features are extracted over the context of the full trajectories (Equation 16). Some discussion on this choice and whether your findings connect with existing work (e.g., [1]) would be appreciated. Have you investigated whether specific regions/time-steps are consistently more informative?\n\n3. The overall method includes curvature features and wavelet features. Does the method not work without them? An ablation study on this, e.g., curvature only or wavelet only or both would be helpful.\n\n4. How should the results in Tables 1 and 2 be interpreted? As I understand, you report conditional metrics on synthetic data from various models. This not sufficient to judge performance without also quantifying performance on real data. While you have provided details about the synthetic data, I couldn't find any information about benchmarking on real data, which is just as important in binary classification. Could you please clarify?\n\n\n[Minor] Consider merging the Appendix (in supplementary material) with the main paper for better readability.\n\n[Minor] The paper is mathematically dense so consider being a bit more explicit with notation and definitions.
