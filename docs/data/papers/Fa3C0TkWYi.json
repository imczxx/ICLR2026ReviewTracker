The limited generalization of current approaches can be attributed to their inability to accurately perceive complex degradations in weather-affected images. Moreover, owing to optimization objectives that prioritize distortion losses, discriminative methods often produce overly smooth reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{RectiWeather}, a novel AWR framework guided by zero-shot soft perceptions extracted from pre-trained vision–language models (VLMs). Specifically, we design an AWR-specific Question Answering (AWR-QA) module that guides VLMs to produce soft perceptions of weather conditions and low-level attributes. These soft perceptions are then integrated into baseline AWR models through attribute-modulated normalization (AMN) and weather-weighted adapters (WWA), enabling posterior mean estimation while minimizing distortion loss. Furthermore, we map the posterior output to the clean image distribution using a perception-aware rectified flow model, where soft perceptions define the source distribution and guide the velocity field. Extensive experiments show that RectiWeather consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity and perceptual metrics across both all-in-one and out-of-distribution scenarios. Our code will be released upon publication.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["zero-shot", "soft perception", "rectified flow"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0ccbf8172fd9da11e5a1c3badd0efedef04b4355.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes RectiWeather, an all-in-one framework for adverse weather removal.

However, the method simply employs a predefined Vision-Language Model (VLM). Although the AWR-specific Question Answering (AWR-QA) module is introduced, the improvement in perceiving underlying weather conditions appears to stem primarily from the pretrained VLM, rather than from any novel mechanism proposed in this work.\n\n- The paper appears to overstate its contributions. \n\nThe only out-of-domain degradation evaluated (Tab. 5) is low-light enhancement, while other tables simply study the same types of degradations using different training and testing datasets. This evidence is insufficient to support the claim of an all-in-one framework, as the degradation types are limited and the model’s generalization ability remains unclear.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the proposed attribute-modulated normalization (AMN) seems largely equivalent to adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN). The authors are encouraged to clarify this relationship or highlight any substantive differences.\n\nRegarding the Weather-Weighted Adapters (WWA), the design introduces N separate branches, each corresponding to a specific weather type. This raises concerns about generalization to unseen weather conditions, as the approach appears constrained to the predefined categories used during training.\n\n- Definition–Question–Answering Process\n\nThe process of injecting definitions of weather conditions aims to strengthen the Vision-Language Model (VLM) by constraining its decision boundaries. However, this approach resembles a manual optimization process. In a reasoning model (which might be worth to explored with), the reasoning procedure should ideally be automatic rather than manually guided."}, "questions": {"value": "- Producing Soft Perceptions via Multiple Conversations\n\nIf the goal is to obtain soft perceptions, it may be more appropriate to utilize the token features before projection to the logits, as they better preserve nuanced information.\n\n- Discussion of the related work\n\nThere are other relevant works such as [1].

Recent frameworks proposed in ECCV 2024, ICCV 2025 already explore text-conditioned or perception-guided restoration, but these are not properly discussed or compared. The proposed “zero-shot perception” component is not fundamentally new and is close to common prompt-guided modulation used in vision–language models. The rectified flow stage also follows existing perception-aware flow or diffusion formulations without offering theoretical or algorithmic innovation.\n\n- The technical novelty is limited because the method mostly combines existing modules rather than introducing new principles. The perception extraction is implemented through simple logit-based weighting and does not demonstrate genuine semantic understanding or reasoning capability. The paper also lacks in-depth analysis of how these soft perceptions actually improve image quality or model generalization.\n\n- The experiments rely primarily on synthetic datasets, which do not represent the difficulty of real adverse weather conditions. The evaluation results show only moderate improvements and do not convincingly demonstrate robustness or realism under challenging real-world scenarios. The claim of “photo-realistic” restoration is not well supported by visual evidence, since many results still appear smooth and lack fine texture.
