Recently, graph domain adaptation has emerged as a promising solution to transfer knowledge from a labeled source graph to an unlabeled target graph. However, most existing methods typically rely on a closed-set assumption, which fails when unknown classes exist in the target domain. Toward this end, in this paper, we investigate the challenging open-set graph domain adaptation problem and propose a dual evidence-aware uncertainty learning framework ETA that simultaneously identifies unknown target nodes and enhances knowledge transfer under the evidential learning theory. Specifically, we adopt a dual-branch encoder to capture both implicit local structures and explicit global semantic consistency within the graph, and leverage evidential deep learning to integrate the evidence from both branches, where the resulting evidence is parameterized by a Dirichlet distribution to estimate class probabilities and enable uncertainty quantification. Based on the identified unknown target node, we further construct cross-domain neighborhoods and perform MixUp-based virtual sample generation in the latent space. Then, we introduce evidential adjacency-consistent uncertainty to evaluate uncertainty consistency across neighborhoods, which serves as auxiliary guidance for robust domain alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ETA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in open-set graph domain adaptation tasks.", "tldr": "The paper introduces a dual evidence-enhanced uncertainty-aware learning framework for the problem of open-set graph domain adaptation.", "keywords": ["Graph Domain Adaption", "Open-Set Learning"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/25274de5a43faeedea66a4cf7cf7a5554d851757.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper \"ETA: Dual Evidence-Aware Uncertainty Learning for Open-Set Graph Domain Adaptation\" proposes a novel framework to address the challenging problem of Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) where the target graph contains new, unknown classes not seen in the source domain."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The proposal of a dual-branch encoder is well-motivated. Graphs exhibit both local neighborhood effects and long-range dependencies, and capturing evidence from both perspectives before fusing it via the evidential learning framework likely leads to more robust and accurate evidence accumulation for final classification and uncertainty estimation.\n\n2. The introduction of MixUp-based virtual sample generation in the latent space, conditioned on identified unknown nodes and cross-domain neighborhoods, is a clever technique. This MixUp strategy creates an auxiliary supervision signal that encourages smoother transitions between known classes and the unknown class, promoting more robust domain alignment while mitigating the negative transfer caused by the unknown samples."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The performance of EDL-based models can be sensitive to the design of the evidence loss and regularization terms (e.g., the $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{evidence}}$ term mentioned in similar literature). The description of the evidential adjacency-consistent uncertainty term suggests a careful loss formulation, but the precise formulation and parameter tuning should be detailed and discussed.\n\n2. While fusing local and global evidence is intuitive, the paper may need clearly explain how the evidence from the two branches (Dirichlet distributions) is formally combined/integrated (e.g., using Dempster-Shafer theory's combination rule or a simpler summation/concatenation of concentration parameters) and why that specific fusion method is optimal for this graph problem."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
