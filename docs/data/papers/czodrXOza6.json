The paper’s main claim (that existing methods fail to reproduce emergent behaviors such as explosive synchronization or hysteresis) is not evaluated. The reported metrics (e.g., KS distance) capture temporal distributional differences but, because they (a) consider distributions over the full graph and (b) are averaged across time, they are unlikely to detect failures in system-level emergent dynamics. If the authors believe such behavior explains the gains in Table 1, a qualitative exploration of specific graph transitions that MulDyDiff captures (but baselines miss) would strengthen the case. Otherwise, evaluation using new metrics explicitly designed to quantify emergent behavior is needed.\n- Limited and uneven empirical support. The model is compared to baselines on only two of the three datasets, and results are mixed: gains on some measures (node behavior, BC) come at the expense of degradation on others (RW). Without deeper analysis of these trade-offs, it is unclear whether the improvements reflect genuine modeling benefits or selective optimization of certain graph statistics. \n- Model complexity. The cross-layer coupling and behavior-guided components substantially increase model parametrization, yet there is no comparison of parameter counts, asymptotic complexity, or parameter efficiency relative to baselines. The modest empirical improvements could simply stem from higher model capacity. This is not inherently a flaw, but given that the gains are not consistent across all network metrics, it remains unclear how much of the improvement derives from MulDyDiff’s conceptual innovations versus its expanded parameterization."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "4Zji5XdLey", "forum": "czodrXOza6", "replyto": "czodrXOza6", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4988/Reviewer_Mm6d"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4988/Reviewer_Mm6d"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4988/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762100418762, "cdate": 1762100418762, "tmdate": 1762917807727, "mdate": 1762917807727, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors of the work propose a method to generate synthetic dynamic multiplex graphs, where nodes are assumed to have time-varying attributes that influence the link generation in multiple layers.

Could the authors explain this motivation of their work better? \n\nAlso, the motivation mentions hysteresis as another important emergent phenomenon, but as far as I see this is actually not considered in the paper. How are hystereses effects considered by your model? I see that there are comments on hysteresis in the Kuramoto model in appendix G2 but I think it should be more clearly stated how this relates to the hysteresis example in the motivation (I think that the relation is weak at best).\n\nFinally, the motivation suggests that multi-layer structure is a precondition for explosive synchronization and hysteresis, which is not the case as there many examples for such effects in dynamical systems on non-multiplex graphs as well. I think this should be reformulated. \n\n- [Q2] From the rather opaque description of the attributed evolution-aware forward process in section 4.1 I could not follow what kind of temporal patterns this part of the model is actually able to capture. Also, I find the notation hard to parse, which does not help to appreciate the underlying ideas. Explaining the meaning of variable s = 1, ..., S early on would also help the reader understand the process. The same holds for the description of the section 4.2, which simply gives the equations without much additional explanations.\n\nMoreover, I have some questions about the cross-layer correlation aware denoising, which builds on a time-evolving cross-layer coupling graph which captures edges between nodes in different layers. What kind of cross-layer correlations does this capture? It seems that those are necessarily based on inter-layer links between specific nodes, which may miss more subtle patterns (e.g. nodes in different communities in different layers that are preferentially connected). Could the authors clarify this? \n\nI would generally recommend that the authors include an intuitive description of what the diffusion process actually captures and then potentially move part of the specific mathematical formulation to the appendix?\n\n- [Q3] Similar to my comments in Q2, from the description in section 4.2.3 I could not follow how the behavior-guidance is actually done. Since this is a major point that could point to a more fundamental misunderstanding of the authors' work, I have structured this in a separate question.\n\nIn particular, the mathematical formulation in eq. 11 and 12 seems to suggest that we actually need to simulate the Kuramoto model to obtain the order parameter, which is then included in the diffusion model. However, this also requires us to set timescales for the simulation, i.e. at what speed does the (continuous-time) model evolve compared to the speed of the evolution of the temporal graph. This is not discussed in the paper, but I believe it is an important point that must be clarified.\n\nAlso, instead of actually simulation the model wouldn't it be possible to use spectral properties to implement the behavior guidance, e.g. the eigenration of the Laplacian matrix which is known to determine the synchronization behavior of Kuramoto oscillators in graphs?\n\n- [Q4] I think it would greatly help the motivation of this work, if the authors could clearly work out a research gap that this work addresses. To this end, the current very brief description of related works is insufficient and - in my view - partly misleading. As an example, in the remark at the end of section 4.1 the authors state that: \n\n\"Unlike prior temporal graph generators (Campbell et al., 2024; Liu & Sariyuce, 2023; Wang et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2022; Zeno et al., 2021), our forward process explicitly encodes temporal dependencies between the current and previous timestamps.\"\n\nIt sounds curious that prior works on temporal graph generators did not consider dependencies between the current and past timesteps of a graph (which is the key point in modelling temporal graphs) and indeed a quick check reveals that some of the cited works include a conditioning on the previous timestamp much in the same way as the present work. I thus believe that the statement above is too general and kindly ask the authors to clarify the contribution over these prior works.\n\n- [Q5] I was very confused by the experimental evaluation, which mentions three data sets and then only presents results on two of them (the third one only being used for the ablation study). Why did you not include results for the third data set. \n\nAlso, it is not clear to me how the evaluation metrics have been chosen (why do we care about the KS-statistic between centrality distributions). Finally, it is not even clear what some of the metrics mean (node behavior, Random Walk) and how they are defined. This must be clarified before this paper can be published.\n\nAlso, in the sensitivity analysis the authors check the impact of the hyperparameters \\gamma_0 and sequence length, but the values used for the main results are not mentioned (and it is not made clear whether these hyperparameters were optimized). Also, the model formulation includes another parameter (noise strength) which is not mentioned in the experimental evaluation.
