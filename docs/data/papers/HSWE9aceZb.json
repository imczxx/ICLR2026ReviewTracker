However, evaluating their practical utility in complex operational environments is hindered by data scarcity (due to privacy concerns) and the limitations of current benchmarks. Existing benchmarks often lack realism, failing to incorporate deep knowledge base (KB) integration, real-world noise, or critical operational tasks beyond conversational fluency.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce CXMdataset, a novel, large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset specifically designed for evaluating AI in operational CXM contexts. Given the diversity in possible contact center features, we have developed a scalable LLM-powered pipeline that simulates the brand's CXM entities that form the foundation of our datasets—such as knowledge articles including product specifications, issue taxonomies, and contact center conversations. The entities closely represent real-world distribution because of controlled noise injection (informed by domain experts) and rigorous automated validation.\n\nBuilding on this, we release CXMdataset, which provides dedicated benchmarks targeting five important operational tasks: Knowledge Base Refinement, Intent Prediction, Agent Quality Adherence, Article Search, and Multi-turn RAG with Integrated Tools.\n\nOur baseline experiments underscore the benchmark's difficulty: even state-of-the-art embedding and generation models achieve only 68% accuracy on article search, while standard embedding methods yield a low F1 score of 0.3 for knowledge base refinement, highlighting significant challenges for current models necessitating complex pipelines and solutions over conventional techniques.", "tldr": "We introduce a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset to evaluate AI performance on critical operational tasks in realistic Customer Experience Management (CXM) scenarios.", "keywords": ["Benchmark Dataset", "Customer Experience Management", "CXM", "Large Language Models", "Synthetic Data Generation", "Contact Center AI", "Retrieval Augmented Generation", "RAG", "Intent Prediction", "LLM", "CXMArena"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b60e2e527e0c164616b568d3be01ca6bbbd8d143.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c9e16a0c3802eb2cb465ab3c08cf2a061d11b36b.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors developed a new way to automatically generate a complete, brand-specific Knowledge Base (KB) for Customer Experience Management (CXM) problems.

A stronger justification would help frame the benchmark as a cohesive suite of tasks designed to address novel CXM challenges, rather than a collection of disconnected components. (e.g. any unique challenge around jointly performing KB retrieval, tool call during a multi-turn RAG problem?)\n\nWhile the paper does involve an evaluation on an end-to-end RAG task, a key methodological detail that remains unclear is how tool outputs are simulated during the multi-turn RAG evaluation, or if tool calls are simulated at all.
