While approaches like self-correction and response selection have emerged as popular solutions, recent studies have shown these methods perform poorly when relying on the LLM itself to provide feedback or selection criteria. We argue this limitation stems from the fact that common LLM post-training procedures lack explicit supervision for discriminative judgment tasks.\nIn this paper, we propose Generative Self-Aggregation (GSA), a novel prompting method that improves answer quality without requiring the model's discriminative capabilities. GSA first samples multiple diverse responses from the LLM, then aggregates them to obtain an improved solution. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require the LLM to correct errors or compare response quality; instead, it leverages the model's generative abilities to synthesize a new response based on the context of multiple samples.\nWhile GSA shares similarities with the self-consistency (SC) approach for response aggregation, SC requires specific verifiable tokens to enable majority voting. In contrast, our approach is more general and can be applied to open-ended tasks. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that GSA effectively improves response quality across various tasks, including mathematical reasoning, knowledge-based problems, and open-ended generation tasks such as code synthesis and conversational responses.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["large language model", "self-consistency", "prompting"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f121e9273f82c4b521f9b147a74417b1104ef30e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly capable, they often need help with complex problems.

Figure 1 and the worked examples make the intuition tangible (e.g., synthesizing from multiple solution paths to fix earlier missteps).\n\nS2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors show their main results across four models and 7-8 diverse domains (math, knowledge, science and open-ended tasks). It is great that the authors also perform cost-aware comparison by fixing model calls (N=4) for fairness and further provides an “adjusted calls” comparison in Table 4. The authors perform meaningful ablations showcasing the effects of number of responses (Figure 2), temperature (Figure 3), and sampling strategies (template variation and multilingual sampling in Table 3) demonstrate robustness to these knobs. It is also useful detail that GSA can succeed even when all individual candidates are wrong, which selection-based methods cannot.\n\nS3.

This level of detail is helpful for practitioners to try GSA quickly."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "W1: My main concern with the paper is that it has very thin contribution. The improvement is minimal (< 1% in most cases compared to SC and also seen in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). Further, numbers reported without error bars on smaller datasets (like GPQA) make the improvement of GSA even harder to discern. The authors say that SC's \"application to open-ended tasks remains challenging due to the lack of clear voting mechanisms.\" While I acknowledge this, there are some indirect ways to go about this like embedding the responses and choosing the cluster with the highest count (or using a LLM-as-a-judge to perform semantic equivalence between two responses and then doing self-consistency).\n\nW2: Apart from greedy decoding, evaluation at recommended temperature, top_p, etc. (for eg: Qwen recommends temp=0.7, top_p=0.8, etc.) should also be done and similarly added to Tables 1/2. \n\nI also noticed some incorrect numbers. Following Qwen2.5 technical report (Table 7), the reported numbers in your paper seem to be lower (i.e., official report's normal evaluation has higher numbers than your proposed method):\n\n| Benchmark | Official Report | Your Reporting (Greedy) |\n|-----------|----------------:|---------------:|\n| MBPP      |            82.0 |          72.00 |\n| GPQA      |            45.5 |          39.51 |\n\nThis might be due to difference in sampling by the Qwen team. Thus, I would also recommend adding evaluation for each model in its recommend configuration (as suggested by their company). Please fix this. \n\nW3: Benchmark sampling choices and statistical rigor: For MMLU, only 10% of the test set is evaluated; for MATH a 500-sample subset is used. There are no confidence intervals or statistical tests across runs/seeds. Please report mean +- std. err. \n\nW4. Missing order-sensitivity: Aggregation may be sensitive to ordering of candidates. Was this factor studied? How sensitive is GSA to candidate ordering? I would request the authors to add more empirical analysis on candidate order like test best-candidate dropped vs. worst-candidate dropped or what fraction of the final response is composed from the each candidate (in their order). \n\nW5: For Alpaca eval, why is GPT-4 used as judge for evaluating GPT-4o-mini (which came out long after GPT-4). GPT-4 is old now (by today's LLM standards) and may even be worse than Qwen2.5-14B on some tasks. At least GPT-4o should be used or similarly capable open-source model like DeepSeek-v3.1 if proprietary cost is an issue. \n\n### Presentation:\n\n1. In L228-230, what is wolves, cougars, etc.?
