Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, transferring images to their approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image areas (e.g., plain sky). Through a series of analyses, we trace this issue to the first inversion steps, which fail to provide accurate and diverse noise. Consequently, the DDIM inversion space is notably less manipulative than the original noise. We show that prior inversion methods do not fully resolve this issue, but our simple fix, where we replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, successfully decorrelates latent encodings and enables higher quality editions and interpolations.", "tldr": "We show that DDIM inverted latents exhibit input image patterns, and provide simple fix", "keywords": ["diffusion models", "ddim inversion", "image interpolation"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ed9e2a95064564ac542aa070cc5b3b9b3471981a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/cfc8e22dd047611c3c07e8cfb8abeede08993534.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper analyzes DDIM inversion, specifically the non-gaussian properties of the final latent $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_T$ which has been mentioned multiple times in previous literature but not explored throughoutly like the authors have done in this work.

In order to prove why the proposed simple fix works should be first followed why the early inversion steps are theoretically the root cause.

(Answer: Because it happens in the first few steps)\n\nIn my opinion, the first two sections primarily reiterate observations and facts that are already well known to the community, albeit supplemented with additional visualizations and plots that support these claims. The authors themselves mention prior work studying the same problem at the beginning of Sec 3.1. The third section has the potential to be more interesting; however, its conclusion appears to be based mainly on empirical observation, and the authors do not provide a convincing explanation for the observed phenomenon, which would have been the most compelling aspect of the analysis. Lastly, the proposed fix, while somewhat effective, appears ad hoc and lacks a principled justification."}, "questions": {"value": "**DDIM Inversion Formula**\n\nThere appear to be different formulations of DDIM inversion in the literature. On one hand, Null-text inversion (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09794, Sec 3.1) and Dhariwal & Nichol (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09672) both call the denoising network on $x_{t-1}$ with timestep $t-1$, i.e. $\\epsilon^{(t)}\\_{\\theta}(x_{t}, c) \\simeq \\epsilon^{(t-1)}\\_{\\theta}(x_{t-1}, c)$. On the other hand, the authors in Eq. (3) seem to follow ReNoise (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14602, Sec 3.1) and keep the same timestep but change $x_{t}$ to $x_{t-1}$, i.e. $\\epsilon^{(t)}\\_{\\theta}(x_{t}, c) \\simeq \\epsilon^{(t)}\\_{\\theta}(x_{t-1}, c)$. In my understanding, the former formulation (calling the network on $x_{t-1}$ with its corresponding timestep $t-1$) represents the correct reverse ODE. This leads to the following questions:\n\n- Which version exactly did the authors implement in the experiments?\n- Have the authors noted any difference in the conclusions using the other version? \n- In particular, this choice changes the definition of the approximation error $\\xi(t)$ in Eq. (4). How does that change the results and conclusions?\n\nNote that in Appendix E, the authors use the latter formulation (non-matching timesteps) in the text, but the illustration in Fig. 8 seems to show the former formulation (matching timesteps). I believe this could be further clarified to improve the reproducibility of the experiments.\n\n**Image Editing and Reconstruction**\n\nOverall, I am not very convinced by the validation provided to measure the quality of image editing applications.\n\n- In Fig. 7, the explanation suggests the method is superior to standard DDIM inversion because it performs similarly to original Gaussian noise in both image diversity and prompt alignment. However, this comparison may not fully validate the editing task. While using real Gaussian noise $x_T$ with a target prompt will expectedly yield a high-quality, prompt-aligned image, it offers no guarantee of fidelity to the source image. Successful editing requires preserving significant portions of the original image while making targeted modifications. Therefore, performance closer to real Gaussian noise does not, by itself, validate superior editing performance.\n- A similar remark applies to Table 7 and Sec 4.3: CLIP text alignment alone is insufficient to assess image editing quality, as it does not measure the preservation of unedited regions. I would suggest considering metrics specifically designed for editing, such as **directional CLIP similarity** (StyleGAN-NADA, https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00946) or **AugCLIP** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11374), for a more comprehensive assessment.\n- Image editing performance often differs between generated and real images. I may have missed it, but are there any editing results with real images? If not, adding a few such examples would significantly strengthen the assessment of the method's practical utility.\n\n**Result with Large Latent Diffusion Models**\n\nLarge text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion are very common in the field, yet not fully assessed in this paper.\n\n- Considering the widespread use of Stable Diffusion models (SD2.1, SDXL, SD3), I was wondering why the authors did not include analysis with these models in the first part of the paper (beyond the results with SDXL in Sec. 4.3)?\n- Did the authors observe any correlation between the quality of standard DDIM inversion and the size of the model's training dataset? One might expect that models trained on larger datasets are less prone to inversion errors, and that the proposed fix would have less impact in these cases. I would be happy to get the authors' perspective on this.\n\n**Other questions and notes**\n\n- What model was used in Figure 1, Figure 6 and Figure 13?\n- The CFG scale can significantly impact experiment outcomes. The authors mention in Appendix G that they use a CFG scale $w=1$ for conditional diffusion models. Does this apply only to the image editing part, or to all experiments in the first part of the paper as well?\n- In Sec 4.3, I believe it could be more explicitly mentioned that the results in Table 7 are based on a comparison with an equal number of function evaluations (NFEs).\n- Appendix H shows interesting differences in the shape of the most probable triangles between models. Do the authors have an explanation for what might be causing these vastly different triangle shapes?\n- In Fig. 3, perhaps a different color scheme or the addition of level set lines could help better visualize the intended point. If I understand correctly, the bottom-left corner (distance between $x_T$ and $x_T$) should be 0. However, its color appears similar to the top-right corner, which would suggest that the image latent $x_0$ is almost the same as the inverted noise $\\hat{x}_T$. This seems counter-intuitive, and a clarification would be helpful.\n- Appendix N shows an interesting experiment using the $L_2$ distance. In general, it is understood that the noise is not necessarily close to the image in an $L_2$ sense, but rather that they are correlated. Out of simple curiosity, does the mapping become feasible if a Pearson correlation metric is used instead?\n- Lastly, I noted a minor citation issue: the reference to Samuel et al. appears to be missing the year, showing up as \"Samuel et al.\" in the text instead of \"Samuel et al. 2025\".\n\nI thank the authors for their time and look forward to any clarifications they can provide."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "IQEYgTovib", "forum": "8PaDdLuVKN", "replyto": "8PaDdLuVKN", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1797/Reviewer_Mq2S"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1797/Reviewer_Mq2S"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1797/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761596883494, "cdate": 1761596883494, "tmdate": 1762915893707, "mdate": 1762915893707, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors examine DDIM inversion in diffusion models, a process of recovering an approximate noise map that reconstructs a user provided image.
