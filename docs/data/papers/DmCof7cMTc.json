Traditional wireless channel modeling approaches face critical limitations: probabilistic models lack spatial granularity for complex multi-antenna systems, while deterministic methods like ray tracing require precise environmental priors that are often unavailable or inaccurate in practice. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by introducing LLM-guided initialization and optimization of 3D Gaussian primitives that dynamically encode both signal propagation characteristics and material-dependent attenuation effects. The framework leverages LLMs' semantic understanding capabilities to analyze environmental scenes and predict material properties, enabling intelligent placement and parameterization of virtual transmitters represented as 3D Gaussians. These primitives are processed through a differentiable rendering pipeline that reconstructs wireless radiation fields with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. The integration of LLM guidance enables automatic adaptation to diverse environmental conditions without requiring extensive manual parameter tuning or detailed material property databases. Through comprehensive experimental validation on real-world datasets, GRF-LLM demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving a 3.82 dB improvement in downlink CSI prediction accuracy while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for AI-enhanced propagation modeling, with significant implications for 6G network optimization and digital twin applications in wireless communications.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["wireless radiation field reconstruction", "3D Gaussian splatting", "channel prediction"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c88a57893a111f8f69487bd6f59b7755566bd5c9.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "GRF-LLM is a novel framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable environment-aware wireless channel modeling.

The reliance on multi-view images reintroduces the need for detailed environmental priors, constraining deployment in settings where such imagery is unavailable or expensive to obtain. Processing large image sets through the LLM also increases training complexity and runtime, which could hinder scalability in large-scale 6G simulations. Moreover, without domain-specific fine-tuning, LLMs may misestimate material properties such as permittivity and conductivity, failing to capture frequency-dependent effects in multipath conditions. This raises concerns about whether general vision-language models are suitable for physics-grounded RF tasks and suggests the need for hybrid validation or RF-aware priors.\n\n\n- While the proposed GRF-LLM framework reports encouraging empirical results, its novelty appears limited. The system architecture closely mirrors the baseline WRF-GS pipeline (Wen et al., 2024), with Figure 2 in this paper resembling WRF-GS’s Figure 4 almost exactly. Both depict the same data flow, inputs of 3D points and transmitter position entering a scenario-representation module, followed by Mercator projection, differentiable tile rasterization, and electromagnetic splatting that yield 90 × 360 spatial spectra. The only addition in GRF-LLM is an LLM-guided initialization step, suggesting an incremental extension. \n\n- Moreover, WRF-GS already reports that initialization of 3D Gaussian points, random or otherwise, has negligible effect due to adaptive density control, further questioning the significance of the proposed enhancement. \n\n- The apparent visual and structural similarity between the two figures also requires clarification to ensure appropriate citation, permission, and originality consistent with ICLR research integrity standards."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the points raised in the Weaknesses section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ZuQAYm6h8k", "forum": "DmCof7cMTc", "replyto": "DmCof7cMTc", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10111/Reviewer_TkZU"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10111/Reviewer_TkZU"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10111/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761774302778, "cdate": 1761774302778, "tmdate": 1762921490951, "mdate": 1762921490951, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel framework (called GRF-LLM) for wireless channel / radiation-field modeling that combines large language models (LLMs) for scene / material understanding with 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) style neural scene representation.

It appears that multi-view images are given, so is there any 3d geometry reconstruction?\n    - Datasets: The paper mentions minimally describes (L367-369) the two datasets.

LLM for estimating parameters**\n- While it is an interesting idea to leverage a pretrained language/vision model to retrieve RF material information, it is unclear the role of this contribution.\n- Fundamentally, this is an ill-posed problem: estimating the parameters largely depends on high quality images (no information on this), but yet it is difficult to determine these parameters (e.g., occlusions, estimating thickness of surfaces)\n- Even ignoring the previous point, there is no discussion on whether the LLM provides any meaningful material information, since there is no evaluation here.\n- There is an \"LLM\" loss term, but is the LLM being trained? Or is the estimated material parameters simply used as the ground-truth?\n\n**3. Formulation and ad-hoc choices**\n- Many choices of the approach appear ad-hoc and also not justified. To name a few:\n- Adaptive property correction (L201): Why is cubic scaling applied to once group, and square to another?\n- NNs to process gaussians: Why are NNs needed to \"process\" the gaussians? The gaussians are multi-dimensional vectors and should already be trainable.\n- Attentuation $\\delta$: How is attentuation captured when a signal passes through multiple gaussians?
