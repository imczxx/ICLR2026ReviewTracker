The core difficulty lies in Dual Dynamics: the constant interplay between game content updates and the shifting focus of the player community. Furthermore, the necessity of automating such a benchmark introduces a critical requirement for player-centric authenticity to ensure generated questions are realistic. To address this integrated challenge, we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain, offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic conditions.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Retrieval Augmented Generation", "Dynamic Benchmarking", "Dual Dynamics", "User Interest Drift", "Gaming", "Player-Centric Evaluation"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/83eb279e10ecb1d66e355b1754b09b755c3df9e7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/39f58be0c204f73873180cf714d096be01f34775.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focus on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) problem in dynamic domains and build a RAG benchmark in the domain of online gaming.
