In Inter-Task Preservation, we protect past knowledge with Tail-Aware Semantic Shrinkage, which corrects biased statistics using semantically related head classes, and Adaptive Margin Hinge Loss, which maintains robust boundaries between old and new classes. Finally, in Knowledge Consolidation, Mode-Connectivity Spherical Merge integrates task-specific adapters along a low-loss path, ensuring stable unification into a single model. By explicitly linking Intra-Task Stabilization, Inter-Task Preservation, and Knowledge Consolidation, our framework delivers a coherent solution for long-tailed CIL.

The paper does not clearly justify the necessity of studying long-tailed class-incremental learning (CIL) in the context of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP.

In fact, the class boundaries appear reasonably well separated, which contradicts the claim that they “appear diffuse and weakly separated.” The numerical differences reported in the accompanying table are also small, and the paper does not explain how these numbers are computed. Without this clarification, the visual and quantitative evidence does not convincingly support the authors’ argument.\n\n4. Most of the proposed techniques rely on the assumption that data features follow a Gaussian distribution. This is an idealized and often unrealistic assumption for real-world visual data. The paper lacks discussion, justification, or empirical verification of this assumption, which weakens the theoretical soundness of the approach.\n\n5. In Table 4, it is unclear why the “Last” metric is chosen as the main indicator for ablation studies. The authors should provide a stronger explanation for this choice. Moreover, the reported results show that the Two-Stage Hybrid Augmentation (TSS) brings only marginal improvements, which raises questions about its effectiveness and contribution.\n\n6.
