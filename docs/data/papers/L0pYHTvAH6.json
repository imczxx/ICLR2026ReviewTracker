However, their deployment in real-world applications remains constrained. Even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-5, frequently produce invalid action plans that violate physical constraints, such as directing a robot to an unreachable location or causing collisions between robots. This issue primarily arises from a lack of awareness of these physical constraints during the reasoning process. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to incentivize knowledge of physical constraints into LLMs to induce constraints-aware reasoning during plan generation. In this approach, only valid action plans that successfully complete a control task receive positive rewards. We applied our method to two small-scale LLMs: a non-reasoning Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and a reasoning Qwen3-4B. The experiment results demonstrate that constraint-aware small LLMs largely outperform large-scale models without constraint knowledge training, grounded on both the BoxNet task and a newly developed BoxNet3D environment built using MuJoCo, which involves LLM planning for up to 25 robots. This work highlights the effectiveness of grounding even small LLMs with physical constraints to enable scalable and efficient multi-robot control in complex, physically constrained environments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["LLM", "Robotic Control", "Large Language Model", "Task Planning"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f1c11084b1b5165e5dc96baa3ce2978a75d3b643.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f73338460f492dc6693eacd6a2ca4785f6a891d2.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces two BoxNet environments to evaluate LLM-based multi-robot control.

However, the proposed approach does not seem to offer a substantial conceptual contribution, as the authors retrained a slightly different formulation of a well-known RL objective function (GRPO).\n\n- Regarding the claimed contribution, describing the physical constraints as \"realistic\" seems to be an overstatement, given the simplicity of the collision and reachability checking mechanisms employed. Furthermore, the environments appear to be designed in a way that minimizes potential robot-robot collisions, which subsequently undermines the claims about reachability.\n\n- The claimed generalization ability of this method appears to be limited. Section 4.2 describes generalization to unseen environments, but these unseen environments share the same underlying grid structure as the training environments. Consequently, the claim of generalisation slightly overstates the scope of what the proposed approach can truly handle.\n\n- The details concerning the robot’s action space, size, and reachability conditions, as well as the collision checking method, should ideally be explained in the main body of the paper rather than being relegated to prompts in the appendix.\n\n- The solution generation time should be considered and added as an important evaluation metric.\n\n- The study would be significantly improved by including a comparison of the proposed RL method with other relevant works in the literature.\n\n- Table 2 in the results section could be more self-contained and clearer.

This asymmetry muddies the “prompt fairness” story across settings and may partially credit RL for implicitly learning a rule that was not textually available to zero‑shot baselines in 2D. \n\n2.

Would a well broken‑down reasoning process or a proven multi‑agent system help in multi‑robot tasks?\n\n2. What exactly are the “physical constraints” incorporated into the reward? Could this be explicitly encoded into the prompts and tested with LLMs?\n\n3. Why Qwen2.5‑3B‑Instruct and Qwen3‑4B?
