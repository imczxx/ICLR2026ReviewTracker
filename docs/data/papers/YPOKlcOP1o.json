In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based generative modeling framework tailored for generative image compression. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that indirectly exploit diffusion modeling, we reinterpret the compression process itself as a forward diffusion path governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A reverse neural network is trained to reconstruct images by reversing the compression process directly, without requiring Gaussian noise initialization. This approach achieves smooth rate adjustment and photo-realistic reconstructions with only a minimal number of sampling steps. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generative image compression approaches across a range of metrics, including perceptual distortion, statistical fidelity, and no-reference quality assessments.", "tldr": "A novel diffusion modeling framework tailored for generative image compression.", "keywords": ["Generative Image Compression", "Diffusion Modeling"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5526983bbdcaba23d7499c38f5ea2063f1e90fdd.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes to consider compression as the forward path of a diffusion process, where rate-variable quantization is modeled as the corruption model instead of additive Gaussian noise.

Please temper the claims and discuss the rate-perception-distortion (RPD) tradeoff explicitly. In particular, to claim that your method is better than others, it needs to improve the performance in both distortion and perceptual quality simultaneously, for a given bitrate. This is the meaning of achieving better performance: we want to get closer and closer to the rate-perception-distortion bound.\n3.

I believe that [1], [2], and [3] are basically already doing this. There are probably more papers too, those are just the first 3 I encountered. I find it concerning that no such works are cited. Can you please situate your research relative to these related works, and clearly state what your novel contribution is?\n\n2. Two details of the proposed method that I suspect may not be theoretically sound:\n\na) In Section 2.2, the authors assert that \"The quantization operation can be regarded as\nadding a uniform noise in the range of [-0.5, 0.5]\". I am not so sure you can get away with this substitution? See [2], which finds that applying a diffusion model starting from discretized data yields qualitatively different results than starting from noisy data. How do the results from [2] not contradict your claim?\n\nb) I suspect that the stochastic sampling variant of the authors' reverse process actually takes the denoising paths out of the training distribution: the training distribution comes from the forward process, and IIUC is essentually the data distribution + uniform noise. But if, during stochastic sampling, you're adding multiple independent samples of noise, that noise will start to look gaussian, which isn't what you trained on. Again, I would anticipate that this should introduce artifacts in the reconstructions, similar to those discussed in [2]. \n\n[1] [Lossy image compression with foundation diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08580)\n\n[2] [Bridging the Gap between Gaussian Diffusion Models and Universal\nQuantization for Image Compression](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/app/uploads/2025/06/Bridging-the-Gap-between-Diffusion-Models-and-Universal-Quantization-for-Image-Compression-Paper.pdf)\n\n[3] [RDEIC: Accelerating Diffusion-Based Extreme\nImage Compression with Relay Residual Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02640)"}, "questions": {"value": "Please respond my concerns from the weaknesses section.
