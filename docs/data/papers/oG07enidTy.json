However, most existing vision–omics models are built on limited and homogeneous datasets, rendering them task-specific and with poor generalizability. Recent multimodal foundation models attempt to bridge histology and gene expression via contrastive objectives; however, they fail to effectively model spot-specific molecular context and overlook spatial dependencies by treating each spot–patch pair in isolation. To bridge these gaps, we present HiBio-ST, a novel hierarchical multimodal foundation model guided by biological prior anchors for ST analysis. HiBio-ST employs a progressive multi-level alignment pretraining pipeline to harmonize visual context with molecular identities. A TF–IDF reweighting strategy is first applied to highlight spatially informative “keyword” genes within ST profiles, reducing the dominance of ubiquitous housekeeping signals. Curated pathway anchors are then incorporated to inject global biological knowledge into the representation space. Moreover, hierarchical region-aware clustering united contiguous meso-scale regions into coherent structural patterns, allowing the model to capture higher-order spatial organization. We evaluated HiBio-ST on four downstream tasks across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that HiBio-ST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its broad applicability in spatial transcriptomics modeling.", "tldr": "HiBio-ST is a  novel hierarchical multimodal foundation model with biological prior anchors for spatial transcriptomics modeling", "keywords": ["Spatial Transcriptomics", "Foundation Model", "Computational Pathology"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b0207ce4c30c8e87734816ea7c3e9ffe9edefd73.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose HiBio-ST, a hierarchical multimodal foundation model for ST that: (1) reweights genes via TF-IDF to emphasize “keyword” genes and use ranked gene names as gene sentence , (2) provides a way to construct pathway priors using curated gene-set “anchors,” and (3) adds region-aware clustering to encourage meso-scale spatial coherence.

In particular, the spatial clustering results on the DLPFC dataset are not strong, the predicted domains fail to recover clear laminar structures and appear inconsistent with the known cortical anatomy.

The manuscript would benefit from additional sanity checks showing that the embeddings preserve biologically meaningful relationships (e.g., spots from the same cortical layer or with similar cell-type compositions clustering together).\n\nFurthermore, while the benchmarking includes comparisons with other foundation models, it omits direct comparisons with task-specific spatial analysis tools such as GraphST or STAGATE, which are designed for spatial domain detection.

Could the authors report the results of spatial clustering without the spatial label-smoothing mechanism, as HiBio-ST theoretically already captures spatial information and should outperform other methods without redundant spatial regularization?\n7. It is unclear whether the authors considered simpler baselines or alignment strategies, such as using a single-scale InfoNCE loss without hierarchical extensions. The proposed framework appears to stack multiple existing components (TF-IDF weighting, pathway priors, spatial clustering, and multi-level contrastive learning) without a clear unifying principle or demonstrated necessity. The ablation studies only show marginal differences and do not isolate whether the hierarchical contrastive design truly contributes beyond increased model complexity.
