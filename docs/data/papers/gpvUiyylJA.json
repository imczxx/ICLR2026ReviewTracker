In the paper, we address the reaction classification task by introducing the Directed Line Graph (DLG) transformation for directed hypergraphs. Building on this representation, we propose the Directed Line Graph Network (DLGNet), the first spectral-based Graph Neural Network (GNN) designed to perform convolutions directly on the DLG. At the core of DLGNet lies a novel complex-valued Hermitian matrix, the Directed Line Graph Laplacian ($\\mathbb{\\vec{L}}_N$), which effectively encodes directional interactions within the hypergraph’s structure through the DLG representation. Experimental results on three real-world chemical reaction datasets demonstrate that DLGNet consistently outperforms all baseline competitors.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Directed Line Graph", "Directed Line Graph Laplacian", "Hyperedge Classification", "Chemical reaction classification"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/19d6e48e2909b9e441522747f08a6aba452c0e4f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a graph neural network (GNN) for classifying chemical reactions.

The experiments do not provide evidence that a (hyper)graph-based representation is inherently superior to a simpler, non-structural approach for this specific task. Modern architectures like transformers have shown great success on set-based data. The paper can be strengthened by including a comparison against a strong baseline that does not rely on an explicit graph structure. For example, a Deep Sets model or a Transformer encoder that treats the reactants and products as two distinct sets of molecular fingerprints. Note that the AllDeepSets and AllSetTransformer models use message-passing-style aggregators typical of graph neural networks [1].\n2. All tasks are reaction-type classification. There’s no evidence the operator helps on other directed-hypergraph problems on non-chemical domains, e.g., citation co-author network with authors as nodes and citation links between author collaborations (papers) as directed hyperedges.\n\n[1] You are AllSet: A Multiset Function Framework for Hypergraph Neural Networks, ICLR 2022."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

In addition to the standardised feature-transfer operator, can baselines be reported with their strongest native hyperedge readouts (e.g., attention-based or learned set pooling) to ensure fair comparison?\n4. Beyond reaction-type classification, can the operator be demonstrated on an additional directed-hypergraph task (e.g., hyperedge link prediction) and/or a non-chemical dataset to establish broader applicability?\n5. The aggregation of molecular features into reaction features is a critical step. The current method uses a weighted summation. Could the authors elaborate on the rationale for choosing summation over other aggregation functions like mean or max pooling? A brief justification or an ablation study on this design choice would be insightful.\n6.

I think an important contribution of this paper is using the Laplacian matrix as prior knowledge for the adjacency matrix in GCN. One thing I'm curious about is whether the Laplacian matrix, after being extracted, can be transformed into the adjacency matrix of the original reaction graph, or integrated as a signal into the original adjacency matrix. For example, $ B * L * B^{-1}$.

The paper only compares against hypergraph-based approaches, many of which show very low F1 scores, making the proposed method appear more effective than it might actually be. Reaction classification can also be addressed using traditional chemoinformatics methods and various GNN- or Transformer-based approaches. At the very least, the method should be compared against typical baselines such as a classic ReactionFP [1] and something like [2]-[4]. Without such comparisons, it's hard to assess the real value of the proposed approach.\n- There are multiple ways to convert a hypergraph into a graph, not just the line graph approach, but also methods like clique expansion. As shown in cited Zhou et al., NIPS 2006 “Learning with Hypergraphs,” it's also possible to define an adjacency matrix directly from the hypergraph's incidence matrix. This would also be consistent with hypergraph Laplacian theory, and it’s not entirely clear how or why the proposed method is better compared to any potential alternatives.\n- I think it would be helpful to include a more concrete explanation of how the hypergraph-based methods being compared differ from the proposed approach. Rather than reducing a hypergraph to a regular graph, it's possible to define message passing directly on the hypergraph and perform prediction by applying global pooling over each hyperedge. In fact, this may allow for more flexible network designs (for example, by incorporating graph transformer layers). However, the paper lacks a clear discussion of how the proposed method compares to or improves upon such approaches, and what specific advantages it offers.\n\n[1] ReactionFP https://doi.org/10.1021/ci5006614  \n[2] Mapping the space of chemical reactions using attention-based neural networks.

However, the manuscript frames the work around the reaction classification task and evaluates it solely in that context. If that’s the case, why were the comparisons limited to hypergraph-based methods? Why not include standard approaches commonly used for reaction classification?\n- Assuming the transformation into a line graph is a key component, the ternary {1, –i, 0} incidence matrix introduced in Eq. (7) is a very interesting idea. Is his incidence matrix itself the novel contribution of the paper? Or is this idea already exists, and the novelty lies instead in how it’s used to analyze the relationship between hypergraphs and directed line graphs, or in the design of the corresponding Laplacian and spectral GNN? Clarifying this would help position the paper’s contribution more clearly.\n- In the end, it's not entirely clear why reducing a hypergraph to a line graph and applying specialized spectral message passing would offer practical advantages over directly designing message passing on the hypergraph itself. Could you provide more clarification on the pros and cons of this line graph reduction approach, especially in comparison to more typical hypergraph-based methods used in your comparisons?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "4b7JJnWqg2", "forum": "gpvUiyylJA", "replyto": "gpvUiyylJA", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5148/Reviewer_yNwD"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5148/Reviewer_yNwD"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5148/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761928751894, "cdate": 1761928751894, "tmdate": 1762917908012, "mdate": 1762917908012, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
