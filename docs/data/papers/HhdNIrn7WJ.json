This recovers and strengthens existing results, while also addressing a gap in the prior analysis for $\\beta=2$.

I find the content of the paper really interesting, but it could be arranged better; for example, by finding some space for the related works and conclusions, and by retaining only the essential material in the main text. In particular, I think that Algorithm 4 in Appendix C is important enough to be at least mentioned or summarized in the main part, since it plays a role in the exploitation phase.\n\n2. It would be helpful to include an explicit remark in the main text explaining how the boundedness assumption on the covariance of the context can be avoided. If I am not mistaken, the key point lies in Equation (12), which essentially shows that the ``transformed'' $U$-based covariance matrix is controlled (specifically, equal to $[\\beta] + 1$).\n\n3. I am not sure about Footnote 3. It would be clearer if you specified which sub-results hold under the adversarial case and which do not. For instance, Theorem 9 (and subsequent results) hold under the stochastic setting (i.i.d. and stationary covariates). The sentence ``we keep our discussion in the stochastic setting mainly for clarity'' makes the scope somewhat confusing.\n\n4. The usage of the term \"uniformly\" is somewhat confusing. For example, in Proposition 9, the uniformity over all $x$ appears to relate to $\\sup_x \\|\\hat{g} - g\\|$, but the upper bound itself depends on $x$. This made me think that you might instead be referring to the intersection of events over all $x$ as in (3). If that is the case, perhaps the phrase \"simultaneously for all $x$'' would be less ambiguous. The same clarification applies to other results, such as Lemma 16.\n\n5. In Proposition 8, do you mean that the sequence $\\{\\xi_i\\}$ (instead of $y_i$) is mutually independent given $x$?\n\n6.
