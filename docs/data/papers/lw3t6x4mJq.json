Classical sparse regression methods (e.g., SINDy-MPC) and physics-informed neural networks achieve good fits when oversampled, but their accuracy degrades sharply when data is available only at the Nyquist rate. We provide an information-theoretic analysis showing that reconstruction error fundamentally decomposes into a data-fit component (linear in sampling frequency) and a model-estimation component (nonlinear in frequency), bounded by the Cramér–Rao lower bound. This motivates MRIDHA, a model recovery framework that constrains the equation search space to physically consistent structures by embedding continuous-time latent variable nodes that enforce stability and time-constant properties. Across nine simulated and three real-world benchmarks—including automated insulin delivery, EEG reconstruction, and a 16D quadcopter—MRIDHA significantly outperforms SINDy-MPC and PINN-SR at Nyquist-rate sampling, demonstrating improved sample efficiency, robustness to input uncertainty, and scalability.

The paper attempts to cover too many aspects (information theory, inverse ODE solution, latent dynamics modeling, etc.) within a single manuscript. The main theme of sample-efficient model recovery gets diluted among numerous details.\n\n2. Although the paper includes real-world examples such as biomedical and EEG data, the experiments mainly report aggregate error metrics (RMSE, MARD, etc.) without demonstrating whether the recovered models capture domain-specific, physically or physiologically meaningful behaviors. For example, in the EEG setting, an important question is whether the identified model can accurately predict key spectral or temporal features, such as the timing of gamma-band peaks or cross-frequency phase–amplitude coupling patterns, which are critical problems in related tasks such as deep brain stimulation.\nSimply showing that MRIDHA achieves lower RMSE than competing methods does not necessarily imply that the learned dynamics are valid or useful for neuroscientific interpretation. In fact, based on the reported metrics, it appears that none of the tested methods—including MRIDHA—achieve the level of predictive fidelity required for practical EEG or neural modeling tasks.\n\n3. The baselines are primarily SINDy-MPC and PINN+SR.

It would be better to use \\text{RMSE} if it is in a math environment. \n\n2. The same problem might happen for the presentation of math equations, which can be important as a theory heavy paper.

(2), when we have an expectation - what is random here? I assume the X(t_i) is random but the fisher information, randomness, expectations are all not making any sense if the random variables are not defined here.

Whatever behind can be meaningless without setting the notations correctly (for example what is sigma here)? \n\n4. The reviewer suggests to use $\\Theta_{\\text{est}}$ for example to make the notation better. \n \n5. Only a question: would authors believe that the ODE solver is really important here to improve the sample complexity? If so, more paragraphs should be centered around here, and show the audience that this is a critical point - and what benefits could we have from here (having an extensive study). \n\n6. Experimentally, would the authors come up with a plan to better modularize the experiments? It would be better if things can be compact within one or two figures, or just within one table. \n\n7.

The work is a blend of theory and engineering: it sets an information-theoretic limit on what’s achievable with limited data and then designs a neural architecture that explicitly respects those limits. On the theory side, the authors analyze the Cramér–Rao lower bound for model recovery and show that reconstruction error fundamentally splits into two terms: data fitting and model estimation, and clarify which term is the main source of issue in different regimes. On practical side, They introduce MRIDHA, which builds physical consistency directly into the search space for candidate equations, more specifically, instead of unconstrained regression, MRIDHA embeds continuous-time latent variable (CTLV) nodes that enforce stability with input-dependent time constraints.

Adding some empirical results on this point or sharing more insights on the gap would greatly strengthen the soundness of the work.\n\nAnother point I want to touch on is that, while the paper is technically rigorous, the underlying research question, i.e. recovering deterministic systems from limited samples may have diminishing practical importance in the current trajectory of data-driven modeling. In most real-world applications, especially in control, biomedicine, and robotics, approximate predictive fidelity or stability guarantees matter more than explicit symbolic recovery of dynamics. From experience in model discovery, once one leaves laboratory-scale systems, the true governing equations are often neither identifiable nor stationary due to unmodeled inputs, sensor drift, and environmental variability. Thus, the pursuit of sample-efficient exact recovery may be intellectually elegant but of limited operational relevance. A more consequential direction might be to extend the theoretical framework toward uncertainty quantification, for example, connecting the Cramér–Rao bounds to Bayesian confidence in recovered dynamics, or to explore sensor placement optimization under the same information-theoretic lens, asking how to actively allocate sampling budget for maximum information gain. Another valuable step could be to test MRIDHA in control-in-the-loop or adaptive filtering scenarios, where its structural priors might translate into measurable improvements in safety or robustness rather than only lower reconstruction error."}, "questions": {"value": "It's unclear to me whether MRIDHA’s improvements truly stem from the imposed physical priors (like stability and input-dependent time constants) or from the added representational power and implicit regularization of the LTC-NN architecture?
