The authors' entire argument rests on a flawed premise. They motivate the work by stating that SHOPCA is NP-hard, but then claim their method transforms this into \"tractable\" geometric subproblems, which are then explicitly identified as Binary Linear Programs (BLPs).\n\nThis is a contradiction. Binary Linear Programming is a classic, well-known NP-hard optimization problem. One cannot claim to have found a \"tractable\" solution by reformulating one NP-hard problem into another. This ambiguity is present throughout the paper.\n\n2. The claimed complexity of O(P(k^3 + Jk^2)) is highly suspect and appears to be incomplete. This analysis seems to only account for the tensor preparation and solution construction phases. It conspicuously omits the computational cost of solving the N mode-wise BLPs.\n\nThe authors must provide a complete complexity analysis that includes the cost of the BLP solver or the approximation algorithm used. The cost of solving a BLP is, in the worst case, exponential. The claim of linear scaling with tensor size P is unproven and likely incorrect until the cost of the \"geometric solver\" stage is fully incorporated.\n\n3. The paper's novelty is repeatedly framed as a \"geometric perspective\". However, this term is never formally defined. The text and Figure 1 immediately pivot from \"geometric solver\" to \"binary linear program.\"\n\nWhat makes this formulation \"geometric\"? Does the method involve convex hulls, projections, or other specific geometric operations that are being abstracted away? Or is \"geometric\" simply a non-standard descriptor for the BLP reformulation? This ambiguity obscures the core technical contribution and must be clarified.\n\n4. The paper's raison d'être is the computational and memory efficiency gained by avoiding covariance matrices. However, the summary of experimental results focuses almost exclusively on accuracy and robustness (support recovery, classification).\n\nThe experimental section must include direct, quantitative comparisons of wall-clock runtime and peak memory usage against the very baselines the paper critiques (e.g., Allen 2012, Lai et al. 2014, etc.). These comparisons must be conducted in the high-dimensional, unbalanced settings where the method claims to have \"notable advantages\". Without this data, the paper's primary claims of efficiency are entirely unsubstantiated."}, "questions": {"value": "The paper addresses an important and well-motivated problem. However, the manuscript in its current form is not suitable for publication.
