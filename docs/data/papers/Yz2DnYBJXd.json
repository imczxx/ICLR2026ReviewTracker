However, most existing VLAs operate under a Markov assumption, limiting their ability to handle temporally extended tasks and learn from feedback. To address these limitations, we propose MVP, a non-Markovian VLA model that leverages episodic memory composed of historical actions and visual observations. To mitigate the computational cost of storing high-dimensional histories, we introduce a compact memory representation inspired by video understanding techniques. Additionally, to prevent the model from disregarding historical inputs during training, we design a novel feedback learning strategy based on SO(3) trajectory perturbation. This approach encourages the model to associate actions with their environmental consequences through observation-action-observation sequences. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MVP outperforms existing models, particularly on tasks that require temporal reasoning and history-dependent decision-making. Our findings highlight the importance of memory and feedback in advancing the capabilities of general-purpose robotic manipulation systems.", "tldr": "A memory-enhanced Vision-Language-Action model", "keywords": ["Robotic Manipulation", "Vision-Language-Action Models", "Memory"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6d853e2bd5580bb25edf078082b78a34a6e5176d.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/be0e32415ccceb396a1bcdf03f6a441257c46a4f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a non-Markovian Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that incorporates past observations and actions as auxiliary information, along with an augmentation method to enhance robustness."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The paper states that “while a Markovian formulation suffices for simple, short-horizon tasks, it fundamentally restricts the robot’s ability to reason about temporally extended goals or to learn from the consequences of previous actions.”\n However, this limitation can be addressed by incorporating several past frames to compensate for the lack of historical information — an approach that some prior VLA models have already adopted. Therefore, the proposed method seems to mainly extend the temporal window by including additional past observations, together with the Legend data augmentation technique to improve robustness, which makes the contribution appear somewhat incremental.\n\n2. In the introduction, the authors mention that “while memory is not strictly necessary for these benchmarks.” Could you clarify why memory is not required in the simulation benchmarks?\n\n3. I am also confused about the use of SO(3) perturbations. Why do you introduce a distortion in the action space? Wouldn’t large perturbations make it more difficult for the model to learn the correct action mapping?\n\n4. Finally, I am curious why setting the memory length to 8 yields the best performance.

The paper doesn't compare against other potential augmentation strategies (e.g., SE(3), temporal jittering, or other forms of trajectory perturbation). The ablation only shows z-axis vs xyz-axis rotation—this is too limited to validate the design choice. Also, applying the same rotation to the entire trajectory seems artificial; real-world disturbances are typically non-uniform.\n\n2. The authors acknowledge that most tasks in their training data (OXE) are Markovian, yet they claim to learn non-Markovian policies. How can a model learn meaningful temporal reasoning when 90%+ of training examples don't require it? The SO(3) augmentation feels like a patch rather than a principled solution to this data problem.\n\n3. The adaptive pooling approach is presented as inspired by \"video understanding techniques,\" but there's no comparison with actual video compression methods (e.g., the techniques from PLLaVA, Flash-VStream that they cite). Why is (2,2) pooling optimal? What information is lost? The inference speed comparison (Table 6) shows their method is slower than CogACT, undermining claims of efficiency.\n\n4. The paper fails to cite several highly relevant recent works on temporal modeling in VLAs, such as TraceVLA (Zheng et al., 2024) and UniVLA (Bu et al., 2025b). The comparison also lacks recent strong baselines like π0, raising questions about whether the improvements hold against state-of-the-art methods.\n\n5. The real-world evaluation consists of only a single task type (object swapping with 4 variants), which is insufficient to demonstrate generalization of the memory mechanism. The simulated experiments use SIMPLER, which is not considered state-of-the-art, and the baseline methods (RT-2-X, OpenVLA) are relatively outdated given the rapid progress in VLA community.\n\n6. Unclear necessity of the approach: The paper's core motivation relies on the claim that most VLA tasks require non-Markovian reasoning, yet their own results show only modest improvements (4-9%) on SIMPLER benchmarks that supposedly don't require memory. The proof in Section 3.2 merely restates the Markov property without providing compelling evidence that real manipulation tasks actually violate this assumption—the swapping task seems cherry-picked to favor their method."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "h9oMoqwi1B", "forum": "Yz2DnYBJXd", "replyto": "Yz2DnYBJXd", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11853/Reviewer_8KjT"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11853/Reviewer_8KjT"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11853/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761874863448, "cdate": 1761874863448, "tmdate": 1762922867152, "mdate": 1762922867152, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes MVP to overcome a fundamental weakness in current robotic manipulation models: they only consider the present state and cannot reason about temporal sequences.
