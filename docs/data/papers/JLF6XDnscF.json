Despite recent progress with deep learning, global atmospheric data remain uniquely challenging since weather dynamics evolve across heterogeneous spatial and temporal scales ranging from planetary circulations to localized phenomena. Capturing such cross-scale interactions within a unified framework remains an open problem.  To address this gap, we propose \\textbf{STORM},  a spatio-temporal model that disentangles atmospheric variations into multiple scales to uncover scale-specific dependencies. In addition, it enables coherent forecasting across multiple resolutions, maintaining consistent temporal evolution. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that STORM consistently delivers superior performance across both global and regional settings, as well as for short- and long-term forecasts.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["spatial-temporal forecasting"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/960f18facfcbfa2843feca16acefc6ba1087bcd4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "- The authors propose the STORM architecture for weather forecasting, designed to capture cross-scale interactions in multi-scale weather data.

The related work section is up to date and provides a solid understanding of the current state of the art. The intuition behind all three main modules is also well explained.\n- Section 5 presents comparisons with state-of-the-art baseline models from the literature on the ERA5 dataset across different scales. The authors provide both short-term and long-term forecasting results. Combined with the visualizations of predictions in the Appendix, the results appear convincing and satisfactory.\n- Section 5.4 clearly demonstrates the importance of using multi-scale information for forecasting, presenting both numerical results and visualizations at different scales. The motivation for setting the number of scales to three is also clearly justified.\n- Appendix B includes some theoretical analysis supporting the need for multi-scale modeling. However, it does not provide theory directly related to the proposed STORM architecture. Nonetheless, this section can still be considered a minor strength, as most recent baseline methods lack any theoretical component."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The ablation study in Section 5.3 seems unsatisfying and weak. The STORM architecture has three key modules, and the authors report results by removing each one on the short-term global forecasting task (comparable to Table 1). Results are shown only in a small bar plot (Figure 6), not in a table. For variables such as T2M, U10, and V10, even the “w/o S&M” configuration appears to outperform baseline methods in Table 1 (losing only to Triton). This implies the T module alone would beat most baselines on some variables, which is unconvincing and undermines the need for all three modules separately. Why not provide tabular results for the ablation? And why restrict it to short-term global forecasting only?\n- Furthermore, the results show the necessity of each module for T, M, and S, but they do not justify the specific architectural choices within each module. For example, we are given no evidence of how effective the Hierarchical Earth Embedder is at leveraging cross-scale information, we are simply asked to understand its value from the RMSE differences with and without it in Section 5.3. Appendix E at least reports some hyperparameters (M=3, D=256, N=3), but the specific design choices inside each module remain questionable: there is no ablation to support them, nor results under alternative hyperparameters. From Appendix E, it appears the default parameters were set intuitively and used across experiments, with only the training epochs adjusted via early stopping on validation data. Furthermore, the manuscript provides no analysis of the STORM architecture’s sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning."}, "questions": {"value": "- Please refer to the weaknesses section for detailed comments.

Unsubstantiated “parameter-efficient” claim\nThe paper repeatedly emphasizes that STORM is parameter-efficient, yet it provides no quantitative evidence such as parameter counts, FLOPs, or inference latency. Given that the architecture involves multiple scale-specific branches and cross-scale message passing, the model design resembles a multi-branch or MoE-style structure that would typically increase parameters rather than reduce them.\nWithout compute-matched comparisons (e.g., same parameter budgets as GraphCast or FuXi), it is impossible to determine whether the reported gains stem from genuine architectural advantages or simply larger capacity.\n\n2. Lack of quantitative analysis on multi-scale effects\nWhile the paper stresses the importance of multi-scale synergy, it never analyzes how performance scales with the number of branches or levels. There is no experiment showing whether adding more scales continues to improve performance, when it saturates, or whether a simple increase in parallel branches (without explicit scale coupling) yields similar gains. Thus, the claimed “cross-scale synergy” remains empirically unverified.\n\n3.
