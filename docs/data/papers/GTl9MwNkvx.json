We introduce Mode Connectivity Evolutionary Attack (MoCo-EA), which replaces traditional crossover with a novel Bézier crossover operator that optimizes perturbations along a continuous Bézier curve between parent perturbations. Our key insight is that adversarial examples lie on connected manifolds where intermediate points maintain, and often enhance, attack effectiveness. We demonstrate three findings: (1) Successful adversarial perturbations exhibit mode connectivity, forming continuous paths that preserve adversarial properties; (2) Intermediate points along optimized paths achieve higher transferability than endpoints, with improvements that scale with auxiliary image guidance; (3) Bézier crossover dramatically outperforms discrete genetic operations, achieving universal attack success across all perturbation norms while reducing convergence time and query requirements by orders of magnitude. By revealing the geometric structure of adversarial space and exploiting it through principled path optimization, MoCo-EA transforms evolutionary attacks from slow, unreliable processes into efficient, dependable methods.

While the paper does a good job of empirically validating this in the input perturbation space (as opposed to weight space), the underlying concept of mode connectivity and connected low-loss regions in neural network landscapes is a well-established area of research. The paper could more clearly position its specific contribution in this context.\n2.\tUnclear Practical Motivation and Positioning: The paper's motivation for focusing on evolutionary attacks in a white-box setting is somewhat underdeveloped. In a white-box scenario, where gradients are available, highly efficient and effective gradient-based attacks (e.g., PGD, AutoAttack) already exist and are the standard. The practical scenario where one would prefer a more query/computation-intensive EA, even an efficient one like MoCo-EA, is not explicitly justified. The paper would be strengthened by a clearer discussion of the niche for evolutionary attacks (e.g., for attacking non-differentiable systems or as a tool for analyzing loss landscapes) and how MoCo-EA positions itself within the broader ecosystem of adversarial attacks.\n3.\tComplexity vs. Benefit Trade-off: The Bézier crossover, while powerful, adds significant complexity to the EA framework, requiring inner-loop gradient-based optimization. The reviewer is left wondering if this complexity is justified given the existence of simpler, highly effective white-box methods. A discussion or experiment comparing MoCo-EA's performance and efficiency against state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks (not just traditional EAs) would help solidify its practical value."}, "questions": {"value": "See the weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "CDyvnJeK4f", "forum": "GTl9MwNkvx", "replyto": "GTl9MwNkvx", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10744/Reviewer_QkrL"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10744/Reviewer_QkrL"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10744/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761614702726, "cdate": 1761614702726, "tmdate": 1762921967259, "mdate": 1762921967259, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper considers optimisation of adversarial attacks using evolutionary algorithms.
