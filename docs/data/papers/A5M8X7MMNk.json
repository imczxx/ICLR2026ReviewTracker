Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great success in learning molecular representations from graphs via capturing local atomic interactions. However, they often struggle to capture global chemical motifs and complex long-range dependencies between molecules and substructures. In this paper, we present Fin-H2AN, a novel Fingerprint-based Heterogeneous Hyper- graph Attention Network to address the molecular property prediction problem. In this model, we propose a novel heterogeneous hypergraph structure by defining higher-order relations between molecules by leveraging diverse substructures derived from multiple molecular fingerprints. In this way, all molecules and their different fingerprints are embedded into a unified hypergraph. We employ a heterogeneous hypergraph attention model to learn meaningful molecular representations from the proposed heterogeneous hypergraph. It captures higher-order relations among molecules and integrates unique features of different molecular fingerprints into the molecular embeddings. These embeddings are then used for molecular property prediction. Extensive experiments on eight MoleculeNet benchmark datasets demonstrate that Fin-H2AN outperforms the state-of-the-art molecular property prediction models and show its effectiveness in capturing both local and global molecular information.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Molecular Property Prediction", "Heterogeneous Hypergraph", "Hypergraph Learning", "Drug discovery"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a5a899d98a412b49a83fe9b90be2bcfe8c946155.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Fin-H2AN, a fingerprint-based heterogeneous hypergraph attention network for molecular property prediction.

Unclear Motivation and Insufficient Problem Definition: The paper claims that existing GNN models fail to capture domain prior knowledge such as molecular fragments. However, many recent works already integrate molecular fragments or functional groups into graph-based or fingerprint-enhanced models. The novelty of this motivation is therefore limited and insufficiently articulated.\n2.  Methodological Innovation is Limited: Using molecular fingerprints as nodes may not overcome known limitations: different molecules can share the same fingerprint vectors, leading to indistinguishability and limiting the model’s expressive power. This fundamental drawback is not discussed or mitigated.\n3. Experimental Design is Relatively Simple: The evaluation benchmarks are standard but limited, and the baselines used are mostly classical models (e.g., GCN, GAT, D-MPNN, AttentiveFP). Recent and stronger baselines, such as CMPNN, GROVER, Uni-Mol are missing.\n4.

Insufficient evaluation datasets: To the best of my knowledge, MoleculeNet includes more datasets than those evaluated in this work. The authors should justify their selection of only five classification datasets. Moreover, the largest dataset used contains only around 7,000 molecules. Evaluation on larger-scale datasets (e.g., HIV, MUV) is necessary to validate the method's effectiveness and scalability.\n2. Data splitting strategy: To better assess the model's generalization capability, the authors should include evaluations under scaffold splitting, which is more challenging and reflective of real-world scenarios.\n3.

For example, wouldn’t simply concatenating the three fingerprints and applying a well-tuned XGBoost or LightGBM model achieve similar accuracy? In recent years, it's become widely recognized and discussed [1][2] that for small to medium-sized datasets or typical ADMET classification tasks, fingerprint-based methods combined with tree-based algorithms (like XGBoost, CatBoost, or Random Forest) often outperform more complex GNN models in a more reliable way.\n- Some have also pointed out that it's not the method itself that works, but rather the richness of the representation. So if you take multiple fingerprint representations like MACCS, ErG, PubChem, Avalon, and ECFP, and combine them with other molecular descriptor features and embeddings from various GNNs to create a comprehensive feature vector, then properly tune a standard machine learning model (like XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, or Random Forest), the predictive performance might be comparable to the method proposed in this study. Since the proposed method uses three different molecular representations, it's possible that the ensemble effect from this diversity in representation is contributing to its performance. In any case, there are still many open questions and room for discussion, and I don’t think benchmark evaluations at this scale alone are enough to clearly determine the strengths or weaknesses of the proposed method.\n- Semantically, each fingerprint is essentially checking for specific substructures. But in constructing the hypergraph, the meaning of each individual bit is ignored, so I don’t think this approach can really be considered as capturing the structure–property relationship of the molecule. It seems more like a mechanical or heuristic way of mixing fingerprint information together.\n\n[1] Could graph neural networks learn better molecular representation for drug discovery?
