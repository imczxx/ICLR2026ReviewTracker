The proposed method for optimizing compression guidelines is novel and clever. Using the task outcome (success vs. failure) as a supervisory signal in a gradient-free, natural language optimization loop is an original approach that is broadly applicable, even to closed-source API-based models.\n\n\nClarity: The paper is exceptionally well-written and clearly structured. The problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental results are all explained with high clarity. The figures, particularly Figure 1 and 3, are effective at illustrating the core trade-offs and the optimization mechanism.\n\nEmpirical Rigor: The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering three distinct and challenging long-horizon benchmarks. The results are strong, showing that ACON not only maintains performance close to the \"no compression\" upper bound but also significantly outperforms other compression baselines, which often suffer from severe performance degradation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Practical Cost vs. Token Efficiency: The primary weakness lies in the trade-off between peak token reduction and overall computational/API cost. The paper itself acknowledges this limitation in Section 4.5. While ACON successfully reduces the maximum context length (peak tokens), the process of history compression (which involves frequent calls to the compressor LLM) can break the KV-caching mechanism of the agent LLM. This forces re-computation and can lead to a higher total number of tokens processed and thus higher API costs, as shown in Figure 7. This is a significant practical drawback that might limit the adoption of the history compression part of the framework where cost, not just memory, is the main concern.\n\nCost and Scalability of the Optimization Process Itself: The paper details the effectiveness of the ACON framework but does not sufficiently discuss the \"meta-cost\" of the guideline optimization process. This process requires running multiple full trajectories (both with and without compression) and then using a powerful \"optimizer\" LLM for analysis. For new, complex domains, this optimization phase could be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. The scalability of this approach to a wide variety of new tasks without incurring substantial upfront costs is unclear.\n\nGeneralizability of Optimized Guidelines: The experiments show that guidelines optimized on a specific benchmark's training set work well on its test set. However, the generalizability of these highly specialized guidelines across different domains remains an open question. For instance, would a guideline optimized for AppWorld's application-based tasks be effective for a radically different domain like code generation or scientific literature review? The paper could be strengthened by including an experiment that tests this cross-domain transferability."}, "questions": {"value": "Regarding the critical issue of computational overhead: Could the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the trade-off between peak token reduction and total API cost, especially for history compression? For what types of tasks or interaction patterns does the cost-saving from reduced context outweigh the extra cost of the compressor calls and KV-cache invalidation?\n\nCould the authors elaborate on the cost and complexity of the guideline optimization phase? What is the estimated computational cost (e.g., in terms of number of LLM calls or GPU hours) required to generate an optimized guideline for a new benchmark of similar complexity to AppWorld?\n\nThe quality of the optimized guideline seems to depend heavily on the capability of the \"optimizer\" LLM (O3 model in this case). How sensitive is the final guideline quality to the choice of this optimizer? If a less capable model (e.g., gpt-4.1-mini) were used as the optimizer, would the process still yield significant improvements, or does ACON fundamentally rely on having access to a state-of-the-art reasoning model for optimization?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "yThouB0bVI", "forum": "7JbSwX6bNL", "replyto": "7JbSwX6bNL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10191/Reviewer_PhCp"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10191/Reviewer_PhCp"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10191/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760465413088, "cdate": 1760465413088, "tmdate": 1762921556104, "mdate": 1762921556104, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Large language models serve as agents in dynamic environments where they accumulate extensive interaction histories, leading to increased computational costs and inefficiencies in long-horizon tasks.

The authors also experimented with distillation of the learned compressor into smaller models using LoRA fine-tuning.

However, while ACON achieves better reasoning stability, the actual efficiency gains in terms of total token usage and runtime cost are less convincing."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "* Formulation of context compression as learning problem: ACON elegantly formulates context compression as a contrastive optimization problem. By pairing successful trajectories with failed ones after compression, it directly trains the model to preserve information that determines success. This min–max objective formalizes what to keep and what to drop in a principled way, moving beyond rule-based or heuristic memory truncation.\n* Clear and rigorous methodological description: The paper provides a detailed explanation of the compression guideline optimization process. The use of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation for multiple candidate guidelines, iterative feedback generation, and adaptive prompt selection is described with strong clarity. This makes the method reproducible and highlights the thoughtfulness of the design.\n* Exhaustive evaluations with multiple benchmarks: The authors conducted experiments on three distinct benchmarks under varying conditions and provided detailed analyses to understand various aspects of the proposed framework. Evaluations on three distinct long-horizon agentic benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and moderate token reductions. The inclusion of both full-scale and distilled compressors supports the framework’s flexibility and practical deployment value.\n* Strong contribution to reasoning stability: Even though ACON’s original goal was efficiency, its most significant contribution appears in reasoning stabilization. Compressed and structured contexts improve coherence in long-horizon planning, reducing redundant exploration and logical drift in LLM agents."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* Limited resolution of the claimed efficiency problem: Although the paper motivates ACON as a solution to computational inefficiency caused by long contexts, experiments show that overall token usage and runtime cost did not decrease significantly. In fact, repeated compressor invocations increased API calls, and the authors acknowledge that execution latency rose. The framework thus enhances task performance but not genuine efficiency\n* High optimization cost in the guideline learning phase: The compression guideline optimization is extremely expensive, involving iterative LLM calls across the full D_cont dataset. With 20–25 candidate prompts per iteration and multiple iterations, the process may require hundreds of thousands of API calls and many hours of training time. The paper admits this cost but omits quantitative measurements, treating it as an offline overhead. This weakens the practicality of ACON for large-scale or domain-adaptive deployment. The authors argue that guideline optimization is performed once per domain and reused across tasks. However, in realistic multi-domain settings, new environments would require data collection and retraining that reintroduces the same heavy computational overhead. This limits ACON’s scalability and adaptability for general-purpose agent systems.\n* Distillation effect Is limited: The distillation step offers only marginal performance gains. The paper itself notes that even GPT-4.1-mini without distillation performs comparably to distilled small models. Hence, the true utility of distillation lies in cost reduction rather than learning transfer, making its contribution modest.\n* Guideline optimization depends heavily on heuristic search: Although the optimization is presented as learning-driven, it fundamentally relies on prompt-based heuristic exploration with LLM-as-a-judge feedback. This process lacks theoretical guarantees of convergence or optimality and may depend heavily on model biases and dataset idiosyncrasies."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the Weaknesses section to address the raised issues."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "C7L01KtwT2", "forum": "7JbSwX6bNL", "replyto": "7JbSwX6bNL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10191/Reviewer_RzY6"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10191/Reviewer_RzY6"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10191/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761814125768, "cdate": 1761814125768, "tmdate": 1762921555263, "mdate": 1762921555263, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
