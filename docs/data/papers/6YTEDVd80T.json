As a result, traditional detection methods rely mostly on subtle artifacts introduced during generation. However, we show that such methods could eventually become ineffective. Anticipating this, we suggest that the main risk lies not in whether a media sample is synthetic or real, but in whether its semantic content is deceiving, that is, whether it distorts the information distribution in a way that misrepresents reality. To capture this, we formally introduce the notion of deception in the context of online media streams. Complementing standard detection approaches, we introduce semantic calibration to mitigate deception directly by processing semantic content using captioning and large language models, rather than relying on artifacts introduced by generative models. Our method is explainable, transparent, and modality agnostic, providing a rigorous foundation for developing new tools to combat online misinformation.

They also highlight that the semantic calibration pipeline is simple, transparent, interpretable, and offers strong explainability.\n\nThe reviewers raised two main concerns. First, the method relies on captioning models, whose imperfections may limit robustness across modalities. Second, several of our experiments use controlled, synthetic semantic shifts rather than real-world media streams. In the following we address both concerns.\n\n### Reliance on captioning models\nAs discussed in Sec. 6, we agree that robust captioning is an important open problem. A large body of research focuses on building strong captioning models. We refer reviewers to existing literature for more details on captioning robustness [1, 2], recent methods aimed at improving it [3], and the current state of captioners [4]. \n\nWhile semantic calibration inherits the limitations of captioning models for non-text modalities, it also benefits from ongoing progress in that area. We also note that the reliance on captioning models is a weakness shared by many recent automatic content moderation algorithms (e.g., [5,6]), not only semantic calibration. For instance, OpenAI's latest content moderation API uses a multimodal model `omni-moderation-latest` to classify images as harmful [6]. \n\nFinally, we emphasize that semantic calibration itself is modality-agnostic: it operates purely on text. While we use captioning models to obtain text from non-textual media, our proposed method applies equally to human-generated captions or textual content, where $Z=\\hat{Z}$ and $H(Z|\\hat{Z})=0$ by definition. The reliance on captioning models is therefore not intrinsic to our work.\n\n### Additional experiments on real-world semantic shifts\n\nSeveral reviewers noted that our experiments focused on simplified, artificial shifts. To address this, we added results on realistic shifts by evaluating semantic calibration on datasets of political opinions from different parties [1,2,3]. The objective is to filter a potentially skewed media stream such that the resulting stream matches a desired balanced distribution. For the binary datasets, we balance between conservative and liberal content. For the three-label dataset, we balance among left, center, and right.\n\nWe run three experiments: one on tweets from U.S. senators, one on political podcast segments, and one on bias-annotated political news (see manuscript for references). **In all cases, the objective is purely distributional: we do not attempt to fact-check or validate the content itself.** The goal is to calibrate the semantic distribution of the stream, which is the core distinction from traditional detection.\n\nAs shown below, semantic calibration consistently reduces deception by more than 80% across real semantic shifts, while introducing negligible bias on the baseline. These results have also been added to Table 1 of the manuscript.\n\nSenator Tweets, target dist.: Conservative \\(C): 50%, Liberal (L): 50%\n\n| Case | C (Initial) | L (Initial) | C (Filtered) | L (Filtered) | Reduction |\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n| Baseline | 50% | 50% | 50% | 50% | — |\n| Mild | 60% | 40% | 52% | 48% | **96.03%**|\n| Moderate | 20% | 80% | 41% | 59% | **91.55%**|\n| Severe | 90% | 10%| 68% | 32%| **81.99%**|\n\nPolitical Podcasts, target dist.: C: 50%, L: 50%\n\n| Case | C (Initial) | L (Initial) | C (Filtered) | L (Filtered) | Reduction |\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n| Baseline | 50% | 50% | 49% | 51% | — |\n| Mild | 60% | 40% | 50% | 50% | **99.77%** |\n| Moderate | 70% | 30% | 50% | 50% | **99.99%** |\n| Severe | 19% | 81% | 42% | 58% | **93.79%** |\n\nPolitical Bias Corpus, target dist.: Left (L): 33%, Center \\(C): 33%, Right \\(R): 33%\n\n| Case | L (Initial) | C (Initial) | R (Initial) | L (Filtered) | C (Filtered) | R (Filtered) | Reduction |\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n| Baseline | 33% | 33% | 33% | 33% | 33% | 33% | — |\n| Mild | 44% | 11% | 44% | 39% | 24% | 36% | **84.85%** |\n| Moderate | 70% | 20% | 10% | 27% | 36% | 36% | **97.12%** |\n| Severe | 75% | 10% | 15% | 49% | 22% | 29% | **84.52%** |\n\n[1] A.
