As a result, traditional detection methods rely mostly on subtle artifacts introduced during generation. However, we show that such methods could eventually become ineffective. Anticipating this, we suggest that the main risk lies not in whether a media sample is synthetic or real, but in whether its semantic content is deceiving, that is, whether it distorts the information distribution in a way that misrepresents reality. To capture this, we formally introduce the notion of deception in the context of online media streams. Complementing standard detection approaches, we introduce semantic calibration to mitigate deception directly by processing semantic content using captioning and large language models, rather than relying on artifacts introduced by generative models. Our method is explainable, transparent, and modality agnostic, providing a rigorous foundation for developing new tools to combat online misinformation. We offer both theoretical justification and empirical evidence for its effectiveness.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["moderation", "semantic calibration"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c5628c90f2361f0849ffaedc3c9b57e0380129c3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper argues that instead of merely detecting whether media content is synthetic or not, one should directly calibrate its semantic distribution to mitigate potential semantic deception.
