Benchmark signatures probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them as a set of salient tokens drawn from **in-the-wild**, naturally authored corpora, where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure, becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and cultural/world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap. Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following, and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected LLM capabilities.", "tldr": "We introduce benchmark signatures, sets of salient tokens on pre-training corpora whose LLM perplexity predicts benchmark performance, to quantify (unexpected) benchmark overlaps such as logic and language.", "keywords": ["meta-evaluation", "benchmark overlaps", "language models"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ccebf43f771fd9a6afd91f1a4de7418bfaeb31fe.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/589ef391f210a0c9bb3f520dcabeb5707224a8e4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces the concept of benchmark signatures that can be used to characterize and compare LLM benchmarks.

For example, Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) was created specifically to address the saturation of MMLU by providing expert-written questions.

This omits classes of benchmarks, such as open-ended generation tasks like summarization or dialogue, where the signature approach may be harder to apply because it inherently works better with well-defined quantitative performance metrics. This focus should be acknowledged as a limitation. \n\n- Some choices in the signature extraction pipeline could use further justification. The authors use a fixed threshold (top/bottom 1% by thrush correlation) for pre-filtering, and then a greedy forward selection up to 1500 tokens. Why 1% and how was 1500 chosen as the max features? There’s no comparison to regularization methods like Lasso or Elastic-Net, which the authors mention as a possible extension but do not report results for. \n\n- A conceptual weakness is the paper’s implicit conflation of model capability and pretraining familiarity. By design, the signature tokens are those that models find easier (lower perplexity) and that correlate with better benchmark scores. This risks a tautology since models may perform well on a benchmark because they have seen similar content before. For benchmarks aiming to test reasoning beyond memorized knowledge, a high signature overlap might indicate the benchmark is inadvertently easier for models that have seen certain clues. In other words, the approach might not distinguish generalization ability from training-set overlap."}, "questions": {"value": "-  If classical regression methods are ill-posed for this high-dimensional problem, did the authors consider regularization techniques or matrix factorization/filtering methods? The use of Lasso or Elastic Net regression is mentioned as an extension but is not explored in this paper.\n- For the THRUSHPREFILTER step, the paper mentions using \"approximately the top 1% of tokens with the strongest signal” but doesn't specify the exact threshold. Is there a more principled data-driven procedure for selecting this threshold; for example, using cross-validation or analyzing the correlation distribution?\n- Relatedly, how sensitive are the results to the fixed variable choices, such as 1% thrush filtering and up to 1500 tokens used in forward selection?\n- While code is provided, certain details of the experimental setup are not explicit in the paper.

It feels like the authors have limited writing experience. The abstract is not very clear and could benefit from referencing how other papers structure theirs. Also, the last line of the last page is not aligned to the bottom. This directly affects the clarity of presentation.\n\nMy main concern is computational cost and scalability. The authors use only 1B tokens from RedPajama, then downsample by 50x to ~16.9M token contexts. Our large model in-the-wild datasets are on the scale of tens of trillions of tokens. It is unclear how this work would handle larger scales. From Section A.5.1:\n- Initial scale: ~8.45 × 10^9 tokens (RedPajama 1B variant)  \n- Downsampling: 1/50\n- Final scale: ~1.69 × 10^7 tokens\n- Feature matrix: P ∈ R^(32 × 1.69×10^7)\n\nThe complexity of generalizing this needs discussion. A previous work addressing similar scale is LESS [1]. Getting scaling behavior from 1B → 10B → 100B tokens seems quite difficult, but the authors should discuss this.\n\nThe paper never shows what the actual salient tokens are. They extract ~30 tokens per benchmark but provide no examples. What tokens predict math performance? What about coding? Without this, the signatures remain black-box features. This is a significant missed opportunity.\n\nMethodological choices lack justification. The authors mention Lasso or Elastic Net but choose forward selection for \"interpretability\" without demonstrating this. No comparison with Spearman correlation or mutual information for screening. More ablations would help.\n\nThe paper discusses two interpretations of overlap - genuine cognitive interdependence versus \"leaky\" benchmarks - but never resolves this. When instruction-following and logic overlap more than within-logic benchmarks, the authors could use signature tokens to distinguish these interpretations but do not.\n\n[1] Chen et al., \"LESS: Selecting Influential Data for Targeted Instruction Tuning,\" ICML 2024."}, "questions": {"value": "Can you provide analysis of how signatures change with corpus size?

Do they make intuitive sense?\n\nWhen instruction-following and logic show high signature overlap, what do the shared tokens look like? This could distinguish between genuine interdependence versus contamination.\n\nHave you validated signatures on held-out models not used in extraction?

Two alternative explanations exist: (a) High within-dataset vs. between-dataset correlations may simply reflect training data contamination, as authors acknowledge; (b) Same dataset may inherently represent a single capability independent of intended subject divisions—for instance, if all MMLU subjects source from Wikipedia, signatures may capture \"Wikipedia-style capability\" (or even spurious correlation) rather than genuine subject-specific skills (history vs. chemistry).
