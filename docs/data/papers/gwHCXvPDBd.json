This challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose $\\text{\\emph{NoisePrints}}$, a lightweight watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access to model weights.", "tldr": "NoisePrints is a distortion-free, seed-based watermarking method that enables efficient and robust authorship verification for diffusion models without model access.", "keywords": ["Watermarking", "Diffusion Models", "Generative AI"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/43a7cf58fa2b5e15ff159a299f5d86edbac136f5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper provides some insights on how the embedding of the generated image is related to the random seed, and thereby proposes a watermark verification method.

The incorporation of a zero-knowledge proof circuit is a notable strength. It enables secure third-party verification without exposing the secret seed, effectively mitigating a key risk in ownership attestation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The proposed NoisePrints is a single-bit watermarking method, which is primarily designed for ownership verification. In contrast, many existing methods are multi-bit, offering the extended capability of tracing the specific user responsible for the generation.\n2. The proposed scheme faces the same practical deployment challenge as Gaussian Shading[1] (GS). To remain distortion-free, it relies on a randomly sampled seed for each generation, which necessitates securely logging and managing a vast database of `(x, s)` pairs. This requirement creates significant operational overhead and scalability concerns in real-world systems.\n3. A logical inconsistency is identified regarding the applicability of the Dispute Protocol. According to Section 3.3, the protocol is activated exclusively when \"two parties submit conflicting authorship claims that both pass the verification test.\" This precondition is inherently incompatible with the threat model of a geometric removal attack, as defined in Section 3.2. In such an attack, the adversary's success is measured by causing the legitimate claim `(x, s)`to fall below the verification threshold τ, thereby making the \"both pass\" condition unattainable. Consequently, the protocol, as currently formulated, offers no recourse for the rightful owner in this common adversarial scenario.\n4. A significant tension exists between the stated threat model and the technical prerequisites of the proposed method. The introduction emphasizes the challenge of watermarking for private models where \"model weights remain private and are never shared.\" However, the verification protocol requires the model provider to use a publicly available VAE encoder. This creates a dependency that contradicts the scenario of a completely self-contained, proprietary model, as a provider wishing to keep their entire pipeline private would be unable to use NoisePrints.\n5. A critical security flaw exists in the naive protocol (without ZKP). The requirement for the content producer to expose the seed `s` by submitting the pair `(x, s)` makes the scheme vulnerable to forgery. An adversary who steals this pair can exploit the public VAE to create a perturbed image `x'` that is perceptually similar to `x` but lies outside the verification boundary for the legitimate owner. The adversary can then present the pair `(x', s)` and successfully claim ownership, all without requiring access to the private U-Net. This breaks the security model under a stolen seed scenario.\n6. The claimed robustness against geometric attacks is conceptually problematic. The resilience is not an inherent property of the NoisePrint signal but is entirely dependent on the Dispute Protocol's ability to apply a corrective inverse transformation. This process merely reverses a specific, pre-defined manipulation (e.g., rotation, scaling) prior to verification. It does not demonstrate that the watermark itself can survive true geometric distortion, which typically causes irreversible, non-aligned spatial scrambling. The same logic could theoretically be applied to any basic image processing attack (e.g., contrast adjustment, blur) if an effective \"inverse operation\" could be found and applied. Therefore, the credit lies with the corrective pre-processing within the protocol, not with the fundamental robustness of the NoisePrints method.\n7. The evaluation of the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) implementation is relatively preliminary.\n8. The threat model for the \"Watermark Injection\" attack appears to lack practical motivation. The scenario in which an adversary creates a forged image that is *visually similar* to the original while also embedding an *identical* watermark seems contrived. In practice, an adversary seeking to claim ownership would more plausibly create a *different* image (e.g., a novel artistic creation) and falsely associate it with a forged seed, rather than meticulously replicating the original content with the same watermark. The authors should either provide a stronger justification for the considered injection attack scenario or redefine it to reflect a more realistic adversarial goal."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **Regarding Weakness 1**: NoisePrints already assigns a unique seed to each user as an identity identifier. This foundation could be directly extended to construct a simple multi-bit scheme, for instance, by allocating a subset of seeds to represent specific user IDs. However, the authors have not evaluated NoisePrints from this perspective. To comprehensively benchmark against state-of-the-art methods like Stable Signature[2] and Gaussian Shading[1], it is necessary to evaluate its performance in terms of traceability accuracy within a multi-bit framework.\n2. **Regarding Weakness 3**: The description of the Dispute Protocol's usage scenario should be reorganized to align with the experimental setup and resolve the logical contradiction when facing geometric attacks.\n3. **Regarding Weakness 4**:  To resolve the contradiction in the threat model, I recommend removing the requirement for a public VAE. Instead of relying on model providers to reuse a public VAE—which conflicts with the scenario of fully proprietary models—the model owner could entrust their private VAE to the fully trusted verifier. This approach would better align with the stated principle that \"the verifier is the only trusted party\" and that \"model weights remain private and are never shared,\" while still enabling the verification procedure.\n4. **Regarding Weakness 5**:  I recommend that the authors augment the threat model with specific strategies to mitigate the risk of seed exposure in the naive protocol version.\n5. **Regarding Weakness 6:** The paper attributes geometric robustness to the NoisePrints method itself. However, the described mechanism relies entirely on the Dispute Protocol's ability to apply an inverse transformation to \"correct\" the image before verification. Could you clarify how this approach demonstrates inherent robustness of the watermark signal, as opposed to being a general pre-processing strategy that could theoretically be applied to any watermarking scheme? Furthermore, does this mean that NoisePrints' geometric robustness is ultimately limited to attacks that are both invertible and whose inverse transformation is known and included in the public set 𝒢?\n6. **Regarding Weakness 7:** The paper demonstrates the functional correctness of the ZKP implementation. However, its security guarantees are primarily cryptographic. A critical remaining question is: how does the *watermark robustness* fare when the image undergoes attacks *before* the ZKP-based verification is performed? Specifically, if an attacked image `x'` (e.g., after JPEG compression, blurring, or a geometric transformation) is submitted for ZKP verification, will the circuit still correctly output `1` (indicating a valid watermark) when provided with the legitimate seed `s`? We recommend that the authors conduct a simple but essential robustness evaluation for the ZKP scenario to confirm that the strong robustness demonstrated in the standard setting is preserved when verification occurs within the ZKP circuit.\n7. **Regarding Weakness 8:** The authors should consider evaluating more practical forgery attacks, such as those proposed in [3].\n\n8.  The paper does not mention a specific method for mapping bits $PRNG(h(s))$ to Gaussian noise $\\epsilon(h(s))$. How is this step concretely implemented?\n9. It is unclear from the experimental description whether a single VAE was used for all verification tasks, or whether the native VAE corresponding to each generative model was employed.
