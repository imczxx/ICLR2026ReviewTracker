However, existing EQA benchmarks suffer from three key limitations: constrained exploration scope, passive trajectory, and insufficient viewpoint annotation. To address these challenges, we introduce ExploraQA, a large-scale dataset featuring 12,436 diverse, open-ended questions across seven categories, designed to evaluate language, visual, and spatial reasoning. ExploraQA emphasizes long-horizon exploration, proactive trajectory, and comprehensive viewpoint annotations, enabling rigorous assessment of autonomous agents. We further propose an Iterative EQA Data Generation Framework to efficiently produce high-quality annotations via VLMs and human verification. To enhance exploration, we present the Answer Quality-Guided Navigator, which leverages a Topology-Aware Keyframe Search Module for efficient long-range navigation and an Answer Quality Reward Mechanism to optimize question-driven trajectories through dual LLM evaluators. Experimental results show that AQ-Nav achieves a 5.4% absolute improvement in E_score on the ExploraQA unseen test set over state-of-the-art navigators. We will release our dataset and code.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["vision language navigation", "computer vision"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/51ecc9f91ba9ff86612c4c8d17c5a43cf9eeffeb.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new dataset and approach for embodied question answering in navigation settings. As a first contribution they curate a new QA dataset using an iterative data generation framework. The main difference between this dataset (and framework) is that it uses expert trajectory data to label some QA. This is what is being referred to as proactive QA. The whole premise being that expert data should be useful to train imitation learning policies. The data generation framework uses multiple VLMs in the loop where one model generates while the other verifies and several rounds happen before the answer is accepted. Using this data a planning framework (AQ Nav) is proposed. AQNav builds a topological map, a navigation module for next subgoal prediction. This waypoint (node) selection mechanism uses the textual information and the graph structure (which includes the visual features from all the different locations) to propose an action, which is either a node in the graph or stop action. The main sell of the approach is that the same expert data can be used for imitation learning as well as for asking QA questions.  Experiments are performed on the proposed ExploraQA dataset where the approach outperforms some old baslines and a more recent ETPONav baseline."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper is overall well written and tries to tackle an important problem.

But I am really sure how this proactive behavior shows up in any of the evals. Can you please clarify this? I think using the word “proactive” seems a bit misguided. Proactive question answering would assume that the agent has some self-awareness and can reason about uncertainty but that is not really what is being proposed here. From my understanding some of the proactive claims (e.g. proactive trajectories) should be substantially reduced.\n\n*Need for a paired dataset*: One of the claims that the paper makes is the need for a paired dataset from which both navigation can be learned via imitation learning as well as have QA pairs to query for video-navigation QA. However, I am a bit unclear about this need. Why can we not learn both of these capabilities from disjoint datasets. Maybe some small amount of paired data is useful but it doesn’t seem super necessary to have a large scale dataset (which is what the paper is proposing) for these capabilities. Both, navigation and embodied QA capabilities seem disjoint. The agent can quite easily learn navigation from hindisght labeled data while embodied QA pairs can be generated from both optimal as well as suboptimal data. Can the authors clarify the need for this large scale paired dataset?\n\n*Comparisons*: There are some recent works such as Saxena et al. which should be cited and compared against as well.

The problem introduced does not appear well-motivated to me, in that existing benchmarks already cover these capabilities\n2. The benchmark adds some LLM-generated (and human checked) questions on top of existing trajectories from other works. Some details are missing about what design parameters were used to ensure the generation was complete (high-recall).\n3. The proposed agent is evaluated only on this new benchmark; not on other existing benchmarks -- which makes it difficult to evaluate the efficacy of the agent.\n\n**Task novelty and utility**\nThe proposed task asks the agent to follow a given trajectory, based on language instructions, and then answer a question based on what the agent sees at the destination. The episode is scored based on how efficiently the agent follows the trajectory, and whether the answer is correct. \n\nBoth the instruction-guided trajectory following [1] and question answering [EQA] tasks themselves are from existing work. Putting these two tasks together does not seem to require substantially different capabilities than what is already required in existing benchmarks:. \n* The trajectories for instruction-guided trajectory are directly used from [1]\n* The question-answering from a trajectory is also covered in OpenEQA: the EM-EQA setting requires agents to answer questions from a predetermined video, and the A-EQA setting requires agents to determine how to navigate around the environment to find the answer\nBoth of these benchmarks use the Habitat simulator.\n\n\n\n**Question generation:**\nThere are very few details about the question generation provided.\n* How do the authors guarantee coverage of useful or important questions that a user might ask? As best I can tell, the diversity comes from whatever GPT4o generates from the prompt in Figure 6. \n* LLMs are known to collapse modes and produce relatively low diversity. For example, ask ChatGPT to tell a joke -- it will usually repeat the same 3 or 4 jokes.  So I wonder how the authors guarantee good coverage of what humans might ask in ExploreQA?\n\nThere are also few details about design decisions used to develop the QA evaluator:\n* How many feedback iterations are does this usually take? How does acceptance rate increase with more iterations?\n* What design decisions or facts about the prompt were important when designing the system?\n* The authors state that this uses Claude Sonnet 3.5, which is known to have relatively weaker visual understanding compared to GPT-4, Qwen, or Gemini. \n\n\n**Agent evaluation**\nDoes the agent generalize to other simulators and other question types, navigation instructions, or to longer trajectories?\n\n\nFor [1], it would also be helpful to compare the SotA on that benchmark, and ideally on other benchmarks in other simulators if they exist. \n\n\n[1] Beyond the navgraph: Vision and language navigation in continuous environments"}, "questions": {"value": "* The authors mention \"proactive navigation\" and proactive several times but I am unfamiliar with the term.

Benchmark value depends on distributional richness and question complexity. No evaluation that LLM-generated QA isn't repetitive or too easy.\n\n- Experiments: No comparison to simple baselines like a blind LLM or a multi-frame VLM with randomly sampled frames from the scene.\n\n- Human verification details limited; no quality statistics beyond a correlation metric.
