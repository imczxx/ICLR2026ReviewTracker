An In-Depth Analysis", "abstract": "Gradually growing the depth of Transformers during training cannot only reduce training cost but also lead to improved reasoning performance, as shown by MIDAS (Saunshi et al., 2024). Thus far, however, a mechanistic understanding of these gains has been missing. In this work, we establish a connection to recent work showing that layers in the second half of non-grown, pre-layernorm Transformers contribute much less to the final output distribution than those in the first half - also known as the Curse of Depth (Sun et al., 2025, Csordás et al., 2025). Using depth-wise analyses, we demonstrate that growth via gradual middle stacking yields more effective utilization of model depth, alters the residual stream structure, and facilitates the formation of permutable computational blocks. In addition, we propose a lightweight modification of MIDAS that yields further improvements in downstream reasoning benchmarks. Overall, this work highlights how the gradual growth of model depth can lead to the formation of distinct computational circuits and overcome the limited depth utilization seen in standard non-grown models.", "tldr": "We analyse how growing Transformers gradually in depth improves reasoning by boosting depth utilization and inducing modular computational circuits.", "keywords": ["stacking", "language model", "reasoning", "efficient training", "depth analysis"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b31315e1fc9558737950d3b7d122ec8f049fd545.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper performs an analysis of MIDAS a gradual stacking technique to grow transformers whilst training them.

In particular, we are grateful to read that this work “deepens the conceptual grounding of growth-based reasoning improvements and is well suited for poster-level acceptance” (Reviewer 2ves), proposing a “lightweight change that preserves or improves reasoning without harming NLL” (Reviewer h9LG), “attains superior performance in reasoning-intensive tasks” (Reviewer ZzFz), and “the analysis presented is deep and thorough” (Reviewer UGkv). All reviewers also noted that this work illuminates and addresses the “Curse of Depth” in Transformers.\n\nIn response to recurring concerns, we have conducted additional experiments and updated the manuscript accordingly. Changes are highlighted in green, with green titles indicating an entirely new section. We summarise the main modifications below:\n\n**Baseline with LayerNorm-Scaling**\n\nWe have added an additional baseline trained with the recently proposed LayerNorm-Scaling scheme [1], which is designed to control exploding variance in later layers of Pre-LN architectures and has been reported to outperform Pre-LN, Post-LN, and Mix-LN variants in task performance while increasing depth usage. With the current setup, however, this baseline does not improve depth utilisation and yields only small, incremental gains in benchmark performance over the original baseline. Moreover, these gains largely vanish when scaling to the larger 1.7B model (Table 1; Appendix E).\n\n**LIDAS + LayerNorm-Scaling**\n\nWe further introduce a variant that combines LayerNorm-Scaling with LIDAS (Table 8; Appendix E). This model achieves improved reasoning benchmark performance over the corresponding LayerNorm-Scaling baseline (without growth) and exhibits stronger depth utilisation (Fig. 27, 28). These results indicate that gradual depth growth remains beneficial and is largely orthogonal to the choice of normalisation scheme.\n\n**FLOPs-matched comparisons**\n\nTo enable a more direct efficiency comparison between growth and non-growth training, we trained truncated baselines for both the 360M and 1.7B models to match the FLOPs of the grown models. This FLOPs-matched setup strengthens the reported efficiency claims.\n| Scale | Model              | NLL ↓    | Open-book Q&A (F1 ↑) | Closed-book Q&A (F1 ↑) | Lambada (Acc ↑) | Hellaswag (Acc ↑) | MathWorld (Acc ↑) | Primitives (Acc ↑) | MathWorld Math Cooldown (Acc ↑) | Primitives Math Cooldown (Acc ↑) |\n|-------|--------------------|----------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 360M  | Baseline Truncated | 2.19     | 20.72                 | 14.17                  | 42.65           | 39.21             | 3.07                   | **32.98**               | 7.30                    | 36.90                    |\n| 360M  | MIDAS              | 2.18     | 24.57                 | 13.75                  | 43.31           | 40.36             | **4.39**               | 28.18                   | **13.43**               | 35.14                    |\n| 360M  | LIDAS              | **2.16** | **26.63**             | **14.57**              | **44.03**       | **40.58**         | 4.36                   | 31.20                   | 12.30                   | **50.36**                |\n| 1.7B  | Baseline Truncated | 1.97     | 29.03                 | 17.99                  | 50.22           | 45.60             | 12.36                  | 31.04                   | 21.15                   | 41.20                    |\n| 1.7B  | MIDAS              | 1.97     | 28.80                 | 18.50                  | 50.81           | 46.19             | 16.07                  | 40.88                   | 24.01                   | **55.46**                |\n| 1.7B  | LIDAS              | **1.96** | **29.84**             | **19.08**              | **51.41**       | **46.32**         | **18.59**              | **47.34**               | **24.60**               | 53.00                    |"}}, "id": "JKmJeEkEhN", "forum": "HZRz9R1Xjo", "replyto": "HZRz9R1Xjo", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20628/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20628/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20628/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763492769803, "cdate": 1763492769803, "tmdate": 1763492769803, "mdate": 1763492769803, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper performs an analysis of MIDAS a gradual stacking technique to grow transformers whilst training them.

Limited architectural generality\nAll experiments are on SmolLM (360M / 1.7B), a single pre-LN, short-context family. Since the contribution is mechanistic in nature, it remains unclear whether the observed “resurrected depth utilization” is a *property of staged growth itself*, or a *property of this architecture family*. \n\n### 2. Causal link between permutation robustness and “depth utilization” remains implicit\nFor example, section 4.2 shows that grown models are more robust to block-level reordering, and **claims** this as evidence of deeper utilization. However, it needs more detailed explanations to bridge this casual relation.\n\n### 3. Performance gaps are small and lack statistical framing\nIn Table 1, most LIDAS vs MIDAS gains are <1pp; without multi-seed variance this is difficult to interpret; if without confidence intervals or multi-seed reporting, the differences are too small to determine whether those small gains reflect a stable trend or training stochasticity. Since LIDAS is an architectural refinement, the size and stability of differences matter for how much weight the architecture (vs. the growth mechanism) contributes to the overall story. \n\n### 4. The 360M + math-cooldown Primitive result is an unexplained outlier\nIn table 1, the improvement between LIDAS and MIDAS is dramatically larger, however, there's no explanation. (The paper itself only states that the cause of the improvements between grown model and baseline is unclear.) \nThis weakens the confidence that the measured gains derive cleanly from the proposed mechanism rather than an interaction or confound.\n\n### 5. Block-size may be an unexamined confound\nThe periodicity observed in section 4.3 is shown only for block size b=4. If b=2 or b=8 produces a different cycle structure, part of the reported effect may be hyperparameter-induced. A small ablation would confirm whether the pattern is intrinsic or scheduler-driven.\n\n### 6. Need more explanation on the causal relation between symmetry and depth depth utilization \nSection 4.4 mentions that LIDAS is more block-wise symmetrical than MIDAS. However, it does not explain precisely why this offers an advantage in terms of in-depth utilization. Need more detailed explanation to build a causal link. \nAlso, better if there is a causal link between this symmetry and the mechanism of LIDAS."}, "questions": {"value": "In Fig. 1 and Fig. 9, the difference between the two variants is subtle (In Fig.1, it seems that LIDAS is not as good as MIDAS).
