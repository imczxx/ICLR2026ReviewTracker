To this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over 1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA) by over 15\\% in terms of geometric accuracy for posed facial expressions.", "tldr": "Fine-tuning image foundation models to predict valuable geometric cues for face tracing.", "keywords": ["Single Image Face Reconstruction", "Face Tracking", "Foundation Model Finetuning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4e59f26aeca9116d67b7caf241c405a3d69d852d.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/1c0e9e6500d5ef7aba8bbe2de1f586227a384bd0.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a hybrid method for single-image 3D face reconstruction, named Pixel3DMM, which leverages a powerful prior model to predict normals and UV coordinates as supervisory signals, guiding the optimization of the FLAME mesh through test-time optimization.

The method primarily fine-tunes DINOv2 with a simple prediction head (4 transformer blocks + 3 up-convolutions). So there is limited novelty in the architecture or set up itself.\n2. Despite strong posed reconstruction, the method only marginally improves over MICA for neutral faces.\n3. The paper lacks discussion of when and why the method fails. What types of expressions or conditions are most challenging? The qualitative comparisons show strong results, but no failure cases are presented.\n4. The method critically depends on MICA's identity predictions (Table 3: \"no MICA\" ablation shows significant degradation). This is a strong assumption that limits the method's independence and could propagate MICA's biases or errors.\n5. The use of IC-Light for lighting augmentation is neat but not thoroughly evaluated. How much does this contribute to robustness? An ablation would be valuable.\n6. The fitting takes 30 seconds in an \"unoptimised implementation.\" How does this compare to baselines? Real-time performance matters for many applications.\n7. In the UV coordinate loss design (Eq. 6) the nearest neighbour lookup seems clumsy to me. Can't you use barycentric interpolation from the per-pixel UVs to interpolate a vertex position?\n8. Simple L1 difference in normal space. Why not use cosine similarity or angular error, which are more standard for normal estimation?\n9. The paper states all datasets are registered to FLAME topology using NPHM's procedure, but doesn't discuss registration quality or errors this might introduce."}, "questions": {"value": "Besides responding to the above listed weaknesses, some additional questions are:\n\nCan you provide quantitative analysis of where the method fails?

The proposed 3D reconstruction method takes two steps and requires two networks to predict normal and UV coordinates separately, which is relatively complex compared with previous feed-forward or optimization-only methods. \n2. The reconstruction still relies on FLAME parameters, which have limited representation capacity, so the method cannot reconstruct fine-grained details beyond 3DMM space. Also the paper uses NPHM to get uniform topology for supervision, which brings error.\n3.
