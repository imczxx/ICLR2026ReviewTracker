It is generally expected that removing low-value points results in a gradual decline in accuracy, while the removal of high-value points leads to a sharp decrease in performance. Many existing studies leverage Shapley-based data values for this task. In this paper, we demonstrate that these data values are not optimally suited for pruning low-value data when only a limited amount of data remains. To address this limitation, we introduce the Contsraint-Data-Value-Maximization approach, which effectively utilizes data attributions for pruning in low-data scenarios. By casting pruning as a constrained optimization that both maximizes total influence and penalizes excessive per‐test contributions, CDVM delivers robust performance even when only a small fraction of the data is retained. On the OpenDataVal benchmark, CDVM consistently outperforms existing alternatives, achieving state‐of‐the‐art accuracy and competitive runtime.", "tldr": "We apply constrained optimization to a data attribution matrix to prune data.", "keywords": ["Data Valuation", "Data Attribution", "Data Pruning", "Constrained Optimization"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/227d238a585420aecab3dce46ea86562f6999a80.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/dc921d02e500fc5ee768fe0c5803d6bf418ae66d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces  Constraint-Data-Value-Maximization (CDVM), which addresses a critical flaw in Shapley-based data pruning methods (and more generally methods based on semi-values): they lead to cluster removal bias, systematically pruning entire large clusters first and causing sharp performance drops.
