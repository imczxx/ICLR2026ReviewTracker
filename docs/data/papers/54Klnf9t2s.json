To mitigate these issues, various approaches have been explored to improve reasoning efficiency. In this paper, we focus on early exit methods which are lightweight and can be seamlessly adapted to various methods. These methods typically trigger an early exit based on different types of signals, including localized criteria like single-step confidence scores, as well as stabilization of an intermediate trial answer over multiple steps. However, we observe that they often struggle to confirm whether the underlying reasoning process is complete or sound. This paper pioneers to diagnose the reasoning state of CoT\nthrough the global dynamics of its entropy. We reveal a consistent pattern: CoT generation begins in a high-entropy uncertainty region before transitioning to a stable, low-entropy confidence region. We demonstrate that the transition into this confidence region strongly correlates with a complete reasoning process. Based on this insight, we propose COnfidence Region Exits (CORE) to stop the CoT\nwhen the model enters the confidence region. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior trade-off between computational cost and accuracy among early exit methods across various models including Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, and Qwen3-14B in AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA datasets.

Heuristic nature of the method. Despite the appealing intuition, the proposed CORE remains largely a heuristic extension of existing confidence-based early-exit methods. The confidence region is defined purely through an empirical entropy threshold and sliding window, without theoretical grounding or formal justification that low entropy reliably corresponds to reasoning completeness.\n\n2. The entropy threshold (β) and window size (w) are tuned empirically on a specific dataset (Bespoke-Stratos-17k) and directly applied to test tasks. This raises concerns about generalization and stability across domains or reasoning styles.\n\n3. The main empirical observation that CoT entropy decreases as reasoning progresses is not entirely new. Similar dynamics have been reported in recent works [1,2]. The proposed framework essentially repackages this known pattern rather than providing new methodological or conceptual insights. The proposed confidence region essentially monitors whether the token-level entropy remains below a threshold β for w consecutive steps. In other words, it merely adds a smoothing window on top of standard confidence-based early-exit heuristics\n\n4. The baselines (DEER, Dynasor) are relatively early heuristic methods.

The claim about efficiency in this paper is not rigorous. The delay analysis in Section 4.4 is misleading.

If every new model requires an expensive tuning on a large dataset (Bespoke-Stratos-17k training split in your setting), how can the method be considered lightweight or seamless-adapted?\n\n3. Figure 4 shows that on hard problems for Qwen3-14B, token savings lead to a proportional accuracy drop.
