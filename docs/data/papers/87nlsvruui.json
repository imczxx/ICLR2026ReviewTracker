However, in the real world, the data associated with a given location is often more complex than a simple scalar value and may contain e.g. images or text. Here, we introduce Embedding Local Spatial Autocorrelation, a new statistic to measure spatial interdependencies of data embeddings at a given location. ELSA adapts and expands one of the most central concepts in geography for the age of AI and its central data structure: embeddings. We highlight the utility of ELSA as a measure of spatial homo- and heterogeneity. Focusing on image embeddings, we provide experiments on using ELSA to test for spatial (in)dependence of distributions, for the detection of outliers and for sampling optimal training datasets. We also comment on further potential applications of ELSA and discuss the shortcomings of our approach.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["spatial autocorrelation", "embeddings", "spatial statistics", "metrics"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/feb7612002a0f367c6e31a06fbea42dd008f7bc7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f4abf1f0aee86ea5a268ed2e3c19b29511ccac5c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ELSA, the first local spatial autocorrelation measure for high-dimensional embeddings, extending geography's classical Local Moran's I from scalars to vectors such as images or texts.

Currently it seems for a given model, the ELSA values will be the same irrespective of the downstream task. I think ELSA needs to be made more task-specific since some tasks are spatially smooth e.g. temperature prediction while some tasks are not e.g. geolocalization.\n5. What would happen if geolocation embedding is concatenated along with the image embeddings? How would the ELSA metric change?\n6. Can you discuss if the ELSA metric is influenced by the spatial distribution of training data? For example, most of the datasets used in experiments are biased towards North America and Europe. Is ELSA robust to domain shifts?\n7. Can you compare other location embedding models and satellite embedding models? The paper is limited to Mosaiks and GeoCLIP embeddings. Also, how would ELSA metric change when using high-resolution satellite imagery vs low-resolution satellite imagery?\n8.
