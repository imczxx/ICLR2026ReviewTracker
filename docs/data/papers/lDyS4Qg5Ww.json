While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using Native Sequence Recovery (NSR)—a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, as different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures, and high NSR does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage framework that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a $9\\\\%$\n improvement in NSR over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model using an improved policy gradient algorithm with four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that our approach improves structural similarity by over $100\\\\%$ across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.", "tldr": "We propose an RL-guided diffusion model for RNA inverse design that directly optimizes 3D structural similarity, generalizes across predictors, and achieves over 100% gains over baselines while generating novel sequences.", "keywords": ["RNA Inverse Design", "Reinforcement Learning", "RNA Structure"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d41c82a5d0807aa5179c26c7ea16d94feebc24fd.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a64316bc5b2fee65ec0c987d5ace401857aa61fa.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose to extend recent RNA inverse folding methods such as RiboDiffusion and gRNAde to generate non-native RNA sequences with near-native structural similarities.

The proposed framework, diffusion-based sequence generation followed by reinforcement learning fine-tuning for structural fidelity, has already been explored extensively in the context of protein inverse folding.

As such, the contribution lies primarily in application rather than new ML methodology. Moreover, the paper underplays or omits discussion of this related body of work, giving the impression that concepts such as “native sequence recovery not reflecting structural fidelity” are new insights, whereas they are well established in the protein design literature.\n\nIn its current form, the paper presents a well-engineered application of known ideas to a new molecular domain, which would be more appropriate for a domain-specific or biological modeling venue rather than ICLR, which prioritizes algorithmic or conceptual advances in machine learning."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "zf7F3T5P4Q", "forum": "lDyS4Qg5Ww", "replyto": "lDyS4Qg5Ww", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12386/Reviewer_io7z"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12386/Reviewer_io7z"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12386/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761867485668, "cdate": 1761867485668, "tmdate": 1762923286977, "mdate": 1762923286977, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tackles RNA sequence design conditioned on a target 3D structure.

This way, the model may optimizer for structure as predicted by the folding model, but the folding model may be very poor (as recent CASP contests for RNA show...) -- this means that the model may not really be doing what its meant to do. \n\nI realise that this is not the current aim of the paper.

I have its native sequence. The 3D structure predictor I happen to use simply cannot fold the native sequence into the target 3D structure (its a poor predictor). So what will happen if I use the proposed RL finetuning method? Won't the model sort of 'hack' the 3D structure predictor I am using and end up designing something that folds well according to the structure predictor, but may not do so in nature?\n\n- Additionally, and relatedly to the weakness I identified (+ my Q above), can the RL methodology be extended to other oracles? Can you show experiments with, say, secondary structure ensemble properties such as Mean Free Energy, or some other reasonable properties of interest for RNA design? I think that could strengthen the paper and also show the generality of RL finetuning a strong base supervised model.\n\nOther suggestions:\n\n- On contribution claim: \"We identify the limitations of native sequence recovery...\" - I don't think this should be presented as a claim.
