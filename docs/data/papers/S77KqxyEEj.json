Conventional approaches typically rely on dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation pipelines, and highly scalable.

The authors emphasize in the introduction and motivation that DDiF struggles with larger and higher-resolution datasets, yet the experiments in this paper do not substantiate this claim. Specifically, DDiF is evaluated on the ImageNet subset with a resolution of 256×256, while GSDD experiments are limited to 128×128 or even 32×32. To convincingly demonstrate GSDD’s superior generalization, it should at least show improvements on datasets of comparable scale and resolution.\n2. The method section provides extensive background on parametric Gaussian modeling but lacks theoretical justification for why Gaussian functions are inherently more effective than INRs. There is no formal reasoning or analysis showing that 2D Gaussian bases offer intrinsic advantages over other differentiable bases (e.g., wavelet or trigonometric) for gradient matching in dataset distillation. As a result, the choice of Gaussian appears heuristic and engineering-driven rather than grounded in theoretical insight.\n3. The paper does not theoretically formalize the superiority of this representation. Most arguments focus on engineering aspects such as CUDA-based rasterization being faster than neural network querying, rather than proving that sparse explicit primitives are fundamentally more suitable for encoding discriminative knowledge than implicit continuous functions.\n4. The paper lacks sensitivity or ablation studies on key hyperparameters, particularly the number of Gaussian primitives per image and their initialization strategy. Since these parameters critically affect performance, the absence of such analysis makes it difficult to assess the robustness and practical applicability of the method.\n5. The paper claims to evaluate cross-architecture transfer from ConvNet to ResNet and VGG. However, Table 4 only shows the performance of different DD methods on ImageNet subsets and does not present any cross-architecture results, so the claimed generalization across architectures is not supported.\n\n**Minor:**\n\n1.

There is a lack of clear justification for the motivation to apply Gaussian splatting to dataset distillation. I believe the current manuscript focuses more on methodologies for efficiently using Gaussian splatting in Dataset distillation than on unique characteristics of Gaussian splatting compared to existing parameterization methods. The issues of redundancy and computational overhead highlighted by the authors as problems in prior research have already been noted in several previous studies[1,2,3,4]. Specifically, while the paper highlights efficiency concerns regarding time and memory for DDiF[5] (the core baseline adopted in this study), this does not sufficiently justify shifting the framework to Gaussian splatting without improving INR-based parameterization. Therefore, an in-depth analysis is required to present new limitations of existing prior research and demonstrate how Gaussian splatting's inherent characteristics can address these.\n\n2. There is insufficient evidence to support the claim that GSDD achieves higher performance than prior research. The contributions of this study are believed to be the first application of Gaussian splatting in the field of dataset distillation and the enhancement of efficiency through various techniques. While this approach achieves high efficiency in terms of time and memory, the lack of evidence and explanation as to why it outperforms prior research makes it difficult to accept. For instance, DDiF argued that the introduction of INR yields higher expressiveness despite using a smaller budget, through theoretical analysis and reconstruction experiments. Furthermore, experiments with a fixed number of decoded instances supported the notion that DDiF's high performance stems from its high expressiveness and diversity. Similarly, a deeper analysis is required to understand the mechanism through which the proposed idea, GSDD, achieves its high performance.\n\n3. There is no analysis of whether GSDD can be applied across diverse application scenarios and achieve high performance. Parameterization methods effective only in specific application area have limitations in their applicability. Several prior studies report experimental results on corrupted datasets[2,3,5] and cross-resolution[5] to evaluate the out-of-domain generalization of each methods. Furthermore, as the primary baseline DDiF is a unified framework for grid-based data across various modalities, it provided performance comparison results across image, video, audio, and 3D voxel datasets. Demonstrating GSDD's superior performance across diverse application scenarios would significantly enhance the impact and applicability of this research.\n\n[1] A Comprehensive Survey of Dataset Distillation\n\n[2] Frequency Domain-based Dataset Distillation\n\n[3] Sparse Parameterization for Epitomic Dataset Distillation\n\n[4] Generalizing Dataset Distillation via Deep Generative Prior\n\n[5] Distilling Dataset into Neural Field"}, "questions": {"value": "1. I am curious about the performance of Gaussian splatting-based parameterization without applying the various techniques for improving efficiency (Section 3.2). I am also curious about the performance improvement when adding each technique, extending Table 3.\n\n2. I am also curious whether GSDD also demonstrates high performance and efficiency for image datasets with resolutions greater than 128.\n\n3. Recently, research into soft labels has also been actively explored as an alternative to one-hot labels[6,7,8]. While this work defined by one-hot label encoding (Line 98), I would be interested to see the performance of GSDD when soft label is applied\n\n4. Quantization using bf16 directly influences the final image per class calculation (Line 402–408), so it affects diversity and playing a key role in GSDD performance (Table 3). However, this technique is not limited to GSDD and can also be applied to existing parameterization methods. Therefore, I would like to know the performance comparison when quantization is applied to existing parameterization methods.\n\n5. I understood that each Gaussian primitive contributes to a single distilled image. I am curious whether this could be extended to allow a Gaussian primitive to contribute to multiple distilled images. If possible, this could further enhance efficiency.\n\n[6] A Label is Worth A Thousand Images in Dataset Distillation\n\n[7] GIFT: Unlocking Full Potential of Labels in Distilled Dataset at Near-zero Cost\n\n[8] Heavy Labels Out!

Critical Omission of ImageNet-1K: The most significant weakness is the failure to evaluate on full ImageNet-1K.

Recent SOTA methods in scalable DD (e.g., SRe2L, RDED, etc.) all report 1K results. Without this comparison, the central claim of scalability is unsubstantiated. The results on \"ImageNet subsets\"  are insufficient.\n\n2. Confounding Initialization: The initialization procedure  is a major methodological flaw. The model is \"pre-trained\" to match real images via MSE loss. This raises two problems:\n   - Performance Confound: How much of the final SOTA performance is simply due to this high-fidelity, real-data-based \"warm start\" rather than the superiority of the GSDD parameterization within the distillation process?\n   - Privacy Contradiction: This initialization method directly leaks data from the original dataset, which contradicts the paper's (and the field's) stated motivations for privacy preservation. A method that requires fitting to real images cannot be straightforwardly used in privacy-sensitive scenarios.\n\n3. Hyperparameter Complexity: The method introduces a critical new hyperparameter trade-off: the number of Gaussians per image ($M$) vs. the number of Gaussian Images Per Class (GPC).
