What is the computational architecture of this multi-layer computing machinery? This problem is certainly worth investigating and is interesting to many researchers in cognitive science \\& neuroscience on the one hand and computer science \\& engineering on the other.  The present paper tackles this problem from a new perspective—namely, starting from the visual phenomenon of seeing blind spots as afterimages, to determining the neural locus of afterimages, to conceptualizing afterimages as visual short-term memory, and finally to formulating a computational architecture of the brain. First, presently, all the textbooks in vision science and perceptual psychology do introduce afterimages but also ubiquitously assume them as due to some peripheral adaptation mechanisms occurring in the retina of the eye; here, the long-forgotten phenomenon of seeing blind spots as afterimages is revived and is used as an \"instantia crucis\" to demonstrate the cortical origin of afterimages.  Second, correlating this phenomenon with the neuroanatomical fact that the blind spot is represented within V1-L4 (i.e., Layer 4 in the visual cortical area V1), it is deduced that V1-L4 is the neural site for afterimages. Third, it is further deduced that the overall computational architecture of the brain is as follows: In each visual cortical area, the superficial layers (i.e., L2\\&3) constitute a feedforward neural network for transforming information from one level to the next, the deep layers (i.e., L5\\&6) constitute a feedback one for the reverse transform, and the middle layer (i.e., L4) serves as short-term memory.  Finally, it is discussed how the computational architecture of the human brain conceptualized in this manner may help foster interdisciplinary interactions towards a more complete understanding of the human brain.", "tldr": "This paper utilizes the visual phenomenon of seeing the physiological blind spot as an afterimage to locate the neural site for visual short-term memory and to formulate a computational architecture of the human brain.", "keywords": ["Short-Term Memory", "Primary Visual Cortex", "V1-L4", "Computational Architecture", "Human Brain", "Color Sensation", "Visual Consciousness"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d44a8bc8475dc4895c64e66f6dfe363122861e4a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, the authors focus on the problem of the case of afterimages in humans.

The question is whether this phenomenon can inspire or at least influence the design of AI systems. The authors focus in particular on the issue of what might be the retinal or cortical origin of such afterimages. The classical view is retinal; the authors argue it is cortical. That is to say, the classical view attributes afterimages to bleaching, or saturation, of the photoreceptors in the retina. This would be relatively uninteresting for neuroAI. The authors contrast this classical view by supporting a cortical circuit origin for afterimages, based on (semi)technical arguments about positive vs. negative contrast afterimages. \n\nThe paper is a beautifully written review of the debate about origins and, I must state, included several facts of historical significance with which I was unfamiliar. For example, I was familiar with Newton's\nwork on color but not his work on afterimages. And I was surprised that Helmholtz did not figure more prominently in the review. Finally, relating it to Purkinjee images, etc., was interesting. \n\nThe main concern is the paper's methodology: it is basically just historical review. \nUnfortunately the only vague connection to modeling and representation occurs at the very end, and is not nearly concrete enough to readily influence the neuroAI community or to inform representations for deep networks.\n\nI think this paper would be a welcome addition to the literature on the history of visual perception,\nand maybe philosophical topics connected to it. There are several journals dedicated to this, and many of the citations are to papers in those journals. While of possible philosophical relevance to the study of representations, however, it is only weakly connected."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "The heart of the paper is about the retinal blindspot and the origins of perceptual afterimages. The strength of the paper is the depth of\nits historical synthesis. The debate about the locus of afterimages -- retinal or cortical -- is classical, with several hundred years of\nparticipation. The question of positive vs negative afterimages, and their relationship, was fascinating; this is mainly where the original content lies. \n\nI agree with the author that selective visual phenomena should have an influence of whether neuroAI is succeeding, but the question is actually which phenomena and how they relate. For comparison, the current MICrONS project has produced a  \"digital twin\" for the mouse's visual system, with the hope that experiments can be performed \"in silico\" rather than \"in vivo.\" For a general discussion, see https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/04/digital-twin.html. The current paper is, in a sense, a call for a weaker version of this. Technically what is required is some sort of a map from the model to the biology. It is here that the author's contribution could be most relevant, but see the discussion of Weaknesses below. I recall the old question: \"should robots have visual illusions?\" The current paper makes the case that the answer is yes, and that afterimages are an exemplar."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The main weakness of the paper is the (lack of a proposed) model: it basically consists of a rough diagram (their Fig. 5). For the paper to be relevant to ICLR, it should have a serious mechanistic component, in the sense that it could (i) guide analysis; (ii) guide other researchers to consider implementing it; (iii) stimulate other researchers to check for afterimage phenomena in existing computational models of visual systems; or (iv) stimulate other researchers to build new models that might exhibit afterimage phenomena. In its current form, the paper is  too philosophical and not sufficiently computational.\n\nIn particular, the (model) diagram only vaguely captures of connectomics of V1, leaving out the many feedback pathways (e.g. long-range horizontal connections in layer 2/3) thought to be responsible for the various \"filling in\" phenomena. See e.g. Lateral connectivity and contextual interactions in macaque primary visual cortex, DD Stettler, A Das, J Bennett, CD Gilbert - Neuron, 2002 and references therein.  Furthermore, there is no connection to the timing of feedback, e.g. from highter visual areas or the V1 --> dLGN --> V1 cycle, or any of the other area-based cycles. I suspect that the authors are aware of much of this physiology and anatomy and it would be great to read a more detailed version of their thoughts on how, and which aspects of, this circuitry could be relevant for their conjectures."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Is it possible to develop the diagram in Fig. 5 into more of a computational model? What would be the cell types in the different layers, and their connections, necessary to support positive and negative afterimages?\n\n2.

Would the authors predict (from the putative model in 2) whether an afterimage in the shape of, say, the Muller-Lyer illusion, would still exhibit the illusion? \n\n4. Is there a time dimension of interest? For example, saturated photoreceptors might take longer to return to normal than cortical circuitry would take to \"recompute\" an afterimage.\n\n5.
