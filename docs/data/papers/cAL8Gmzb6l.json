While machine learning (ML) models have proven to be effective for this task, the limited interpretability restricts their applicability in trust-critical domains. In this paper, we develop two interpretable ML models to predict whether a candidate constant should fill the empty cell of an incomplete row by learning Datalog rules describing chain-like patterns of relations. Both models are *fully interpretable with formal guarantees*: we provide algorithms that take a model instance and extract an *equivalent* set of rules, in the sense that both the model and the rules produce the same output for any input table over a fixed relation schema. Furthermore, our models utilize different aggregation strategies to offer distinct trade-offs regarding expressive power and ease of rule extraction. Evaluations reveal that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance on tabular data cell completion with superior interpretability.", "tldr": "We propose fully interpretable models for tabular data cell completion, accompanied by rule extraction algorithms.

The primary contribution is that both models are fully interpretable and include faithful rule extraction algorithms.

Strong Formal Guarantees: The paper's most salient strength is its formal commitment to faithfulness. The authors do not merely claim interpretability; they formally prove via Theorems 4.4 and 5.2 that the extracted Datalog rule sets produce the exact same output as the models themselves (MC and MC-max) on any given input.\n2. Clear Model Design and Trade-offs: The paper designs two models with clear semantics. The MC model uses sum aggregation, corresponding logically to counting the number of matching paths. The MC-max model uses max aggregation, corresponding to detecting the existence of the strongest path.\n3. Excellent Empirical Performance: The experimental section is convincing. The MC and MC-max models achieve SOTA results on multiple key metrics across several tabular and binary relation datasets. They not only surpass specialized GNN baselines but also significantly outperform strong LLM baselines. This demonstrates that the models achieve interpretability without sacrificing predictive performance."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Scalability of Global Faithfulness for MC Model: Despite the formal guarantee (Theorem 4.4), the global rule extraction algorithm for the MC model (Algorithm 1) has a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(C^{\\delta^{L}\\nu^{2L}})$. This complexity is doubly exponential in both the path length $L$ and the maximum table arity $\\nu$. This implies that for database schemas of moderate complexity (e.g., slightly more tables or longer dependency chains), extracting the complete, equivalent Datalog program is computationally infeasible. Although database-specific extraction (Algorithm 3) is feasible, this limitation diminishes the practical significance of the MC model's \"global faithfulness\".\n2. Rigid Dependence of Model Architecture on Database Schema: The dimension $K$ of the model's parameter tensor $b^{h,t}$ depends on all predicates (tables) and their arities (column counts) in the database. This means the model architecture is hard-bound to a specific database schema. If a new table (new predicate) is added to the database, or if the arity of an existing table changes, the entire model must be redesigned and retrained. This limits the model's applicability in dynamic database environments."}, "questions": {"value": "Handling of Multiple Missing Values (Appendix F): The method in Appendix F for handling multiple missing values involves creating a separate auxiliary fact for each missing value and filling other missing positions with a special constant $c_0$.
