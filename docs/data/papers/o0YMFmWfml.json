Cellular subpopulations may shift from cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular, posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE (Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology. First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding challenge in computational biology.", "tldr": "MODE (Mixture Of Dynamical Experts): a graphical modeling framework which decomposes complex dynamics into interpretable components, enabling the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and long-term forecasting across regime transitions.", "keywords": ["dynamical systems", "mixture of experts", "interpretable machine learning", "clustering", "time series forecasting", "systems biology", "single cell RNA sequencing"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0e8222ab9896d32910b5e41c7ca80f86cefe7ec4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/cf818c0d7a4899e9d4ddccd64dddf68d9352e652.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a unified perspective to address key limitations of existing methods for modelling complex mixtures of overlapping behavioural regimes: the inability of flow-based models to handle branching dynamics, the computational complexity of switching system inference, and the lack of interpretability in many neural approaches.

A priori $K$ selection: The most critical limitation of this work is that the number of experts, $K$, must be manually specified corresponding to the number of dynamic regimes. This is impractical for real-world discovery tasks where $K$ is a primary unknown.\n2. The paper's solution to trajectory crossing (a known failure of NODEs) is clear. It would be strengthened by contrasting its discrete mixture-based approach with continuous, augmentation-based methods like ANODE [1].\n3. Gradient-based optimisation of the gating network is a known challenge (see MixER [2]). The paper's regularization solution (Eq. 4) to prevent the gating network from collapsing is interesting. It could be compared to other methods, such as the K-Means initialization used in MixER.\n4. A claim in L297-298 that MODE \"does not rely on phase space geometry\" appears to contradict the model's formulation, which explicitly uses the state $x$ (the geometry) to parameterize both the gating function $\\pi(x)$ and the expert dynamics $f_{\\Theta_{s}}(x)$.

Also, the problem statement (Consequently, a large body of research at the intersection of computational biology and data-driven dynamical systems has been devoted to the modeling of snapshot data.

It is unclear whether the x-axis in Figure 1 represents time. The visualization appears to suggest that blue cells evolve into red and green cells over time. In the overlapped region (left panel), do the red and green cells physically interact, or does their spatial overlap simply obscure individual dynamics? I would appreciate further clarification on how overlapping dynamical regimes introduce modeling challenges and whether this overlap is a visualization artifact or a true physical mixture.\n\n- Is the research problem novel? The general problem of learning systems governed by multiple, switching, and partially unknown dynamics has been extensively studied in the literature (e.g., Graph Switching Dynamical Systems, ICML 2023). It is not fully clear what unique challenge this paper addresses beyond existing frameworks for switching or hybrid dynamical systems.\n\n- Is MODE technically novel? The MODE framework appears conceptually similar to standard mixture-of-experts models with sparse MAP estimation. The objective in Equation (3) essentially corresponds to a weighted MAP formulation, and the comparison baselines (GMM, supervised MLP, NODE) are arguably too weak or mismatched for a fair assessment. It would strengthen the paper to demonstrate MODE’s advantage over stronger baselines explicitly designed for switching or compositional dynamics.\n\n- Motivational gap regarding branching systems. The paper motivates MODE by emphasizing that biological systems may bifurcate into multiple branches. However, it is not clear why existing models could not be independently trained for each branch (e.g., fitting separate NODEs for red and green trajectories). If MODE’s advantage lies in discovering branches without supervision, this distinction should be emphasized more clearly.\n\n- How do we know how many experts will be required? The number of experts (K) seems to correspond to the number of distinct dynamical regimes, which in practice may require prior domain knowledge. It remains unclear how MODE performs when K is misspecified or when the true number of regimes is unknown, which could be an important consideration for real-world biological applications.\n\n- In Line 185, the authors assume that each sample is governed by one expert, implying no interaction across regimes. If that assumption holds, why not simply learn from data after regime transitions are completed, rather than during overlap? Clarifying this design choice would help justify the need for mixture modeling during ambiguous transitions.\n\n- Equation (4) introduces pi_s(x) as the expert assignment distribution, but it is unclear how this distribution behaves in practice.
