From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10\\%–45\\%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["model-based reinforcement learning", "online learning", "reinforcement learning"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/14e99ee23a6feda519d314f241e1e057bfb19ea1.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a40f10d4e1119c035f313c38f3aba9b8b6b0638b.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper adds an \"event-aware\" layer to world models so that agents learn from meaningful changes (events) rather than raw frames alone.

(1): the image intensity $I_t$ is not explicitly introduced in the text.\n  - Line 151: \"direction of the event\" is unclear, does this mean the sign of the brightness change?\n  - For ordinal data, the event is defined as $p_i$. For consistency with visual data it should likely be a tuple e_{t,i}.\n  - Eq. (2): $\\Delta o_i$ is not defined.\n  - This carries into Eqs. (3)-(4): wwhat exactly are the events $e$? In places it seems $p$ might be intended instead of $e$.\n- Discrepancies in Figure 3 vs. Eq. (3):\n  - The sequence model is labeled $F_\\theta$ in the figure but $f_\\theta$ in the equation.\n  - In Eq. (3), the representation model is conditioned on $y_t$, in the figure it is conditioned on $h_t$.\n  - In Eq. (3), the event predictor conditions on $y_{t-1}, y_t$, in the figure it appears to use $y_t, y_{t+1}$.\n  - Why is the observation predictor categorized under \"EA\" rather than \"WM\"?\n- The sentence \"We employ Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models to automatically detect such events from video\" needs concrete detail. What features are modeled, how thresholds are chosen/updated, and how detections map to the event tuple. This is central to the method but currently vague.\n- The description of the Geneirc Event Segmentor is hard to follow:\n  - How is $\\alpha_t$ computed exactly, do indices $i$ range over pixels or batches? This should be made precise.\n  - Line 272: please define \"event boundaries.\"\n  - The role of GES (as a weighting coefficient for the event/observation losses) emerges only from the equations. The text says \"reallocate attention\" but should explicitly tie to Eqs. (7)-(8).\n  - The function $g$ in Eq. (6) appears without explanation in the main text, only the appendix clarifies it.\n  - From Eq. (6), GES seems independent of $\\theta$. If it has no learned parameters, why is it part of the world model rather than a fixed weighting step?\n- Reported scores show discrepancies vs prior work:\n  - DreamerV3 numbers on Atari 100K are lower than the original paper (mean 1.15 reported here vs 1.25), which makes the gap to EADream's 1.29 smaller than suggested. Please clarify whether these were re-runs and why they differ.\n  - For Simulus, the reported mean and median (1.61 and 0.74) differ from the Simulus paper (1.65 and 0.98). Please explain the deviation.\n- Ablations are unclear:\n  - \"No Event Predictor\": What exactly is disabled? If event prediction is off, shoudn't the model reduce to the original world model? Why do \"EADream w/o Event Predictor\" and DreamerV3 differ? Is this related to the RSSM-OP change, but if so, why is there the same effect for Simulus?\n  - \"No GES\": If GES is off, is $\\omega$ also set to $0$? If so, consider an additional ablation where GES is on but $\\omega = 0$ to disentangle effects.\n  - \"Without Observation Prediction\": RSSM-OP seems to matter a lot. An ablation \"Dreamer + RSSM-OP\" would isolate its contribution.\n- Minor: Missing citations to Craftax and DMC in Section 4.1.\n\nI'm willing to raise my score if the presentation is improved and these points are addressed, as the method and results look very promising.
