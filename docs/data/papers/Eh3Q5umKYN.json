However, strong autocorrelation often limits the detection power of existing algorithms and increases the risk of false positives. Moreover, when both lagged and contemporaneous links are considered, existing algorithms are prone to generating false positives in lagged link detection due to indirect causal effects induced by contemporaneous mediators. To address these challenges, the Adaptive Momentary Conditional Independence (aMCI) method is introduced to mitigate the masking effects of autocorrelation and maintain control over false discovery rates. The aMCI adaptively modifies the conditioning set while aggregating conclusions from multiple conditional independence tests. In addition, a multi-phase algorithm is proposed to robustly learn the causal graph by effectively applying the aMCI. The algorithm is designed to be hyperparameter-insensitive, order-independent, and provably consistent under oracle conditions. Extensive evaluations on simulated and benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially improves the accuracy of causal discovery from time series, especially in detecting lagged links.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Causal Discovery", "Time Series", "Autocorrelation", "Conditional Independence Tests", "Momentary Conditional Independence", "PC-algorithm"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2c7d995888edbd421cf25d9239d2ac6bdab8cf43.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/2a4202a9a8bc9066cd06e4d53e0617250748f4c3.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper aims at two challenges in time-series causal discovery: i) autocorrelation, and ii) contemporaneous effect.

The core idea is that conditioning on highly autocorrelated recent lags can suppress genuine causal signals; thus, aMCI adaptively substitutes such immediate predecessors with earlier lags to improve detectability. Integrated into the PCMCI+ framework, this yields ECD-aMCI, an algorithm that retains PCMCI+’s structure but modifies the conditioning step to preserve causal signal strength. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for consistency, order independence, and enhanced accuracy, and demonstrate empirical gains over PCMCI+, Bagged-PCMCI+, and NTS-NOTEARS on linear, nonlinear, and fMRI datasets, particularly in high-autocorrelation regimes.

The simple bivariate example in Section 3.1 provides a clear illustration of the exact problem the paper aims to solve."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The ECD-aMCI algorithm closely follows the PCMCI+ pipeline in both design and implementation. The independence tests, search phases, and orientation rules are entirely retained, and the only substantive modification is the adaptive adjustment of the conditioning set before each conditional independence test. While this modification is intuitively appealing and theoretically supported, it represents a localized heuristic improvement rather than a new causal discovery framework. Consequently, the contribution resides primarily at the implementation level within the PCMCI+ structure rather than at the algorithmic or theoretical level.\n- The evaluation on both stationary and non-stationary datasets is presented in a somewhat inconsistent and incomplete manner. While the authors include additional experiments on non-stationary data in Appendix C.3, these results are not integrated into the main text and are reported briefly, with limited quantitative interpretation. Moreover, the main body of the paper explicitly states that “only stationary models are considered” in the simulated data generation section, which is misleading; it is unclear whether this statement refers to the dataset itself or to the earlier stationarity assumption of the causal model. If it refers to the assumption, it should not appear in the data-generation description; if it refers to the dataset, then the inclusion of non-stationary experiments in the appendix contradicts that claim.\n- The synthetic evaluation is also suboptimal in several respects. The nonlinear dataset generation described in the paper includes nonlinear transformations in equation form but omits realistic temporal characteristics such as trend or seasonality, which are ubiquitous in real-world time series. When visualized, the generated “nonlinear” time series exhibit no discernible non-stationary behavior or long-term structural variation, appearing qualitatively similar to linear autoregressive data. As a result, the nonlinear experiments test only pointwise nonlinearity rather than temporal non-stationarity, limiting the conclusions about robustness under realistic dynamics.\n- The current choice of baselines (PCMCI+, Bagged-PCMCI+, and NTS-NOTEARS) does not sufficiently represent the state of the art in time-series causal discovery. The inclusion of Bagged-PCMCI+ is redundant, as it is simply a resampled ensemble variant of PCMCI+ that does not introduce a distinct methodological perspective. Instead, the evaluation should have incorporated modern approaches that provide complementary algorithmic principles or neural Granger-like approaches. Furthermore, at least one Granger-based causal discovery baseline, such as Neural Granger Causality (Tank et al., 2021 ) (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/34/9812931/09376668.pdf ) or SPACETIME (Mameche et al., 2025)(https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/34136/36291 ) should have been included for completeness. Although Granger causality does not represent true structural causality under intervention semantics, it remains increasingly popular in applied time-series domains (finance, neuroscience, climate modeling) and provides a practical reference for temporal dependency detection. The absence of such baselines narrows the comparative context and underrepresents how ECD-aMCI performs relative to recent state-of-the-art causal discovery methods.\n- The theoretical component of the paper largely extends existing PCMCI+ results to the adaptive setting. The proofs for consistency and order independence closely parallel those of the original framework, while the “enhanced accuracy” theorem formalizes an intuitively expected improvement in test power rather than establishing a new theoretical guarantee. There is no formal quantification of how much adaptive conditioning improves causal recovery beyond qualitative reasoning about signal-to-noise ratios. As a result, the theoretical novelty is incremental, and the contribution remains primarily empirical."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
