Here, we succinctly summarize the novelty and contributions of this work and then list the main revisions implemented in the manuscript. \n\n**Point 1: the novelty and contributions of this work**\n\n(1) A Novel Fusion Framework. RLNO represents a novel approach grounded in VAE framework, incorporating an RNN-based encoder, latent neural operator and a decoder. This framework effectively harnesses the strengths of RNNs and neural operators, enabling more accurate operator learning. Specifically, the core idea of the proposed framework is to uncover the underlying low-dimensional manifold structure in observed data through latent space transformations. On this basis, the dynamical laws on this manifold can be learned in the latent space, and subsequently operator modeling can be achieved through a decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach can more efficiently model a family of dynamical systems and achieve operator learning.\n\n(2) Utilizing More Dynamic Information. The proposed OPERATOR-RNN encoder extracts and leverages more domain-specific information and dynamic evolution patterns from the sequential observational data in new domains. It remains applicable under non-uniform sampling conditions, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of the RLNO method. Specifically, current neural operator methods, including DeepONet and FNO, often only input the sampled functions (such as parameter functions, initial or boundary conditions) when tested in new domains. However, in many practical applications, there may exist prior observational data at several moments in this new domain, which is often overlooked in previous methods. Our research finds that fully leveraging these prior observational states has a very significant effect on promoting the robustness and accuracy of neural operator modeling. This benefit arises from domain-specific observations, which not only provide more state information but also extract specific dynamic information from these sequential observations. \n\n(3) Efficiency and Scalability. RLNO inherits the low computational costs of neural operators, significantly outperforming RNN and Neural ODE-based methods. And it can select a smaller latent space dimension, which reduces learning complexity and data requirements, enabling easier extension to high-dimensional complex systems. In addition, the framework presented in this study is general and flexible, and can be extended to other neural frameworks such as diffusion models, neural ordinary differential equations, and graph neural networks. This adaptability enables more robust and accurate dynamical predictions by effectively leveraging sparse observational data in new domains.\n\nFinally, we select a total of five systems for experimental validation, encompassing a synthetic dataset with periodic orbits of varying frequencies; two 1D PDE systems: the Diffusion-Reaction equation and the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation; as well as two 2D PDE systems: the Navier–Stokes equations and Rayleigh–Bénard convection. Additionally, we select 8 baseline methods (including approaches based on RNNs, classical neural ODEs, classical neural operators and latent neural operators), and conducted 4 ablation studies to affirm the significant contribution of each component in our methodology. To enhance the reliability and reproducibility of our experimental results, we also provide all the experiment codes in the supplementary materials. \n\n\n**Point 2: the main revisions implemented in the manuscript**\n\n(1) We supplement the Key Notation table in Appendix A.2 to enhance the clarity and readability of the article. \n\n(2) We meticulously review the entire text and tone down overly strong claims. Examples include the conclusion of the second paragraph in the Introduction section and the second paragraph of Section 4.1.\n\n(3) We refine the statement of Theorem 1 and carefully verify its proof in Appendix A.3. Furthermore, we supplement the corresponding discussions following the proof.\n\n(4) In Section 4.3, we further elaborate on the complex nature of the 2D Navier–Stokes and Rayleigh–Bénard PDE systems, thereby demonstrating that the selected experimental systems can be used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n(5) We supplement several references on “latent flow approaches” in the introduction section.\n\n(6) We carefully review the technical details in the paper to enhance readability. This includes supplementing and refining the notation explanations for Eqs.
