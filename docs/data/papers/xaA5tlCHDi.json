Recent studies leverage the hidden state of the target model to enhance draft model prediction accuracy. However, existing methods suffer from the degrading quality of draft token predictions at later positions, due to error accumulation in draft model generated features. In this paper, we propose Position Specialists (PosS), which consist of multiple position-specialized draft layers to generate tokens at assigned position(s). Position specialists greatly improve token acceptance rate at later positions per drafting round, as each specialist only needs to focus on handling a certain level of draft model feature deviation.

This makes it impossible to determine if the benefits come from \"specialization\" or simply from increased model capacity.\n2. High Deployment Complexity: Maintaining independent KV-Caches for each specialist and switching between them introduces significant overhead. This complexity poses challenges for deployment, especially within modern serving frameworks.\n3. Unfavorable Cost-Benefit Ratio: The performance gains are often marginal and inconsistent, as seen in Table-2, the L2-13B model, where PosS (3.34x) offers negligible improvement over HASS (3.33x).

The performance gain achieved by the proposed method is difficult to solely attribute to the \"Position Specialists\" architecture, as opposed to the \"HASS-like\" recursive feature alignment training strategy (which PoSS utilizes).

This small margin suggests that the performance lift might primarily stem from the training approach common to both HASS and PosS.\n\n2.

A critical experiment would involve training the EAGLE-3 architecture (i.e., the single draft layer) using the same training data and total steps as PosS-3(E3), but without the position specialists. Comparing this result directly against PosS-3(E3) would clearly indicate the incremental value of the PoSS architecture itself. If you solve this core problem, I'm willing to raise my score.\n\n- How is the Key-Value (KV) cache managed under the PoSS framework? Since different specialist layers  are used to predict tokens at different positions, the features generated by these layers are distinct. This prevents the standard sharing and reusing of KV caches that is typical in single-model decoding. Could the authors quantify the potential overhead introduced by managing non-shared KV caches and discuss whether this processing time significantly impacts the overall speedup?\n\n- The authors should provide performance results using industry-standard, high-performance serving frameworks such as vllm or sglang.

Compared to a single draft model, POSS requires training and storing multiple specialist models. While the paper argues in Appendix C that the inference-time memory overhead is acceptable (approx. 218M per specialist), the training process becomes more complex (e.g., requiring initialization from a pre-trained EAGLE model and subsequent staged training). It would strengthen the paper to briefly discuss this trade-off and its impact on training time and computational resources.\n3.

We have revised the paper to address the comments. To summarize our major updates and new experiments:\n\n* **Deployment on vLLM** (response to **dNHR & udoP**): We integrated PosS into vLLM. On Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, PosS-3 consistently outperforms EAGLE-3. At batch size of 4, PosS-3 achieves a speedup of 2.07x, 26.2% faster than EAGLE-3.\n* **Comparison with Gumiho** (response to **dNHR**): We compared PosS with Gumiho, a relevant method with layer specialization. Across different experiment settings, PosS outperforms Gumiho in overall speedup ratio and stability.\n* **Dynamic layer allocation, including MoE** (response to **ATMa & udoP**): We explored the way to dynamically allocate layers for PosS. The failure of MoE-based allocation proves the necessity of layer specialization. Takeaway: layers have to be called in sequential order, but the number of positions assigned to each layer is flexible.\n* **Ablation on training strategy** (EAGLE-3 + HASS, response to **dNHR**): We experimented with different training strategies. Comparison of PosS-3(E3), EAGLE-3, and EAGLE-3 + HASS demonstrates that PosS mainly benefits from its sequential layer specialization."}}, "id": "KMSodsCIGX", "forum": "xaA5tlCHDi", "replyto": "xaA5tlCHDi", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13914/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13914/Authors"], "number": 7, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13914/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763706929538, "cdate": 1763706929538, "tmdate": 1763706929538, "mdate": 1763706929538, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
