Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated commonsense knowledge and social intelligence, a natural question arises: Can LLMs be used to model the dynamics of social beliefs following social events? Addressing this problem can deepen our understanding of community dynamics and inform better decision-making in the real world. In this work, we introduce the Social World Model (SocialWM) concept, a general framework designed to capture how social beliefs evolve in response to major events. SocialWM learns state-transition functions for social beliefs by mining temporal patterns in social data and optimizing the evidence lower bound, without the need for explicit causal annotations that link events to belief shifts or expensive census data. To evaluate SocialWM's effectiveness in predicting social belief transitions, we introduce a benchmark, SocialWM-bench, derived from real-world Polymarket data. SocialWM-bench includes over 300,000 data samples for social belief prediction tasks spanning diverse domains such as politics, sports, cryptocurrency, and elections. Our experimental results show that SocialWM significantly outperforms traditional time-series models, achieving a 21.56% reduction in RMSE while offering interpretable insights into the underlying mechanisms of social belief dynamics.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["world model", "social learning", "large language model"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6cfa7d55e4f9186502ba2249eaaef0e79c5caa2b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces the Social World Model (SWM), a novel LLM-based framework designed to model and predict the evolution of social beliefs over time in response to significant social events. The central idea is to treat social beliefs as states and social events as actions within a temporal world model, analogous to world models in reinforcement learning, but grounded in collective human opinion rather than physical environments. The model explicitly decouples social reasoning and belief transition, leveraging a posterior-guided reasoner (powered by GPT-4o) and an LLM-based transition model trained via ELBO optimization. To evaluate SWM, the authors construct SWM-Bench, a large-scale benchmark derived from over 300,000 samples of real-world Polymarket prediction market data across domains like politics, crypto, and sports.

However, this claim is not sufficiently supported. The argument would benefit from a clearer explanation of why financially motivated trading behavior better reflects social beliefs than alternative data sources like surveys or social media.\n\nPotential bias and groupthink in Polymarket data\nThe use of Polymarket as the primary dataset introduces the risk of collective biases. Markets often exhibit herd behavior, social reinforcement, or correlated trading patterns. These dynamics may distort the very opinion signals that SWM aims to model. The paper does not discuss how such effects are mitigated or how they might affect model reliability.\n\nLimited comparison to other reasoning-based forecasting methods\nThe paper primarily compares SWM against time-series models and simple LLM baselines, but not against retrieval-augmented or reasoning-based approaches. This omission makes it difficult to evaluate how SWM performs relative to more advanced forecasting frameworks.\n\nGeneralization limited to a single data source\nThe evaluation is confined to Polymarket data.
