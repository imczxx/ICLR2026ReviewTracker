However, the framework suffers from severe policy redundancy in the processes of policy generation and policy population construction, thereby leading to a substantial increase in computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Sparse PSRO, a novel framework that overcomes policy redundancy through two key innovations: (1) Sparsity Metric, which quantifies the dissimilarity between candidate strategies and existing populations via convex combination residual constraints, guiding the algorithm to explore underrepresented payoff regions while suppressing redundant policy generation; (2) Policy Space Sparsification, which constructs the Policy Hull backbone via intensive early exploration and admits only geometrically distinct strategies through threshold control, effectively reducing the number of policies and lowering computational complexity. Theoretical analysis proves that Sparse PSRO maintains a finite policy population with guaranteed separation distances, preventing exponential population growth while ensuring convergence to the Nash Equilibrium. Experiments across diverse environments (including RGoS, AlphaStar888, Blotto, and Kuhn Poker) demonstrate that Sparse PSRO significantly outperforms six baseline methods in terms of exploitability and policy population size, thus validating its effectiveness in efficiently approximating Nash Equilibrium with reduced computational costs.", "tldr": "This paper proposed Sparse-PSRO with sparsity metric and policy space sparsification, which learns better solution and fast", "keywords": ["Policy Space Response Oracles", "policy sparsity metric", "policy space sparsification", "exploitability"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/472f526d68e842c6a3b4d13a6dd678408efcacf8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/74b3a9baeea34b02e8592fe25f53adb1af4e3b47.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces Sparse PSRO for multi-agent non-transitive games.

The size of the policy pool is insufficient to demonstrate that your approach resolves the issue of redundant policies. Based solely on the policy pool size, sparse PSRO does not exhibit a significant advantage over naive PSRO. Why not conduct a more detailed statistical analysis of the existence and quantity of redundant policies?\n3. This paper does not address how to represent an agent's policy compared to other studies. Is the policy defined as a row in the payoff matrix? Or is it a representation based on state-action distributions and occupancy measures? If a policy is represented by a row in the payoff matrix, how does the diversity measure proposed in this paper differ from the “Response Diversity” measure in “Towards Unifying Behavioral and Response Diversity for Open-ended Learning in Zero-sum Games”?\n4.

The theorems and proofs are strange.\n\nThe first theorem (Theorem 4.1) states that the policy population remains \"finite\" for any t>1. This statement seems silly and vacuous to me -- of course if we add at most 1 policy each iteration, the cardinality of the set of policies will be finite at any iteration. The paper then goes on to say that this theorem avoids \"exponential growth\", which is not the same as finiteness.\n\nThe proof of second theorem (Theorem 4.3) also seems questionable to me. It is stated in the proof that expanding the policy hull reduces population exploitability -- I don't see why this was the case. Intuitively, it seems like expanding the policy hull *doesn't increase population exploitability*, but I don't see why it necessarily reduces it. \n\nAlso, not sure how big of an issue it is, but it is stated that the game is a symmetric zero-sum game. Are we only studying *symmetric* zero-sum games in this work? But the experiments are not all on symmetric games, right? (e.g. Kuhn poker is not symmetric)\n\n2. It's not immediately clear what the x-axis on the empirical results (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 4). I'm assuming that for Sparse-PSRO and Sparsity-PSRO, an \"iteration\" is only when a new policy is actually added to the population. If so, this mismatch between iteration and computation/time is a bit swept under the rug, and it would be nicer if this was mentioned in the paper or if graphs were included with other choices of x-axis as well.\n\n3. I don't understand the main metric (sparsity).\nIt is defined in Equation 6. Crucially, it includes an arithmetic operation on policies: ${\\pi_i - \\Pi^t_i}^\\top$. It's not clear to me how we are supposed to add or subtract policies. The most obvious interpretation is that we are performing vector addition and subtraction where e.g. the pure strategies are the vectors <0,0,0,1>, <0,0,1,0>, <0,1,0,0>, and <1,0,0,0>, and the mixed strategies lie on the simplex between these points. But then I don't see how the methods in the paper differ from normal PSRO/double oracle, in that any novel pure strategy should be equidistant from the existing policy hull induced by a population of pure strategies."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
