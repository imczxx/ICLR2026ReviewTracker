Although recent studies have employed graph structures to model the complex relationships among financial entities, the corresponding models fail to efficiently capture semantically rich edge features across heterogeneous entities, thereby limiting the ability to fuse and align multimodal data such as market indicators, financial events, and heterogeneous graph structure. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Multimodal Edge-Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Transformer with LLM-driven Knowledge Graphs (MEHGT-LKG) for stock trend prediction. Specifically, we first fine-tune a large language model (LLM) by using instruction tuning datasets to design a financial event-centric knowledge extraction agent (FinEX). Subsequently, we encode the structured tuples generated from FinEX into financial event-centric knowledge graphs (FEKGs) and then construct multimodal heterogeneous graphs by incorporating multimodal information. Finally, we design a Multimodal Edge-Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (MEHGT) to fully encode a series of semantically enriched multimodal heterogeneous graphs spanning different time horizons. MEHGT models edge-level features through type-specific encoders and integrates them into both multi-head attention and message propagation, significantly enriching the representation of relational semantics and target nodes. Extensive experimental results and trading simulations on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach beyond other state-of-the-art models.", "tldr": "We present MEHGT-LKG, a multimodal edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph transformer leveraging LLM-driven knowledge graphs to integrate financial events, market indicators, and heterogeneous relations for accurate stock trend prediction.", "keywords": ["Heterogeneous graph model", "Large language model", "Multimodal fusion", "Quantitative investment"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/930009d01e33b450bd1cbbffb6aa8c7353e1486c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/86cbe2d3c9645a853c0d17ce03091e63df1e4f1f.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a study focused on stock trend prediction by constructing and leveraging a heterogeneous knowledge graph centered on financial events.

The paper constructs a financial event-centric knowledge graph based on FinEX, but lacks more detailed descriptions such as statistical information about this knowledge graph. Additionally, if the events extracted by FinEX can be tuples of dual entities or single entities, how are they uniformly stored in the graph database?\n\n2. The paper claims to have constructed a multimodal heterogeneous graph, but the multimodality is only reflected in the multiple sources of information, rather than in the different modalities of node and edge representations in the graph. Moreover, the MEHGT method does not include specialized processing or encoding for different modalities. I believe the authors' claim of multimodality is somewhat far-fetched.\n\n3. When introducing the MEHGT method, the paper proposes explicitly integrating edge features into both the attention computation and message passing processes. However, it lacks necessary explanation for the motivation behind integrating them into both computational processes. Additionally, there is no clear analysis of the individual impact and contribution of integrating edge features into attention computation and message passing on the overall performance.\n\n4. The performance comparison experiments in the paper were conducted on specific stocks, rather than evaluating the overall performance on a large number of stocks across market sectors. What is the reason for this? Why were these particular stocks selected as evaluation targets? Can evaluations on specific stocks represent the model's high predictive performance on other stocks?\n\n5. In the experimental section, the MEHGT method achieved significant performance improvements on some datasets, but it did not show performance gains on datasets such as EVE and Sungrow. The reasons for these performance differences across datasets were not clearly analyzed.\n\n6. The method proposed in the paper integrates edge information into the graph transformer, which appears to be a general approach for the representation of heterogeneous graphs. However, the text lacks a strong connection between the design of this method and the task of stock architecture trends, or it lacks an analysis of the transferability of this method in other domains.\n\n7.

The novelty of the proposed method seems to be limited, as the proposed method lacks technical contribution. Exploiting LLMs to construct financial event/knowledge graphs for financial investigation has been largely studied by existing works [1, 2, 3]. Moreover, the proposed information fusion mechanism is also similar to the work in the edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph Transformer. All these mechanisms resemble existing works and do not introduce principled advances in LLM-based stock prediction or heterogeneous graphs.\n2. I am very concerned about the process of LLM instruction tuning, as this paper missed so many details for this stage. For example, how is the instruction dataset constructed? Where do the news articles and triplets used as supervision signals come from? What is the dataset’s scale? Are all samples generated by GPT-4 or partially collected from external sources? How do the authors ensure the correctness and reliability of the generated content by LLMs? These details are critical for assessing the soundness and fairness of the instruction-tuning process.\n3. The baselines, especially the time series modeling methods, are extremely outdated. More recent baselines should be compared to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n4. Many figures, such as Figure 5 and Figure 7, are difficult to interpret. It is unclear what specific insights or advantages these visualizations provide.\n5.
