However, once suitable fragments are identified, assembling these fragments into a high affinity drug with desirable pharmacological properties is difficult. This \"molecule assembly\" task is particularly challenging because, initially, fragment positions are known only approximately, and the combinatorial space of potential connectivities is extremely large. Even if the individual fragments form favorable interactions with regions of the pocket, a poor assembly of these fragments can drastically compromise the molecule's druglikeness and hinder its binding affinity. In this paper, we present EdGr, a new graph diffusion framework tailored for the molecule assembly task. EdGr can handle both fragments and atoms, and predicted candidate edge likelihoods influence node position updates during the diffusion denoising process, allowing connectivity cues to guide spatial movements, and vice versa. EdGr substantially outperforms previous methods on the molecule assembly task and stays robust even as confidence in fragment placement decreases.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["graph completion", "diffusion models", "molecule assembly", "ligand design", "graph neural network"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/001f67c47bacc9db883d140490410b894e14d439.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces EdGr, a graph diffusion framework designed for the \"molecule assembly\" task.

One never starts with knowledge of all the fragments of the final molecule. Success on the task of this paper provides no evidence that the model can be useful for FBDD.\n2. The model treats fragments as rigid bodies, using the Kabsch algorithm (Section 3.4) to enforce this during inference.

Therefore, the practical applicability of the proposed task formulation is unclear.\n\n- The core techniques appear to be standard/not novel.

The main contribution lies in framing these components for the “molecule assembly” problem, but the novelty in terms of algorithmic design is limited. Furthermore, since the practicality of the problem setting itself is questionable, the overall impact of the work is diminished.\n\n- The model treats each fragment as a rigid body that can only undergo global translation and rotation. In real molecular systems, fragments can deform or exhibit internal flexibility when binding to a protein pocket. This rigid-body assumption may make the results unrealistic for true molecular design tasks. It would be helpful to discuss whether intra-fragment flexibility could be incorporated or whether the method’s performance degrades if fragments deviate from rigidity.\n\n- he paper does not evaluate or enforce the chemical validity of the assembled molecules.
