Clarity and presentation issues (Major revision is required). The manuscript requires substantial editing for clarity and professional presentation. These issues suggest the work was not thoroughly proofread or revised before submission. The overall writing quality is poor, which significantly hinders readability. There are numerous basic formatting errors throughout the text. Examples include incorrect citation formats throughout, visible artifacts (e.g., the redundant \"IOU(A)\" label in Figure 1b, the stray question mark in line 308), and suboptimal presentation of data (e.g., poor formatting in Table 3 and Figure 5).\n\n2. Ambiguity in core motivation and problem definition The paper's central argument regarding the \"query collision issue\" is conceptually weak and lacks precise clarity, diminishing the motivation for the proposed solution. The introduction intends to establish a unique issue—the disharmony between track queries and detection queries in the unified decoder. However, the subsequent analysis and discussion often blur this distinction, making the phenomenon appear to be merely a consequence of target occlusion and crowded scenes (i.e., standard MOT challenges) rather than a novel architectural flaw specific to the DETR-MOT design.\n\n3. Technical and robustness limitations of the proposed method. The proposed method exhibits several technical limitations and robustness concerns. First, the query updating mechanism appears insufficient for handling prolonged target occlusion, and the proximity of similar objects introduces a high risk of track query contamination. Second, the system's reliance on explicit motion prediction makes it vulnerable to non-linear or irregular motion trajectories, where the module may introduce more interference than benefit. Finally, the authors' heavy dependence on artificially introduced thresholds during inference significantly compromises the model's generalizability and robustness against diverse, real-world scenarios."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the questions listed in Weaknesses part."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "uJ7TP6xBL2", "forum": "HFUPcRrG7O", "replyto": "HFUPcRrG7O", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4590/Reviewer_GqHZ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4590/Reviewer_GqHZ"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4590/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762611564580, "cdate": 1762611564580, "tmdate": 1762917457917, "mdate": 1762917457917, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses a challenge of multi-object tracking (MOT) in video sequences, particularly concerning query conflicts in existing end-to-end Transformer-based models.
