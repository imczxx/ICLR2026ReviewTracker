The authors prove a scale-independent iteration bound, ensuring that refinement at each level converges in a constant number of steps, and introduce dual-violation augmentation to improve robustness without sacrificing sparsity.

HALO is tailored for 2D optimal transport problems with squared Euclidean cost on regular grids, and both its theoretical guarantees and hierarchical design rely on this structure.

Moreover, while the algorithm performs impressively on the DOTmark benchmark, its evaluation is confined to this dataset, leaving open questions about robustness and generalization to more diverse or real-world applications.\n\nAnother limitation is the dependence on heuristic components such as dual-violation augmentation and Top-K active-set selection, whose performance may vary with parameter choices not deeply analyzed in the paper. The implementation is also technically complex—combining multiscale hierarchy, active-support refinement, and GPU-based PDHG—which could make reproduction or extension challenging for practitioners.
