Despite growing interest in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), contemporary works cannot robustly learn policies in offline settings with poor data coverage and often lack algorithmic tractability. We propose a novel **M**odel-based **C**onservative **P**lanning (MCP) algorithm for offline PbRL, which leverages a general function class and uses a tractable conservative learning framework to improve the policy upon an arbitrary reference policy. We prove that, MCP can compete with the best policy within data coverage when the reference policy is supported by the data. To the best of our knowledge, MCP is the first provably sample-efficient and computationally tractable offline PbRL algorithm under partial data coverage, without requiring known transition dynamics. We further demonstrate that, with certain structural properties in PbRL dynamics, our algorithm can effectively exploit these structures to relax the partial data coverage requirement and improve regret guarantees. We evaluate MCP on a comprehensive suite of human-in-the-loop benchmarks in Meta-World.
