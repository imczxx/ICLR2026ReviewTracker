We introduce \\textbf{SynHING}, a synthetic HIN generation framework that supports both graph learning and explainability research. SynHING constructs synthetic graphs by extracting motifs from reference networks, assembling them through motif-guided composition, and refining them via post-pruning to preserve structural and statistical fidelity. Importantly, SynHING is \\emph{not limited to the extracted motifs}: users can incorporate their own motifs of interest, which the framework integrates seamlessly into the generated graphs. This flexibility enables controlled and reproducible studies across diverse domains. Experiments on IMDB, Recipe, ACM, and DBLP demonstrate that SynHING produces realistic and semantically consistent HINs, while providing a principled testbed for evaluating Heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) and explanation methods.

The method used to construct synthetic datasets in this paper is very similar to and straightforward as that for synthesizing homogeneous graphs. Both are based on motif/node labels and handcrafted rules to compose motifs into large graphs.\nThis work seems to merely replace the motifs of homogeneous graphs with those derived from heterogeneous information networks.  \n\n2. The paper defines \"target node pairs + all valid meta-paths within a user-defined hop count\" as Major Motifs and regards them as \"natural explanatory units\". However, it lacks key qualitative analysis. For example, measuring the extent to which these motifs can recover the predictions of a GNN trained on the original graph. This is critical because it determines whether the synthesized graphs capture the causal structure of the original graph.  \n\n3. Beyond the definition of Major Motifs, the paper also introduces other priors, such as simulating \"Superstars\" to merge subgraphs. Does this approach make the synthesized graphs closer to the distribution of real graphs? If not, extracting motifs from real HINs is of little significance. Has the author considered designing experiments from the perspective of graph isomorphism analysis or frequent subgraph mining? Has the author considered theoretical analysis to demonstrate the necessity of the proposed synthesis method?\n\n4. In the past, synthesizing graph data has relied on researcher-defined motifs. Thus, the \"user-defined motif integration\" mentioned in the paper is not a new concept. Additionally, the paper mentions \"semantic consistency\" multiple times but provides no direct experimental support, there is no direct evidence that the improvement results in Section 5.4 stem from semantic consistency.  \n\nIn summary, although the paper claims that SynHING is the first framework to enable user-defined, motif-aware HIN synthesis, it fails to address key challenges inherent in this task. These challenges include how to extract causal motifs and how to ensure the synthesis of HINs that are consistent with real distributions.

It is unclear what kind of randomness is applied or how it interacts with the added non-target nodes. Figure 1 doesn’t visually distinguish target vs. minor nodes. The “Merge” operation (Section 3.5) is introduced without sufficient theoretical or empirical justification. The motivation behind separating Intra-Cluster Merge and Inter-Cluster Merge is unclear, and their relation to real-world HIN generative processes is not explained. \n\nW3. Experimental design needs to be enhanced. The paper provides no comparison with existing synthetic graph generators (e.g., SBM, GraphWorld, HeteroGraphGAN, etc). Section 5.1 doesn’t have a clear purpose. The results in Figure 4 only show how Macro-F1 varies with parameters 𝑝 and 𝑞, but it is not clear what scientific insight this provides or how it validates the method. The visualizations in Figure 4 (c-e) could be improved. Fidelity is used as a proxy for explainability quality, but no actual explainer or motif-label ground truth is evaluated.
