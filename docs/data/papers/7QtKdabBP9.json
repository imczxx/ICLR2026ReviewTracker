The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation spaces relies on an exhaustive $\\Omega(n^2)$ pairwise comparison, inducing a dense representation that is impractical for large-scale permutations. To break this barrier, we introduce a novel framework for generating efficient permutation representations via kernel functions derived from sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as a special instance derived from enumeration sort. Further, we introduce the \\textbf{Merge Kernel} , which leverages the divide-and-conquer structure of merge sort to produce a compact, $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity with no information loss and effectively capture permutation structure. Our central thesis is that the Merge Kernel performs competitively with the Mallows kernel in low-dimensional settings, but significantly outperforms it in both optimization performance and computational efficiency as the dimension $n$ grows. Extensive evaluations on various permutation optimization benchmarks confirm our hypothesis, demonstrating that the Merge Kernel provides a scalable and more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional permutation spaces, thereby unlocking the potential for tackling previously intractable problems such as large-scale feature ordering and combinatorial neural architecture search.", "tldr": "Our Merge Kernel, derived from merge sort, creates scalable permutation kernels with O(nlogn) complexity, breaking the SOTA's O(n^2)", "keywords": ["Bayesian Optimization", "Combinatorial Optimization", "Permutation Space"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6f846a0975437f04753e9a0ae96ce89a49817dd0.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c9c192dd1500725ebba7877513a2abacb257e127.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the problem of black-box optimization over permutation spaces.
