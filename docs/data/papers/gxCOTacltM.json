To address this, soft-DTW replaces the minimum operator with a smooth soft-min, enabling differentiability and efficient computation. Motivated by soft-DTW, we propose perturbed-DTW, a differentiable framework of DTW obtained by adding random perturbations to warping costs and taking the expected minimum. Under Gumbel noise, perturbed-DTW exactly recovers soft-DTW, providing a natural probabilistic interpretation of soft-DTW. We further generalize this framework by extending the Gumbel noise to the broader family of generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions, leading to a new class of soft-DTW variants. Building on this insight, we introduce nested-soft-DTW (ns-DTW), which integrates GEV perturbations into the dynamic programming formulation of perturbed-DTW. This extension induces alignments with tunable skewness, offering greater flexibility in modeling diverse alignment structures. We validate ns-DTW on barycenter computation, clustering, and classification, demonstrating its effectiveness over existing approaches.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["dynamic time warping", "perturbation", "dynamic programming"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1255c322b928e3400c460029d99f6255f3a15620.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4aa78a668f334538b89f4e489d6e7549dd41ec15.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper provides a new probabilistic perturbation-based interpretation of soft-DTW, formulated using a concept similar to the Gumbel-Max (softmax) trick—specifically, its softmin counterpart (Lemma 1).\nUnder this formulation, the authors define perturbed-DTW and show that when the perturbation noise follows a $\\mathrm{Gumbel}(-c, 1)$ distribution (where $c$ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant, the perturbed-DTW becomes exactly equivalent to soft-DTW.\n\nFurthermore, the paper introduces nested-soft-DTW (ns-DTW), which employs the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution—a generalization of the Gumbel distribution—as the perturbation noise model.\nTheoretical analysis (Theorem 1) derives a closed-form solution for this generalized case.\nIn ns-DTW, the set of alignment matrices is partitioned into $J$ groups, each associated with a parameter $\\tau_\\ell \\in (0,1]$.
