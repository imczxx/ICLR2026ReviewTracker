Here are the main weaknesses I found:\n\n**Relevance of ROSE block**: It is not clear to me why the ROSE mechanism is actually needed. The authors say that avoids gradient noise, but still this should be described more in detail, as it feels somewhat very generic. From adversarial robustness literature, it is commonly known that this issue mostly arises when there is an inherent randomness in the inference process, yet I fail in understanding where is the Shapley-based estimation introducing noise. Also, from a practical perspective, I think that this could be more simply solved by using EoT approaches [ext_ref_1, ext_ref_2]. \n\n**Separate cells over different losses**: I understand the reason that led the authors in designing two separate cells. But still, it is not clear to me how and why this should be better than having a single cell with a different loss, such as the TRADES loss which accounts for both clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. I would also have expected an ablation study in this regard.\n\n**Other issues, not necessarily minor:** \n- The adversarial robustness evaluation standard is now commonly accepted to be AutoAttack, which reduces possible robustness over-estimation. I appreciate that the authors use it, but still their method does not indicate the best robustness with the most relevant attack method among the used ones. \n- The sentence: \"Nevertheless, many approaches still depend on predefined templates and heuristic evaluations (e.g., PGD accuracy), which can introduce statistical noise and obscure robustness-critical factors. This motivates the need for principled, robustness-aware NAS frameworks that dynamically identify sensitivity in operations and architectural choices, enabling the discovery of inherently robust models\" does not make much sense to me in general, but it does not also look coherent with what the authors do in practice (eq. 12 is based on PGD). I fail in understanding where the highly principled/non-PGD based evaluation/approach is here. \n- This sentence: \"Architectures not explicitly designed for robustness often exhibit an inherent trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial performance\" should be supported by a reference, as it is once again extremely vague and generic.\n\n[ext_ref_1]: Athalye, Anish, Nicholas Carlini, and David Wagner. \"Obfuscated gradients give a false sense of security: Circumventing defenses to adversarial examples.\" International conference on machine learning.

Can you perform an ablation or comparative study isolating the contribution of the dual-branch design versus adversarial training alone?\n- You mention that existing approaches rely on heuristic evaluations (e.g., PGD accuracy), whereas your approach is “principled.” Could you clarify in what sense RDNAS avoids such heuristics, given that Eq.

The core problem addressed is that most Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods optimize for clean accuracy and ignore robustness, while existing robust NAS methods often suffer from unstable training due to noisy gradients from adversarial training. \n\nThe overall framework integrates adversarial training into a DARTS-like bilevel optimization process and uses ROSE to guide the selection of the final architecture. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and Tiny-ImageNet show that RDNAS discovers architectures that outperform both manually-designed networks and other state-of-the-art robust NAS methods in both clean accuracy and robustness against attacks like PGD and AutoAttack.\n\nContribution:\n\n* A Novel Dual-Branch Cell Design: This architecture explicitly separates and fuses clean and robust feature pathways via an attention mechanism. This is designed to effectively manage the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness.\n\n* ROSE, a Robust Scoring Mechanism: A new, principled scoring estimator based on Shapley values that is specifically designed to be stable under the noisy conditions of adversarial training by using MoM and IQR statistics.\n\n* Strong Empirical Validation: The paper provides extensive experimental evidence that RDNAS discovers architectures with a superior balance of robustness and accuracy compared to existing baselines across multiple datasets and attack types."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

State-of-the-Art Performance: The method achieves excellent results, outperforming a wide range of baselines (e.g., AdvRush, RACL, RobNet) on standard benchmarks.

New Hyperparameters: The ROSE estimator introduces its own set of hyperparameters, such as the $\\beta$ parameter that balances the MoM and IQR scores, the number of MoM groups $G$, and the IQR sensitivity $\\gamma$. This adds extra tuning parameters to an already complex search process.\n\n3.
