HVAC devices form a complex thermodynamic system, and while model predictive control and reinforcement learning have been used to optimize control policies, scaling to thousands of buildings remains a significant unsolved challenge. Most current approaches are over-optimized for specific buildings and rely on proprietary data or hard-to-configure simulators. We present the Smart Buildings Control Suite, the first open source interactive HVAC control benchmark with a focus on solutions that generalize across building. It has 3 components: real-world data from 11 buildings over 6 years, a lightweight data-driven simulator for each building, and a modular Physically Informed Neural Network (PINN) building model as a simulator alternative. The buildings span multiple climates, management systems, and sizes, and both the simulator and PINN easily transfer to new buildings, ensuring solutions using this benchmark are robust to these factors and only reliant on fully scalable building models. This represents a major step towards scaling HVAC optimization from the lab to buildings everywhere. To facilitate use, our benchmark is compatible with the Gym standard, and our data is part of TensorFlow Datasets.", "tldr": "We present a new benchmark for optimizing the efficiency of commercial buildings", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Optimal Control", "HVAC Control", "Sustainability", "Climate Control", "Datasets and Benchmarks", "Simulation", "Physically Informed Neural Networks"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dc015ba2739078267d5b3eb9ac29aeea25624e18.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9c4a76554b5d79f1045532bd4c3f523ec39a62a8.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper describes \"The Smart Buildings Control Suite\" (SBCS): a benchmark intended to evaluate and scale HVAC control policies with an explicit focus on generalization across buildings.

It aims to unlock interactive policy learning while preserving ties to real buildings—something most prior datasets/simulators don’t offer at once. (Sec. 2 contrasts with EnergyPlus/BEAR and single‑building datasets; Sec. 4–6 describe the three pillars.) \n\n- The simulator’s calibration/evaluation protocol is clearly defined and illustrated with quantitative drift. The discussion of parameter plausibility and the compensatory role of the convection coefficient is transparent.\n\n - The PINN model is satisfactory - It incorporates physical priors and positivity constraints on control gains, and it is validated both by MAE and behavioral sanity (response monotonicity; MMD vs. LSTM). \n\n- The 3C reward seems thoughtfully constructed and extensible (comfort, cost, carbon; with an optional IAQ term and feasibility constraints discussed on 18–20). The comfort loss is tied to literature and occupancy modeling.\n\n - The paper is well written and includes useful diagrams and visual diagnostics The appendices provide substantial implementation detail on FD derivations, tensorization, preprocessing floor plans and hyperparameters, aiding reproducibility.\n\n- Climate/energy impacts are substantial, and reproducible benchmarks are currently a bottleneck for ML+HVAC.
