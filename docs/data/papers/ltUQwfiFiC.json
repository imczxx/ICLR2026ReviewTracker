To gauge and diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources, and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the\npromise of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.", "tldr": "challenging video LLMs on their capacity for visual-centric humor understanding", "keywords": ["humor understanding", "video LLMs"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dfc8145c4f58d4017b837eb9281bbab1124a0722.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces v-HUB, a visual-centric benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on video humor understanding, addressing the gap in existing benchmarks that either rely on spoken language or require both video and linguistic cues to comprehend humor.

The dataset scale is relatively limited, with only 900+ videos included. This small sample size may restrict the evaluation breadth. For instance, it fails to fully cover humorous scenarios across diverse cultural backgrounds or visual styles, making it difficult to disentangle whether the observed MLLM underperformance stems from inherent capability gaps or insufficient dataset coverage.\n2. Additionally, this dataset may lack of diversity (e.g., different types of humor, different topics of videos).  This lack of transparent cultural diversity validation restricts the generalizability of v-HUB to MLLMs evaluated on cross-cultural humor understanding tasks. \n3. The above limited scale and diversity of historical humor samples undermines the statistical robustness of the claim regarding MLLMs’ poorer comprehension of historical versus contemporary humor, as the conclusion may be biased by small-sample variation rather than genuine model limitations.\n4. The paper lacks explicit documentation of the parameter sizes for most evaluated models (e.g., Video-SALMONN-2, MiniCPM-2.6-o) and omits controlled experiments to isolate the impacts of model parameters versus architecture. While a few models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-72B) have parameter sizes specified, the absence of comparative tests between models with identical architectures but different parameter scales (or vice versa) makes it impossible to attribute performance differences to either pre-trained knowledge storage gaps (due to parameter size) or architectural design nuances (e.g., visual encoders, multimodal fusion modules, the pre-training method of different model). This ambiguity weakens the depth of analysis into MLLMs’ humor understanding limitations. \n5. The evaluation framework does not include comparative experiments on performance-boosting methods such as few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT), or fine-tuning. The paper cannot assess whether MLLMs’ visual-centric humor understanding capabilities can be activated or enhanced via these approaches. \n6. While the paper mentions that some qualified annotators conducted three rounds of annotation for each video, it does not report quantitative metrics (e.g., Cohen’s Kappa coefficient, Fleiss’ Kappa) to measure inter-annotator agreement.\n7. This work mainly uses traditional NLG automatic metrics to evaluate the ability of LLMs. Personally, I feel that these metrics are no longer sufficient to indicate whether the generated text conforms to human preferences."}, "questions": {"value": "1.V-HUB only contains 900+ videos and is sourced by a single X account and silent flims from Charlie Chaplin, how do you address the concern that the small and undiverse dataset scale may limit the evaluation breadth, diversity and statistical robustness of the claim about MLLMs’ poorer comprehension of historical versus contemporary humor?

The dataset novelty is limited. \n- Table 1 summarizes the novelty of the proposed v-HUB over existing humor video datasets. However, it contains highly exaggerated arguments. \n- Surely, v-Hub is more visual-centric than the other datasets, but it is an overclaimed argument that only v-Hub is O and the others are X, since it is a matter of degree not a binary O/X decision. For example, ExFunTube contains many visual-centric datapoints, although all datapoints would not. \n- Also, another important novelty argument is that v-Hub supports three target tasks. However, once one has humor explanation text labels for humor videos, it is almost automatic to transform their label formats for those of caption matching and QA tasks. Thus, it is not a notable contribution. \n\n2. The experimental findings are quite predictable with little surprising novelty. \n- It is a well-known issue that current multimodal models (1) are highly biased toward text information over visual one, and (2) often ignore subtle information in the visuals. These phenomena have been observed in almost all multimodal tasks. \n- Likewise, findings summarized in the text in bold in section 4.2-4.3 have little novel perspective on the multimodal task. \n\nBased on the points in 1-2 (limited novelty), this work may be better fit to a second-tier venue rather than ICLR. \n\n3. The ethics review is not possible for a reviewer. \n- Often humor videos in social media are highly likely to contain sensitive, offensive, disturbing, or private content. However, this work does not provide reviewers with the means to assess such issues in the dataset, as only four examples in Fig.1 are viewable to a reviewer. \n- The copyright issue on Charlie Chaplin’s Silent Films (one of the two main video sources) is not discussed."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["Yes, Discrimination / bias / fairness concerns", "Yes, Privacy, security and safety", "Yes, Legal compliance (e.g., GDPR, copyright, terms of use, web crawling policies)", "Yes, Potentially harmful insights, methodologies and applications"]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "Please refer to the Weakness 3."}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "xNzfzAYeqV", "forum": "ltUQwfiFiC", "replyto": "ltUQwfiFiC", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4776/Reviewer_Qhvs"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4776/Reviewer_Qhvs"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4776/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761744215427, "cdate": 1761744215427, "tmdate": 1762917564707, "mdate": 1762917564707, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper present a visual-centric video humor understanding benchmark, and give a comprehensive evaluation of many sota MLLMs."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "1.
