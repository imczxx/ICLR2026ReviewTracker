Part-level pointing presents unique challenges: annotation is costly, parts are long-tail distributed, and many are difficult to specify precisely in language. We introduce POinting at Parts (POP), a training-free, plug-and-play approach that addresses these challenges under a few-shot setup. POP fuses textual and visual attention maps with self-supervised visual correspondences from query image and few-shot examples. On average across the three evaluated datasets, POP achieves accuracy gains of up to 8.9 points in the one-shot setting and 16.4 points in the three-shot setting for the pointing-capable MLLMs—Qwen2.5-VL, Ovis2.5, and Molmo. Notably, even MLLMs without pointing capability benefit significantly from the proposed approach. These results establish a simple yet effective path toward fine-grained spatial grounding in MLLMs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["point-based grounding", "few-shot learning", "multimodal large language model"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e646e0f54e7e7f9ba1e61e3e6a376ccc323d3be5.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d1fa9c4054208966be07b0e25132665b20c6fba5.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}, "comment": {"value": "Please remove the submission from ICLR on openreview."}}, "id": "M1mNgHAhRs", "forum": "kCIqoW70oG", "replyto": "kCIqoW70oG", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9000/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9000/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761940376601, "cdate": 1761940376601, "tmdate": 1761940376601, "mdate": 1761940376601, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
