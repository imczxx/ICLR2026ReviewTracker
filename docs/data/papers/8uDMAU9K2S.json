Often, the propagation of the signal leads to a loss of information, where the signal tends to diffuse across the graph instead of being deliberately routed between regions of interest. Two notions that depict this phenomenon are oversmoothing and oversquashing. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for modeling signal propagation, inspired by quantum mechanics, using the notion of observables. Specifically, we model the place in the graph where the signal lies,  how much the signal is concentrated at this place, and how much of the signal is propagated towards a location of interest when applying a GNN. Using these new concepts, we prove that standard spectral GNNs have poor signal propagation capabilities. We then propose a new type of spectral GNN, termed Schr\\\"odinger GNN, which we show has a superior capacity to route the signal between graph regions.", "tldr": "We propose a theory for modeling the capacity of GNNs to rout signals between regions of the graph.

The authors define three “observables” of a graph signal: (i) its location in the graph, (ii) the concentration of the signal around that location, and (iii) how much of the signal is propagated from one region to another. Using these notions, they prove that standard spectral GNNs cannot effectively move information between distant nodes (they keep the signal’s mean location fixed and only increase its spread). As a remedy, the authors propose Schrödinger GNN, a spectral GNN built with a unitary graph shift operator and complex-valued input features. A part of the feature channels encodes an abstract “formal location” and the rest encodes the actual signal. The authors show that Schrödinger filters can direct signal propagation at a roughly constant speed in any desired direction.  Empirically, they demonstrate on a synthetic ring-transport task that only the Schrödinger GNN with complex modulation is able to successfully route the signal whereas standard GCN and GAT fail.

Also, the method achieves competitive results on LRGB (Peptides), which together give initial evidence of the method’s practical value."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Some parts of the exposition are hard to parse, especially for a graph ML audience. It also seems to me that the paper does not explicitly discuss how oversquashing is quantitatively addressed in the observables framework, so readers may wonder how the new measures relate to known bottleneck metrics. I only found a generic oversquashing discussion in appendix A.3, which doesn’t mention Schrödinger GNNs. I would encourage the authors to clarify this connection and consider discussing oversquashing more prominently in the main body (if I have not overlooked it). Furthermore, the paper devotes substantial space to motivating the ideas from quantum mechanics, but the actual method is then only sketched very briefly (page 7, l. 360-371). I think that having a more self-contained section introducing the Schrödinger GNN would greatly improve the paper’s clarity and accessibility. For example, it is should also be made clearer throughout the paper that applying a Schrödinger GNN is a 2-step procedure including the Position-Momentum Optimization (Def. 3.11).\n- While the toy example is clear, the real-graph improve the results only modestly. In Table 2, the Schrödinger GNN’s scores on Peptides-Func (AP ~71.4) and Peptides-Struct (MAE ~0.2447) are essentially matched by other GNNs. Interestingly, the impact of complex modulation on the LRGB tasks is minimal. While LRGB is the natural starting point, it has been noted to be somewhat saturated and not always diagnostic of capturing true long-range interactions [1,2]. There are several recent benchmarks that aim to better probe long-range dependencies, although it would be unreasonable to expect evaluation on these newer datasets at this point. Still, within LRGB itself, the paper’s evaluation (restricted to a single real-world dataset and only a *part* of the full suite) appears somewhat incomplete.\n- Several key references are missing. For example, table 1 compares to GAT, but the corresponding citation [3] is omitted. I did not check all ~20 methods compared on the LRGB task (table 2), but, also here, key baselines that are *explicitly mentioned* (such as [4,5]) cannot be found in the references. Even if the results for these other methods were not reproduced by the authors themselves, it remains standard scientific practice to include citations to all methods mentioned in the script.
