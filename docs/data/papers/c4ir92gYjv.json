While it promises to solve some of the intractable problems of computing, real world application is scarce. It is mainly challenged by the hardware which are currently limited both in circuit width and depth. Finding a real world application with an advantage compared to classically available solutions is even harder in the current state-of-the-art machines. However, given the vastly different nature of quantum computers, it is possible the advantage may come from unexpected corners when applied to wide range of classical problems. Machine learning using quantum algorithms are of particular interest due to their ease of parameterization and possible resource efficiency. In this work, we apply a quantum machine learning (QML) algorithm to real world data and benchmark some of the well established scaling laws in a resource constraint scenario using both ideal and noisy ion trap quantum computer platform. The real world problem we investigated comes from the accurate identification of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell activation states from high‑dimensional cytometric data. Hand‑engineered features extracted from imaging flow cytometry capture morphological, intensity, texture and shape descriptors that are essential for discriminating between quiescent and stimulated cellular states. Leveraging a dataset of processed blood cell images from three patients, we compare quantum data re‑uploading classifiers (QDRCs) with classical feedforward neural networks (FNNs) for the task of binary classification of cellular activation. The study is driven by three findings: (1) both quantum and classical models achieve high test accuracy ($\\approx99$%) when trained with sufficient data and epochs, and models trained on one patient generalize well to the other two, demonstrating the learnability of the engineered feature space; (2) the generalization error of QDRCs exhibits a predictable power‑law scaling with training size consistent with a $\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{N}}$ bound for T trainable parameters, whereas FNNs lack a comparable scaling relationship; and (3) QDRCs achieve high accuracy in early epochs under low‑data constraints, aligning with a convex kernel interpretation of the re‑uploading model. We further validate a theoretical bound derived from quantum generalization theory and provide an intuitive proof under a convexity assumption. These results indicate that quantum architectures can be competitive with classical baselines while offering faster early generalization and theory-consistent behavior in data‑limited regimes, although our conclusions are restricted to hand‑crafted features and do not imply clinical readiness or broader generalization.", "tldr": "This paper shows that for classifying cancerous cells from cytometric data, quantum models learn faster and generalize more effectively from limited data than classical neural networks, and their performance predictably scales as theory suggests.", "keywords": ["Quantum Machine Learning", "Generalization Error", "Data-Efficient Learning", "Computational Biology", "Quantum Neural Networks", "Deep Learning"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/06952b01a910fe0985ec5472b51bf3cf12b0578f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the generalization behaviour and learning dynamics of Quantum Data Re-uploading Classifiers (QDRCs) versus classical Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) on a biomedical dataset derived from imaging flow cytometry.

The models are not processing raw cell images, but rather a 76-dimensional \"hand-crafted feature\" vector extracted by proprietary software.\n\nThis implies that the most challenging feature engineering step has already been completed by domain experts and the software.\n\nThis 76-dimensional feature vector appears to be a highly concentrated and well-designed dataset. This might simplify the task from a complex machine learning problem to one of shallow classification on a well-defined feature space.\n\nQuestions Regarding the Choice of Classical Baseline (FNN):\nThe paper's core argument for the QDRC's data efficiency rests on a comparison with an FNN. This choice of baseline raises some questions, as an FNN may not be the most suitable or strongest model for this specific type of \"high-dimensional feature, small-sample\" task.\n\nIn classical machine learning, methods like SVMs, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosted Trees are often the standard and highly effective tools for this kind of \"shallow\" tabular data.\n\nThese classical models (particularly SVMs) are known to be inherently data-efficient in high-dimensional spaces and might achieve very high accuracy with only a small number of samples.\n\nThis leads to a key question: how would the QDRC's data efficiency and \"faster early learning\" compare against a more traditional and potentially stronger baseline like an SVM? Without this comparison, it is difficult to be certain that the observed advantages are unique to the quantum model rather than just a reflection of the FNN's limitations on this task.\n\nInterpretation of \"Faster Learning\" and \"Scaling Laws\":\n\nThe paper notes that the QDRC's early advantage is temporary, with the FNN eventually \"catching up and overtaking\" (Sec 3.3). The practical significance of this temporary advantage is unclear, especially if a more standard classical model (like an SVM) could potentially converge to a high accuracy almost immediately.\n\nThe verification that QDRC's generalization error fits the $\\sqrt{T/N}$ theory is a valuable scientific validation. However, this seems to be evidence of the model's predictability, not necessarily its superiority. The fact that the FNN does not fit this simple law just implies its generalization behavior is more complex, not that its generalization error is inherently worse."}, "questions": {"value": "Some aspects may be improved and clarified,\n\n1. Limited dataset and domain scope\n\nThe dataset comprises only three patients and a 76-dimensional hand-engineered feature set rather than raw image or flow-cytometry data. The limited sample size and narrow feature domain raise concerns about generality of the claims (clinical readiness and broader generalization are explicitly excluded by the authors themselves).\n\nBecause the features are engineered rather than raw high-dimensional data, the quantum advantage might stem more from the smaller input space than from intrinsic quantum model strengths; thus the relevance to large-scale deep-learning problems (e.g., raw images, millions of features) is unclear.\n\n2. Quantum vs classical comparison caveats\n\nWhile QDRCs apparently show faster early-epoch convergence and scaling behaviour, the performance advantage is modest, and under abundant data both QDRCs and FNNs perform similarly. This suggests the quantum benefit might only hold in niche low-data regimes.\n\nIt is unclear whether the classical baseline architectures were optimised equivalently (in hyperparameters, regularisation, architecture depth) or whether the feature-engineering favoured one class of models. Without strong classical baselines, the claim of quantum competitiveness remains tentative.\n\n3. Theoretical bound assumptions and hardware realism\n\nThe theoretical bound for QDRCs (power-law scaling of generalization error) is derived under a convexity assumption, which may not hold for more complex architectures or non-convex training. The authors should make clear the conditions under which the bound applies, and whether those reflect the actual training regime of the QDRCs.\n\nThe experiments include “ideal and noisy ion trap quantum computer platform” simulations, but real hardware may include error correlations, drift, connectivity constraints, and other non-idealities which may alter generalisation/learning dynamics significantly. The paper acknowledges this, but the practical readiness for NISQ or fault-tolerant devices is not established.\n\n4. Scalability and feature-space mismatch\n\nWhile the QDRC exhibits favourable scaling in the given feature-space, how this would extend to high-dimensional raw data, larger numbers of classes, more complex tasks (multi-class, multi-label) remains unaddressed.\n\nThe use of hand-engineered features reduces the dimensionality and complexity of the learning task, which could bias the result in favour of simpler models (quantum or classical) and may not reflect real deep-feature learning scenarios.\n\n5. Interpretability of “faster early learning” attribution\n\nThe claim that QDRCs learn faster in the early epochs is attributed to a “fixed-feature, linear-readout view” and a PL-condition rate constant proportional to the minimum eigenvalue of G (the Gram/kernel matrix). While plausible, the empirical validation of this mechanism is limited. More diagnostics (such as measured eigenvalues, kernel spectra, trajectory of logits) would strengthen this intuition.\n\n**Relevant References for Inclusion**\n\nTo strengthen the manuscript and situate it properly within the QML and generalisation literature, the authors should include the following:\n\nBanchi, L., Pereira, J., & Pirandola, S.

While suitable as a proof of concept, this setup is too limited to justify broad claims about scaling or generalization behaviour in quantum models.\n\n- **Underdeveloped classical baseline.**\n  The FNN comparison is shallowly explored. Details about optimizer choice, learning-rate schedules, batch sizes, and hyper-parameter tuning are missing. The FNN architecture is varied only coarsely (1–5 hidden layers) with the hidden width h adjusted solely to match the total parameter count T of the quantum models (T ∈ [80, 800]). This coupling of depth and width prevents disentangling how width affects generalization—an aspect known to strongly influence learning dynamics in classical networks.\n\n- **Inconclusive scaling analysis.**\n  The claimed T/N power-law scaling for QDRCs relies on a limited range of model sizes and a simple log–log fit (R² ≈ 0.72–0.84). The classical models show a much weaker correlation (R² ≈ 0.17–0.22), which may stem from insufficient exploration rather than a fundamental difference. Without broader architectural sweeps (e.g., explicit width variation at fixed depth), ablations on optimizer and initialization, or tests on other datasets, the scaling claim remains tentative.\n\n- **Early-epoch behaviour likely confounded.**\n  The reported \"early-epoch advantage\" of QDRCs could result from architectural or training-setup differences rather than an intrinsic quantum effect. Wider networks typically converge faster due to smoother gradients (as predicted by NTK theory), while deeper or narrower ones train more slowly. Combined with possible optimizer or hyper-parameter differences, the observed effect cannot yet be attributed confidently to model type.\n\n- **Overstated framing of contributions.**\n  In the **Introduction** (last paragraph), the paper describes its study as a \"comprehensive empirical benchmark\".
