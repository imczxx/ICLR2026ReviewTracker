In contrast, this paper explores continual learning (CL) for malware traffic analysis, which leverages encrypted flow features to capture behavioral signals resilient to obfuscation and encryption. Unlike intrusion detection systems that focus on coarse anomaly detection, malware traffic analysis requires fine-grained family-level classification under evolving and imbalanced distributions, making it a distinct and challenging setting for CL.\n\nWe introduce TraMEL (Traffic-based Malware Exemplar Learning), a replay-based CL framework designed for malware traffic. TraMEL integrates (i) adaptive exemplar selection to balance long-tailed family distributions and (ii) an exemplar refinement phase to counter task recency bias while operating under strict memory budgets. We evaluate both standard class-incremental and temporally shifted scenarios, showing that TraMEL consistently outperforms strong CL baselines such as iCaRL, ER, and TAMiL by 10–30 percentage points on CICAndMal2017 and IoT23. Remarkably, it approaches the performance of joint training, a theoretical upper bound with full access to past data. These results demonstrate that CL on malware traffic is both feasible and practical, providing a memory-efficient approach for real-world detection.

Also, while the paper clearly states at the beginning that domain knowledge is rarely used in these contexts, it falls into the same problem. If the issue was the length of the replay buffer (which the experiments show it was) then also other methods outside security can be used by tweaking that parameter. Also, the strict resource requirements are mentioned, but the paper does not provide a quantitative way to judge such claim. Thus, the contribution feels more as an application of a new loss rather then providing systemic insights in the domain.\n\n**2) Not discussed why there is a boost in performance.** Is it because the transformer is useful? Or is the sampling? Only the buffer replay size is discussed, but no complete ablation study is provided.\n\n**3) Tabular data = ensembles of trees.** Why the paper deploys deep networks, when tabular data is empirically proven to be the best data format for ensembles of trees? See attached references. However, this would not be a contribution, but the correct usage of prior works published on top-tier venues.\n\n**4) No limitations are discussed.** The paper has limitations, related to the choice of architecture, of the choice of the dataset, and other many that the paper does not take into account, being a huge miss for this paper.\n\n**5) Missing baselines.** While the paper states that there are few work on continual learning for traffic data, some are presented. It is not clear why they were not evaluated. The papers state they are just not practical, without being convincing on why. \n\n**Minor comments.**\n1. there is an Appendix ?? reference broken at page 4\n2. space is used strangely, with paragraphs with different gaps\n3.

Specifically, while the refinement effectively counters recency bias, it introduces a separate, mandatory optimization step after every task, increasing the wall-clock time and computational load relative to standard replay methods. The paper can consider quantifying the exact overhead (e.g., training time in minutes/hours) added by the refinement phase compared to the joint training phase alone, especially in the tightest budget scenarios. \n\n(2) The K-means clustering-based selection (TraMEL-K) is shown to be crucial for tight memory budgets, but its reliance on a pre-determined optimal cluster number ($N_{k}=600$ for IoT23) is unclear to me. Here, I understand that the dependence of performance on the specific, empirically found value of $N_{k}$ (Section A.2, Table 6) suggests that this hyperparameter may not generalize well. If $N_{k}$ must be tuned per dataset, it negates some of the framework's practical use cases.\n\n\n(3) The paper defines the temporal-shift scenario as disjoint families grouped by the year of first appearance, which is acknowledged as a stricter than real deployments lower bound. Although the retrograde malware attack threat model is excellent, the current temporal-shift benchmark does not fully capture the recurring nature of the RMA's third phase (reintroducing legacy families or slightly altered variants). This is because the paper uses only disjoint families, and it assesses drift, not genuine recurrence.\n\n(4) The paper's foundational arguments on buffer constraints, related work, and core assumptions need stronger substantiation to clearly frame its novelty.\n\n- The paper repeatedly asserts that detectors must operate under strict memory budgets due to storage and scalability limits. This motivation is currently asserted without concrete, domain-specific justification. \n\n-  The term closed-world assumption is central to differentiating this work from traditional IDS, but it is never formally defined. \n\n-  The Related Work section is dismissive toward several recent, relevant CL efforts in network security, primarily by stating their limited relevance.  I believe,  instead of dismissing related CL works (\\eg SPIDER, SPCIL) or other malware CL methods (\\eg MalCL), the paper can briefly and precisely articulate the technical difference in feature space."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "EtJqUYvJKk", "forum": "7PVPfFHpdS", "replyto": "7PVPfFHpdS", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20123/Reviewer_XFd3"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20123/Reviewer_XFd3"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20123/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761761670510, "cdate": 1761761670510, "tmdate": 1762933021862, "mdate": 1762933021862, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes TraMEL, an exemplar replay-based continual learning (CL) framework for fine-grained malware family classification from encrypted network traffic.
