Surprisingly, current topology reasoning tasks do not address how to produce better discrete graphs, even though downstream modules such as planning and control rely on them. Existing methods predict continuous edge scores and then apply simple thresholding to obtain discrete graphs, but this step is neither optimized during training nor evaluated in benchmarks. As a result, it remains unclear whether their predicted continuous graphs are truly effective for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose **TopoRefine**, a universal and plug-and-play topology graph refinement module that refines continuous graphs predicted by any topology reasoning model into higher-quality discrete graphs. Specifically, it refines connectivity by learning structural patterns via a lightweight GNN-based refinement module trained in a self-supervised way. This refinement module calibrates predictions so that thresholding yields more reliable discrete structures. In addition, we are the first to introduce a discrete graph evaluation metric in this setting, the Topology Jaccard Score, tailored to directly assess the quality of discrete driving topology graph. Experiments on multiple baselines demonstrate that TopoRefine improves both continuous and discrete graph quality, making it the first framework to explicitly focus on improving discrete graph reliability in topology reasoning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Online Map Generation", "Autonomous Driving", "Topology Graph Refinement", "Self-Supervised Learning", "Heterogeneous GNN"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/668ad88e16c6285eac2bdb120ecced7f96b88f98.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes TopoRefine, a plug-and-play refinement module designed to improve the discrete graph quality in driving topology reasoning.

The definitions and conceptual differences between continuous graphs and discrete graphs are insufficiently clear, leading to a vague motivation for why this distinction is crucial.\n\n2. The proposed Topology Jaccard Score (TJS) is essentially equivalent to a standard Graph IoU metric and therefore does not provide substantial new conceptual insight. Furthermore, IoU-based measures are inherently sensitive to the threshold used to determine true and false positives; however, the paper lacks any sensitivity analysis or discussion regarding this critical aspect.\n\n3. As described in Sections 3 and 5.2, the framework depends on centerline polylines and traffic element features extracted from strong pretrained backbones such as DINOv2-ViT-L. Consequently, the method functions largely as a post-hoc “plug-and-play” refinement on top of existing lane detection pipelines, introducing additional complexity. Moreover, the integration between this refinement module and existing lane detection or topology reasoning models appears limited, without demonstrating meaningful synergistic effects.\n\n4. Line 301: The paper claims that OpenLane-V2 uses a specific matching formula based on the Hungarian Matching Algorithm, but the corresponding equation seems incorrect and inconsistent with the original OpenLane-V2 implementation.\n5.

This lack of clarification casts doubt on the reported performance gains.\n\n6. The evaluation is restricted to OpenLane-V2 Subset A only, with no validation on Subset B.\n\n7.

OpenLane-V2 consists of two subsets, Subset A and Subset B, but the paper lacks validation on Subset B.\n2. The authors claim that TopoRefine requires only 1.5 hours of training, whereas methods such as SMART take around two days. However, this comparison is unfair because TopoRefine is not trained from scratch. Moreover, existing methods are typically trained on eight GPUs rather than a single one, allowing them to complete training within half a day.\n3. The Topology Jaccard Score (TJS) and Topology mAP Score (TOP) both evaluate connectivity reasoning in autonomous driving but from different perspectives. There is no absolute superiority between the two; rather, each captures complementary aspects of topological reasoning. TJS is a discrete, detection-aware metric that measures the overlap between predicted and ground-truth edges, focusing solely on whether topological connections are correct. It is simple, efficient, and interpretable, making it ideal for benchmarking discrete topology reasoning or binary connection prediction. However, TJS overlooks confidence ranking and may not fully reflect the quality of probabilistic predictions. In contrast, TOP, adapted from link prediction in graph learning, assesses how well high-confidence edges correspond to true connections using mean average precision. It captures ranking quality and overall connectivity confidence but is more computationally expensive and sensitive to noisy predictions. In practice, TJS provides a fast and stable measure of structural correctness, while TOP offers a more fine-grained evaluation of model confidence and link reliability.\n4. Presenting improvements in percentages is not very intuitive and may come across as overstated.\n5. The baseline methods were not originally designed or trained to optimize TJS metric, which explains their weaker performance. Therefore, the large improvement reported on TJS is not entirely convincing. It would be more reliable to demonstrate the improvement through end-to-end (E2E) training that incorporates the TopoRefine method from the beginning.\n6. The proposed method involves a large number of hyperparameters, but only partial ablation studies are provided, leaving uncertainty about its sensitivity and generalizability. Moreover, Table 7 evaluates the method on the weakest baseline, whose detection performance is already poor, thereby severely limiting the upper bound of the topology-related metrics.\n7. The current method’s topological prediction remains heavily constrained by detection performance. Since TopoRefine is a post-training refinement approach, it inherently inherits the limitations of the underlying detection quality."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
