To perform better, the model needs to explore the reward space by numerously generating responses and learn from fragmented reward signals, blind to the overall reward patterns.\nFortunately, verifiable rewards make the natural language description of the reward function possible, and meanwhile, LLMs have demonstrated strong in-context learning ability.\nThis motivates us to explore if Large Reasoning Models can benefit from a **motivation** of the task, i.e., awareness of the reward function, during the reinforcement finetuning process, as we humans sometimes do when learning.\nIn this paper, we introduce ***M**otivation-**e**nhanced **R**einforcement **F**inetuning* (**MeRF**), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement finetuning of LLMs by involving \\emph{``telling LLMs rules of the game''}. \nSpecifically, **MeRF** directly injects the reward specification into the prompt, which serves as an in-context motivation for the model to be aware of the optimization objective. \nThis simple modification leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs, aligning generation with optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from both inner motivation and external reward. \nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate that **MeRF** achieves substantial performance gains over RLVR baseline. \nMoreover, ablation studies show that MeRF performs better with greater consistency between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through reinforcement finetuning.", "tldr": "effectively leveraging in-context learning ability of LLMs in reinforcement finetuning", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Finetuning", "Large Language Models"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/66a2b488a7dfa1b69c60eaa8c32f519dde7d9efc.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "By providing evaluation criteria with the system prompt (find-grained guideline), RLVR pipeline could be effectively trained."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "Through a series of experiments, the paper demonstrates that when training a model in a domain where the grading criteria are clearly defined, providing information about the grading scheme alongside the data can significantly accelerate the model’s learning process."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* As mentioned in the limitations, in situations where there is no prior knowledge of how the grading will be done, an approach that dynamically identifies the motivation and effectively solves the problem seems to have greater scalability.\n\n* Since adding even a suboptimal motivation still provides non-zero additional information, it is unsurprising that the performance improves compared to RLVR.
