The intrinsic interconnectedness of network and the attendant violation of the SUTVA assumption have prompted a wave of treatment effect estimation methods tailored to network settings, yielding considerable progress such as capturing hidden confounders by leveraging auxiliary network structure. Nevertheless, despite these advances, the existing methods: (i) mainly focus on the static network, overlooking the dynamic nature of many real-world networks and confounders that evolve over time; (ii) assume the absence of dynamic network interference where one unit’s treatment can affect its neighbors’ outcomes. To address these two limitations, we first define a new estimand of treatment effects accounting for interference in a dynamic network environment, i.e., CATE-ID, and establish its identifiability under such an environment. Then we accordingly propose DSPNET, a framework tailored specifically for treatment effect estimation in dynamic network environment, that leverages historical information and network structure to capture time-varying confounders and model dynamic interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Dynamic Network", "Interference", "Causality"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ca8898ff65ba24368a8f98a67415c75d6e37afd9.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Overall, this paper offers a **technically sound and empirically thorough** approach to a timely and underexplored problem — causal inference in dynamic network environments with interference.\nKey strengths include the introduction of a formally identifiable estimand (Eq. 2; Sec. 3), a well-structured architecture combining temporal and graph components (Fig. 2; Sec. 4), and strong empirical results (Table 1, Fig. 3).\nHowever, the **proof of identifiability** relies on strong and untested assumptions (Assumptions 3.1–3.2), and the **causal interpretation** of learned embeddings (especially the interference term ( e_t^i )) remains opaque.\nThe **datasets are synthetic**, which limits the generalizability of findings.\nOverall, the work is **technically competent and innovative**, but it needs clearer causal justification and stronger empirical grounding."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "* **Novel causal estimand and theory** — The paper proposes CATE-ID (Eq. 2) to extend CATE to dynamic settings with interference and proves its identifiability under explicit assumptions (Theorem 3.3).
