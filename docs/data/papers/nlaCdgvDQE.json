Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others, current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and hardware settings.

While the paper claims to use parallel encoders to disentangle brain-state-specific representations, in practice only two specialized encoders are implemented (for affect and motor tasks), with all other brain states collapsed into a generic “other” encoder. Given that affect and motor represent only a small subset of possible brain states, this coarse categorization significantly limits the generality and practical impact of the proposed disentanglement strategy.\n\n2. The paper lacks clarity on how encoder aggregation is performed during downstream fine-tuning. Although the authors argue that BrainPro can flexibly activate task-relevant encoders, Table 13 shows that using all encoders yields the best performance on affect tasks. Since the total model size is modest (7.69M parameters) and activating all encoders incurs minimal computational overhead, it is unclear why a selective activation mechanism is necessary—raising questions about the actual utility of the proposed modular design.\n\n3. The method section is difficult to follow due to an excessive amount of notation, some of which is either undefined (e.g., Sp​ on line 210) or appears to contain errors (e.g., “KTT” on line 197). Additionally, the formulation in Equation 9 is ambiguous—specifically, it is unclear whether the positional embedding p is added before or after the flattening operation (line 213). The authors should thoroughly revise and reorganize this section to improve clarity and readability.\n\n4. While the paper states that BrainPro supports heterogeneous electrode layouts through its retrieval-based spatial learning block, the current implementation appears to rely on a fixed universal template of only 60 channels. This may limit its applicability to datasets or clinical protocols that use denser montages (e.g., 62, 128, or even 256 channels), where fine-grained spatial resolution is critical—particularly for tasks like source localization or high-fidelity cognitive decoding. The authors should clarify whether the framework can scale to higher-density setups, and if so, how the retrieval mechanism generalizes beyond the 60-channel prior. If not, this constitutes a practical limitation that should be acknowledged.\n\n5. The pretraining corpus appears to be dominated by datasets such as TUH EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ) and TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus (TUEP). According to the authors’ own categorization, these datasets would fall under the “other” brain state, meaning that during pretraining—per Equation 13—only the shared encoder and the “other”-specific encoder receive gradients, while the affect- and motor-specific encoders remain largely unused. This leads to highly imbalanced parameter updates across encoders during pretraining. I suspect this issue stems primarily from the coarse brain-state taxonomy (affect / motor / other), which oversimplifies the rich diversity of neural processes in real-world EEG data. A more fine-grained and neuroscientifically grounded state partitioning could substantially strengthen the model’s design and the paper’s overall contribution."}, "questions": {"value": "The experiments in Table 13 are central to validating the paper’s core claim — that BrainPro enables flexible, task-adaptive encoder activation.

Specifically, the \"Second\" and \"Third\" limitations highlighted in the Introduction largely overlap--both concern the inflexibility of a single shared encoder in handling diverse or overlapping brain processes--yet are presented as distinct issues. Moreover, the claim that a single shared encoder inherently limits downstream adaptability contradicts a core premise of foundation models, which is precisely that a well-pretrained shared representation can generalize across tasks with appropriate fine-tuning. The paper provides little theoretical or empirical justification for why this principle fails in the EEG context.\n\nThe proposed retrieval-based spatial learning block essentially combines channel-level and region-level feature aggregation. While practically useful, this approach builds on well-established ideas in EEG modeling (e.g., region-of-interest analysis, local-global graph representations) and does not introduce a fundamentally novel spatial modeling mechanism.\n\nThe brain state taxonomy--limited to \"affect\", \"motor\", and \"others\"--is overly coarse. Real-world EEG data often reflect mixed or nuanced cognitive states (e.g., attention, working memory, fatigue), and such a simplistic categorization may hinder the model's ability to capture fine-grained or overlapping neural processes, limiting its applicability to more complex BCI scenarios.\n\nThe core claim is that parallel encoders enable better disentanglement than a single shared encoder. However, the paper does not compare against a strong baseline: a single encoder with the same total parameters as BrainPro's combined encoders, but conditioned on brain state (e.g., via input token or Feature-wise Linear Modulation).

The paper advocates for *flexible downstream adaptation* by selecting subsets of encoders. However, Table 13 shows that using *all* encoders (EA + EM + ES) yields the best performance on both FACED and BCI-IV-2A. If the full combination is consistently optimal, what is the practical benefit of flexibility? Does this imply that the “flexible adaptation” is unnecessary in practice, and simply fusing all available encoders is sufficient?\n\n3.
