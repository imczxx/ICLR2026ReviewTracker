In this work, we propose, AffinityEnhancer, a framework to improve the affinity of an antibody in a one-shot setting. In the one‐shot setting, we start from a single lead sequence—never fine‐tuning on it or using its structure in complex with the antigen or epitope/paratope information—and seek variants that reliably boost affinity. During training, AffinityEnhancer utilizes pairs of related sequences with higher versus lower measured binding in a pan-antigen dataset comprising diverse “environments” (antigens) and a shared reconstruction module that learns to transform low‐affinity sequences into high‐affinity ones, effectively distilling the consistent, causal features that drive binding. By incorporating pretrained sequence–structure embeddings and an antibody-specific sequence decoder, our method enables robust generalization to entirely new antibody seeds. Across multiple unseen internal and public benchmarks, AffinityEnhancer outperforms existing structure‐conditioned and inpainting approaches—achieving substantial (in-silico) affinity gains in true one‐shot experiments without ever seeing antigen data.", "tldr": "AffinityEnhancer boosts antibody affinity from a single sequence, without structure or antigen data, by learning from matched high– vs. low-affinity pairs, capturing generalizable binding features and outperforming SOTA baselines.", "keywords": ["One-shot learning", "matching", "directed evolution", "antibodies", "structure-embeddings"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/abffa4c876ba9e1eed6dc1908bc22ff07f2f06ad.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/186a92d49821f208a51f53db208e50f9d6c4d07c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents AFFINITYENHANCER, a one-shot framework for antibody affinity improvement: given a single lead antibody sequence, the method learns residual mappings in a structure-aware embedding space from matched (low-affinity, high-affinity) pairs collected under the same antigen environment, and decodes improved candidates.
