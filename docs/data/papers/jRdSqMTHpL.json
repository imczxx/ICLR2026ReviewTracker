Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas (PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., “move [OBJ] to [OBJ]” → “move apple to desk”) to ensure concise action space and reliable scalability. This alternative is motivated by its align- ment with human cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection point between ALFWorld (∼35 actions) and SciWorld (∼500 actions), which serve as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable autonomy.", "tldr": "As action space complexity scales, a more scalable action representation should be planning with schemas rather than planning with actions.", "keywords": ["Long-Horizon Agent", "Large Language Models", "Agents under action space scaling"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/06af06fbcb92f2ace59d1c57ee26e674ba1eb100.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a cognitive perspective on how LLM agents handle planning in environments of increasing complexity.

For example, in an environment where abundant number of different action schemas exist, this assumption cannot always hold.\n* Inaccurate characterization of environment complexity: The paper states that ALFWorld has ~35 actions, but ALFWorld which is based on ALFRED actually contains hundreds of grounded action combinations from 11 action schemas and 84 object classes. The authors should provide a detailed explanation of how this figure of 35 actions was derived.\n* Unclear explanation of ALFWorld results: Planning with schemas performance in ALFWorld is extremely low (e.g., GPT-4.1 = 16 %, Gemini-2.0-flash = 1%), despite the schema space being small (11 schemas with 35 actions).

PwS, by shifting the cognitive load to the schema instantiation (SI) stage, allows for better handling of long-term dependencies, making it a more reliable and effective choice for complex tasks.

This discrepancy raises questions about whether PwS is truly more effective in handling more intricate tasks, as the framework suggests. Further clarification are needed to explain this result and whether additional factors such as task characteristics or environmental constraints influence performance.\n\n3. **Confuse about Relationship between Action Paradigm Choice and Environment**: The paper also needs to provide a discussion on how the choice between PwA and PwS might relate to the environment itself. Specifically, it is unclear whether the selection of the action representation paradigm is solely dependent on the intrinsic properties of large language models (LLMs) or if it also interacts with environmental factors and low-level skills.

The behavioral comparison's analysis of \"Repetitive Actions\" and \"Invalid Actions\" relies on either simple rule-based filtering (for Invalid Actions) or an external LLM (Kimi-K2) to analyze and generate ground truth for failure modes, which could introduce potential noise and dependence on a specific model's subjective judgment."}, "questions": {"value": "1. To overcome the qualitative nature of the Cognitive Bandwidth Perspective, could the authors propose a quantifiable proxy for Schema Instantiation (SI) load ($\\mathcal{L}_{SI}$), perhaps based on the number of objects visible in the observation (combinatorial complexity of grounding) or the token count of the generated action string? This could help replace the subjective binary categorization in Section 5.\n2. The paper argues PwA suffers from high Environment Understanding (EU) load and long context pressure. Yet, for PwS, the final grounded action still needs to be inserted into the history for subsequent interaction steps (Eq. 1, 2). Could the authors measure the total historical token growth for successful trajectories in SciWorld under both PwA and PwS? This would provide quantitative evidence on how much PwS actually mitigates the \"long context pressure\" throughout the entire multi-turn trajectory.\n3. The current schemas for ALFWorld and SciWorld are derived by replacing all object arguments with a generic `[OBJ]` token. How robust is this simple abstraction across different instruction styles? Does providing the LLM with slightly different schema formats, such as `move [FRUIT] to [DESK]` (using explicit types) or `move [OBJ1] to [OBJ2]`, significantly change the inflection point's location for models categorized with poor SI capability?\n4. Since Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have marginally improved PwS performance but failed to solve the SI bottleneck, did the authors experiment with prompting strategies that specifically augment the SI stage? For example, using a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt structured as: \"Thought: To instantiate 'move [OBJ] to [OBJ]', I must first identify available objects, then check if they are movable, and finally generate the action 'move apple to desk'\"? Measuring performance change here would directly probe the bottleneck.\n\nWould appreciate answers to these questions.
