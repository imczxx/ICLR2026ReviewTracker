Yet, its practical adoption is hindered by a reliance on strong, often unverifiable assumptions and a lack of robust performance assessment. To address these limitations and advance empirical CD evaluation, we present **TCD-Arena**, a modularized and extendable testing kit to assess the robustness of time series CD algorithms against stepwise more severe assumption violations. For demonstration, we conduct an extensive empirical study comprising over 50 million individual CD attempts and reveal nuanced robustness profiles for 27 distinct assumption violations. Further, we investigate CD ensembles and find that they can boost general robustness, which has implications for real-world applications. With this, we strive to ultimately facilitate the development of CD methods that are reliable for a diverse range of synthetic and potentially real-world data conditions.", "tldr": "large scale study on the robustness of causal discovery algorithms for time series data against violations of their assumptions", "keywords": ["Causal Discovery", "Benchmark", "Robustness", "Time-Series", "Causality"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ab3389b1ecea52735fc80b3dab821caf472a8586.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces TCD-Arena, a modular, open-source testbed for stress-testing time-series causal discovery (CD) methods under stepwise assumption violations.

Even though ICLR does occasionally accept benchmark-oriented papers, such works usually have a broad and transformative impact (for example, by introducing a new real-world benchmark or establishing a widely adopted evaluation framework). In its current form, the contribution of this paper seems more incremental in scope (even though I think it is very interesting and needed). That said, I may not be fully aware of the current editorial stance on such submissions, and I would defer to the area and meta chairs regarding venue fit.

(2017) when referring to a comprehensive review of causal discovery in i.i.d. settings, as this book provides a more in-depth treatment of constraint-based causal discovery methods (PC and FCI) than the other two references.\n\n\n* In much of the existing literature, the WCG and summary graph are defined differently: both typically include instantaneous relations. It may therefore be helpful to explicitly state that your definitions diverge from the conventional ones. You might also consider using distinct notation (e.g., LWCG for lagged window causal graph and LSG for lagged summary graph) to avoid confusion. Additionally, note that the literature also defines a third type of graph, the extended summary causal graph, which, as I understand it, combines features of the lagged summary graph and the instantaneous graph.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n* [1] Peters et al.

Providing complete and correctly formatted references would help readers in the community quickly identify related advances.\n- Could the authors provide more details about the GVAR method and the code source used in the experiments? It seems that this corresponds to an extended version of the standard VAR model, as Table 11 indicates that the method has two hyperparameters, coeff and p-val. Including a brief methodological description would make the work more complete. Also, unless there is a specific reason to retain this name, it might be preferable to change it, since another work [1] is also named GVAR, which could lead to confusion.\n- Could the authors elaborate on how AUROC was computed in Figure 1? My understanding is as follows: for each assumption violation scenario, there are five different violation levels, and for each level, 100 datasets are sampled. Each method, under each hyperparameter configuration, computes AUROC across all these datasets. The results are then averaged to obtain an average AUROC per hyperparameter configuration, and the best-performing configuration is reported. Please confirm whether this interpretation is correct.\n- The paper defines robustness (line 363) in a way that differs from prior works such as Montagna et al. and Yi et al., which report results based on the best-performing hyperparameter setting per violation. Could the authors discuss the differences between these two evaluation strategies and their respective advantages or limitations?
