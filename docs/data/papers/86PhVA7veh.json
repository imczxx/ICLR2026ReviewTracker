We introduce Fixed-Point Self-Attention (FPSA), a parameter-free, drop-in replacement for self-attention that enables a model to adaptively ``think longer'' by iteratively refining each layer's representations to a fixed point. We train this recurrent process end-to-end using implicit differentiation, ensuring that memory usage during training and inference remains constant and identical to a standard Transformer layer, regardless of the number of refinement steps. Without adding any parameters, FPSA significantly improves strong baselines like BERT-Base and ELECTRA-Base on the GLUE and SQuAD v2.0 benchmarks. We demonstrate similar consistent gains for vision (ViT-B/16) and vision-language models, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 20\\%. This performance boost comes at a modest computational cost: a median of 3--6 refinement steps results in a $\\approx1.6\\times$ GFLOPs and $\\approx1.3-1.4\\times$ latency overhead compared to an equivalent BERT-Base model. Analysis shows FPSA dynamically allocates compute to challenging inputs and converges to stable fixed points. Furthermore, integrating FPSA into language models improves performance on complex reasoning tasks like GSM8K, BBH, and LogiQA. Ultimately, FPSA bridges the gap between fixed-computation and iterative reasoning, offering a powerful building block that adaptively allocates compute while preserving architectural simplicity.", "tldr": "FixedPoint SelfAttention replaces token autoregression with latent alignment refinement enabling iterative reasoning within self-attention,by updating alignment matrices through fixed-point iterations, it achieve 25% improvement with parameters reuse", "keywords": ["deep learning architecture", "fixed point iteration", "adaptive test-time"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6bde904f12569564ccb5cfd150c5f71ff9e17714.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Fixed-Point Self-Attention (FPSA), a parameter-free and computationally adaptive replacement for the standard self-attention mechanism in Transformers.

There is lack of discussion to recent papers. And I'm curious about comparison to them. For example, comparison with Figure 1c or 1d, and ablation results without fixing value state.\n- All layers seem like being updated by fixed-point iteration. What will happened if you select certain layers only? Some redundancy can be existed like current architecture, but this pushed too much for all layers.\n- With this paradigm, can pruning be more critical? I feel like redundancy gets disappeared for each layer, which means that we can fully leverage the \"depth\" of models while loosing some chances to prune.\n- Selecting some layers would be the solution though, inference latency and throughput seem inefficient.
