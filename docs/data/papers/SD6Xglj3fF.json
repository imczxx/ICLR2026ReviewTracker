In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA) and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning, we propose our method ICON with two-stage training strategy: First, we employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["unsupervised learning", "representation learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d2d6ce4518c8a269334e5e1fd15775edae8d9f56.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "My understanding is that this paper tackles the problem of catastrophic interference (CI) by framing it as a latent-variable identification problem. The authors propose two setups: a \"partial-task aware\" (PTA) model, trained on tasks up to $t-1$, and an \"all-task aware\" (ATA) model, representing an ideal model trained on all tasks. The paper's core idea is that CI can be quantified by the distance between the latent representations of these two setups. The authors propose a method called ICON, which first uses MLE to learn the latent representations for both the PTA and ATA configurations.

The paper attempts to provide a new theoretical perspective on catastrophic interference, framing it through the lens of identifiability theory. This is a relevant and challenging problem for the community.\n\n2. The conceptual setup of comparing a PTA to a hypothetical ATA is an intuitive way to think about the \"forgetting\" problem."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. My primary concern is the practicality. ICON relies on flow models (GIN), MLE and KL between PTA and ATA latent posteriors, and estimating those posteriors reliably is nontrivial. The paper glosses over how KL between learned latent posteriors is computed in practice and how sensitive the method is to model misspecification.\n\n2. The quality of the writing is not very good, which severely hinders the evaluation of the paper's contributions. The manuscript appears to suffer from numerous grammatical errors, awkward sentence constructions, and imprecise terminology (e.g., \"Theorem 4\" is mentioned in Sec 6.1 but the paper only presents \"Theorem 1\" in Sec 4; \"Def 3\" in Theorem 1, etc.). Key sections, particularly the Problem Setup (Sec 3) and the Identifiability Theory (Sec 4), are difficult to follow. The formal definitions of the PTA and ATA settings are not as clear as they could be, and the connection between the theoretical claims and the final algorithm is tenuous. While the authors note in Appendix C that LLMs were used to correct grammar, the current state of the manuscript is not at a publishable standard for ICLR.\n\n3. The core technical contribution of the proposed method ICON appears to be the application of a KL divergence loss (Eq. 14) to align the latent distributions from the PTA and ATA models. This technique—minimizing KL divergence to match two distributions—is a very standard and widely-used approach in machine learning for tasks like domain adaptation, generative modeling, and representation learning. It is not clear that the identifiability-based theoretical framework provides any new algorithmic insight beyond this standard practice. The contribution thus feels incremental and the novelty, from a methodological standpoint, is questionable.\n\n4. It is difficult to trace a clear line from the identifiability theory in Section 4 to the final objective function. The theory discusses conditions for identification, but it's not apparent why this leads specifically to the KL divergence as the objective, as opposed to other $f$-divergences or distance metrics (e.g., MMD, W-distance). The theory does not seem to constrain or uniquely motivate the practical algorithm."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Given the significant clarity issues, a major revision of the paper's exposition would be necessary. Could the authors clarify the definitions in Section 3?

Could the authors elaborate on the novelty of the method beyond applying a standard KL divergence loss to align two latent distributions?

I think the setting in this paper is closer to multi-task learning rather than continual learning. In particular, the first stage of ICON optimizes Eq.(12) and Eq.(13) independently, and both objectives require access to training data from previous tasks. While *empirical replay* only uses a small subset of previous data, which is a common and acceptable strategy in continual learning, the authors appear to use the entire previous datasets in experiments. Please clarify whether ICON and other baselines use full replay or limited replay; if the former, the authors should justify why this is a fair evaluation under the continual learning.\n2. The paper reports only average classification accuracy. This metric does not show how forgetting on earlier tasks is mitigated. The authors should report per-task accuracies and quantify forgetting with forgetting rate, which means the drop from peak to final for each task. Presenting task-wise curves or a table of per-task performance is also necessary to make the claims about catastrophic forgetting much more convincing.\n3. Several notations are not clear to me, which makes it hard to follow:\n   1. In Line 150, what is the exact meaning of $\\mathbf{z}^{t} = \\mathbf{\\tilde{z}}^{t} = \\mathbf{\\bar{z}}^{t}$? Maybe the authors aim to illustrate that $\\forall \\mathbf{\\tilde{z}}^{t} \\in \\mathcal{Z}^{t}, \\mathbf{\\tilde{z}}^{t} \\in \\bar{\\mathcal{Z}}^{t}$ and $\\mathbf{\\tilde{z}}^{t} \\in \\tilde{\\mathcal{Z}}^{t}$?\n   2.

In the equations (12) and (14), the summation index $i$ running from 1 to $t$ is confusing because $i$ does not appear in the summand. I cannot understand the meaning of the summand and why the summation index $i$ is running from 1 to $t$. \n4. This work contains a lot of typos, which provides a bad impression to me.\n   1. Line 135 $G$ should be $\\mathcal{G}$.\n   2. Line 136, *lost function* should be *loss function*. In addition, a period is missing at the end of the sentence.\n   3. Line 160, $\\mathcal{Z}_2 t$ should be $\\mathcal{Z}^{t}_2$.\n   4. In Equations (4) and (7), $inf$ and $sup$ may be $\\inf$ and $\\sup$ because the authors use $\\min$ rather than $min$ in the manuscript.\n   5.

Population-level theory: Theorem 4.1 is stated in the asymptotic regime where the data distribution is known exactly; consequently, it provides no guarantee on how many samples are required for the empirical minimiser of the KL alignment objective to lie within an ε-ball of the true shared latent point. A finite-sample analysis that quantifies the estimation error as a function of the number of observations per task, the complexity of the flow-based hypothesis class, the strong-convexity constant of the KL objective, and the uniform lower bound on the singular values of the Jacobian would close this gap and turn the appealing but purely theoretical statement into a practically actionable guarantee.\n\n2. Task-ID leakage: The training loss uses the task index t to route each sample to its task-specific PTA encoder q_θ(z|x,t), which means that the method still relies on a discrete grouping variable that is external to the observation x. While this is weaker supervision than class labels or auxiliary modalities, it is strictly stronger than a fully unsupervised setup in which no side information is available at training time. The claim that auxiliary labels are unnecessary should therefore be tempered to acknowledge that task identities are still required and that their availability might limit the applicability of the approach in streaming scenarios where task boundaries are not provided.\n\n3. Replay confound: Every empirical result on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100 is produced with a replay buffer that retains 2 000 and 1 000 exemplars, respectively. Because rehearsal is itself a powerful mechanism for mitigating forgetting, the observed accuracy improvements could be dominated by the memory baseline rather than by the identifiability-driven KL term. Providing learning curves for buffer sizes in {0, 250, 500, 1000, 2000} while freezing all other hyper-parameters would allow the reader to read off the marginal value of the KL objective once the contribution of rehearsal has been factored out.\n\n4. Latent-code evaluation missing: The synthetic experiment reports reconstruction error in pixel space, yet the central claim of the paper is that the algorithm correctly identifies the shared latent sub-space. Without displaying the Euclidean distance between the ground-truth 8-dimensional task-invariant latent vector and its estimate produced by each encoder, one cannot conclude that the pixel-level improvement is driven by better latent recovery rather than by a more flexible decoder that simply fits the observation noise more effectively.\n\n5. Jacobian regulariser unchecked: Assumption 5 demands that the smallest singular value of the Jacobian of the mixing function g remains uniformly bounded away from zero so that distinct latent points are guaranteed to produce observably distinct images. During gradient-based optimisation, however, the Jacobian can become ill-conditioned, causing the theoretical lower bound to be violated in practice. Recording the evolution of σ_min(J_g) across training iterations and, if necessary, adding a soft penalty −λ log σ_min(J_g) to the objective would ensure that the condition required by the theorem is not inadvertently invalidated by the optimiser.\n\n6. KL direction arbitrary: Minimising the forward KL D_KL(q_PTA ‖ q_ATA) can lead to an approximation that covers the support of the ATA posterior but also assigns mass to regions where the PTA posterior has negligible density. Evaluating the reverse KL D_KL(q_ATA ‖ q_PTA) or the symmetric Jensen–Shannon divergence would produce qualitatively different geometries of the shared manifold, potentially yielding a more peaked and better-aligned representation. Reporting how the choice of divergence affects the volume, diameter, and pairwise OT-distance between the PTA and ATA point clouds would clarify whether the reported gains are robust to this modelling choice."}, "questions": {"value": "Q1.
