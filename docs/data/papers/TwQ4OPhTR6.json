In recent years, the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance has attracted growing interest because it enables the comparison of structured data by jointly accounting for feature similarity and geometric structure. However, as a variant of optimal transport (OT), classical FGW assumes an equal mass constraint on the compared data. In this work, we relax this mass constraint and propose the Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein (FPGW) framework, which extends FGW to accommodate unbalanced data. Theoretically, we establish the relationship between FPGW and FGW and prove the metric properties of FPGW. Numerically, we introduce Frank-Wolfe solvers and Sinkhorn solvers for the proposed FPGW framework.  Finally, we evaluate the FPGW distance through graph matching, graph classification and graph clustering experiments, demonstrating its robust performance.

Please elaborate more on the advantage of using TV over KL.\n- The proposed FW and Sinkhorn algorithms for FPGW appear to be straightforward adaptations of those from [1]. In addition, in the graph matching experiments, only the Sinkhorn-based FPGW (first mentioned in line 379, presumably Algorithm 2) was used for comparisons.\nPlease clarify why the FW variant was not evaluated.\n- In the toy graph clustering experiment, the setting is not convincing. The weight \\omega_2 was set as 0.999, which means that the contribution of linear term (OT cost) was negligible. Then it becomes PGW, which is not original contribution of this paper. Hence, this example fails to demonstrate the distinct effectiveness of the fused formulation.\n- In other experiments (e.g., graph matching), the selection of \\omega parameters was not explained. \n\nBelow are some minor things:\n- In Eq (12), the constraint should be \\gamma \\in T_{\\leq} (p,q). \n- In Eq (16), the left hand side should be F(\\gamma, \\pi). \n- In Proposition 3.2 (line 252), the constraint should read \\gamma \\in \\in T_{\\leq} (\\muy,\\nuy). \n- In line 1001, where is the proposition L.2. \n- In line 1375, should be |\\gamma| = \\rho. \n- In line 1679, should use \\leq instead of \"=\" \n- In line 1858, left-hand side should be F(\\gamma, \\pi). \n- In line 1892, use \\gamma \\times \\pi instead of \\gamma \\bigotimes \\pi \n- In line 1990, the objective is missing--only the defintion of the constraint set is given. \n- In line 1982, a \">\" is missing for the first term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Bai et al,.

The authors use the Fused GW distance, where the GW distance between the graphs (coded as the sets of distances in a graph) to be compared and the attribute distances between nodes related by the transport plan are added (with some weights to balance them). This Fused GW distance is already well developed in the literature from 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe article points to the specific extension where the graphs are unbalanced, so that one can not expect to have the same total distributions for the two graphs. This is called the Fused Partial GW problem  (+ the sub-variant of Mass-constrained PGW problem) and the question has also been well studied between 2020 and 2024.\n\nThe novelty here is on two aspects: the authors propose to use a different, specific form for age distance between the attributes, as being the Total variation (instead of KL divergence or L_q distances as in previous works). From that, there derive algorithms from the Franck-Wolfe method and the Sinkhorn algorithm to solve this specific instance of FPGW or FMPGW problems. \n\nThe authors have the result that the problem, formulated that way, provides a semi-metric. Then, they show examples on three ML task with graphs: clustering, graph matching, and geometry matching. For that, they use classical machinery for OT methods with graphs, computing barycenters for FPGW distances ; coding graphs as discrete mass measures ; selecting a specific node as anchor for geometry matching;  and so on.

There is an effort to prove some theoretical properties: existence of minimiser for the unbalanced FGW or FPGW; properties related to being a metric or semi-metric;  details on the described algorithms and convergence properties.\n\n3. I have found one point with some novelty: the fact that the proposed method allows to “put aside” nodes which are outliers in a graph, and not transport them to the other graph (as seen on Fig. 2). However, $N_G$ appear to be needed (the number of nodes which are not outliers) and this diminishes the usefulness of the method."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The article has several weaknesses and I find that they overcome the strengths of the article:\n\n1. First of all, the work is way too **incremental**: the problem of FPGW (and its variants) was already well considered before, with methods to solve it and better discussions than in the present article about why the problem is relevant. Here, the main novelties are technical results and algorithms in a specific choice of distance ; and these technicalities and algorithms come almost straight from the literature.\n\n2. The authors give **no element to justify whether their choices are better, or more sound, or just sound**, as compared to previous works. For instance, why use a total variation ? Is there a reason for that ? When to use the FW algorithm to the Sinkhorn version ? Why is the  Sinkhorn one mostly used in the experiments ? (and then, why propose also the FW version ?)\n\n3. The numerical experiments are not that illuminating. They are on specific questions and situations already well known. The geometry matching one for instance is a niche topic, here on only one 3d mesh.The graph datasets used for clustering or graph matching are small.\n\n4. For graph clustering, did not understand how the parameters were chosen. The number of non-outliers node appear to be known. How can that relate to any practical situation ? How were set the other parameters ? Also, it is written on page 7:\n> This robustness is attributed to the partial matching property of FPGW.\n\nWhy that ? Any proof of this assertion ?\n\n5. In 4.2, is the fact that only 50% of the nodes are extracted a known fact ? It seems that globally the method is only valid if each node corresponds to a node in the other graph, while an interest of the OT approach for ML on graphs is that it allows a change of scale in some situations (one node might be matched to 5 or 10 in the second graph, if need be). Also, knowing $N_G$ in advance seems to be a weak point of the method.\n\n6. Table 1 has to be re-considered: are the std of the results (in %) precise up to 2 digits  ? How come some methods have a ±0.00 std ? This is not statistically sound. What is the unit of Time ? The results should include the FW algorithm. \n\n7. The example in 4.3 (geometry matching) is of limited impact. Also, the underlying task (“geometry matching task”) is not really detailed.\n\n8. A limitation of methods based on Fused GW is often the computation time. Is it also the case here ? Or not because of the sinkhorn version ? What is the theoretical complexity and its scaling ?\nThe used datasets for 4.1 and 4.2 are not fully described but they are quite small graphs. Can the method be extended to larger graphs (in terms of nodes) ? \n\n9. In the results, FUGW appear to have often similar performance than sink-FPGW (in Table 1). Is it the case ? Then, the contribution is about acceleration by using a sinkhorn algorithm, no ? Why is this acceleration not obtained on the Douban dataset ? Is is related to  the size of this dataset ?"}, "questions": {"value": "I have a small list of suggestions or questions, that will not change the weaknesses that I see in this article :\n\n- it seems that the definition of the total variation is not given (despite the 2 pages of notations). Also, it comes as $ \\Vert . \\Vert_{TV}$ or $ | . |_{TV}$ depending on the pages.\n\n- Titouan et al. (2019a) should be Vayer et al. (2019a)\n\n- Some misprints (examples: “postivie” on page 5 ; “RAPAMETER” in title M. ; “As shown in Table 2” on page 8 -> should be Table 1)\n\n-  Add some ablative or comparative study to assess whether using the TV distance is sound for this problem.\n\n- Compare the two proposed algorithms in many situations, and compare them better to existing approaches. For instance, it is not useful to compare them to methods assuming balanced sets, as this topic (partial/unbalanced vs balanced problem, has already been discussed in the literature).

Moreover authors should justify their choice of algorithm, as it does not seem to be able to solve the EFPGW problem but a relaxed version.\n\n- **W3: relations between FPGW and FMPGW**:\n   - I believe that Proposition K1 and so on should be mentioned in the main paper as these are important to understand the relevance of introducing two different solvers. Moreover the study of the relations between both OT problems seem incomplete as I believe that a user would be interested in how to link $\\lambda$ (in FPGW$ and $\\rho$ (in FMPGW). Could authors try to complete this proposition in this direction ?

Therefore i think it would be appropriate to increase the number of existing baselines able to leverage those, such as srFGW and FPGW (equivalent to FMPGW).\n   - Could authors explain the trick mentioned in eq.106 in the supplementary and its impact in the benchmark ? \n   - It is not clear how hyperparameters have been validated for each method include theirs, could authors detail that ?
