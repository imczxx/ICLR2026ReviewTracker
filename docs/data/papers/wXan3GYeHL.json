Traditional approaches rely heavily on handcrafted encodings of one-dimensional (1D) peptide sequences, which can limit generalizability across tasks and datasets. Recently, protein language models (PLMs), such as ESM-2 and ESMFold, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. However, they face two critical challenges. First, fine-tuning is computationally costly. Second, their complex latent representations hinder interpretability for domain experts. Additionally, many frameworks have been developed for specific types of peptide classification, lacking generalization. These limitations restrict the ability to connect model predictions to biologically relevant motifs and structural properties. To address these limitations, we present PepTriX, a novel framework that integrates one dimensional (1D) sequence embeddings and three-dimensional (3D) structural features via a graph attention network enhanced with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention. PepTriX automatically adapts to diverse datasets, producing task-specific peptide vectors while retaining biological plausibility. After evaluation by domain experts, we found that PepTriX performs remarkably well across multiple peptide classification tasks and provides interpretable insights into the structural and biophysical\nmotifs that drive predictions. Thus, PepTriX offers both predictive robustness and interpretable validation, bridging the gap between performance-driven peptide-level models (PLMs) and domain-level understanding in peptide research.", "tldr": "PepTriX is a framework for explainable peptide analysis that uses a graph attention network to combine 1D sequence embeddings with 3D structural features, enabling robust, interpretable, and generalizable predictions for peptide classification tasks.", "keywords": ["Representation Learning", "Computational Biology", "Protein Language Models", "Machine Learning", "XAI", "Contrastive Training", "Graph Attention Network"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/45746a542b21b71ee552516e70236be2cf85628a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/75af0dc7917e0072afdc7077ba595299589b1190.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The work presents a new model for peptide property prediction called PepTriX.

The framework is an assembly of standard parts: pre-trained ESM-2 embeddings, ESMFold for structure generation, a GAT for processing graphs, contrastive loss for modal alignment, and co-attention for heatmaps. The paper fails to prove that this specific combination provides a unique advantage that other, simpler combinations would lack.\n2. **Weak and Self-Contradictory Interpretability Claim:** The paper's primary contribution is purported to be interpretability. However, it criticizes other models' attention/saliency maps as potentially misleading but then offers its own co-attention heatmaps as a solution without any rigorous validation of their \"faithfulness.\" The analysis in Section 3 is purely qualitative and prone to the exact post-hoc rationalization that plagues attention-based interpretability.\n3. **Overstated Performance and Cost Claims:** The claim to \"match or exceed\" SOTA is not supported by the data in Table 2, which shows mixed results. Furthermore, the claim of being \"lightweight\" by avoiding fine-tuning is a strawman. The proposed method *replaces* fine-tuning with the non-trivial computational cost of running ESMFold inference for every peptide and then training a GAT on thousands of individual graphs. A much simpler and truly lightweight baseline (e.g., an MLP trained *only* on the ESM-2 embeddings) is not compared against, making it impossible to judge the utility of the entire 3D/GAT branch.\n4. **Unexplored Hybrid Loss:** The hybrid loss simultaneously optimizes for classification and seq-struct alignment. It is not demonstrated that this auxiliary contrastive task actually *helps* the primary classification task. The results in Table 3, showing that model performance is highly *insensitive* to the $\\lambda$ weight, are puzzling. This could imply the contrastive component has no meaningful impact, rendering a key part of the proposed method unnecessary. This is a critical point that is left unaddressed."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **On Interpretability:** The paper criticizes other attention mechanisms as potentially misleading. How does the proposed co-attention mechanism avoid these same pitfalls? Can the authors provide *quantitative* validation of their heatmaps' faithfulness (e.g., via-label-erasure experiments) rather than relying on qualitative, post-hoc stories?\n2. **On Novelty & Utility:** Given that the components (ESM embeddings, GATs, contrastive loss) are all standard, what is the core novel insight? Specifically, can the authors provide an ablation study that compares the full PepTriX model to a much simpler baseline, such as a 2-layer MLP trained *only* on the ESM-2 embeddings? This would be necessary to justify the added complexity and computational cost of the entire ESMFold/GAT structural branch.\n3. **On the Hybrid Loss:** The results in Table 3 show that performance is remarkably stable across different values of $\\lambda$. This is counter-intuitive and suggests the contrastive loss $\\mathcal{L}_{contrastive}$ might not be contributing meaningfully to the training. Could the authors elaborate on this? What happens if $\\lambda=0$? Is the performance identical? If so, this would invalidate the premise of the hybrid-loss approach.\n4. **On Performance Claims:** In light of the mixed results in Table 2 (e.g., `hiv_v3` baseline is 0.99 F1 vs. PepTriX's 0.97), would the authors consider toning down the claims of \"remarkable performance\" 44 to a more accurate \"comparable performance\"?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "AGYLCu5MY6", "forum": "wXan3GYeHL", "replyto": "wXan3GYeHL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12050/Reviewer_9rR3"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12050/Reviewer_9rR3"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12050/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761974169386, "cdate": 1761974169386, "tmdate": 1762923023813, "mdate": 1762923023813, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes PepTriX, a framework integrating ESM-2 sequence embeddings (1D) with ESMFold-derived 3D features via a Graph Attention Network (GAT).
