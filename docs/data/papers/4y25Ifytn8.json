This paper proposes a Tree-RAG acceleration method based on the improved Cuckoo Filter, which optimizes entity localization during the retrieval process to achieve significant performance improvements. Tree-RAG effectively organizes entities through the introduction of a hierarchical tree structure, while the Cuckoo Filter serves as an efficient data structure that supports rapid membership queries and dynamic updates. The experiment results demonstrate that our method is much faster than baseline methods while maintaining high levels of generative quality. For instance, our method is more than 800% faster than naive Tree-RAG on DART dataset.

Misrepresentation and unfair comparison of text-based RAG: the introduction claims that text-based RAG is slow due to complex language processing, which is misleading. In practice, Text-Based RAG leveraging efficient vector indexes (e.g., FAISS/HNSW) is often one of the fastest retrieval methods. Besides, the experimental setup is unfair. The reported retrieval times for Text-Based RAG are extremely long, suggesting that the authors likely used a brute-force search without any indexing. This is not a reasonable or competitive baseline, which undermines the paper's claims about its speed advantage.\n2. The core of this work is based on an existing data structure: the Cuckoo Filter. The main contributions are incremental improvements rather than a new framework or a fundamental shift in the RAG paradigm. Therefore, the conceptual novelty of this work is relatively limited.\n3. All experiments were conducted by selecting only 36 questions from each dataset. This sample size is too small and may lead to coincidental results, casting doubt on the statistical significance and generalizability of the findings."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Your Text-Based RAG baseline appears to lack a vector index, causing it to be unusually slow. Standard RAG implementations typically use efficient indexes like FAISS, and their retrieval speed often surpasses that of Tree-RAG.
