Although image tamper detection technology has made some progress, techniques specifically targeting CT image tampering detection are extremely scarce. This paper proposes a dual-branch feature fusion framework based on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for CT image tampering detection. This framework utilizes a ResNet-based generator to create tampered images that rich in edge and noise features, which are then fed into a dual-branch discriminator to separately learn noise and edge features. For the features learned by the discriminator, we designed a feature fusion module that captures complex relationships between features and selects different feature weights through a cross self-attention mechanism and dynamic feature selection. Additionally, we created a CT image tampering dataset and conducted comparative experiments with existing mainstream methods on public image tampering datasets and the self-made CT tampering image dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses good accuracy and robustness, providing an effective solution for CT image tamper detection.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["GenAI", "Feature fusion", "CT image forensics", "Robust detection"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7f723f3e77a0270d1ce269e2483beb93dc02599e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a dual-branch feature fusion framework based on GenAI for detecting tampering in medical CT images.\nThe main idea is to use a generator to synthesize tampered or forged CT images that help train a dual-branch discriminator, which separately models edge and noise cues and fuses them via a cross self-attention and adaptive feature pyramid (AC-FPN) module.\nThe authors also introduce a CT tampering dataset (6,000 images, including copy-move and splicing manipulations) and conduct experiments on both public datasets (CASIA, Columbia, NIST16, MSMC) and the proposed CT dataset, showing improved detection accuracy and robustness against perturbations such as rotation and noise."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.Addresses an important real-world problem — tampering in medical CT imaging — with potential relevance for medical forensics and data integrity.\n\n2.Proposes a clear modular structure (edge and noise branches with fusion), offering some interpretability for feature attribution.\n\n3.Introduces a CT tampering dataset and performs evaluations on multiple public datasets.\n\n4.Includes basic robustness and efficiency analyses (rotation, noise, inference time)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.Limited novelty – The framework is an incremental combination of known techniques (GANs, SRM filters, U-Net, FPN, attention).

While the problem of image tampering is important, the motivation for focusing specifically on CT images could be strengthened. The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the threat model. For instance, at what stage of the clinical workflow would such tampering occur (e.g., at the scanner, in the PACS)? What are the concrete real-world risks or documented cases that drive this research? Without a clearer discussion of these points, the significance of the problem remains somewhat speculative and the motivation feels underdeveloped.\n\n2. The authors claim that existing methods \"face technical limitations when dealing with complex tampering scenarios, including insufficient ability to recognize different types of tampering.\" I find this claim to be overstated. The problem of detecting complex tampering scenarios has been considered in prior work (e.g., MIML@CVPR'24), and the challenge of recognizing different tampering types has also been explicitly addressed (e.g., HiFi-Net).\n\n3. The proposed detection network appears to be quite generic and could seemingly be applied to natural images without much modification. The use of standard components like edge enhancement and SRM, which are common in natural image forensics, raises questions about the method's specific adaptation to CT imagery. The paper does not seem to incorporate any prior knowledge of CT imaging physics or specific anatomical constraints to explicitly address the challenges outlined in the introduction (e.g., high diversity, complex scenes).\n\n4. The paper argues that a key difference between CT and natural images is the high diversity of CT scans. This assertion is counter-intuitive. While there is patient variability, the domain of natural images (with countless objects, textures, lighting conditions, and complex scenes) is arguably far broader and more diverse than the relatively constrained domain of anatomical scans from CT devices.\n\n5. The selection of comparative methods is a significant weakness. The baselines are not representative of the current SOTA in image manipulation detection. The most recent method cited, HiFi-Net, was designed for a different task (hierarchical semantic segmentation) and its comparison here is not entirely fair. A more appropriate and recent baseline would be PSCC-Net (2022), and its absence makes it difficult to properly assess the proposed method's performance against the current SOTA.\n\n6. There is a discrepancy between the claims and the experiments. The introduction emphasizes the challenge of handling diverse tampering types, yet the quantitative results in Table 2 only report performance on two types of manipulation. The evaluation should be expanded to encompass the variety of tampering scenarios discussed.\n\n7. The authors report a much larger performance gain on the natural image dataset (NIST) compared to their custom CT dataset. This is a curious result that warrants a detailed analysis, which is currently missing. Does this imply the method is, in fact, better suited for natural images than for CT images? This could undermine the central premise of the paper.\n\n8. The robustness evaluation includes image rotation. This is not a realistic transformation for CT scan data in a clinical context, as axial scans have a fixed anatomical orientation. This experiment seems irrelevant and suggests a lack of domain-specific consideration in the evaluation design.\n\n9. The section on the custom CT dataset generation raises several questions. Are any measures taken to ensure the anatomical plausibility of the manipulated images? The manipulations appear to be limited to lesions. Furthermore, if the tampered lesions are sourced from images acquired by the same CT scanner as the target image, the effectiveness of noise-based forensic methods like SRM, which often rely on detecting inconsistencies in device fingerprints, is questionable. This aspect requires a more thorough justification."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "yqxm7BwSMS", "forum": "Jl0dy1YOAu", "replyto": "Jl0dy1YOAu", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17438/Reviewer_8B16"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17438/Reviewer_8B16"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17438/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761795184471, "cdate": 1761795184471, "tmdate": 1762927328545, "mdate": 1762927328545, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a dual-branch feature fusion framework, leveraging generative AI (GenAI) for robust detection of tampering in medical CT images.
