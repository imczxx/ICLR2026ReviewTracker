We highlight the importance of aligning a diffusion language model’s preference-inference trajectory with its post-training objective. To this end, we propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for DLMs that incorporates information from inference trajectories into post-training and is applicable to both full-attention and block-attention diffusion models. We also introduce a diffusion-based value model that enhances training stability and naturally accommodates process rewards. We demonstrate TraceRL’s superiority in enhancing a model’s reasoning ability on complex math and coding tasks, as well as its applicability in scaling block diffusion models to larger block sizes. Employing TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models, namely TraDo. Although smaller than Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, TraDo-4B-Instruct consistently outperforms it on complex math reasoning tasks. TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves 4.5% higher accuracy on MATH500 than Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 6.6% higher accuracy on LiveCodeBench-V2 than Llama3.1-8B-Instruct.

TraceRL improves previous DLM RL methods, but the performance gain through TraceRL is still marginal (4%\\~5% on very simple benchmarks like MATH500).

Post-training is critical to LLMs, while the significance of DLM RL remains questionable given the marginal improvement.\n- Incremental Novelty. The paper positions TraceRL as a novel framework that, unlike prior work, uses information \"embedded in the sampling trajectory.\" However, most policy gradient RL methods are inherently \"trajectory-aware.\", especially the diffusion RL methods like FlowGRPO/DanceGRPO. The objective function in Equation 3 appears to be a standard PPO-style implementation applied to the steps of a diffusion process, which has already been done in FlowGRPO/DanceGRPO. The novelty seems to lie in the specific application to DLMs rather than a fundamental innovation in RL methodology.\n- Overclaiming in the Title and Narrative. The title uses the word \"Revolutionizing,\" which sets an exceptionally high bar that the contributions, while solid, do not appear to meet. The work does not fundamentally change the paradigm of diffusion RL.\n- Confounding Effect of Long-CoT Fine-Tuning. The TraDo-8B-Thinking model achieves the most impressive results (e.g., 87.4% on MATH500). However, this model is the result of first applying TraceRL and then performing an additional semi-autoregressive fine-tuning step on the OpenThoughts dataset. A significant portion of the performance lift is likely attributable to the long-CoT data, and it is unclear how much TraceRL contributes. Even without TraceRL, the high-quality data of OpenThoughts itself could bring huge performance improvement. Notably, the OpenThinker-v3 7B autoregressive model tuned with the OpenThoughts dataset achieves an AIME2024 score of 69, significantly higher than TraDo-8B-Thinking's 35.5.
