However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Mesh Simulation", "Physics Simulation", "Fluid Dynamics"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3449481a2cf58a46f69eeafbce6305c45a9cd9c3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose AdaMeshNet, a framework that introduces adaptive graph rewiring during the message-passing process, as opposed to static rewiring methods that perform all rewiring before GNN training.

The evaluation is restricted to two fluid datasets (CylinderFlow and Airfoil). Broader validation on non-fluid domains (e.g., deformable solids, elastic plates, cloth dynamics) would better demonstrate generality.\n2. The key rewiring criterion — connecting nodes with large velocity differences — is directly inherited from PIORF (Yu et al., 2025), potentially diminishing the novelty of the contribution. I suggest investigating other physical quantities (e.g., pressure, density, or vorticity) that might be more appropriate for different physical systems. For example, pressure and density gradients dominate the dynamics in compressible fluids, whereas in deformable solids or elastic media, strain or stress fields may play a more important role. Limiting the rewiring signal to velocity may be suboptimal or even physically inconsistent in other regimes.\n3. While the delay-based rewiring is motivated by gradual propagation in fluids, it remains unclear how the same mechanism adapts to physics where interaction speed or propagation modality differs (e.g., elastic or collision dynamics).\n4. Prior works [1–5] employ hierarchical or multiscale connectivity learning to address long-range information loss. Discussion or comparison with these approaches would help clarify how AdaMeshNet differs from such hierarchical designs.\n5.

This mechanism delays the addition of new edges to specific message-passing layers based on a \"rewiring delay score.\"\n\nWhile the paper addresses a relevant problem and shows slight empirical improvements, I must recommend **Reject**.\n\nThe work suffers from three critical flaws:\n1.  The core physics-informed rewiring strategy (identifying bottlenecks with Ollivier-Ricci Curvature and connecting them to nodes with maximal velocity difference) is not novel and is adopted directly from prior art, PIORF. The only novelty is an algorithmic tweak to *delay* this connection.\n2.  The entire justification for this delay is that instantaneous interactions are \"physically wrong\". This is fundamentally incorrect for the paper's primary benchmark, CylinderFlow which models *incompressible* flow. In this regime, information (pressure) propagates *instantaneously* by definition.\n3.  The core mechanism, the \"rewiring delay score\" (Eq. 8), is dimensionally incoherent. It compares a unitless GNN layer index $l$ to a score $s_{delay}$ that, by its formulation (unitless distance divided by velocity), must have physical units ($Time/Length$). This comparison is physically and mathematically meaningless.\n\nThe paper is an incremental work, while it's intuition is physically unjustified, and mathematically flawed."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The ablation study effectively demonstrates that both the distance and velocity components of the heuristic score (Eq. 8) are necessary to achieve the reported performance."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  The paper presents its physics-informed selection strategy as novel. However, the entire logic—(1) identify topological bottlenecks using node-level ORC, and select a rewiring target $v_{i^*}$ that maximizes the velocity difference $||v_i - v_j||$—is identical to the strategy proposed in the PIORF paper[1]; The *only* novel contribution of this work is the calculation of $s_{delay}$ to decide *when* to add this pre-selected edge, which is an incremental modification, not a \"novel framework\".\n\n2. The paper's central premise is that modeling the \"gradual propagation of physical interactions\" is more realistic than assuming \"instantaneous interactions\". This justification is in direct conflict with the physics of the paper's main benchmark. The CylinderFlow dataset models incompressible flow. In an incompressible fluid, the speed of sound is infinite, and thus information (propagated via the pressure field) is, by definition, \"sensed instantaneously at all other points in the fluid\". The \"flaw\" this paper claims to fix is, in fact, the *correct* physical assumption for this system. The authors appear to be conflating the *advection* of mass (which takes time) with the *propagation* of information (which is instantaneous in this model).\n\n3.  The paper's core mechanism, Eq. 8, does not make sense dimensionally speaking, it's using some dimensionless quantity to divide realistic velocity. Also, the usage of geodesic minimal (edge-count) distance does not make sense too, as for FVM (finite volume method) simulation, the velocity is never defined on the edge.\n\n4.  The paper provides a standard definition for ORC, which involves computing the $W_1$ distance. This is known to be computationally expensive, requiring the solution of a linear programming problem for each edge. The only exception is for bi-partite graph or graph with girth >=5 [2]. But here we have triangular mesh (girth=3). PIORF performs this expensive calculation *once* as a preprocessing step. In contrast, AdaMeshNet's Algorithm 1 places the *entire* preprocessing step—including the ORC calculation and the $O(N^2)$ search for optimal partners—*inside* the main training loop, to be run *every epoch*. This suggests a prohibitive increase in computational cost, however the paper does not report implementation details or timing.\n\n[1] https://openreview.net/forum?id=qkBBHixPow\n[2] https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/sumitm/Ricci.pdf"}, "questions": {"value": "1.  How do the authors justify the core premise of \"gradual propagation\" when the CylinderFlow dataset models incompressible flow, where pressure propagation is instantaneous?\n2.  Can the authors provide a dimensional analysis for Equation 8? How can the unitless layer index $l$ be mathematically compared to $s_{delay}$, which (based on its components) has units of $Time/Length$?\n3.  The calculation of $W_1$ for ORC on triangular meshes is non-trivial and requires solving a linear program. How is this step practically implemented? Is a numerical optimizer used, and if so, why is this extremely expensive step placed *inside* the main training loop (Algorithm 1) rather than as a one-time preprocessing step?
