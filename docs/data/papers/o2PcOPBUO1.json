A primary mechanism that non-coding driver mutations contribute to cancer is by affecting gene expression, potentially from millions of nucleotides away. However, existing predictors of gene expression from mutations are unable to simultaneously handle interactions spanning millions of base pairs, the extreme sparsity of somatic mutations, and generalize to unseen genes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GenVarFormer (GVF), a novel transformer-based architecture designed to learn mutation representations and their impact on gene expression. GVF efficiently predicts the effect of mutations up to 8 million base pairs away from a gene by only considering mutations and their local DNA context, while omitting the vast intermediate sequence. Using data from 864 breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we demonstrate that GVF predicts gene expression with 26-fold higher correlation across samples than current models. In addition, GVF is the first model of its kind to generalize to unseen genes and samples simultaneously. Finally, we find that GVF patient embeddings are more informative than ground-truth gene expression for predicting overall patient survival in the most prevalent breast cancer subtype, luminal A. GVF embeddings and gene expression yielded concordance indices of $0.706^{\\pm0.136}$ and $0.573^{\\pm0.234}$, respectively.

Gene expression is a function of all variants, germline and somatic. In fact, germline mutations are one of the main reasons different people have significantly different prognosis and outcomes. I don’t believe germline mutations can be left for future work in this context.\n- All training/eval is on 864 TCGA breast tumors; there’s no external cohort (e.g., CPTAC) or pan-cancer validation, so generalizability is unclear. \n- There are many existing tools (AlphaGenome, BigRNA, ChromBPNet, DeepSEA, Enformer, etc) that predict the consequences of genomic variants on chromatin accessibility, histone marks, TF/RBP binding, promoter activity, (alternative) splicing, gene expression, etc. Why are none of them used here? Sure, the cellular context in cancer cells will be different, but the model will be able to learn it.   \n- Depending on cancer type, a significant number of genes (in particular tumor suppressors) are silenced through hyper-methylation of their promoters (CpG islands). How are absence of epigenomic factors handled in this analysis? On that note, how is the performance breakdown across oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and other gene groups?\n- In most cancers, a small number of activated key oncogenes start de-regulating cellular processing with massive consequences, e.g., change in expression of other genes, not because they have somatic mutations, but due to other genes being activated or silenced. What will be GVF's performance in such cases?  \n- The authors mention that one of the major benefits of their method over others is its generalizability to new genes, such as fusion products. How can this be validated in TCGA data?\n- If Borzoi cannot be fine-tuned due to resource constraints, it should not be included. A Pearson correlation of 0.0043, which is most likely not statistically significant, is not very informative. \n- A correlation number by itself, especially when it is only 0.22, is not very meaningful. A couple of examples of how GVF can find hallmark genes with significant predicted and observed differential expression will be helpful.\n- The authors predict “in silico purified” cancer expression (InstaPrism) and also regress out the top 10 PCs before z-scoring; both steps can remove real signal or introduce target noise/bias. There are genuine differences between subtypes, which seems to be wiped out (Figs. 4A and B).\n- The survival analysis results use linear probes and are strongest only in luminal A (where are Luminal B and Her2?); robustness across subtypes and cohorts remains untested.

This finding only holds for one of two tested cancer subtypes (Luminal A) and is not statistically robust, as indicated by the large and overlapping confidence intervals. This high variance is likely a direct consequence of the small dataset.\n\n- While the 26-fold improvement over the lasso baseline is striking, this baseline's performance is near zero.

Unfortunately, the lack of details and broader context in describing the application (cancer mutations and their effect), as well as in placing the results in context of other bioinformatics approaches, do not show clear evidence that the proposed method substantially advances machine learning-based cancer bioinformatics. \n\nThe manuscript is missing some crucial information that would put the work in context, especially for a broader machine learning audience. For example, while the introduction highlights the sparsity of mutations along the DNA, it does not provide information about the distribution of distances of regulatory sites that may be affected by these mutations from the TSS of genes they regulate. Without this information, it is unclear whether the selected window size of 16M is sufficient, or necessary.\n\nFurther, within the 16M window, the method operates by focusing on smaller window around mutation sites. The experimental section is vague in terms of how are mutations selected – are all mutations present in TCGA within the window used, or some approach is used to select driver mutations?\n\nIt is also unclear how much DNA (how many bps) the method actually utilizes in making the prediction. The sentence “GVF uses a DNA context window of 16Mbp” should be rephrased: for a general machine learning audience, this is understood as indicating that the Transformer model in GVF takes DNA sequences that are 16Mbp long on input (the phrase “context window” has a precise technical meaning in LLM-related domain), while in fact it seems to take embeddings of 32bp sequences from each of the n mutations present within 16Mbp (in that sense, it is more similar to a RAG system, using LLM terms). It is not clear from the experimental section what are the typical number of mutations (i.e., how many 32bp windows are being embedded and presented to the Transformer model). For comparison, Borzoi model takes on input a full 0.5Mbp sequence of DNA. \n\nThe experimental results from evaluating the model are weak, and presented without much discussion. Predictive accuracy, as measured by Person’s rho, is very low (average of .21), but the utility of having a predictive model of expression changes with this level of accuracy is not discussed. In predicting expression changes from mutations, in a somewhat different experimental setup, Enformer and Borzoi achieve values mostly in the 0.4-0.6 range (see Liner et al, 2023, supplemental data/figures). Further, Fig 3B indicates that accuracy on “unseen genes and samples” is somewhat higher than for “unseen genes”, yet this surprising result is not discussed.\n\nResults on predicting downstream clinical variables are also low (e.g. AUROC of 0.56 for early/late stage prediction), yet again are presented without discussion or context (e.g. what are the reference values for predicting overall/progression-free survival for these cancer types using existing established approaches)."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "oCQgh2wtGP", "forum": "o2PcOPBUO1", "replyto": "o2PcOPBUO1", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24265/Reviewer_e2vU"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24265/Reviewer_e2vU"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24265/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762116215512, "cdate": 1762116215512, "tmdate": 1762943023220, "mdate": 1762943023220, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
