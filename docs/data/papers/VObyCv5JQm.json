This paper explores optimal conference protocols --- rules for designing review tasks to reviewers and inferring paper quality based on the noisy review.  The widely used *direct review* protocol assigns multiple independent reviewers to each paper in an *isolated* and *parallel* manner.  However, as submission volumes grow, more complex protocols have developed, e.g., two-phase review and meta-review.\n\nIn this paper, we investigate whether and when these more complex *joint* and *adaptive* protocols can reduce the *review load ratio*, the number of review tasks per paper.  Using tools from information theory and coding theory, we establish the following results:\n- We prove that the optimal load ratio for isolated protocols is $\\Theta(\\ln n/\\epsilon)$, where $n$ is the number of papers and $\\epsilon$ is the error probability indicating that the review load ratio increases as the number of papers grows.\n- We prove that the optimal load ratio of joint protocols is a constant dependent on the agents' noise levels and independent of both $n$ and $\\epsilon$.  This suggests that joint protocols—including two-phase review—can dramatically reduce the review burden.\n- We empirically explore the design of two-phase review protocols and find that selecting the borderline (ambiguous) papers for the second phase review can significantly increase the accuracy compared to the conventional selection of a better fraction of promising papers for the second phase.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["crowdsourcing", "peer review", "coding theory"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2402cbb2eed16a0eac847752bd7db8769655c769.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/13007b869f509c46649497cd86aae58ee0b0ff80.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies the reviewer load ratio (the number of tasks assigned to each reviewer) across different types of review processes using a mathematical framework.

Conceptual Modeling Issues\n The central weakness of the paper lies in the abstraction of “review tasks.” Reviewers are modeled as costless information channels that can be assigned arbitrarily complex evaluations over arbitrary subsets of papers. In practice, reviewers incur cost proportional to the number and complexity of papers they read. The model effectively allows a “joint” task to involve reading many papers but charges only a single unit of review cost. This assumption drives the main result that joint protocols can achieve constant load ratios—it seems to be a mathematical artifact of the cost model, not a property of real reviewing systems.\n If reviewer cost were proportional to the number of papers read (as it must be in any realistic setting), the supposed advantage of joint protocols would largely vanish.\n2. Ambiguous and Inconsistent Definitions\n Several key quantities are ambiguously defined:\n$ε$ appears to represent the probability of making any mistake, not the expected error per paper. This distinction (analogous to FWER vs. FDR) is never made explicit and dramatically affects the asymptotic interpretation.\n\n\nThe “noise parameters” $q_i$​ are described as being drawn from a distribution $D_q$​ over agents (174), but the formalism indexes them by task, implying each task draws an independent noise level. This makes the model equivalent to an infinite pool of independent labelers and removes inter-task correlation—essentially turning the conference problem into a pure crowdsourcing model.\n If this interpretation is intended, it should be made explicit; otherwise, the assumptions and notation should be revised to define noise per reviewer rather than per task.\n\n\n3. Mathematical and Presentation Ambiguities\nThe asymptotic notation $Θ(\\ln n/ε)$ is written ambiguously and later used interchangeably with $Θ(\\ln (n/ε))$. This needs correction.\n\n\nTheorem 4.5’s claim (specifically the parallel upper-bound; the lower bound seems fine) that joint protocols can achieve load independent of $ε$ seems inconsistent with the $n=1$ special case, where all protocols are tautologically isolated, and estimation reduces to testing the polarity of a Bernoulli, which obviously depends on $ε$. Either the theorem omits conditions on $n$, or the upper bound derivation hides a residual logarithmic dependence.\n\n\nFigure 1’s axes, colors, and line types are not clearly labeled, and it is unclear what $x,y,z$ represent. The caption for Figure 1D likely contains a typo (“joint and adaptive”).\n\n\n4. Questionable Interpretations and Motivation\n The “successive review tasks” example illustrates this modeling problem vividly. Each reviewer supposedly checks whether the previous report was correct—a task that, under the model, provides exactly the same information as directly reviewing the paper, while in practice it requires more effort (reading the paper and the prior review). This suggests that isolated adaptive tasks cannot outperform direct evaluation, which is true but trivial. If this is meant to be a theoretical generalization of Blackwell’s theorem for isolated tasks, that connection should be stated plainly.\n5. Writing and Style\n The paper is readable but needs proofreading:\n“rules for designing review tasks to reviewer” → assigning review tasks to reviewers\n\n\n“the review load ratio, the number of review tasks per paper” → should use “i.e.,” parentheses, or a colon.\n\n\n“final estimation’s error probability” → final estimate’s.\n\n\nMisuse of \\citet throughout; many should be parenthetical.\n\n165 Avoid referencing “Section 3” from within Section 3.\n\n\n169 Typographic style description is a bit nonstandard. “Normal”  may be more clearly described as “Roman” or “upright,” and outcomes (or just variables) should probably be described as “bold(face)” and “bold-italic.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThese issues, combined with mathematical ambiguities, make the work difficult to follow. As a result, the formal results appear more surprising than they actually are—once unpacked, the conclusions mostly restate intuitive facts about the relative information limits of isolated versus non-isolated systems."}, "questions": {"value": "Have you considered allowing for a fixed expected error rate rather than a global error bound $ε$? Would the asymptotic behavior of isolated versus joint protocols remain distinct?\n\n\nHow would your results change if reviewer cost scaled linearly with the number of papers read in a joint task?\n\n\nAre $q_i$​ known constants or latent random variables? Or are they observed? How are they estimated or incorporated into the design of optimal protocols? This point is very unclear, but they seem to be known, and if so, this is another conceptual limitation, as actually knowing these probabilities seems difficult.\n\n\n225-231: What’s the point of successive review tasks as defined here? Aren’t the reviewers doing more work (now they have to read the original paper and all the reviews!), only to give the exact same information (by the theoretical model, they are equivalent)? Is the point that any isolated protocol can never ask the reviewers any task that is better than “is the original paper good”? As far as I can tell, the Blackwell argument essentially formalizes this idea over the space of isolated review problems, but in this more narrow domain, it's quite obvious.\n\n\n\n\n*I suspect the answers to the last 2 questions are trivial, but they highlight potential fragility in the distinctions the paper draws between settings, which seems to be a serious limitation.*"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "VFeCRhcidw", "forum": "VObyCv5JQm", "replyto": "VObyCv5JQm", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14435/Reviewer_CHLn"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14435/Reviewer_CHLn"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14435/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762045731870, "cdate": 1762045731870, "tmdate": 1762924840731, "mdate": 1762924840731, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
