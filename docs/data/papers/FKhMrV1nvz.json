In this paper, we present a novel instruction tuning framework designed to enhance LLMs' symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our approach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical inference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through the precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied in a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes through structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification skills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about precondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation. Experimental results on multiple planning domains show that our chain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly better at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This work bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising direction for developing better AI planning systems.", "tldr": "Enhancing Symbolic PDDL Planning Capabilities in LLMs through Logical Chain-of-Thought Instruction Tuning", "keywords": ["Automated Planning", "Chain-of-Thought", "Instruction Tuning", "Large Language Models", "Verification"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b7004992259dd870da3496d185e43140df268d34.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose the PDDL-Instruct framework, a model finetuning approach, to improve Large Language Models abilities on sequential planning tasks.

The central move is to turn plan generation into explicit state–action–state chains and supervise them with a formal validator (VAL) that checks preconditions, effects, and goal satisfaction. Training is staged: first general instruction-tuning with explanations (including negative examples), then a chain-of-thought phase with two objectives: a step-level “reasoning-chain” loss over ⟨si−1, ai, si⟩ triplets and a final plan-validity loss. On PlanBench-style tasks, reported accuracy gains over base models and a Phase-1-only ablation are large, with the strongest results when using detailed validator feedback and more feedback iterations.\n\nThe contribution is best viewed as an integrative advance rather than a new paradigm. Each major component has precedent namely: instruction tuning, chain-of-thought prompting, and external verification, but the paper’s value lies in packaging them into a coherent training loop that treats symbolic planning as verifiable, stepwise reasoning and shows strong empirical gains. The two-stage loss that first optimizes step-level reasoning chains and then end-task validity is a nice, concrete design choice; using detailed validator feedback to supervise CoT at the triplet level is what most clearly differentiates this from prior self-critique/reflection approaches."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Data and compute loop: accuracy improves with more VAL-guided iterations (n), but the cost/benefit curve and stopping criteria are not fully characterized.\n4.

Ablate the effect of modified VAL outputs in training (show effect when you never tamper with VAL).\n6. Generalization claims need clearer definition. The paper uses “generalization” loosely; clarify whether this means cross-domain transfer (different domain file), larger problem instances, or semantic obfuscation (Mystery Blocksworld). Provide explicit transfer experiments (train on a set of domains, test on held-out domains).\n7.  Test set contamination risk: The paper states \"We remove the solution plans from datasets D₂ and D_test\" but doesn't clarify if D₂ and D_test contain problems from the same domains with different configurations. If test problems are structurally similar to training problems within the same three domains, this raises concerns about memorization vs. generalization."}, "questions": {"value": "1. You state you sometimes alter VAL outputs to create incorrect explanations for a few plans (Sec. 5.1). Why was this done? How many examples were altered and what safeguards ensure the model does not learn incorrect inference from corrupted feedback?\n\n2.

If not possible, explain limitations and expected failure modes.\n\n3. How robust are the CoT traces? Provide examples of unfaithful CoT traces (CoT that looks plausible but the plan fails) and quantify how often your external verifier catches such unfaithful traces. Compare this to literature on CoT unfaithfulness.\n\n4. In result section I see SD value is quite high, why paper have such a high SD value. I assume SD mean standard deviation, correct me If I am wrong. Is it due to high temperature setting of the LLM?\n\n5.
