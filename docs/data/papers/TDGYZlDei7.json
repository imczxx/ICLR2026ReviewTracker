The authors argue that prior agents suffer from three coupled issues: (1) historical information is lost when policies act only from the current egocentric view, (2) scene representations are inconsistent because 2D predictions are lifted to 3D through noisy depth, and (3) execution is rigid because the agent cannot interrupt a long navigation plan when a nearer manipulable target appears. The proposed method, SCOUT, has two main components. First, a Spatial-Aware Continual Scene Understanding module maintains a BEV-like 3D scene feature over time using spatial cross attention (projecting 3D points into the current image to fetch the right 2D features, thus avoiding depth estimation) and temporal cross attention (fusing the previous scene feature to preserve memory). It also has a mask-query module that pools object-specific 3D features and aligns them with 2D image features to produce pixel-level interaction masks. Second, a Switch Policy combines a rule-based long-term planner (BFS over the semantic scene map) with a learned short-term planner that can interrupt navigation whenever an object is both semantically correct and spatially reachable. On ALFRED, this yields higher success rates than prior work, including DISCO, in both seen and unseen settings and improves path-length–weighted metrics."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper is well motivated: it spells out three concrete failure modes in existing embodied agents (history loss, inconsistent 3D grounding, non-adaptive execution) and maps each to a specific component of the method, so the design is coherent.\n2. The scene-understanding part is a sensible adaptation of BEV-style and deformable-attention ideas to single-view, temporally accumulated embodied data: instead of lifting 2D to 3D with predicted depth (which causes error accumulation), it pulls 2D features from projected 3D points, and then keeps temporal consistency with a dedicated temporal cross attention.\n3. The Switch Policy directly targets a real ALFRED failure case: once the agent turns, a closer instance of the target may appear, and executing the long plan is wasteful. The proposed dual planner (long-term BFS + learned short-term classifier) is a simple but effective way to cut extra steps, which is supported by higher path-length–weighted metrics and the qualitative example.\n4. Ablation studies are thorough. Removing temporal cross attention causes large drops; removing the switch policy reduces both success and efficiency; using ground-truth masks gives only small gains, which means the proposed mask-query module is already strong. This makes the main result credible.\n5. The method achieves clearly better numbers than strong baselines under both step-by-step and goal-only instruction settings on the official test split, which is nontrivial for ALFRED."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. On the perception side, the contribution is mostly integrative. The method reuses established ingredients (BEV-style scene feature, deformable attention, 3D→2D projection, 2D–3D feature alignment) and repackages them for ALFRED. The novelty is more in the way these are combined and supervised than in a fundamentally new learning component.\n2. The switch policy is only partly learned. The long-horizon component is still a hand-designed BFS over the semantic map, and only the short-horizon “is this manipulable now?” part is trained. This makes the contribution feel somewhat engineered and raises questions about portability to other simulators or to real robots where the semantic map is noisy.\n3. The evaluation is confined to ALFRED. Because the method is tuned to ALFRED’s discretization (25 m × 25 m, 25 cm grid, 100 × 100 best) and to its task structure, the generality of the approach is not fully demonstrated. Even a small experiment on a second embodied benchmark would strengthen the claim.\n4. The model is relatively heavy (100 × 100 grid, spatial and temporal deformable attention, two segmentation losses), and training uses 8 GPUs for a day, but there is no careful runtime/latency comparison to prior work. For practical embodied deployment, this information would be useful.\n5. The paper itself admits that it cannot handle open-vocabulary objects or reason about objects hidden/contained inside others, which are active directions in current embodied AI."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can the switching decision itself be learned end-to-end (for example, via RL over the two planners) rather than partially hand-coded?\n2.
