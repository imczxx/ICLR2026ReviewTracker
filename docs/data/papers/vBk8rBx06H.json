We refer to this failure mode as  merging collapse. Intuitively, collapse arises when the learned representations or parameter adjustments for different tasks are fundamentally incompatible, so that merging forces destructive interference rather than synergy.\nIn this paper, we identify and characterize the phenomenon of task-level merging collapse, where certain task combinations consistently trigger huge performance degradation across all merging methods. \nThrough extensive experiments and statistical analysis, we demonstrate that representational incompatibility between tasks is strongly correlated with merging collapse, while parameter-space conflict metrics show minimal correlation, challenging conventional wisdom in model merging literature.\nWe provide a theoretical explanation on this phenomenon through rate-distortion theory with a dimension-dependent bound, establishing fundamental limits on task mergeability regardless of methodology.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Model Merging", "Task Vector", "Multi-task Learning"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7c6d99330e5b2e41db86aebd4e7be8b3baba3634.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f423f4fe63224e1f0d586ec0549959879db0569c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Model merging is a popular method to efficiently build a multi-task model.

This omission limits the contextualization of the proposed study and leaves unclear how it connects to or extends prior understanding of merging failure.\n- Evaluating the hidden-state diameter $\\Delta$ or the distortion $\\delta_{max}$ requires access to hidden representations across all fine-tuned models and the entire input distribution, which is generally infeasible in realistic multi-task or large-scale settings.\nThus, although the bound provides theoretical insight into when merging is doomed to fail, it is difficult to operationalize as a predictive or diagnostic tool.\n- The statement of the theorem is not clear; some symbols are not well explained beforehand. \nThe symbol $D$ (and $D^*$) is introduced without a clear definition. \nIt appears to correspond to some notion of ``distortion'' or hidden-state mismatch, but no explicit mathematical formulation is given. \nLikewise, the term distortion is used interchangeably with $\\delta_{\\max}(\\hat{\\theta})$ in the main theorem, but this identification is never formally stated. \nIn the proof, $\\delta_i(\\hat{\\theta})$ is not defined; I assumed it was meant to be\n$\n\\delta_i(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\mathbb{E}_X \\big\\| H_i(X) - h(X; \\hat{\\theta}) \\big\\|_2^2 .\n$\nMoreover, the proof contains some small issues in Step~1: the paper's wording makes it sound as if the coefficients $\\alpha$ are fixed \\emph{a priori} and then one finds the center of the convex hull. \nUnder this interpretation, it is not true that $h(x; \\bar{\\theta})$ coincides with $c(x)$. \nWhat is true is that, by Jung's Theorem, there exists a set of coefficients (depending on $x$) such that the convex combination (that is, the center) minimizes the worst-case distance to all $H_i(x)$. \nIf this same set of coefficients defines a parameter merge, then this merge achieves the minimum possible worst-case hidden-state distortion. \nIn any case, the statements appear correct to me. \n- table 7-10 are not clear, what are the columns in this tables?
