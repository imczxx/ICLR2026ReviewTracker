However, directly applying these methods to graph data is challenging: (1) standard discrepancy measures neglect structural information, and (2) noise in graphs tends to be propagated and amplified through structural dependencies, ultimately degrading imputation performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Relaxed Graph Spectral Discrepancy (RGSD), a discrepancy designed to compare sets of graphs by capturing both structural patterns and inter-node correlations through spectral decomposition, along with a selective matching regularization to mitigate the impact of noise. Building on RGSD, we introduce the RGSD for Imputation (RGSImp) framework, which iteratively refines graph imputation results by minimizing the RGSD between observed and imputed data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that RGSImp effectively incorporates graph structure and node correlations, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art graph imputation methods in both imputation accuracy and downstream tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Wasserstein Balancing", "Graph Attribute Imputation"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0798c8f34f519e5e2607fc3d2c5ecf537b32ed6c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the problem of missing node feature imputation in graph-structured data.

RGSImp builds upon the existing alignment-based imputation framework, which assumes that different batches drawn from the same dataset should exhibit consistent distributions. Thus, imputation can be performed by iteratively resampling incomplete batches and updating missing entries to minimize inter-batch distributional discrepancies. When generalizing the alignment-based framework to graph data, the authors observe that existing discrepancy measurements do not consider graph structural information and are sensitive to noise, an issue that is prevalent in graph data, thus degrading imputation performance. To resolve these issues, the authors first propose the Pairwise Graph Spectral Discrepancy (PGSD), a discrepancy measurement designed to compare graphs by capturing both structural patterns and inter-node correlations via the Graph Fourier Transform. Specifically, two graphs are first projected into spectral domains, and then their discrepancy is computed. Then, the authors proposed a new discrepancy matching objective, called Relaxed Graph Spectral Discrepancy (RGSD), which is designed to tolerate noise present in graph data.
