However, the first contribution—ternary spiking—has already been widely adopted in SNN research. The third contribution—dynamic thresholding—has also been extensively explored in prior SNN literature. Regarding the fourth contribution, the near-exact PCN approximation resembles a conversion or distillation process; therefore, clarification is needed on whether it should be viewed as a form of teacher–student distillation rather than an independent methodological innovation.\n\n2. The manuscript argues that surrogate-gradient-based backpropagation is biologically implausible due to reliance on global gradients, whereas DiffPC uses local plasticity and is thus more brain-like. However, validating DiffPC only on MLP architectures does not substantiate this claim. The experiments do not reveal whether a fully local learning mechanism can scale to larger networks. More importantly, when every layer is trained exclusively through DiffPC, the paper does not analyze how network depth or size influences final model performance.\n\n3. Although the paper emphasizes its relevance to neuromorphic tasks, no temporal benchmarks are included. Evaluation on event-driven datasets would be necessary to support this claim.\n\n4.
