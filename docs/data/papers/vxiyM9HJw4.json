Static embeddings from algorithmic approaches (network theory) cannot serve this role. Ultimately in my opinion, the hyperbolic learning community targets at an end-to-end hyperbolic networks that can replace existing Euclidean-based networks on some tasks. And it's already well-established how important learnable embedding layers are.\n\n- The focus on metrics is also somewhat misplaced, since for downstream tasks (e.g., node or graph classification), the rank and precision of distances is very relevant to downstream performance, that truly matters, especially considering current e.g. classification algorithms are largely dependent on the hyperbolic distance. \n\n- Some reported results appear unreliable—for example, the 2D Poincaré and Lorentz embeddings from Nickel and Kiela (2017, 2018) were not reproduced, even though they were already shown in many following ML works, can be reproduced. \n\n- The framing of the paper is also misleading: it reads more like a survey rather than a genuine attempt to bridge ML and algorithms due to the reasons stated above."}, "questions": {"value": "- How do the authors envision static embeddings from network theory adapting to downstream ML tasks that require trainable representations?\n\n- what causes the non-reproducibility of Poincaré/Lorentz experiment results?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "JfLaBN3ayP", "forum": "vxiyM9HJw4", "replyto": "vxiyM9HJw4", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10604/Reviewer_VCXG"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10604/Reviewer_VCXG"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10604/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761812336693, "cdate": 1761812336693, "tmdate": 1762921869556, "mdate": 1762921869556, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Hyperbolic embedding is a well-studied technique for graph representation learning.

The authors should use benchmarks that create ground-truth networks generated in the hyperbolic space using the nonuniform popularity similarity model (nPSO) that allows also the creation of mesoscale community structure in artificial networks as many real networks have. Then they should use measures for the order of nodes on angular coordinates, the hyperbolic distance correlation and the angular separability index of the community. In particular, the presence of community in the benchmark is fundamental because they are a property that justifies why methods such as Hypermap and HypermapCN did not work well, because being based on the simple PSO model they did not have a parameter to model the community organization of real networks. \n\nThe test on real networks are not convincing because as a matter of fact the authors do not offer any quantitative evidence that these networks are hyperbolic and the measures they use are all empirical and ill posed. For instance, assuming that a network is embedded better because their greedy stretch factor is higher is misleading. In reality, every network has a complex system on the back with an intrinsic navigability and over-estimating it is wrong. \n\nThe measure of Greedy stretch factor for navigability is old and surpassed. Measures such as the greedy routing efficiency and the geometrical congruency are more advanced tools to quantify the navigability.\n\nThe authors do not consider in their comparison important studies:\n+ one of the recent states of the art proposed in this article: \nCLOVE, a Travelling Salesman’s approach to hyperbolic embeddings of complex networks with communities.
