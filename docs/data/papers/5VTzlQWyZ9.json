Through iterative application, we demonstrate that self-attention alone intrinsically drives the formation of semantically meaningful clusters in the representation space. Analyzing this behavior across global, local-window, and hybrid patterns reveals their inherent geometric biases independent of training. Crucially, we find that query scaling (as used in Longformer) induces an implicit dimensionality reduction that systematically improves model generalization, a insight we validate experimentally. This geometric bias is consistent across both low-dimensional data and high-dimensional real-world representations. Probing a pre-trained model confirms this is architecturally inherent and further refined by learning.

Incomplete and unclear writing: Several core elements such as motivation, related work, and key definitions, are missing or underdeveloped, which makes the paper hard to read and follow.\n2. Conceptual triviality / unclear novelty: With all projections and normalizations removed, self-attention effectively reduces to a (softmax-normalized) dot-product kernel over raw tokens; the update rule then corresponds to repeated kernel-weighted averaging (plus standardization), which is closely related to classical affinity/spectral clustering behavior. Many reported “properties” (e.g., cluster formation) are thus properties of the dot product kernel, and not new insights about trained attention. The paper does not connect its dynamics to known kernel/spectral results nor clarify what is genuinely new beyond prior analyzes of clustering in self-attention dynamics.\n3. Toy-level evaluation: The semantic alignment relies on manual cluster-to-label mapping guided by domain knowledge, which creates room for post-hoc choices. The datasets are tiny and low-dimensional, and the image dataset (dataset A) is a trivial color-based foreground/background split."}, "questions": {"value": "1. First, on weakness #1, the paper seems to be rushed and mostly LLM-generated (although acknowledged) without further manual improvement/validation. For example, the introduction is very short and the motivation of the work is not clearly mentioned. Furthermore, the paper is presented in a very complicated and ambiguous way that is hard to follow. For example, several concepts (such as local window in section 3.2) were mentioned without proper explanation. Could you please explain the motivations of the work, considering the questions below?\n2. On weakness #2, let's start with the analyzed framework. It is mentioned that all learnable projections, normalizations, and dropouts are removed. This means that self-attention would exactly calculate the (normalized) dot product (i.e. similarity) of different tokens in the input. In that case, for data A (the image of a fox), this will correspond to a color-based clustering of the image which makes the reported results largely trivial. I would guess the same concern also applies to other datasets. Could you please justify how the analyzed framework goes beyond dot-product properties?\n3. I would appreciate it if the authors could explain what the novelties of the paper are. In particular, under what conditions does the proposed parameter-free self-attention differ (both theoretically and empirically) from standard spectral clustering [1] or diffusion maps [2] on the cosine kernel? Concrete derivations or counterexamples would help.\n4. Assuming that the abovementioned concerns are addressed, I would like to see the results on high-dimensional hidden states from diverse pretrained models (not just Longformer) and on non-trivial vision inputs beyond simple foreground/background segmentation.\n\n\n[1] Von Luxburg, Ulrike. \"A tutorial on spectral clustering.\" _Statistics and computing_ 17.4 (2007): 395-416.\n\n[2] Coifman, Ronald R., and Stéphane Lafon. \"Diffusion maps.\" _Applied and computational harmonic analysis_ 21.1 (2006): 5-30."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "OevsR0MTCE", "forum": "5VTzlQWyZ9", "replyto": "5VTzlQWyZ9", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5040/Reviewer_tD5A"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5040/Reviewer_tD5A"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5040/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761906019526, "cdate": 1761906019526, "tmdate": 1762917837537, "mdate": 1762917837537, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes an offline, parameter-free framework to “reveal” the inductive bias of different self-attention mechanisms. Concretely, the authors take standard attention modules (BERT self-attention, Longformer self-attention, and a custom local-window attention), remove their learnable parts by replacing the query/key/value projections with identity matrices, and repeatedly apply these frozen attention layers to an input tensor. After each iteration, they cluster the resulting token representations with k-means and evaluate how “clean” the clusters are using silhouette score and simple visualizations (3D scatter, binary masks). The claim is that different attention patterns (global vs local vs Longformer-style) induce different clustering behaviour even without training, and that this can be used as a diagnostic tool for attention designs. Experiments are run on three very small setups: (1) a single 64×64 image (probably a fox, not a cat) with very very clear foreground/background separation, (2) a 3D diabetes tabular dataset, and (3) a 3D heart-disease dataset.

The visualizations of token trajectories and the k-means masks can help beginners understand that attention is, at its core, a data-dependent mixing operator.\n3. **Interesting small observation on Longformer.** The paper notices that the HF Longformer variant scales only queries (scaling_type='sq') and shows that this has an effect on the spectrum and the resulting clusters. That’s a legitimate engineering observation.\n4. **Connection (at least in intent) to recent works on clustering in attention dynamics.** The authors mention the line of work that interprets attention as a particle system / clustering dynamic. So they are not completely disconnected from the literature — they just don’t reach the same depth."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Experimental setup is far below ICLR standards.** The main vision experiment is literally one image of size 64×64, with a very obvious foreground (fox) and background. On such an image, plain k-means on raw RGB would already separate fg/bg. So this setup does not demonstrate any special, emergent, or surprising property of attention. The other two datasets are tiny 3D tabular datasets (diabetes, heart). In 3D it is trivial to see clusters and to make nice 3D plots. That does not tell us how the method behaves in realistic, high-dimensional vision or language settings. For a paper that claims to “reveal” something about attention, we would minimally expect CIFAR-10, CUB, Stanford Cars, or at least a few real images passed through an attention mechanism. \n2. **No coherent rationale for the chosen attention mechanisms**. The paper only uses:    \n\t•\t“global” = BERT self-attention (but with identities),   \n\t•\tLongformer self-attention (with identity Q/K/V),   \n\t•\ta custom local-window attention.   \nBut the motivation in the text is to study different attention patterns. If that’s the goal, please include more (possibly self-attention or cross-attention mechanisms). Have a look at [1] for various attention mechanism alternatives.\n3. **Metrics are weak and partly circular**. \n4. **The core claim is obvious and not backed by strong evidence**. The conclusion — “global attention gives more coherent clusters, local attention is fragmented, Longformer is in-between” — is exactly what one would predict from the definitions of these mechanisms, without running any experiments. The experiments should uncover a non-obvious behaviour (e.g. “this sparse pattern still recovers semantic parts”, or “this scaling makes clustering drastically more stable”), but they don’t.\n5. **Very thin theoretical background**.\n6. **The NLP experiment does not support the big story**. Authors add a small WikiText-2 → IMDB/SST-2 experiment to argue that “the scaling we identified offline corresponds to better generalization”. But the gains are small, there’s no variance, and the setup is small. This does not validate the proposed analysis pipeline.\n7. **Missing related works**.
