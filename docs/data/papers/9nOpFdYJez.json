However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its high efficiency and effectiveness.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Deep Learning Algorithms"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ab13d79ae46ad6df54706a66c94e0dd7a0609290.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces GRFT (Gradient-based and Regularized Fine-Tuning), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach.

The novelty is somewhat incremental, mainly extending GPS from element-wise to structured row/column selection.

While GRFT’s storage efficiency is clear, the performance improvement over GPS is less intuitive. Intuitively, GPS performs finer-grained parameter updates, and the paper does not provide sufficient explanation or analysis to clarify why the structured updates in GRFT lead to higher performance.\n3. The paper lacks comparisons with several recent and stronger baselines on vision tasks, such as MLAE [1] and GLoRA [2], which limits the assessment of its competitiveness. Meanwhile, the baselines in the LLM experiments are also insufficient, as GPS itself is not included and no comparisons are made with more advanced fine-tuning methods.

We consider that the innovation of the work is insufficient. The novelty of the technical architecture is lacking, and the loss function is not proposed in an innovative manner. GRFT only focuses on the fixed structured unit of \"rows/columns\"; its selection unit is fixed, resulting in insufficient adaptability and flexibility for different feature dimensions and task difficulties. The work fails to explore more flexible parameter grouping methods, leading to relatively weak innovation.  \n\n2. The work takes the \"last L layers and classification head\" as the focus of regularization. In existing studies, some methods have dynamically determined regularization strength through \"layer sensitivity analysis\" (e.g., applying strong constraints to high-sensitivity layers and weak constraints to low-sensitivity layers). In contrast, GRFT adopts a fixed hierarchical approach and lacks adaptive adjustment capabilities.  \n\n3. The parameter selection (row/column selection) and regularization (L2 constraint) of GRFT are two independently implemented modules, and the work does not explore the collaborative optimization logic between the m. This results in low integration between the two core modules and insufficient integrated innovation of the overall architecture.  \n\n4. The work mainly compares with basic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods such as LoRA, GPS, and Adapter, but fails to include more advanced gradient-based or structured fine-tuning methods in the field. For example, it does not compare with GaLoRA [1], which has already realized \"gradient-guided low-rank matrix optimization\" and is directly comparable to GRFT in terms of design ideas.  \n\n5. It is suggested to supplement the explanation of Figure 3.\n\n[1] Zhao J, Zhang Z, Chen B, et al. GaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection.
