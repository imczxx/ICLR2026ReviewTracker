Existing neural approaches, ranging from CNNs and RNNs to attention-based Transformers, have achieved notable progress. Yet, they often suffer from two key limitations: difficulty in capturing hierarchical spatiotemporal dependencies and computational inefficiencies when scaling to high-dimensional meteorological data. We propose \\fate (Focal-modulated Attention Encoder), a new Transformer architecture tailored for robust multivariate time-series forecasting. \\fate introduces a tensorized focal modulation mechanism that enhances spatiotemporal dependency modeling while maintaining scalability. To improve interpretability, we further design dual modulation scores that identify critical environmental features driving the forecasts. Comprehensive experiments on seven diverse real-world datasets, including benchmark energy, traffic, and large-scale climate datasets, demonstrate that \\fate consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly on long-horizon and high-variability settings. Extensive ablations confirm the generalization ability of \\fate across heterogeneous forecasting tasks. To foster reproducibility and future research, we will release the full implementation.", "tldr": "FATE introduces a tensorized focal attention mechanism that improves long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting and outperforms state-of-the-art models on seven real-world datasets.", "keywords": ["Time-Series Forecasting", "Focal Modulation", "Spatiotemporal Modeling"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/44b67f9d4da31329ecdcf58cacfa15ec3cc0712f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes FATE, which focuses on capturing spatial-temporal dependency by extending the prior work, FocalNet Transformer, to time series forecasting."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The exploration of spatial-temporal data with the concept of locality is plausible.\n\nThe experiment expands on multiple areas to show the model's performance gains."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**W1:** Notation lacks definitions: The notation system can be improved. A lot of terms have been used before defining. For example, in lines 51-53, the authors directly used T, S, and P for the 3-dimensional tensor without explaining what each dimension stands for. In Eq. (1) PE(\\cdot) is also not explained, and many more. Additionally, many notations are not in math format. While these issues do not directly obscure the main ideas, they reduce the clarity and readability of the paper.\n\n**W2:** Terms unexplained: A lot of uncommon terms are used without justification. For example, what are focal levels? \n\n**W3:** Notations need to be revised: Apart from unexplained notations, the dimension of the tensors and weights also seems to be problematic. For example, in Eq. (2), it is unexplained how every h in Q, K, V can be obtained by multiplying every p in X with the corresponding weights. The dimension is either mismatched or requires a more detailed explanation. This paper needs great work on improving the notation clarity.\n\n**W4:** Experiment not explained: The method was proposed for spatial-temporal data. However, in the tasks that the authors are using to evaluate the performance, many are not spatial-temporal data and thus do not have a \"3-dimensional\" tensor structure or any explicit geographical relationships (e.g., ETTh1, ETTm2, and Traffic). It generally does not make sense as the \"city\" or \"local\" concept becomes invalid for these specific datasets, and there is also no explanation of how to adapt the proposed model to these tasks that hold unordered covariates.\n\n**W5:** Insufficient analysis. The paper would benefit from additional experiments to provide a deeper understanding of the model’s behaviour. For example, several parameters specific to this work are presented in Table 1 without validation or discussion of their impact.\n\n\nMinor:\n\n- The used baselines are quite out-of-date, with the latest being iTransformer, which was published in 2024.
