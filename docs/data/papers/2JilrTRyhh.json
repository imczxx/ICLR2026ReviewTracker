What would be different if we just assumed these were just a linear combinations \"discrete distributions\" of some finite set and then went with it?  The insistence on measure theory and functional-analytic analysis makes the paper very specialized, so if it could be simplified at all, it would be greatly appreciated (I understand that often we do actually require this level of sophistication to analyze some setups, but this setup feels like a more interesting analysis could be made with simpler mathematics).\n\nWhat exactly is the statistical estimation problem introduced in Section 3?  As far as I understand, it is an abstraction of the memory recall problem (I might be wrong, but this is what I understood from the paper).  In this case, what exactly is the value of such an abstraction and analysis?  I do not think there is value in knowing at exactly what rate it decays, given that the problem itself is a \"fake\" problem invented only a a proxy.
