These two learners are coupled to perform distinct yet complementary roles: the fast learner focuses on knowledge transfer, while the meta learner ensures knowledge integration. In contrast to traditional multi-task RL approaches that share knowledge through average return maximization, our meta learner incrementally integrates new experiences by explicitly minimizing catastrophic forgetting, thereby supporting efficient cumulative knowledge transfer for the fast learner. To facilitate rapid adaptation in new environments, we introduce an adaptive meta warm-up mechanism that selectively harnesses past knowledge.

While a longer $L$ might intuitively suggest improved learning from the meta-learner, the empirical results show a non-monotonic trend. Specifically, extending $L$ to $50 \\times 10^4$ yields marginal gains in Forward Transfer (FT) (0.16 to 0.17) but significantly worsens Forgetting (0.72 to 0.78) and degrades the 'Average Performance' on Breakout. This result is counter-intuitive. Why does a prolonged application of Behavior Cloning (BCI appreciate if you let me know this phenomena.\n\n2.  **On a Principled Strategy for Determining $L$ and $N$:**\n    The ablation studies  confirm that performance is highly sensitive to the choice of $L$ and $N$. These parameters appear inherently task-dependent. $N$ dictates the fidelity of the approximated state-visitation distribution ($w_k$ or $\\mu_k$), while $L$ manages the plasticity-stability trade-off during adaptation. However, the paper does not seem to offer a principled method for their selection beyond empirical tuning within a specific domain. Could the authors share heuristics or a more adaptive strategy for setting these parameters? For instance, in the Meta-World experiments, the warm-up evaluation was set to 10 episodes. What rationale guided this specific choice, and how might such a heuristic generalize to environments with varying task complexities or episode lengths?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "pm0bPAbJ6b", "forum": "loNTDX3wTn", "replyto": "loNTDX3wTn", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12837/Reviewer_6F7r"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12837/Reviewer_6F7r"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12837/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760879042409, "cdate": 1760879042409, "tmdate": 1762923636179, "mdate": 1762923636179, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes **FAME**, a principled framework for continual reinforcement learning (CRL) that couples a fast learner (responsible for rapid adaptation and knowledge transfer) with a meta learner (responsible for long-term knowledge consolidation and minimizing catastrophic forgetting).
