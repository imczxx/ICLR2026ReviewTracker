Although primarily designed for discrete environments, many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and slow convergence.\nIn this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies in continuous-time environments.\nNumerical experiments show that the proposed CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "continuous time", "deterministic policy", "stochastic control"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5f42a5d4d744aa6727d3108cfc2cba74ee9ae424.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a principled framework for deterministic policy gradient (DPG) in continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL).

The paper establishes a mathematically solid foundation for deterministic policy gradient (DPG) methods in continuous-time reinforcement learning. The authors derive a continuous-time analogue of the advantage function (Theorem 3.1) and rigorously prove its martingale characterization (Theorem 3.2), connecting the policy gradient to the advantage-rate function under deterministic policies. This framework generalizes the discrete-time DPG results (Silver et al., 2014) while removing restrictive assumptions such as uniform ellipticity and purely stochastic policies. The martingale-based formulation elegantly guarantees consistency of the value and advantage functions and provides a clear theoretical pathway for algorithm design.\n2. The paper directly targets the issue that discrete-time RL algorithms become unstable as the time-step $h\\to0$. The authors provide a precise theoretical explanation for this degradation: one-step temporal-difference (TD) updates cause gradient variance to blow up (Proposition 4.1). To overcome this, they introduce the Continuous-Time Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (CT-DDPG) algorithm using multi-step TD objectives (Eq. 4.7), proving its variance remains bounded (Proposition 4.2)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The paper’s theoretical framing and algorithmic contribution appear incremental relative to prior work in continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL). While it emphasizes the use of a martingale characterization to derive a deterministic policy gradient (DPG) formula, the idea is conceptually close to existing stochastic-policy frameworks (Jia & Zhou, 2022a; 2022b; 2023) and the model-based DPG formulations of [5]. The paper does not convincingly clarify why the martingale representation provides a fundamentally new perspective or practical advantage over Itô-based stochastic analysis or existing actor–critic formulations.\n   \n   Moreover, the literature review is narrow and overlooks several recent studies towards same target. For example: [1] systematically analyzes multiple discretization strategies (MSS) for model-based CTRL; [2] proposes a time-adaptive sensing and control approach that jointly optimizes action and duration, directly tackling the same step-size sensitivity problem that this paper aims to address; [3] focuses on improving sample and computational efficiency while maintaining performance; and [4] theoretically studies how, for stochastic dynamics, the observation interval should adapt to the system’s variance. Although the authors cite [5], the discussion remains superficial—[5] already develops a continuous-time actor–critic framework that learns a deterministic policy gradient under ODE dynamics, conceptually similar to this work.\n   \n   The paper does not clearly articulate how its CT-DDPG algorithm differs from or improves upon these established baselines, many of which already achieve comparable goals such as variance control, discretization invariance, and stability. A more thorough comparative discussion and empirical ablation referencing these works would be necessary to substantiate the claimed contributions.\n\n   [1] Treven, L., Hübotter, J., Sukhija, B., Dorfler, F., & Krause, A.

It is unclear why the paper does not include comparisons with ctrl methods such as those proposed in [2] and [5]. In Figure 2, the only continuous-time baseline shown is the q-learning algorithm. Since the authors already cite [5] in the main paper, it would be natural—and important—to include it as a baseline to better demonstrate the claimed advantages of the proposed deterministic approach.\n3. The reported results also appear somewhat counter-intuitive. In Figure 2(c) (Hopper, h = 0.008, $\\sigma$ = 0), the q-learning (L = 1) baseline exhibits a substantially larger error bar than in panels (g) and (k), even though the noise level is lower. This behavior is unexpected and not explained in the paper—it raises questions about potential implementation differences, instability in training, or inconsistent experimental conditions."}, "questions": {"value": "Please compare with the papers listed in the weakness part.

Thm. 3.2 characterizes both the value (V_\\phi) and the advantage rate (A_\\phi) via a *martingale orthogonality* condition.

A stronger baseline suite would isolate the benefits of deterministic policies from those of *multi‑step TD*. \n\n Experiments inject i.i.d. Gaussian generalized forces at the MuJoCo level.
