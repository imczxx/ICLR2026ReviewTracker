It is widely applicable to identify intrusion, fraud, anomalies, but also values that may occur rarely but are important for various data analysis applications, e.g., maximum/minimum, median, etc. We consider a deterministic version of the problem, called Testing for Hidden Function's Outliers (HFO-testing for short), defined as follows. Given a hidden function $f$ of at most $\\ell$ values, the goal is to find all outliers of $f$, that is, values whose preimages are of size at most $k$, together with their preimages, where $\\ell,k$ are the problem parameters. Finding outliers can be done by asking OR queries, each represented by a set of pairs $(x,y)$, where the answer to each query is $1$ if at least one pair in the query is consistent with function $f$, i.e., a pair $(x,f(x))$ belongs to the query for some $x$, and $0$ otherwise. We formally model this process as a learning game between two players: the adversary, who first chooses\\&hides a function and later provides feedback to the other player queries, and the other player (user) who creates and asks queries and later analyzes the obtained feedback. This paper aims at finding a short universal sequence of queries that allows the user to solve the above-mentioned problem for any adversarial function $f$ from any given (potentially very large) domain $N$ to a codomain $M$. We formally prove nearly-cubic, in terms of parameters $\\ell,k$ and polylog$(N,M)$, upper and lower bounds for this problem, which are tight up to a polylogarithmic factor. The upper bound is showed by constructing and analyzing non-adaptive deterministic OR-query system, with decoding. The lower bound is proved by designing \"costly\" functions for any given OR-query system.", "tldr": "Testing for outliers in a function hidden by the adversary, in a learning game in which the user asks queries and the adversary provides logic-OR feedback.", "keywords": ["Testing functions", "Outliers", "Query systems"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dd095f60671f5136d4c1123a5dae0c6faba23779.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies outlier detection and formulates it by introducing the Hidden Function Outlier (HFO) problem.

Without such comparisons, it’s unclear how much the proposed design actually improves over straightforward alternatives grounded in the same toolbox.\n\n-  How does your construction fundamentally differ from known explicit non-adaptive group testing schemes (e.g., [1])? Section 1.3 does not do justice. Could you formalize the gap?\n\n-  The query complexity is cubic in $(k,\\ell)$ up to polylog factors. In many realistic “outlier” regimes k may be small, but \\ell (the image size) can be moderate/large, making $(k+\\ell)k\\ell$ potentially large. Moreover, the construction builds an incidence matrix with $N\\cdot M$ rows and very long blocks (length $q'_k q'_\\ell$​), which undercuts practical scalability. Can the authors clarify?\n\n- In addition, I believe that the fault‑tolerance “extension” increases constants rather than fundamentally changing asymptotics. Specifically, the fault‑tolerance section is heuristic: it inflates constants $c_k,c_\\ell$​ to guarantee “at least one good column,” but gives no tight trade‑off or rigorous adversary model beyond a simple bound on the number of flips. Can the authors provide a rigorous analysis of error resilience (e.g., minimum distance, decoding under $\\alpha$ adversarial flips) rather than heuristic constant inflation?\n\n-  For $\\ell \\gg k$, the upper bound is $\\tilde O(\\ell^2 k)$ while the lower bound is $\\Omega(\\ell k^2\\log_k N)$. Can you clarify why this is “nearly matching” and whether improvements are possible?\n\n\n- From the practicability persepective, what is the actual size of $M^\\*$ for realistic $N,M,k,\\ell$? Could compression or sparsity-aware techniques make this feasible?\n\n\n[1] Porat & Rothschild.
