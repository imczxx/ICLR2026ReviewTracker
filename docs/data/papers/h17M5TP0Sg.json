Low-bit quantization has been effectively employed to enhance the speed of LLM inference. Nonetheless, existing methodologies predominantly concentrate on the reduction of weight bit-width, often neglecting the potential for acceleration through the exploitation of weight sparsity at various locations within LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that integrates rotation-based low-bit quantization with $N{:}M$ unstructured pruning. This framework encompasses: \\textit{i)} $N{:}M$ sparse pattern optimization, which is aimed at identifying optimal sparsity configurations. These configurations are chosen to maximize throughput-per-second (TPS) while minimizing accuracy degradation throughout the low-bit quantization process, and \\textit{ii)} in response to the combinatorial explosion associated with identifying optimal $N{:}M$ patterns, we develop hardware-aware performance models that adeptly navigate the expansive $N{:}M$ parameter space to ascertain the optimal sparse pattern. Extensive experiments conducted on the Llama-2 model family reveal that our framework sustains benchmark accuracy degradation within 1\\%, concurrently achieving state-of-the-art inference acceleration on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs. On Llama-2-70B, we achieve 3.65$\\times$ prefill throughput improvement and 50\\% memory reduction. This research bridges the divide between low-bit quantization and unstructured pruning through effective $N{:}M$ exploration strategies, thereby advancing the frontiers of extreme LLM compression for deployment on commodity hardware.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Low-bit Quantization", "N:M Sparse Pruning", "Hardware-aware Optimization", "Inference Acceleration"], "primary_area": "infrastructure, software libraries, hardware, systems, etc.", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b38082ab506e82947b41da17b62c54145e819513.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/18bb183f06e6e6cd0ada764077f13aeda37301cc.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a method combining QuaRot quantization, SR-STE N:M semi-structured pruning, and model-guided search for exploring sparse N:M topologies.

Unstructured pruning describes the removal of weights without any particular pattern or underlying structure. As such “N:M unstructured” pruning is an oxymoron. \n* Co-adaptation?: The paper describes the challenges of combining quantization and pruning and the need to “coordinate the feedback loops between these two independent processes”. However, the proposed method is to sequentially quantize than prune, which doesn’t appear to satisfy the intent of providing feedback between the two processes. As such, the claim that the co-optimization problem has been solved appears to be overstated. \n* Limited novelty: As far as I can tell, each of the proposed steps in the compression method have been previously proposed. Quantization is performed with QuaRot, pruning is conducted with magnitude pruning, sparse fine-tuning uses SR-STE, and searching for the best layerwise N:M sparsity is conducted with typical surrogate-assisted optimization approach. As discussed in the incomplete literature review bullet below, the combination of these techniques has relatively limited novelty as well. \n* Memory reduction missing mask metadata: In Table 3 and appendix Table 1, N:M patterns at 50% sparsity are stated to have a x2 memory reduction. N:M sparsity requires storing $log_N(M)$ bits of mask metadata that does not appear to have been accounted for in these figures. In Appendix A.11.3, the authors note that the index overhead is negligible. For 2:4 sparsity with 4 bit weights, 3 bits of metadata are required for every two non-zero weights. This is an overhead of 31.25% which is not negligible. \n* Incomplete literature review: The investigation of combining sparsity and quantization for LLMs has seen some significant interest in recent years, but several important works are missing from the literature review. For instance, [1] found that sparsity and quantization cannot be defined as fundamentally orthogonal. [2] Explored joint sparsification and quantization including 2:4 sparsity and a variety of quantization and pruning methods. SDC [3] proposed a method of combining N:4 and N:8 pruning with W4A4 and W8A8 quantization, respectively. [4] investigated the pros and cons of quantization versus pruning including a small study on their combination when applied to computer vision models. [5] provided kernels intended for 2:4 W4A16 LLMs which achieve up to x5 acceleration even at batch size=1. It’s also worth noting that some of the papers which are cited already included ablations that combined sparsity and quantization. For example, SparseGPT experimented with that 4-bit weight quantization with 2:4 sparse weights and found only a 0.1 PPL increase above the 2:4 sparse BF16 baseline. This paper would be improved by citing works that have previously explored the combination of sparsity and quantization. In particular, adding concrete comparisons to other methods that combine sparsity and quantization is crucial to improving the paper's rating. \n* Limited performance gains: The performance gains of the proposed method are marginal compared to the speedups provided by just QuaRot alone. It’s unlikely that the small improvements in performance depicted in Figure 7 are worth the associated decreased accuracy compared to using QuaRot alone. \n\n\n# Minor concerns\nThe following are minor concerns, typos, etc. which would improve the work but do not affect the final rating: \n* L45: Including “this direction…” in the phrasing of the list elements is redundant. Suggest simply omitting and starting each element with the main clause (i.e., i) low-bit quantization, … ii) weight pruning, …\n* L64: Weight pruning and quantization have been demonstrated to be non-orthogonal. [1]\n* L98: “random dropout” typically refers to the dropout technique, which drops out neurons/units rather than individual connections/weights. Suggest rephrasing as 50% random pruning. \n* Figure 3A) is nearly identical to Figure 3 in QuaRot. Suggest removing and simply referring to the original work. \n* L142: Line spacing is non-uniform \n* L157: L_{pruned} is defined in the appendix but not the main body. \n* L161: Typo, $||\\mathbf{W}\\_i||_{20}$\n* L248: Wrong in-text citation, should be for Zhou et al.: Learning N:M Fine-grained Structured Sparse Neural Networks From Scratch\n\n[1]  S.

First, it talks about unstructured pruning, but actually considers N:M structures (nowadays typically referred to a semi-structured sparsity). In fact, in the appendix, the paper itself states \"Weight Storage Reduction. The N :M sparse matrix implementation significantly reduces memory requirements through structured sparsity\"\n\nSection 3.2 introduces block-wise magnitude-based pruning, but section 3.3 then talks about this being a (M, N) combinatorial problem.\n\n> For matrix sparse multiplication, we adapt the dense matrix multiplication\nimplementation in the CUTLASS library (NVIDIA, 2023). This adaptation supports N:M sparse\npattern operations. More details can be found in Appendix A.7.\n\nBut I haven't found anything in the appendix about the actual fast N:M sparse matmul implementation; especially since N and M only allow one single fixed value if you want to use tensor core support, but the paper then claims to do a sweep over configurations (We evaluate N:M sparsity configurations where M ranges from 2 to 16 and N varies from 2 to 8)\n\nI don't think the claim \"where the index overhead for N :M patterns is negligible due to the regular structure.\" is true. With 2:4 sparsity, the overhead for indexing is 4 bits, (2 bits per non-zero), so at 4-bit quantization, this amounts to a total of 33% overhead, far from negligible.
