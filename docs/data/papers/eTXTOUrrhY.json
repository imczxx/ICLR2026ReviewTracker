We introduce FOLIAGE, a geometry-centric latent world model that infers a deployable state from heterogeneous, partial sensors and predicts its action-conditioned evolution. The perception stack aligns images, point clouds, and meshes through correspondence-constrained fusion and age features, then pools into global and young-region summaries that emphasize where change will occur next. Dynamics input act only on the latent, taking material coefficients and a horizon code to produce counterfactual roll-outs without entangling perception with control. Training-time physics guides representation via a target encoder that receives per-vertex energies and energy-gated message passing, while the deployable path relies solely on observable inputs. On the SURF-GARDEN data platform and the SURF-BENCH suite, FOLIAGE improves mesh topology classification by ~3 pp, reduces dense-correspondence geodesic error by ~10\\%, lifts cross-modal retrieval by ~25\\% mAP@100, increases growth-stage recognition by ~8 pp, lowers 5-step Chamfer by ~20\\%, and cuts inverse-material error by ~40\\% relative to strong baselines. Stress tests show graceful degradation under sensor loss, stable long-horizon roll-outs, and gains from train-only physics without test-time privileges.

A major strength of this work is the introduction of the SURF-GARDEN platform and SURF-BENCH evaluation suite. This is a significant contribution that formalizes a challenging new problem domain, providing a high-quality dataset, a physically-based simulator, and a diverse set of tasks. This infrastructure is valuable for enabling future research in this specific area.\n2. The FOLIAGE model is technically sophisticated and thoughtfully designed. The approach of fusing heterogeneous sensor data via correspondence, using age features to encode temporal dynamics, and separating a deployable encoder from a privileged, physics-guided target encoder for training is a novel and powerful paradigm for learning from complex physical systems.\n3. The paper presents extensive experiments demonstrating that FOLIAGE consistently outperforms a wide range of strong baselines across the six core tasks defined in SURF-BENCH. The results are thorough, and the stress tests effectively showcase the robustness of the proposed model."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The primary weakness of this work is its focus on \"accretive surface growth,\" a highly specialized sub-field of computational physics and biology. While the problem is scientifically interesting, its relevance and potential impact on the broader machine learning and representation learning community at ICLR is questionable. The paper does not make a compelling case for why this specific physical phenomenon should be of general interest, nor how the methods developed would apply to more mainstream problems in vision, graphics, or robotics.\n2. The paper's main achievement is the construction of a large, complex, and highly integrated system for solving one specific task. While impressive from an engineering perspective, it is difficult to distill a single, core machine learning method or principle that is broadly applicable. The individual components are clever adaptations of existing tools (GNNs, Transformers, EMA), but the overall contribution feels more like a strong application paper for a specialized venue (e.g., computer graphics, computational science) rather than a foundational methods paper for ICLR.\n3. The FOLIAGE system is exceptionally complex, involving a custom simulator, multiple specialized encoders for different modalities, a heterogeneous graph fusion mechanism, and a specific physics-guided training loop. This high degree of complexity, coupled with the reliance on a new custom dataset, may significantly limit the work's adoption, reproducibility, and the ability for other researchers to build upon its ideas."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could the authors better position their contribution for the ICLR audience? Are the core principles of FOLIAGE—such as age-based positional encoding or correspondence-driven multimodal fusion—applicable to more general and widely studied problems in dynamic 3D understanding, such as human motion analysis, long-term robotic interaction, or video prediction?\n2. The work relies entirely on the new SURF-GARDEN dataset. How do the authors see the proposed methods generalizing beyond this simulated environment? Were any experiments conducted on real-world data, or on other standard dynamic 3D datasets, even if they don't feature the specific \"accretive growth\" property?\n3. The physics-guided training is a key component. How much of the model's strong performance is attributable to having access to a high-fidelity simulator with privileged energy information, versus the novelty of the FOLIAGE architecture itself? Is it possible that a simpler model could perform similarly if given access to the same high-quality, physically-grounded data?\n4. Given the system's significant complexity, what is the single most important architectural or methodological insight that the broader community should take away from this work? If a researcher cannot replicate the entire SURF-GARDEN platform, what is the key component they could readily apply to their own problems?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ANa5dnx7Iq", "forum": "eTXTOUrrhY", "replyto": "eTXTOUrrhY", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15361/Reviewer_Wk6Y"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15361/Reviewer_Wk6Y"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15361/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760786369219, "cdate": 1760786369219, "tmdate": 1762925646371, "mdate": 1762925646371, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "FOLIAGE is a geometry-centric latent world model for accretive surface growth that fuses RGB/point-cloud/mesh via correspondence-constrained attention with vertex-age features, predicts action-conditioned evolution from material coefficients and horizon codes, and uses train-only physics (per-vertex energies with energy-gated message passing and an EMA target encoder) to shape representations without test-time privilege; evaluated on the new SURF-GARDEN/SURF-BENCH (with branched counterfactual sequences and exact cross-modal correspondences), it surpasses strong baselines on topology, dense correspondence, cross-modal retrieval, growth-stage recognition, mesh forecasting, and inverse-material estimation, while remaining robust to sensor loss and stable over long rollouts."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- The paper is original in framing accretive surface growth as a geometry-centric latent world modeling problem with correspondence-driven multimodal fusion and train-only physics guidance.  \n- Method quality is strong, with clear modular design (perception, action-conditioned predictor, physics-guided target), careful leakage controls, and extensive ablations tests.  \n- Writing and presentation are clear, with precise task definitions, dataset/simulator details, and well-explained components like age features, hierarchical pooling, and EGMP."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Real-world validation gap  \nAll results are on the synthetic SURF-GARDEN.

While I may have missed certain contextual details, the manuscript does not clearly convey the assumptions made during inference, nor does it sufficiently explain how the proposed framework operates. In particular, it remains unclear how the learned representation is decoded or utilized to predict physical quantities, such as vertex displacements, that drive the temporal evolution of the surface. I would like the authors to address these issues through the clarifications listed in the following “Questions” section.\n- As far as I understand, FOLIAGE appears to require meshes as one of its input modalities, which seems essential since the birth-time tags and age features are defined over mesh vertices. However, this dependency makes the problem formulation less compelling in in-the-wild scenarios, where ground-truth meshes are typically unavailable compared to other modalities such as RGB images or point clouds. Moreover, it remains unclear from both the text and experiments why learning latent dynamics would be advantageous when a ground-truth mesh is already available and could be directly used for simulation.\n- It is difficult to evaluate the true performance gains and overall significance of the proposed method based on the reported experimental results. Although the authors evaluate their model across numerous tasks, several of them, such as topology classification, cross-modal retrieval, and dense correspondence, do not appear to be directly aligned with the main objective of this work: learning a latent representation that facilitates the prediction of accretive surface evolution."}, "questions": {"value": "- It seems the framework uses a mesh as one of its inputs. How can we obtain a mesh from sensors in in-the-wild setup? Is meshing easy-to-do and trivial?\n- It appears that the ablation study on input data modalities was conducted only for the image-point retrieval task (T5). How do the performances on mesh forecasting and inverse material estimation change when fewer modalities are used? I believe these two tasks are of greater importance and would benefit more from such analysis.\n- In addition to simulating latent dynamics by computing $s_{t+\\Delta t}$ from $s_{t}$ and the conditioning inputs, it remains unclear how this latent representation is subsequently decoded into explicit forms, such as point clouds or meshes. Could you provide more details? In particular, I am curious how new vertices or points are generated from such a compact latent representation.\n- Could you elaborate on the rationale behind the training loss used for **G2**? As I understand it, the framework appears to bootstrap the very representation it is intended to learn. Was there a specific reason why alternative objectives—such as direct photometric losses or geometric distances like the Chamfer distance between point clouds and mesh vertices—were not adopted in the final design?\n- While the proposed method outperforms all baselines in inverse material estimation in terms of MAE (presumably *Mean Absolute Error*), it would be helpful to understand how these methods compare under *relative* or *normalized* error metrics. For example, in the neural operator literature, where physical fields often exhibit small magnitudes, it is common to report the relative L2 error, where the L2 error is normalized by the norm of the ground-truth physical field."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "FtvM0Bfm6e", "forum": "eTXTOUrrhY", "replyto": "eTXTOUrrhY", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15361/Reviewer_jdRn"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15361/Reviewer_jdRn"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15361/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762323114120, "cdate": 1762323114120, "tmdate": 1762925645065, "mdate": 1762925645065, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces FOLIAGE, a geometry-centric latent world model designed to predict and control accretive surface growth — phenomena where surfaces add new material and evolve in morphology (e.g., leaves, tissues, 4D-printed materials).\n\nThe framework combines:\n\n- A multimodal perception stack that fuses images, point clouds, and meshes using correspondence-constrained fusion and vertex age embeddings to highlight regions where growth occurs.\n\n- An action-conditioned latent dynamics model that predicts geometric evolution based on material parameters (stretch, shear, bend coefficients) without directly simulating physics.\n\n- A physics-guided training branch using energy-gated message passing—privileged physical energy signals available only at training time to improve the representation’s physical awareness.\n\nThe system is trained and evaluated on a new dataset, SURF-GARDEN, and benchmark suite, SURF-BENCH, which include diverse growth simulations with ground-truth correspondences and counterfactual branching."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- Novel problem formulation:\nAccretive surface growth is an underexplored domain bridging geometry, control, and materials.
