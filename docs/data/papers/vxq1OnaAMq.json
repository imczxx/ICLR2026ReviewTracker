However, a fundamental challenge persists: ensuring generated samples strictly satisfy problem-specific constraints — a crucial requirement for physics-informed problems, safety-critical applications, watermark embedding, etc. Existing approaches, such as mirror maps and reflection methods, either have limited applicable constraint sets or introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we develop gauge flow matching (GFM), a simple yet efficient framework for constrained generative modeling. Our GFM approach introduces a generalized bijective gauge mapping to transform generation over arbitrary compact convex sets into an equivalent process over the unit ball, which allows low-complexity feasibility-ensuring operations such as reflection. The generated samples are then mapped back to the original domain for output. We prove that our GFM framework guarantees strict constraint satisfaction, with low generation complexity and bounded distribution approximation errors. We further extend our GFM framework to two popular non-convex settings, namely, star-convex and geodesic-convex sets. Extensive experiments show that GFM outperforms existing methods in generation speed and quality across multiple benchmarks.", "tldr": "An efficient gauge-mapping based constrained generative model over general convex sets and beyond.", "keywords": ["constraint", "generative models", "homeomorphism", "convex constraints", "gauge mapping"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bee632e6cb9fa860e9c1fbfdb2ea43d3ac025c0d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses a critically important and timely challenge of constrained generative modeling by proposing a novel idea called gauge flow matching (GFM). The underlying idea of GFM is to introduce a bijective gauge mapping to transform a complex constrained generative modeling problem into an equivalent modeling problem over a simple unit ball domain.

I understand that the authors did their best to cover the spectrum of discussions from theoretical to empirical validations, the real-world generative tasks (i.e., robotic manipulability and relaxed combinatorial problems), but I still feel underwhelmed when it comes to the empirical validation portion of this work. Image generation, for example, would've been a great benchmark test, even if the scope of images was limited to a small, limited variety (e.g., microscopic images as opposed to the whole set of natural images). I understand such a task might be \"too non-convex\" and might be beyond the scope of this work, but I still remain curious to know if and how far the proposed GFM idea could push the limit. (Especially because the other parts of the works are very well done!)\n\nOther than that, I only have some minor suggestions regarding mostly presentation, which the authors may or may not want to consider:\n- I think Figure 1 captures the core idea of your work very well. Why don't you move it to an earlier page?\n- Also, figure captions in general could be more elaborate and contain more details.\n- Excessive use of bold faces and color highlights hurts readability in my opinion. As an example (out of other such cases), I don't see the need to emphasize the acronym \"GFM\" and the word \"limitation\" in the conclusion section by making them boldface.

The analysis appears to be sound, and the provided bounds contribute to the soundness of the paper.\n\n- **Run-time Efficiency:** The efficiency arguments are an interesting contribution. While I believe the authors could make a better case for this by motivating it with time-sensitive, real-world experimental settings, I believe there are some relevant applications where this could be applied."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **Limited Contribution:** The novelty of the method seems to be directly tied to the application of the existing gauge mapping [1] within flow matching models. The actual integration of this into the flow matching model is very closely tied to prior work on mirror maps and reflection based techniques. While the authors do point out that mirror maps do not generalize to arbitrary convex sets, it seems that beyond this mapping \"substitution\", the contribution is fairly limited.\n\n- **Limited Empirical Evaluation:** While the experimental evaluation provides strong results, it relies solely on synthetic test cases with little to no real-world meaning. Furthermore, for many of these test cases, rejection sampling seems to be the better approach, as feasibility rates are higher than 90%, and samples have higher fidelity to the training set. Hence, the results would be much more compelling if they were applied to real-world settings where constrained sampling would be practically applied; this seems to be a missed opportunity, especially if such settings could provide a compelling case for the introduced efficiency. \n\n- **Selected Baselines:** It is surprising that the authors have not chosen to compare to mirror diffusion models [2] in any of their analysis. Given how closely the method overlaps with mirror mappings, the omission of this comparison makes it difficult to assess whether the gauge map is effective -- which is the core contribution of the work. Furthermore, this would be a valuable comparison to assess how different bijective mappings influence the generation quality. \n\n---\n\n[1] Tabas, Daniel, and Baosen Zhang. \"Computationally efficient safe reinforcement learning for power systems.\" 2022 American Control Conference (ACC).
