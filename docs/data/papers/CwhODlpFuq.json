Traditional methods like Kriging rely on strong distributional assumptions such as normality, which often fail in large-scale datasets, leading to unreliable intervals. Conformal prediction offers distribution-free coverage, yet most implementations rely on i.i.d. data and ignore spatial dependence. We propose Localized Spatial Conformal Prediction (LSCP), a model-agnostic framework that couples local quantile regression with conformal calibration to produce spatially adaptive prediction intervals. LSCP conditions on neighborhoods in space to capture local heterogeneity and relaxes i.i.d. requirements: it retains finite-sample marginal coverage under exchangeability and, under stationarity and spatial mixing, attains asymptotic conditional coverage. Across synthetic and real datasets, LSCP consistently achieves near-nominal coverage with tighter and more stable intervals than other existing CP methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Conformal prediction", "uncertainty quantification", "spatial statistics", "machine learning"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a2e4e1e6c972f8d6bf900a729aa438361811b46e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses uncertainty quantification for spatial prediction, where traditional methods like Kriging require strong parametric assumptions that often fail in complex datasets, while standard conformal prediction ignores spatial dependence.

The core idea of using data-adaptive weights isn't entirely novel: it extends existing weighted CP frameworks (Tibshirani et al., 2019; Barber et al., 2023) by learning weights through QRF rather than specifying them. The \"localization\" concept has also been introduced, the authors seem to miss another potential baseline here: Han et al., (2022) Split Localized Conformal Prediction.\n\n4.

Improving conditional coverage of conformal prediction based methods by studying the score distribution has been explored extensively in recent years. Apart from LCP (Guan, 2023), multiple other methods were proposed, including the methods of Han (2022), Colombo (2024), Gibbs (2023), Plassier (2024). For example, the earlier SLCP (Han, 2022) approach proposes to estimate the CDF of the residuals on a portion of the calibration set with a kernel-based method. While the mentioned works do not explicitly target spatial setting, they can be readily applied to the authors’ setup by merging feature and location vectors. In this light I consider revising the exposition in light of this previous work to be worthwhile for improving the paper.\n\nParticular technical weaknesses can be formalized as follows\n1. Mismatch between theory and implementation: the weight‑decay assumption (Assumption 4.1) appears incompatible with the fixed $k$ neighborhoods used in practice (Appendix C.4).\n2. Appendix A.2 equation 8 incorrectly equates the noise with the prediction error.\n3. Data‑dependent weights learned on the same calibration set that the empirical weighted CDF is estimated.\n4. Inconsistent experiment setup: Section 5 claims $k$ is cross‑validated, while Appendix C.4 fixes $k=50$.\n\nReferences\n1. Split Localized Conformal Prediction (Han, 2022), \n2.
