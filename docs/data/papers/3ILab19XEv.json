In practice, entities often span multiple networks—for example, users migrate and interact across social platforms, forming multiplex networks. Approaches considering multiplex networks typically use static weights or simple aggregation, failing to adaptively control the influence of each network at the sample level. This can introduce irrelevant information and cause negative transfer.\nTo address this, we introduce Adaptive Coupling for cross-Network structure Enhancement (ACNE), the first framework that leverages adaptive, sample-wise cross-network coupling for structure enhancement in multiplex networks. We first employ GNNs to obtain network-specific representations.   Building upon this foundation, we introduce a generative–discriminative adversarial learning framework, and impose an adversarial weight perturbation in parameter space to approximate worst-case noise and stabilize the learned cross-network embeddings.  To adaptively balance the contributions between target-specific and cross-network embeddings, we design a low-rank bilinear gated fusion module.   In addition, a decorrelation regularizer is incorporated to minimize redundancy arising from overlapping communities. Extensive experiments on real-world multiplex networks show that our approach consistently surpasses existing baselines in link prediction, highlighting the effectiveness and practical value of adaptive cross-network structure enhancement.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Cross-Network", "Adaptive coupling", "Structure Enhancement"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/030648a17e08dd1c90a6ad85f3bb1861ba59400b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper targets link prediction on a target layer within multiplex networks and proposes Adaptive Coupling for\ncross-Network structure Enhancement (ACNE), which is trained end-to-end using a linear combination of the prediction loss, discriminator loss, and a decorrelation term.
