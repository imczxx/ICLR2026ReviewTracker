However, while large proprietary models (e.g., models with over 100B parameters) achieve remarkable results across diverse tasks, they are often accessible through costly APIs, making frequent use too costly for many applications. In contrast, small open-source models (e.g., models with fewer than 3B parameters) are freely available and easy to deploy locally, but their performance on complex tasks remains limited. This trade-off raises a natural question: how can small and large models efficiently collaborate to combine their complementary strengths? To bridge this trade-off, we propose COPE, a test-time collaboration framework. A planner model first generates a plan, a high-level abstraction of the task, and this plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a downstream executor model. Small and large models take turns acting as planner and executor, exchanging plans in a multi-stage cascade to collaboratively solve tasks. Through comprehensive experiments on benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, open-ended tasks, and agent tasks, we demonstrate that COPE achieves performance comparable to large proprietary models, while drastically reducing the inference API cost. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for cost-efficient inference.", "tldr": "COPE is a test-time inference framework that enables small and large language models to collaborate via planning, achieving comparable or better performance than large models alone while significantly reducing inference cost.", "keywords": ["Planning", "Model collaboration", "Test-time inference"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/63f9849ad77cddb2bb4b12ede05e37dc5ff628f6.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f2f347520a49e3675ced6cd4a1afeefd388bb792.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes COPE, a test-time collaboration scheme between a small model and a large model.
