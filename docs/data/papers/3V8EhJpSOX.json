However, conventional active learning strategies suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch. They are designed to reduce uncertainty in model parameters or in observable factual outcomes, failing to directly target the unobservable causal quantities that are the true objects of interest. To address this misalignment, we introduce the principle of causal objective alignment, which posits that acquisition functions should target unobservable causal quantities, such as the potential outcomes and the CATE, rather than indirect proxies. We operationalize this principle through the Causal-EPIG framework, which adapts the information-theoretic criterion of Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG) to explicitly quantify the value of a query in terms of reducing uncertainty about unobservable causal quantities. From this unified framework, we derive two distinct strategies that embody a fundamental trade-off: a comprehensive approach that robustly models the full causal mechanisms via the joint potential outcomes, and a focused approach that directly targets the CATE estimand for maximum sample efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategies consistently outperform standard baselines, and crucially, reveal that the optimal strategy is context-dependent, contingent on the base estimator and data complexity. Our framework thus provides a principled guide for sample-efficient CATE estimation in practice.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["CATE Estimation", "Active Learning", "Causal Objective Alignment"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4d82644a40d3f1cef00c41cf2969d1ece0e4c1c1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel framework for active outcome acquisition for CATE estimation using observational data.

It resolves the fundamental goal mismatch between traditional active learning (AL) and conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation. Grounded in information theory, this framework designs two sample acquisition strategies that demonstrate superior sample efficiency across multiple benchmark tasks. Experimental analysis further validates Causal-EPIG's superior efficiency compared to mainstream methods, alongside its adaptability and robustness across diverse estimators and data scenarios, demonstrating strong practical application potential.\nHowever, the method retains certain limitations. Its theoretical framework relies on the strong assumption of no unobservable confounding, limiting applicability to broader observational data. Performance is highly sensitive to the quality of posterior calibration for the selected CATE estimator. Additionally, computational complexity increases with target set size, potentially encountering bottlenecks in large-scale, high-dimensional data environments. These aspects also provide valuable directions for future improvements. Overall, however, I still perceive the innovation and contribution of this paper as limited (my current understanding is that the main contribution lies in the modification of the utility function to a more causal form). Therefore, I tend to believe this paper falls slightly below the acceptance threshold for ICLR.\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)"}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "see above"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "see above"}, "questions": {"value": "see above"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "na"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "4iWm3MjQ65", "forum": "3V8EhJpSOX", "replyto": "3V8EhJpSOX", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22876/Reviewer_pqm9"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22876/Reviewer_pqm9"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22876/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761467863085, "cdate": 1761467863085, "tmdate": 1762942422311, "mdate": 1762942422311, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a active estimation framework for improving the sample efficiency of CATE estimation when outcome measurements are costly.
