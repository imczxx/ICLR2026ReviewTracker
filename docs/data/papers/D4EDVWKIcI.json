While large language models (LLMs) show great promise, their dense and entangled representations impede precise control over the generation of molecules with bespoke substructures or properties. To address this, we propose Sparse Representation Editing (SpaRE), an interpretability-driven framework for fine-grained and precise control in LLM-based molecule generation. The crux of SpaRE is to disentangle dense representations into various sparsely activated latent patterns that correspond to chemically meaningful concepts. Building on this, SpaRE enables direct manipulation of LLM representations associated with these concepts to achieve (1) local control, by generating target atoms and functional groups at specified positions; and (2) global control, by customizing the overall structural and physicochemical properties within defined ranges. In this way, our framework advances interpretability from post-hoc analysis to actionable generative control. Experiments demonstrate that SpaRE is capable of generating chemically desirable molecules under complex constraints in real-world scenarios, while providing causal insights for quantitative structure–property analysis.

The idea of using a sparse autoencoders to disentangle LLM token representations into chemical concepts is very intuitive.\n- Similarly, representation editing at inference time (using hooks + contrastive directions) is conceptually clean.\n- The interpretability analyses (e.g. linear probes) are very interesting and add a strong qualitative layer to the evaluation.\n- SpaRE is tested extensively and against a very comprehensive set of baselines, using appropriate metrics.\n- Empirical gains are evident from the experiments.

The computational overhead introduced by having to train one SAE per layer is not quantified or discussed critically. Please quantify computational overhead.\n- Claims like \"causal\" or \"mechanistic interpretability\" are overstated. It's hard to assess causal relationships when the method relies on proxy metrics or heuristics (e.g., QED/SA) rather than ground-truth assays. Moreover, a proper causal assessment would require interventions or counterfactuals. I think these claims must be toned down accordingly.\n- I am a bit skeptical of the LLM self-interpretation part. First, there is a risk of circularity (an LLM evaluating an LLM). Second, a precise sparse feature-chemical rule mapping (as done by the LLM) assumes that chemical concepts are completely disentangled, which cannot be assessed. I would frame this part a little bit lightly, this can be a rough indicator about what the features hint at, but not a mechanistic interpretation of the feature.\n- In general, I find that this paper is over-indulgent with the merits of the SpaRE (there are some indeed, especially in the way it is formulated) while it forgets/forgives obvious limitations (such as reliance on noisy predictors) to oversell the interpretability part."}, "questions": {"value": "See above"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "s8cuY8qmKD", "forum": "D4EDVWKIcI", "replyto": "D4EDVWKIcI", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13124/Reviewer_EbUZ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13124/Reviewer_EbUZ"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13124/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761562636339, "cdate": 1761562636339, "tmdate": 1762923847535, "mdate": 1762923847535, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce SpaRE, an interpretability-driven framework for precise control of LLM-based molecule generation.

The framework enables two types of control: Local Control and Global Control.

Effectiveness in Complex Tasks: The paper demonstrates that SpaRE is not just a toy.

Generalizability of Learned Concepts: The SAE is trained on activations from a fixed corpus of molecules. The paper does not extensively test whether the learned \"concepts\" are universal or if they would generalize to controlling properties or chemical motifs that are far out-of-distribution from the SAE's training data. This is important, especially when considering the world knowledge of LLMs, which in my opinion, is the most superiority of LLM-based molecule generative methods compared to point-cloud based or 3D graph-based ones.\n\n2. Scalability of Feature Interpretation: While the LLM-based interpretation of features is a novel validation step, it seems to be not scalable.
