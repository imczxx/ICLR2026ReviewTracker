However, even state-of-the-art autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) today exhibit unreliability when required to generate structured output. Inspired by the current new diffusion-based large language models (dLLM), we realize that the architectural difference, especially the global information-sharing mechanism for language modeling, may be the key to unlock next-level controllable generation. To explore the possibility, we propose Self-adaptive Schema Scaffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLM to stably generate reliable structured outputs (e.g., JSON) by utilizing its innate reverse reasoning capability and global context awareness. $S^3$ initiates a schematic template directly in the output context as a starting state for dLLM, offering a more robust and general method than intricate prompt optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our method substantially unlocks the dLLM’s potential in controllable generation in terms of structure adherence, content fidelity, and faithfulness. These results establish new perspectives and practical pathways for deploying language models in controllable generation tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["diffusion large langauge models", "controllable generation", "structured output"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7ae701691a421adf597df4bd83fb5e5267b6a361.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper explores the potential of diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) as an alternative to autoregressive (AR) models for controllable structured generation—a key capability for applications like JSON output, API integration, and agentic communication.\nThe authors identify key limitations of AR models (lack of global coherence, irreversible token commitments, and sequential dependency) and argue that dLLMs’ iterative denoising and global attention mechanisms offer inherent advantages for structured output.\nTo unlock this potential, they propose Self-adaptive Schema Scaffolding (S³), a training-free method that pre-initializes dLLM outputs with a structured schema scaffold (e.g., JSON skeleton) and uses adaptive null tokens to handle variable-length or missing fields."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- First comprehensive analysis of diffusion LLMs in controllable structured generation.\n\n- S³ improves structure adherence and reduces hallucination without retraining.\n\n- Achieves near-perfect structure compliance (≈0.997) and lowest hallucination (0.33 vs. 0.40 baseline).\n\n- Provides clear theoretical rationale and visual intuition for why scaffolding aids denoising.\n\n- Training-free and computationally efficient; suitable for real-world schema-driven applications.\n\n- The new tri-metric framework (adherence, fidelity, faithfulness) sets a useful precedent for future structured LLM work."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Experiments focus narrowly on WikiBio and JSON; applicability to more diverse formats (e.g., code, graphs) remains untested.\n\n- The study lacks comparison to strong AR baselines using grammar-constrained decoding or function-calling LLMs.\n\n- Only one dLLM (LLaDA) is evaluated; cross-model tests (e.g., Dream or Mercury) would strengthen claims.\n\n- While effective, it may not generalize to schemas without explicit “missing field” semantics.\n\n- Despite reduced denoising steps, dLLM inference (O(nL²)) may still lag AR models (O(L)), which could affect scalability in long-context tasks."}, "questions": {"value": "- How sensitive is S³’s performance to the number of denoising steps or the choice of remasking strategy (top-K vs. low-confidence)?\n\n- Can this framework be extended to multi-modal dLLMs (e.g., LLaDA-V) where structured outputs integrate vision and text?\n\n- How does S³ interact with instruction-tuned or RLHF-optimized dLLMs trained for task-following?\n\n- Would hybrid diffusion–autoregressive setups (e.g., block diffusion) inherit similar controllability advantages?\n\n- Have the authors evaluated the effect of schema complexity (nested vs. flat JSON) on scaffolding performance?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "The paper uses public data (WikiBio, HuggingFace models) and focuses solely on generation methodology.

It is well-motivated to use dLLMs for structured outputs, as this task (which requires lookahead planning from known future tokens) aligns well with the properties of dLLM.\n\n3.

For the Wikibio dataset, do you use the biography text as the input to the prompt, and the contents of the infobox as the target output?

In autoregressive LLMs, it is previous shown by Tam et al [1] that enforcing LLMs to provide structured outputs degrade task performance (i.e., generated contents' quality) compared to when LLMs can \"speak freely\" without structured constraints. Therefore, a way to preserve both the structured adherence and content quality is to adopt a two-stage inference process: Let the model \"speak freely\" and focus on generating the contents first, and then convert the generated contents to structured outputs. Do diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have similar properties? I think it would make the work more complete if this experiment is done, so that we know whether enforcing structured outputs degrade dLLMs' content generation ability.\n\n[1] Tam, Zhi Rui, et al. \"Let me speak freely? a study on the impact of format restrictions on performance of large language models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2408.02442 (2024)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "L7oG5CAMCw", "forum": "qhd0qv6L0k", "replyto": "qhd0qv6L0k", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23700/Reviewer_bXwN"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23700/Reviewer_bXwN"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23700/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761872054857, "cdate": 1761872054857, "tmdate": 1762942772522, "mdate": 1762942772522, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes an algorithm that utilizes schema scaffolding for controllable generation in diffusion models, theoretically demonstrates the feasibility of schema scaffolding, and conducts experiments across three key dimensions to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "To ensure global awareness, the paper employs a diffusion model for generation.
