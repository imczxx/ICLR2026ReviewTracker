However, in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task: detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework, which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios, demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.", "tldr": "Detecting post-generation edits made to watermarked LLM outputs", "keywords": ["Large language models", "watermarking", "post-generation edits"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/18042d9bfa9abd3b8a4b0fd522dad7ef4896bc6a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f769cfca3ba51fb00b466cdff43ccc13886a38ee.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a novel hard-watermarking scheme designed to detect and localize edits in text generated by large language models. The core idea is to embed a predefined pattern (e.g., A-B-A-B) into the text during generation and subsequently detect edits by identifying disruptions to this pattern using a sliding window approach. While the problem of edit localization is highly relevant and important, I have several major concerns regarding the experimental methodology, the practical viability of the proposed method, and the lack of comparison to relevant baselines. These concerns prevent me from recommending acceptance in its current form. The paper would require a major revision to address these issues."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The primary strength of this work lies in its focus on a critical and practical problem. As watermarking becomes a standard for identifying machine-generated text, the ability to not only detect the presence of a watermark but also to precisely localize subsequent human edits is of great importance for content attribution, tracking modifications, and ensuring information integrity. The authors are commended for tackling this challenging task of edit localization."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Lack of Clarity in Experimental Results**: The main experimental results for edit detection accuracy are presented solely in Figure 5. However, the visualization makes it difficult to assess the performance precisely. The y-axis ticks are too sparse, preventing a clear and direct comparison of the exact performance values between different methods and conditions. For a rigorous evaluation, graphical representations should be supplemented with precise data. I strongly recommend that the authors provide a table that reports the exact numerical values for edit detection accuracy for all methods and conditions shown in Figure 5.\n\n2. **Severe Impact on Text Quality**: The proposed method is a \"hard\" watermark, which restricts the sampling vocabulary at each position to a specific pre-determined list of tokens. This approach is known to have a significant negative impact on the quality (fluency, coherence, and factual correctness) of the generated text. This concern is amplified by the choice of delta=5.8 for the main experiments in Figure 5. This is an extraordinarily high value for the logit bias parameter. Standard practice in the field often uses a delta around 2.0, as higher values can severely degrade text quality to the point of being nearly unreadable. The paper currently lacks any evaluation of the text quality under such a strong watermark, which is a critical omission. Without this, the reported detection accuracy is meaningless, as it may come at the cost of rendering the text unusable.\n\n3. **Missing Comparison to Relevant Baselines**: The task of edit localization is conceptually similar to the task of identifying watermarked segments within a mixed-source document (i.e., a document containing both watermarked and non-watermarked text). The paper fails to discuss or compare against recent, relevant work in this area, which is a significant oversight. A thorough discussion and empirical comparison with existing segment detection methods are necessary to properly contextualize the contributions of this paper and to demonstrate its advantages over prior art. The authors should consider comparing their method against baselines such as:\n\n[1] Efficiently Identifying Watermarked Segments in Mixed-Source Texts\n[2] WaterSeeker: Pioneering Efficient Detection of Watermarked Segments in Large Documents"}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could the authors provide a clear justification for choosing delta=5.8 for the experiments in Figure 5? Why was such a strong bias necessary? Furthermore, it is crucial to demonstrate the quality of the text generated with this setting. I would expect to see standard automatic metrics like Perplexity (PPL) and, if possible, performance on downstream NLP tasks to quantify the trade-off between detection accuracy and text utility. A qualitative analysis with generated examples would also be highly beneficial.\n\n2. The evaluation in Figure 5 assesses the detection of \"pure\" edit types (i.e., only inserts, only deletes, or only replacements) in isolation. However, real-world edits are often complex and involve a combination of these operations (e.g., rephrasing a sentence involves both deletions and insertions). Could the authors provide an evaluation of the method's robustness in more realistic, mixed-edit scenarios? How does the detection accuracy hold up when multiple types of edits are present within the same text segment?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "TFEKEj0Hlc", "forum": "SzrQBJDYHn", "replyto": "SzrQBJDYHn", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22684/Reviewer_Jmfd"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22684/Reviewer_Jmfd"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22684/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761218394662, "cdate": 1761218394662, "tmdate": 1762942336020, "mdate": 1762942336020, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new task, post-generation edit detection, aimed at identifying and localizing edits made to watermarked LLM outputs.
