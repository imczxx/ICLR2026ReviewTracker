Recent works address this issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource constraints.", "tldr": "The paper introduces the Generalized Adversarial Solver, a simplified diffusion sampling acceleration framework combining distillation and adversarial training to achieve superior generation quality over existing methods.", "keywords": ["diffusion models", "diffusion acceleration", "diffusion distillation", "ODE solvers", "adversarial training"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7dcfdbcf4ef404af4d613d81b80a66363048844a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes an ODE solver distillation method for diffusion models that augments prior work with: an adversarial loss, a better initialization inspired by theory in other ODE solvers, and deliberate over parameterization.

This results in measurable improvements in both performance and generalization."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **High Training Cost from Adversarial Loss**  \n   While the adversarial loss improves overall quality, it significantly increases the training cost. As shown in Table 8, the training time is more than double that of GS (without adversarial loss), raising questions about computational efficiency.  \n\n2. **Questionable Initialization Strategy**  \n   The solver learns coefficients for a linear multistep method but initializes some parameters from the DPM solver [2], which belongs to the exponential integrator family. Since exponential integrators differ fundamentally from linear multistep methods, this initialization may lead to inconsistent behavior and a theoretically unsound starting point.  \n\n3. **Dependence on a Pretrained GAN**  \n   The method’s reliance on a pretrained GAN introduces unnecessary complexity and limits its generalizability. This dependency may hinder reproducibility and make it difficult to apply the method across different architectures.  \n\n4. **Unfair Comparison with S4S**  \n   The reported comparisons with S4S [1] may be misleading, as solver performance heavily depends on the teacher model used. Variations in teacher configurations can skew the results, weakening the validity of the performance claims."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **Ensure Fairness in Training Time Comparisons (Table 7)**  \n   Training times should be reported using the same GPU model to ensure fairness, as differences in hardware can significantly affect latency measurements. Additionally, comparing results under the same number of function evaluations (NFE) would provide a more accurate measure of computational efficiency.  \n\n2. **Align Training Iterations Across Methods (Appendix D.4.1)**  \n   In Appendix D.4.1, GS and GAS appear to have been trained for different numbers of iterations (e.g., 1k for GS vs. 2k for GAS in the text-to-image experiment). This inconsistency complicates fair comparison. Both methods should be trained for the same number of iterations to enable a meaningful evaluation.  \n\n3. **Clarify the Choice of Initialization Solver**  \n   The paper initializes coefficients using the DPM solver [2], which belongs to the exponential integrator family which might affect the theoretical soundess of initializing some coefficients with it.  \n\n4. **Absence of Alternating Training Strategy and Its Rationale**  \n   Unlike S4S [1], the proposed method does not employ an alternating training strategy for the timestep scheduler and solver coefficients. It would be valuable for the authors to elaborate on why their approach doesn't require alternating strategy to stabilize training.  \n\n5. **Retrain S4S for Consistent Comparison**  \n   The S4S results presented are taken directly from the original paper, yet S4S performance is highly sensitive to the choice of teacher model. For example, in the LSUN-Bedroom 256 dataset, S4S underperforms relative to other solvers due to the poor teacher performance used in S4S in the original paper. Retraining S4S under the same setup and teacher model would ensure a fair and unbiased comparison with the proposed GAS method.\n\n---\n\n## References  \n[1] **S4S: Solving for a Diffusion Model Solver.**   \n[2] **DPM-Solver: A Fast ODE Solver for Diffusion Probabilistic Model Sampling in Around 10 Steps.**"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "X614tJaNcG", "forum": "R1l46h8kyM", "replyto": "R1l46h8kyM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18372/Reviewer_bLXP"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18372/Reviewer_bLXP"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18372/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761810157307, "cdate": 1761810157307, "tmdate": 1762928078606, "mdate": 1762928078606, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work studies the topic of distilling diffusion models into a few-step solver.
