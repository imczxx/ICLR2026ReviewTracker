To defend against potential attacks, in practice, soft keyboards for PIN entry are randomized in layout to mitigate such threats. In this paper, we present RecSpy, a novel cognition-driven acoustic side-channel attack that infers PINs on randomized soft keyboards. Unlike prior work that relies on video, power, or electromagnetic emanations, RecSpy exploits a previously unexplored vulnerability: distinct human recognition latencies for symbolic numbers. By modeling cognitive latency patterns and leveraging acoustic keystroke signatures, RecSpy learns individual and digit-level recognition features through contrastive and self-supervised learning. Furthermore, we also introduce a novel Logic-Guided Inference Network that integrates recognition patterns with the reasoning capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to prune the hypothesis space and infer complete PIN sequences. We extensively evaluate RecSpy on both Android and iOS devices, and results show that it improves the probability of successful inference by up to 4000×, which demonstrates a practical threat to current mobile authentication systems and shows that representation learning and LLMs can enable new side-channel attacks.", "tldr": "We propose the first cognition-driven side-channel attack that leverages LLM-based reasoning to infer PINs on randomized soft keyboards.", "keywords": ["Side-channel Attack", "Human Cognition"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7befb2b4a4665530905d976946af909bc271e087.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Authors present RecSpy, a novel cognition-driven acoustic side-channel attack that infers PINs on randomized soft keyboards.

This makes the PIN inference problem harder than that on fixed-layout but more realistic and vital to investigate.\n- **Novel concept of exploiting human cognitive recognition latency** for inferring PIN digits. This is novel and very interesting concept that also seems to be supported by referenced work. This approach enables a realistic threat model that only assumes microphone access through an installed malicious app on the victim's phone.\n- The attack seems to generalize between different smartphone and OS platforms (Android and iOS)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **The attack does not seem to be very successful.** Hit rates of 8%, 13%, and 29% for Top-20, Top-50 and Top-100, respectively, do not seem all that successful. Moreover, PIN entry usually has limits of 3 to at most 5 tries before being blocked by the apps (bank account apps or similar), making this very unrealistic.\n- **Lack of justification and evidence-supported rationale for the steps and components of the proposed method.** While the paper includes includes an ablation study for the third part using LLMs, the rest of the process offers only vague or no reasoning for design choices. Each step of the method is packed with many different components (e.g., SENs, CNNs, LSTMs in just one part of the method). The selection of these specific components appears arbitrary, as the authors provide little to no justification or empirical support for their choices. This raises significant doubt regarding the necessity for such highly complex method, and makes the method challenging to evaluate and validate.\n- **The provided explanation of the method is incomplete,** leaving some open questions about its overall process. Specifically, there is ambiguity surrounding the collection and application of user (victim) data. The authors fail to clarify when this data is collected in the process and how it is integrated and utilized by the method. The training schemes (paragraphs) require a more detailed discussion on what data is used and the precise data collection methodology. Moreover, a significant ambiguity exists in the method's ability to differentiate keystrokes: it is not clearly explained how the system distinguishes between inputs related to PINs and general smartphone usage, such as typing messages. \n- **The evaluation of the proposed attack method is significantly limited** due to its comparison against only random guessing. This minimal baseline restricts the proper assessment of the attack's true performance and efficacy."}, "questions": {"value": "These questions are, in most part, addition to the stated weakness.\n\n- My impression is that the results are not very good. Thus, what are the reasons for such a performance, and what makes these metrics and these results indicate a successful attack and a real threat to user's PIN security? Top-20 does not seem to be good enough for limited PIN tries, and with the statement from the paper, \"an attacker can continuously collect data and attempt guesses over time\", the question raises as to how long does it then take, and how much data is necessary?\n- What are the implications of this work? Should smartphone designers/app designers do something and should users of those smartphone be concerned? This is also connected with the previous point on the attack's success.\n- The terms utilized in this work, such as Individual-level Recognition, and Digit-level Discrimination, individual-specific patterns and digit-level latencies are not very clear. Moreover, they are never explicitly explained. For example, only in training scheme for IRM, it is said that the data is labelled with the age groups, meaning that this is where the reader learns that the individual-level recognition means the age group recognition specifically (if I understand that correctly). So, my suggestion is that these terms are explained more explicitly to avoid confusion.\n- Why are all three steps of the method necessary? How do you select all the components and their combinations for each of the steps? Also, some of the hyperparameters are mentioned, such as number of epoch, and the choice for those is also not discussed.\n- Another confusion stems from the data and data handling. \n\t- There is a dataset in Section 3.3. (143 participants) and a dataset from Section 7.1 (40 participants). Is the 40 participants data a a subset of 143 participants data or a completely new group of participants? With the same group of people, there can be bias in the ML methods utilized.\n\t- Is it an assumption that the attacker has a similar dataset that is collected offline and labelled with age groups?\n\t- At which point is the victim's data collected (for inference) and how is it utilized in the method?\n\t- The data described in Section 3.3 is preprocessed by removing silence and aligned to a specific time. Is the collected data from victim user also preprocessed in this way?\n\t- From the collected victim's data, how does the attacker differ between keystrokes related to the PIN entries and the rest of the smartphone usage?\n- Why was the attack method only compared with random guessing?\n\nAdditional comments/questions (less relevant)\n- How does your approach work if the keyboard layout is not randomized? \n- \"but the relative differences among digits remained unchanged.\" - This is not true, look at times for numbers 2 and 8 in the 31-40 and 41-50 age group.\n- What would be limitations of this work, or possible countermeasures?\n\t- Can users detect suspicious background operations, e.g., from the decreasing battery life due to more power used while they are not actively using their smartphone?\n- Due to the high complexity of the method, reproducing the work appears tedious and is unlikely to be successful given the lack of reported hyperparameters. Thus, providing the source code and, ideally, the collected datasets would significantly benefit this research direction and allow for proper validation."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ICzfCgWoyT", "forum": "jG4o0mnfJ1", "replyto": "jG4o0mnfJ1", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14592/Reviewer_nroz"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14592/Reviewer_nroz"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14592/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761769867897, "cdate": 1761769867897, "tmdate": 1762924976641, "mdate": 1762924976641, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes an innovative cognitive-driven acoustic side-channel attack scheme called RecSpy, which records stereo tap acoustics on smartphones and exploits digit‑specific cognitive latencies via IRM, DDN, and an LLM‑based LIN to infer 6‑digit PINs on randomized keypads.

Are the training and evaluation participants entirely distinct?\n3. While the paper compares RecSpy to random guessing, it does not benchmark against lightweight models (e.g., logistic regression, CRFs) or prior keystroke eavesdropping techniques. Is it possible that prior methods or lighter models can achieve attack performance slightly worse than RecSpy, but with much lower cost and constraints?\n4.

Reporting only something like \"x improvement over $10^{-6}$\" (e.g., the numbers reported in Section 7.2) can be somewhat misleading.\n\n- Given the randomized layout, the paper should include a direct comparison against an audio-only baseline, such as a layout-agnostic KeyListener-like model [2] retrained to either classify each tap's spectrogram into digit labels without position cues or infer same/different constraints across taps, so the unique contribution of the cognition-driven modules is clear.\n\n- Reliance on LLM reasoning to extract/prune repetition priors raises robustness and faithfulness concerns. Prior work shows chain-of-thought style reasoning can be brittle and unfaithful, and performance often depends on decoding strategies like self-consistency [3], which suggests the Pruning Reasoner may be sensitive to prompts/seeds and could overfit to training distributions unless carefully stress-tested.\n\n- There are also reproducibility issues: the paper provides no stated plan to release code or data, and that the dataset is only described at a high level (devices, participant counts, and collection protocol) without an accessible corpus or retrieval details, preventing independent verification or re-analysis.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] J.
