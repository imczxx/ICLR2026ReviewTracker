They either treat each document as an isolated knowledge graph, which preserves contextual purity but prevents cross-document reasoning, or merge them into a single, massive graph, leading to entity saturation and contextual noise pollution. To resolve this core conflict, we introduce the BridgeRAG framework, designed to elegantly achieve both \"rtitioned isolation\"and \"ross-partition linking\"or multiple documents. BridgeRAG is a collaborative framework that integrates static linking and dynamic reasoning. Experiments on multi-hop question answering benchmarks like HotpotQA show that BridgeRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG models, especially on complex questions that require deep cross-partition navigation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["RAG", "Knowledge Graphs", "Multi-hop Question Answering", "Multi-Document Reasoning", "LLM Agents", "Planned Navigation"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/51f5805fffc4fa55eb2d7ef9f890b997e3aefb09.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper BridgeRAG: A Framework for Reasoning over Partitioned Knowledge Graphs presents a framework for querying over multiple documents, evaluated in the context of multi-hop question answering.

However, the system does not use graphs per se, as the LLMs are not equipped for dealing with data in graph format. Therefore, the resulting graph is summarized using an LLM (both at the entity level and at the document level), and the rest of the processing is done on the generated text.\n\nThe authors of the paper do not clearly delineate their own work from existing tools and methods. It is therefore very difficult to accurately delineate their contributions.\n\nThe contributions as stated by the authors consist in proposing a framework for doing RAG across multiple documents and introducing three mechanisms to this end: knowledge predigestion (creating entity-level and document-level summaries based on the information in the knowledge graph); hybrid entity linking (matching the entities across documents using encodings of their summaries and an LLM-based SAME_AS score) and dynamic working memory (which deals with expanding the graph starting from the original query and documents)."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper has potential, however, the way it was written makes it difficult to understand and to replicate.

To resolve this “contextual purity vs knowledge connectivity” dilemma, the authors propose BridgeRAG, a two-phase framework. Offline, it “pre-digests” documents and uses hybrid (LLM + embedding) entity linking to build trustworthy SAME-AS links across otherwise isolated document-level KGs. Online, an LLM agent does iterative, multi-hop reasoning over these linked partitions: a multi-source weighted routing module picks the most relevant documents, and a Dynamic Working Memory (DWM) keeps only the highly relevant facts in context.

Invoking the LLM to summarize every entity neglects the issue of computational cost, leading to significant resource waste as the number of KG nodes increases. It is recommended to include experiments analyzing time consumption and computational overhead. Moreover, while the idea of leveraging broad world knowledge and contextual cues from entity summaries to disambiguate whether two entities refer to the same real-world object is sound, this approach causes severe exponential growth in LLM invocations, making it impractical for large document collections.\n\n(2) The Dynamic Working Memory (DWM) module in BridgeRAG is presented as the “core innovation” of the framework, but from a rigorous review perspective, its novelty is limited. The first step of DWM—using IsSufficient to determine whether the current context adequately answers the question—cites Liu et al. (2025) and follows the established “self-evaluation and reflection” paradigm seen in Self-RAG (Asai et al., 2024), Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), and Critic-CoT / Self-Consistency (Kumar et al., 2025). The subsequent “generation of new sub-questions” is likewise a common Query Refinement strategy. The second step, \n, which generates refined sub-questions based on prior context, is already well-established, as in RQ-RAG (Chan et al., 2024) under its “query refinement through LLM planning” approach.\n\n(3) The construction of cross-document experimental datasets is insufficiently described. Given that typical LLMs handle around 5,000 tokens effectively, the rationale for the chosen dataset configuration remains unclear.
