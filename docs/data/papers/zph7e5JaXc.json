KD methods typically ask the student to mimic the teacher's distribution over the entire output. However, a student with limited capacity can be overwhelmed by such extensive supervision causing a distribution mismatch, especially in complex reasoning tasks. We propose Token-Selective Dual Knowledge Distillation (TSD-KD), a framework for student-centric distillation. TSD-KD focuses on distilling important tokens for reasoning and encourages the student to explain reasoning in its own words. TSD-KD combines indirect and direct distillation. Indirect distillation uses a weak form of feedback based on preference ranking. The student proposes candidate responses generated on its own; the teacher re-ranks those candidates as indirect feedback without enforcing its entire distribution. Direct distillation uses distribution matching; however, it selectively distills tokens based on the relative confidence between teacher and student. Finally, we add entropy regularization to maintain the student's confidence during distillation. Overall, our method provides the student with targeted and indirect feedback to support its own reasoning process and to facilitate self-improvement. The experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of TSD-KD on 10 challenging reasoning benchmarks, outperforming the baseline and runner-up in accuracy by up to 54.4\\% and 40.3\\%, respectively. Notably, a student trained by TSD-KD even outperformed its own teacher model in four cases by up to 20.3\\%.", "tldr": "TSD-KD is a new knowledge distillation method that maximizes performance by selectively distilling only key reasoning tokens from a large model and guiding the smaller model to learn on its own, instead of forcing it to mimic the entire output.", "keywords": ["Knowledge Distillation", "Transfer Learning", "Large Language Model"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/33a4a4558e11c1323a6718c2243e0c97ade96f69.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/38a7d49f9d035fd12598c19819b4142fdeda9309.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Token-Selective Dual Knowledge Distillation (TSD-KD), a student-centric framework for improving reasoning through selective and dual-mode knowledge transfer.

This phenomenon, which guides the model learning process, has been well-established in antecedent works (such as the RL-based methods by Wang et al. (2025) and Lei et al. (2025)). Therefore, the paper's contribution lies primarily in the engineering application and integration of this existing principle into the knowledge distillation domain for selective supervision, rather than a breakthrough in fundamental mechanism discovery or method innovation.\n2) The TSD-KD methodology lacks deep theoretical innovation in distillation, being an effective combination of existing techniques and intuitive heuristic rules. Specifically, the Indirect Distillation employs the established Plackett-Luce (PL) model from RLHF, and Direct Distillation uses the known Generalized JSD (GKD) loss. While the \"uncertainty gap\" token selection mechanism is novel, it functions as an intuitive heuristic rule. Consequently, the paper's main contribution is the effective integration of these existing components, rather than the proposal of a new foundational distillation mechanism or a novel loss function.\n3) The crucial length of the \"Opener\" for selective supervision is defined by an empirical hyperparameter: the c% accumulated entropy threshold (set to c=10% based on ablation studies). This fixed-ratio approach is a heuristic inherited from similar suggestions in other reinforcement learning works. The absence of a dynamic or adaptive mechanism that adjusts this threshold based on the specific complexity and depth of the reasoning task limits the theoretical generalizability of the method, as the optimal empirical value may vary significantly across different domains (e.g., mathematical vs. common-sense reasoning) and model architectures."}, "questions": {"value": "1) Given that the insight \"high-entropy/uncertain tokens contribute more\" is highly similar to recent RL-based works (e.g., Wang et al. (2025) and Lei et al.

How does the student model maintain reasoning consistency and quality during the subsequent unsupervised phases?
