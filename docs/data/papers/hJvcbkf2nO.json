A related concept, representation compatibility, is investigated via model stitching, where an affine transformation aligns two models to solve a task. However, recent studies highlight a critical limitation: models trained on different information cues can still produce compatible representations, making them appear functionally similar \\cite{smithfunctional}. To address this, we pose two requirements for similarity under model stitching, probing both forward and backward compatibility. To realize this, we introduce invariance-aware Functional Latent Alignment (I-FuLA), a novel model stitching setting.

The paper is difficult to follow. The writing is often dense, and key concepts like \"information cues\" are used without a precise definition. Most importantly, Figures 4, 5 and 6 are not well-explained in the caption, are hard to interpret and it is extremely hard to match the trace to the correct item in the legend. \n\n2. The interpretation of some results is questionable. For example, in the cross-data stitching experiment (CIFAR-RGB vs. CIFAR-grayscale), the sharp performance drop for I-FuLA is presented as a success. However, one could argue that since the underlying image content is the same, with different augmentations, a good similarity metric should yield high similarity. The paper does not defend *why* this sharp drop is a desirable property.\n\n\n3. The paper's core premise, that models trained on different \"information cues\" should be considered functionally dissimilar, is not sufficiently motivated. This stance appears to contradict a growing body of work suggesting that models can and should learn compatible or geometrically aligned representations if the underlying data semantics are the same (e.g., the Platonic Hypothesis). The paper fails to adequately position itself against this literature, for example the works on relative representations are cited but sligthly misinterpreted (Moschella et al., 2022, Cannistraci et al., 2023): they have already been used as invariance-aware similarity measure between representations  (e.g., Section 4.1 in Moschella et al) and not only for model stitching.\n\n\n4. The analysis is missing crucial ablations. The expressivity of the stitching transformation S is fixed to a linear layer. However, the capacity of this transformation is a critical factor that could heavily influence the stitching outcome. An analysis with different capacities (e.g., identity, a small MLP) is needed to disentangle the effects of the stitching objective from the effects of the transformation's capacity."}, "questions": {"value": "- Could the authors clarify their position with respect to the emerging similarity literature? These works suggest that compatible representations should emerge from data with shared semantics, even if the inputs differ (e.g., images and captions). Why should models trained on grayscale vs. RGB images be considered functionally dissimilar?\n\n- Regarding the cross-data stitching experiment (Fig. 4, \"Cross-data\"), the authors present the sharp decline in performance for I-FuLA as a positive outcome. Further elaboration is needed on why this is a desirable result. An alternative viewpoint is that the models should be able to find common ground, as the semantic content is largely preserved between colored and grayscale images.\n\n- How do the results and conclusions change when varying the expressivity of the stitching transformation S (e.g., using a multi-layer perceptron instead of a single linear layer)? It seems possible that a more expressive stitch layer could overcome the dissimilarities that I-FuLA is designed to detect, which would challenge the paper's conclusions.\n \n- The paper would benefit from a more high-level, intuitive explanation of the core concepts before diving into the formal notation.

Clarity and Presentation**: The major weakness is that the paper is dense and can be difficult to follow. It doesn't follow a clear and linear story. Additional, the core concepts of \"forward\" and \"backward\" compatibility, while central to the paper, are not introduced with sufficient clarity early on. The notation, though systematic, adds to the cognitive load. The figures, particularly the \"stitching plots,\" are small and contain a lot of information, making them hard to decipher without extensive cross-referencing with the text. A more guided walkthrough of one of the plots in the main text would have been beneficial.\n\n* **W2. Limited Experimental Scope**: The experimental validation is conducted on relatively small-scale datasets (CIFAR-10 and a 10-class subset of ImageNet) and primarily with one architecture (ResNet-18). While VGG-16 and ViT-Tiny are included in the appendix, the main claims are built on the ResNet-18 results. The findings would be much more compelling if demonstrated on larger-scale benchmarks (e.g., the full ImageNet-1k) and with a more diverse set of modern architectures, especially larger Transformers.\n\n* **W3. Novelty and Contribution Statement**: The paper's primary novelty lies in formalizing the \"backward compatibility\" requirement and using IRIs to test it. However, this could be stated more directly in the introduction and contributions list. The introduction of I-FuLA, while new, appears to be a secondary contribution, as the \"invariance-aware\" setting is what drives most of the significant results. The paper could be improved by more clearly delineating the impact of each of these two contributions.\n\n* **W4. Comparison to Other Metrics and Related Work**: The paper does not compare its similarity findings to other representation similarity metrics like Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) [1] or to other more recent works such as [2]. Such a comparison would help contextualize their results and clarify what unique insights the notion of \"functional similarity\" provides over geometric or statistical similarity of representations. Additional, the authors could consider including in the related work section the following model-stitching works [4,5,6].\n\n* **W5. Reproducibility**: Providing the code would be essential for the community to verify the results and build upon this work.\n\n* **W6. Subjectivity of \"Meaningful Similarity**: A core claim of the paper is that it provides a more \"meaningful\" measure of similarity. However, \"meaningful\" is never formally defined and is instead based on intuitive sanity checks. While the experiments are convincing, the paper would be stronger if it could connect its measure to a more concrete, objective property, or discuss the philosophical underpinnings of what makes a similarity measure meaningful.\n\n\n---\n[1] Kornblith, Simon, et al. \"Similarity of neural network representations revisited.\" International conference on machine learning.
