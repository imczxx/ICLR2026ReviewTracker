In this paper, we consider the setting of online dynamics adaptation, where policies are trained in the source domain with sufficient data, while only limited interactions with the target domain are allowed. There are a few existing works that address the dynamics mismatch by employing domain classifiers, value-guided data filtering, or representation learning. Instead, we study the domain adaptation problem from a generative modeling perspective. Specifically, we introduce DADiff, a diffusion-based framework that leverages the discrepancy between source and target domain generative trajectories in the generation process of the next state to estimate the dynamics mismatch. Both reward modification and data selection variants are developed to adapt the policy to the target domain. We also provide a theoretical analysis to show that the performance difference of a given policy between the two domains is bounded by the generative trajectory deviation. More discussions on the applicability of the variants and the connection between our theoretical analysis and the prior work are further provided. We conduct extensive experiments in environments with kinematic and morphology shifts to validate the effectiveness of our method. The results demonstrate that our method provides superior performance compared to existing approaches, effectively addressing the dynamics mismatch.

The high-level idea of it is to obtain a more fine-grained shift measurement compared to DARC and PAR, and the theoretical analysis is actully similar to those paper, except with sligtly different notation of the shfit measurement. Also, the performance doesn't have a significant improvement compared to them. \n\n3, DARC and PAR have been shown to be ineffective when the shift is large. What is your performance on a large shift case? \n\n4, The performance of your method seems to rely on an assumption that the domain shift is not that large. If the shift is too large, the KL in Eq. 5 will grow extremely large, or even infinity. The performance is bounded only when the KL of the source and target is bounded. Also, as stated in [1], the KL can be ill defined when the shift is large because there is no support of some target transition in source domain. \n\nIn summary, I am questioning whether the reward modification method is still a valid method to solve the off-dynamcis RL problem as many previous work [1,2] has shown the limitation of it and when the shift is large (the joint distribution is small), the reward modicication method always fails, performing good in the source but poorly in the target.   \n\n[1] Composite Flow Matching for Reinforcement Learning with Shifted-Dynamics Data\n[2] Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning via Domain Adaptation and Reward Augmented Imitation"}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "PMlkJ4jhC7", "forum": "9aaiQbIUND", "replyto": "9aaiQbIUND", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9260/Reviewer_5rqK"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9260/Reviewer_5rqK"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9260/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761933079317, "cdate": 1761933079317, "tmdate": 1762920910308, "mdate": 1762920910308, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the problem of online dynamics adaptation in reinforcement learning, where a policy is pre-trained in a source domain (e.g., a simulator) and must be adapted to a target domain (e.g., the real world) with only limited interactions.

The paper acknowledges that VGDF, a model-based method, is significantly slower, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of DADiff's own computational cost (e.g., training/inference time, memory footprint) compared to PAR, which is a crucial factor for real-world applicability. The increased complexity needs a more compelling justification in terms of capability.\n\nThe experiments are conducted on standard MuJoCo locomotion tasks, which, while common, have relatively simple and deterministic dynamics. The paper’s core claim is about capturing complex dynamics mismatches via diffusion models. To truly validate the advantage of modeling the full generative trajectory, experiments on tasks with more complex, high-dimensional, or highly stochastic dynamics would be far more convincing.
