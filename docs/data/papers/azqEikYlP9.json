Poorly placed seams often result in severe UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure mode for another—producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency and visual fidelity.", "tldr": "An autoregressive GPT-style seam generator conditioned on point-cloud inputs.", "keywords": ["Mesh Cutting", "Auto-Regressive", "Direct Preference Optimization"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4132c0cd8be6e62b2e281cc835348681bf346fee.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style model designed to generate high-quality mesh seams for UV unwrapping and texture mapping.

However, the distortion problem still exists even with the best choices of seams. Some methods instead opted for methods that learn to represent textures directly on 3D surfaces / points bypassing the UV altogether.

What is it about DPO that makes it special for this case? \n- I would have expected some (maybe small) dataset that is artist curated (maybe through some interaction) that acts as a guide to align the output with artist preferences. Otherwise, we rely completely on the density/fidelity metrics to capture the full preferences of the humans/artists, which I believe is not realistic. \n- The paper stresses too much the topology aspect but then uses a point cloud encoder to encode some skeleton, completely ignoring the mesh structure, which also provides topological information. Is there a rationale behind this choice? Can we see comparisons? \n- Seams seem to be snapped to mesh vertices / edges. When elongated and potentially large triangles are present, this might lead to failures. Thus, I would ask for a comparison with different mesh structures where triangle distributions are non uniform. \n- Paper really has very few related works and seems to ignore a very large literature on UV-mapping and texturing. I would strongly suggest the authors to conduct a thorough literature survey.

The most significant weakness is the limited perceived impact of the problem itself. UV unwrapping is a highly specialized task, and the improvements, while real, feel incremental. The work comes across as a sophisticated engineering solution to a niche problem, rather than fundamental research that would be broadly interesting or applicable to the general ICLR audience.\n\n2. The method's robustness is not fully explored. The final step (Section 4.3) relies on projecting predicted 3D coordinates to the nearest mesh vertex and then finding a shortest geodesic path. This seems\npotentially brittle. How does the method perform on meshes with complex topologies, noise, non-manifold geometry, or if the initial 3D coordinate prediction is slightly inaccurate? The reliance on a clean topological graph seems like a strong assumption.\n\n3. The paper is missing a hyperparameter analysis. For instance, the dual-branch encoder samples $N_g=N_t=30,720$ points. How sensitive is the model to this number? Similarly, the DPO stage introduces its own set of hyperparameters (e.g., the $\\beta$ in the DPO loss, the learning rate for post-training) which are not ablated.\n\n4.

Following on the weakness mentioned above: Could you provide more details on the failure cases of the seam projection step (Section 4.3)? What happens if the nearest-neighbor search maps a predicted endpoint to the wrong vertex, or if the shortest geodesic path is not the semantically intended one?\n\n2. The preference dataset for DPO is built on two automated metrics: distortion and density. The preference criterion (Eq. 4) is very strict, requiring a candidate to be strictly better on both metrics to be considered \"preferred\". Did you experiment with a more relaxed definition, for example, a weighted sum of metrics, or using a Pareto frontier? It seems this strict criterion might discard many useful comparison pairs and bias the optimization.\n\n3.
