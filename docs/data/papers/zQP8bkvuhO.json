Previous deep learning approaches have primarily relied on pixel-based representations of weather data, which can lead to significant data redundancy and inefficiencies in capturing the continuous nature of weather phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, EllipWeather, which leverages Gaussian ellipsoids to represent weather patterns, as weather phenomena can be effectively modeled using a mixture of Gaussian distributions. With this representation, we first develop an equivariant graph neural network to capture the intrinsic equivariance of weather variances, specifically tailored to process Gaussian ellipsoids for weather prediction tasks. Then we also demonstrate the potential of EllipWeather in downstream tasks such as data compression and downscaling (super-resolution). Extensive experiments on commonly used datasets show that EllipWeather achieves superior performance over previous works.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["representation learning", "weather modeling"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4f1fb3be7e56b087fcefb89509fb69ebe9c00074.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a weather forecasting paradigm by shifting from pixel-based grids to a compact, continuous representation using Gaussian ellipsoids.

Decomposing complex weather into basis functions/distributions is challenging; prior work like Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO) attempted spherical harmonics representations but did not yield significant performance gains over baselines. As a central contribution, this assumption requires clearer validation.\n* Why implement equivariance via EGNN rather than Spherical CNNs, which are more suited to grid-based data? The shift to graphs for Gaussian ellipsoids seems unnecessary, and the proposed method appears to merely apply existing EGNN principles. Moreover, equivariant models feel unintuitive for regional (non-global) datasets used here.\n* If the data is regarded as graphs, the performance of related equivariant GNNs should be compared.\n* The paper omits references to relevant works like Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO) and scaling spherical cnns.\n* Table 1 lacks specification of the prediction time scale, but results suggest single-step forecasting.
