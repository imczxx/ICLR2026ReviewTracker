While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a drop-in, test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. On Google Scanned Objects, PowerRemap has a stabilization rate of 98.3% for the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer WaLa. Overall, this work is a case study on how diffusion model behavior can be understood and guided based on mechanistic analysis, linking a circuit-level cross-attention mechanism to diffusion-dynamics accounts of trajectory bifurcations.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["mechanistic interpretability", "diffusion dynamics", "test-time intervention", "3D diffusion"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1478dd892e99b7250c468551ac416380adad4862.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper reveals and deeply analyzes a catastrophic failure phenomenon that exists in the current most advanced 3D diffusion Transformers when performing surface reconstruction from sparse point clouds, which the authors call meltdown.

Based on this insight, the author proposed a simple yet effective test-time intervention method called PowerRemap.

There is still some speculation about the mechanism explanation for \"why does a decreased spectral entropy reduce invalid outputs?\". It is suggested that the author deepen this explanation.

The paper presents an interesting application of existing activation patching method to identify geometry-related representations within 3D latent diffusion models.\n2.

The proposed PowerRemap intervention is simple yet effective, demonstrating strong recovery performance on WaLa model and the GSO dataset by intervening the cross-attention head outputs that have causal connections with output surface connectivity. Nonethelss, it is questionable whether this intervention method generalizes to other models (see weakness 2)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The generalizability of this finding is very limited. The experiment focused on two models (WaLa and MAKE-A-SHAPE) and evaluated the meltdown on only one dataset (Google Scanned Objects). It is unknown whether the meltdown phenonomon is unique to the GSO datasets, and if the cross-attention head that controls the meltdown can be found in latent 3D diffusion transformer, other than WaLa and MAKE-A-SHAPE.\n2.  As shown in Tables 2 and 3 in Appendix B.3 (p. 21), the effectiveness of PowerRemap differs significantly when applied to the WALA model versus the MAKE-A-SHAPE model. While PowerRemap recovers 98% of the meltdowned generation for WALA on GSO dataset, it recovers only about 10% of meltdowned cases for MAKE-A-SHAPE model. This large discrepancy again raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed intervention and the causal role of the identified cross-attention head in MAKE-A-SHAPE model.\n3. The interpretation offered in this paper is also limited in depth. What exact geometric features have been learned by this cross-attention head? If one ablates this cross-attention head, will the meltdown phenomenon disappear? What is the trade-off between suppressing the spectral entropy of this head's output versus ablating it. \n4. The trends shown in Figure 3 differ between individual and population levels. The difference at population level (across seeds) was unexplained. Within the same random seed, the plot shows that the connectivity $C$ sharply increases after the spectral entropy exceeds a threshold. However, across seeds, the meltdowns (sudden jump in $C$) occur earlier even when the spectral entropy is lower. Current text does not explain thos trend at the population level.\n5. The influence of PowerRemap strength $\\gamma$ on reconstruction connectivity is not studied. It remains unclear how $\\gamma$ should be selected in practice or whether larger / smaller values introduce any trade-offs in reconstruction quality besides connectivity.\n6. It is also unclear what data and how many data points and random seeds are used to localized the meltdown circuit in section 3.2.\n7. Why search only the cross-attention outputs? The decision to restrict the search space to cross-attention outputs is insufficiently justified. Since the cross-attention outputs will be written back to the residual stream, will you obtain similar results if patch residual stream activations? How much worse does the activation patching on MLP layer outputs compared to the cross-attention outputs."}, "questions": {"value": "1. What are the patching results for other components (MLP, self-attention, and residual stream) in the latent diffusion transformer?\n2. As mentioned in Weakness 5, it is unclear what data and how many samples were used to produce Figures 2 and 3. Do the observed patterns in these plots generalize when evaluated on more data points and random seeds?\n3. In Figure 3, the change in connectivity is sudden, suggesting meltdown is relatively binary phenomenon. However, the spectral entropy of the cross-attention head outputs varies smoothly. Does this imply that later MLP blocks might also contribute to (or mitigate) the meltdown failures?\n4. For the qualitative examples shown in Figure 4, what are the corresponding ground-truth 3D shapes of these four objects?\n5. According to Appendix B.3 (p. 20, l. 1060), the PowerRemap intervention was applied only to failure cases of the model’s generation.
