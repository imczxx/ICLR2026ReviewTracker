In this paper we show that it also learns photometric understanding due to training pairs with differing illumination.

To do so, we use self-supervised cross-lighting and intrinsic consistency losses on a dataset two orders of magnitude smaller than that used to train CroCo. This comprises pixel-wise aligned, paired images under different illumination. We further show that the lighting latent can be used and manipulated for tasks such as interpolation between lighting conditions, shadow removal, and albedo estimation.

The paper is framed as an application showcase (e.g., lighting stabilization in timelapse, temporal upsampling, shadow removal, intrinsic decomposition, etc.), but its core contribution is the insight into repurposing foundation models. It would be much stronger if repositioned as a systematic investigation (similar to Probe3D) into which and how pre-trained vision foundation models capture photometric properties, and why. The current study is confined to CroCo, missing a crucial comparative analysis against other foundation models. An investigation should include:\n    - Other two-view encoders (e.g., DUST3R, MAST3R) and matchers (e.g., RoMa, GIM).\n    - Single-view models known for strong correspondence (e.g., DINOv2, DINOv3).\n    - Multi-view models where two-view is a special case (e.g., VGGT, Pi-3).\n  - Such a comparison would provide more generalizable insights into how different pre-training objectives (cross-view, contrastive, etc.) contribute to learning photometric understanding.\n\n- **W2.** Mixed results on quantitative evaluations and missing some evaluations.\n    - We only have quantitative results for shadow removal (Table 1) and intrinsic decomposition (Table 2), while the other applications (lighting stabilization in timelapse, temporal upsampling) lack any quantitative benchmarks.\n    - The intrinsic decomposition results are state-of-the-art (Table 2), while shadow removal is not (Table 1). This is acceptable if the paper is repositioned as an investigation (per W1), where the goal is demonstrating feasibility rather than beating every SOTA. However, under the current paper's narrative, it is difficult to justify the advantage of CroCoDiLight over other specialized methods.\n    - That is, if we shift the paper's focus from application showcase to systematic investigation, we don't need to provide quantitative results for all applications, and we don't necessarily need to beat every SOTA.\n\nOverall, the paper's insight (cross-view completion models implicitly learn photometric understanding) is valuable, but the paper's positioning and scope are not strong enough to provide a comprehensive investigation of this insight.

How would the model work if instead of the Croco encoder the  MAE, DINOv2 or DINOv3 encoder is used and disentangled? Would the model perform less well on the downstream tasks? \n\nAlso, the ablation in Table 6 raises a concern: the architecture of the two models compared are no longer identical so while supposedly it is true, it is not directly shown that the gain comes from the pre-trained model and not from the architecture choice.  It would have been insightful to evaluate also a model that retains the CroCo encoder architecture but is initialized from scratch.

Good writing.\n- The paper starts with a strong observation & hypothesis, recognizing the (possible) inherent capability within the original CroCo paper that its encoder implicitly encodes illumination information, which enables delighting & relighting during its novel view reconstruction task, and extending it to the hypothesis that this capability can be explicitly harnessed to achieve photometric tasks such as relighting/shadow removal/delighting. I believe the work is well-motivated and tackles an interesting question about the nature of CroCo and its representation.\n- The authors offer a simple and intuitive solution to the problem (though this might point to the lack of novelty, as I would mention in the weakness section) by including a latent vector that disentangles lighting from geometry during the training phase. The method is simple and straightforward, effectively achieving its goal of lighting disentanglement as shown in the results."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The original CroCo paper was a representation learning paper, focused on pre-training the model to be generally more suitable for various 3D / NVS downstream tasks from a simple two-view reconstruction loss. However, it seems that this work is more focused on training a model towards each specific downstream task (relighting / shadow removal / intrinsic image decomposition), which makes this work more closely aligned with existing relighting methods, of which there are already many. However, in this view, the core method of this paper (adding a separate latent vector for style and teaching model to change 'style (lighting)' of the image) very closely resembles previous GAN methods that achieve similar goals in generative scene and seems to lack novelty. Is there a more general implication for this method that may be relevant to representation learning / other downstream tasks, as was the original CroCo?\n- The method requires datasets with identical geometry under different lighting, significantly limiting available training data. While synthetic datasets like HyperSim could be used, they introduce domain gap issues. How the authors address this fundamental limitation remains unclear.\n- Lighting manipulation requires \"walking\" through latent space, making it difficult to achieve specific desired lighting conditions. The paper lacks a demonstration of how users can specify target lighting or achieve reproducible, controllable results without another scene that has desired lighting - can this point be further elaborated?\n- What does this method have in advantage in comparison to Diffusion-based relighting methods, especially IC-Light (ICLR 2025), whose lighting can be controlled with text prompt as well as can be applied to various domains beyond scene imagery (i.e. including human faces, etc.)?

The method uses a single global lighting latent, which fundamentally cannot capture the geometric information needed for sharp shadow boundaries. Sharp shadows arise from point lights and hard occluders, they encode precise light direction, occluder position, and surface geometry. A single image-space vector cannot represent this information, especially when shadow boundaries need to move correctly across multiple frames. The evidence is scattered throughout:\n\nFig. 17 shows direct shadows being replaced with ambient occlusion\nSection 5.1 notes shadow motion during interpolation is \"not entirely smooth\" and Section F.1 admits tiles fully in shadow fail.\nMost successful examples (Figs. 3-4, 8-10) show soft shadows, diffuse lighting, or outdoor scenes with gradual illumination changes\nThe timelapse examples work well for slow sun movement creating soft shadow transitions, but would likely fail for a person walking past a lamp creating sharp moving shadows\n\nTiling artifacts is unresolved: Section 3.5 and Fig. 16 show color inconsistencies from the sliding window approach. Paper mention potential fixes (Poisson blending, global reference tile) but don't implement them. Why present solutions but not evaluate them? The lighting latent being \"optimally used\" at 448×448 is a fundamental design limitation. This significantly undermines the high-resolution claims. Shadow removal metrics don't really match qualitative results.\n\nFig. 17 shows cases where your method is \"working better\" by removing additional shadows, but this also suggests the model isn't learning what the benchmark defines as shadow removal in my opinion.\n\nLimited architectural justification- Why a single lighting latent and why D=1024? \n\nPaper didn't provide ablations on:\n\nMultiple lighting latents per image/tile (which would help with local lighting)\nLighting latent dimensionality (is 1024 dimensions necessary? wasteful?)\nSpatial lighting maps vs. single vector\n\nThe Table 3 ablation uses a much simpler baseline (just linear embedding + DPT head), making it unclear whether gains come from CroCo features or better architecture. A fairer comparison would use the same I/R architecture without CroCo pretraining.\nImage-space lighting is a fundamental limitation: Section 5 and Appendix C mention the lighting latent works in \"image space\" not \"world space\" but don't explore the implications.
