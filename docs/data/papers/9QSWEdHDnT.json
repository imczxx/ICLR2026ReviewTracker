However, existing approaches still face two major challenges: (1) the lack of a global mechanism to integrate and interact across diverse reasoning hypotheses, and (2) the absence of structured analysis techniques to filter redundancy and extract salient reasoning features. To address these challenges, we propose GHS-TDA (Global Hypothesis Space with Topological Data Analysis), a two-stage reasoning framework that achieves synergistic enhancement through global information integration and topological feature analysis. Specifically, (i) Global Hypothesis Space (GHS) constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph via agenda-driven multi-agent interactions, integrating diverse hypotheses and their semantic relations; (ii) Topological Data Analysis (TDA) applies persistent homology to extract multi-scale topological features, identify stable connected components and self-consistent loops, and derive a redundancy-free reasoning skeleton chain. GHS-TDA preserves reasoning diversity while leveraging topological stability to achieve self-aware convergence, ultimately producing high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths. Experimental results show that GHS-TDA consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and competitiveness in complex reasoning scenarios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models，Complex Reasoning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3bc3a1e01deb9229604fcb75dedda2eb603aa1f2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents GHS-TDA, a two-stage framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. It addresses limitations of existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, which often lack a global mechanism for integrating and validating multiple reasoning paths.

Although the authors proposed algorithmic acceleration, they did not provide further details, such as building an index, and vaguely did not give the real number of computations in the experiment.\n     - In addition, the entire process involves repeatedly generating paths, merging them to generate a global hypothesis graph, then converting it into embeddings, and using topological structure to extract a reasoning skeleton. The process is very complex for the reasoning stage, making it difficult to ensure computational and time overhead.\n\n3.\tKey methodological details are ambiguously described：The paper's descriptions are vague. For example, how to perform conflict detection is only vaguely described as \"Through unification, conflict detection, and closure inference, GHS enhances semantic connections among nodes and overcomes the isolation of traditional path-based generation\". There is no detailed explanation of the specific algorithm, making it hard to believe the paper's contribution. There is also no specific description of how the method performs canonicalization. The correctness of the canonicalization plays a key role in the subsequent merging step.\n\n4.\tLack of Theoretical Foundation: The paper's central claim that the persistence of topological features like H₀ and H₁ characterizes reasoning reliability—lacks support from a theoretical model. Currently, this claim resembles a hypothesis retroactively inferred from experimental data, rather than a deduction derived from first principles, which weakens the theoretical grounding of the method. The concept of \"reasoning reliability\" is vaguely defined and is largely equated with final-answer correctness. We suggest the authors provide a more formal, process-oriented definition of reasoning reliability. Building upon this, they could then formally argue that the persistent topological features extracted by TDA serve as a effective proxy for this defined robustness."}, "questions": {"value": "Q1: On the Distance Metric\nThe hybrid distance metric is a key contribution of the work. However, the weights (α, β, γ) appear to be set empirically. Did the authors perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contribution of each component (semantic, structural, uncertainty) to the final performance? Furthermore, was the exploration of more complex, non-linear distance functions considered?\nQ2: On the Robustness of Graph Construction\nThe node merging process heavily relies on the \"canonical form\" and the threshold θ_merge. Is the method sufficiently sensitive to steps that are semantically similar but logically distinct (e.g., \"Assume X is true\" vs. \"Therefore we have proven X\")? Could the authors discuss the potential risks and consequences of incorrect node merging?\nQ3: On Computational Cost\nThe GHS-TDA framework involves multiple LLM calls for path generation, embedding computation, and confidence scoring. Compared to other multi-call baselines like AoT or ToT, could the authors provide a more detailed computational overhead analysis (e.g., total token consumption or latency)? For resource-constrained applications, are there components within the framework that could be streamlined or simplified?\nQ4: On Generalizability\nThe methodology seems to be agnostic to the underlying LLM. Have the authors tested GHS-TDA on smaller or open-source models (e.g., the Llama series)? If the performance gains are heavily dependent on a powerful base model like GPT-4, how might this affect the perceived generalizability and accessibility of the proposed method?\nQ5. Diversity of Multiple Reasoning Paths: You use the same LLM to generate multiple reasoning paths, hoping to obtain diverse ones. However, it cannot be guaranteed that the multiple reasoning paths are diverse. The reasoning tokens generated multiple times by the same LLM are actually similar, and diversity cannot be guaranteed. Consequently, the subsequent similarity calculations can hardly play a key role.\nQ6.
