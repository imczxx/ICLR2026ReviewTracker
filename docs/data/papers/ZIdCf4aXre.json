This motivates our *main conceptual contribution*: **energy shields**.\n  An energy shield is a novel, lightweight, adaptive controller that monitors a sequence of decisions and intervenes *probabilistically* to ensure runtime fairness smoothly, by utilizing physics-inspired energy functions to nudge the sequence towards fairness:\n  the more unfair the decisions, the stronger the nudging force becomes. This makes energy shields the **first** fairness shields to provide both *short-term safety and long-term liveness guarantees*.\n  Safety ensures that the running fairness measure stays within a running target interval with high probability,\n  and liveness ensures that the limit of the fairness measure lies within the limit target interval. \n  Intuitively, the short-term specifies the tolerated fairness values and the long-term specifies the desired fairness values. \n  We also provide a synthesis procedure for constructing the least intrusive energy shield for a given target specification, and demonstrate its efficiency experimentally.

The setting is that there is a decision maker deciding true/false outcomes in a sequential fashion and one wants to enforce that after some burn-in time, some target of true/false decision ratios is maintained within some interval, and that in the limit the ratio converges to some given value. A shield is a monitor that occasionally nudges decisions to help the decision maker satisfy the fairness goal. The key gap to address is that deterministic shields can be \"invasive/abrupt\" and costly to execute as they require solving a dynamic program. The proposed approach is instead to have a probabilistic shield that only nudges with some probability, thus ensuring more \"smooth\" shielding. The key insight is to decide with what probability to nudge based on an energy function that captures how much the decisions are deviating from the target fairness goals. The results on two examples illustrate that the probabilistic controller achieves the desired goals compared to a deterministic one"}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- Lifting deterministic shields to probabilistic ones is a very natural direction \n- The paper is technically well-executed and the theoretical contributions seem non-trivial (note, I'm not an expert here, so I can't really check how hard/novel this part is).

Can the authors discuss how their definitions related to calibration? (e.g., this paper https://proceedings.mlr.press/v247/qiao24a/qiao24a.pdf)\n\nHave you considered applying this approach to the predictions of auto-regressive language models (aka LLMs)? I can imagine a setting in which some set of words (maybe negative sentiments or known-GPT words like delve) should not be \"overly used\" and so they have a target probability. The shield would then monitor usage and occasionally \"re-weigh\" the LLM logits to ensure usage stays within target? In such a setting I would expect that your approach is more beneficial than deterministic or periodic monitors as those would make the output fluency (something measurable) worse.\n\n\nMINOR/OTHER:\n- No need to cite this, or do anything about it, but this line of work reminds me of older results in synthesizing controllers (and the idea of algorithmic improvisation). I can't find the paper that comes to mind on making sure a thermostat keeps temperatures within some bounds while in the limit reaching a desired temperature, but I found this maybe related paper (https://susmitjha.github.io/papers/iccps10.pdf).
