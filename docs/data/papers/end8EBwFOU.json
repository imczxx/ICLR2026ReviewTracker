In practice, this distributional assumption is well justified: For example, training diffusion models on finite data (and truncating the reverse process such that the variance of the forward process is non-zero at $t=0$) gives rise to $p_0$ being a GMM (empirical, slightly smoothed data distribution)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "+ **Practical applicability of Assumption 1**\n\t+ Since $s(x,t)$ is typically modeled with a neural network which is Lipschitz in $t$, the assumption of adding *independent* Gaussian perturbations $e_t$ seems strong. \n\t+ In practice, the score error will depend on the location $x$ (e.g., how far away $x$ is from the manifold), and will show strong temporal correlation.\n+ **Assumption 1 vs. $L^2$-bounded score assumption**\n\t+ While Assumption 1 implies $L^2$-boundedness, the reverse is not true: The assumption of $L^2$-bounded scores does make distributional assumptions, and is more general than Assumption 1. It also allows for temporal correlation, error distributions that depend on $x$, and non-Gaussian error, making it more practically relevant than Assumption 1.\n+ **Empirical Validation** \n\t+ The paper only provides a single experiment with a 1D GMM, where the score is perturbed when $t \\in [0, 0.4T]$. However, even in this controlled toy experiment where Assumption 1 is true by construction, the deviation between the magnitudes of theoretical and empirical Wasserstein distance is non-negligible. Additional experiments with different index sets $I$ and different (high-dimensional) GMMs are missing. Such experiments would strengthen the practical validity of the theoretical results.\n\t+ Experiments for non-GMM $p_0$ are missing. \n\t+ The paper lacks experiments that investigate the applicability of Assumption 1 in more practical scenarios.

The only numerical evidence in the main paper (Figure 1) is a toy example for mixture of Gaussians, which aims to illustrate that the empirical choices of small step-size at late-stage of generation can be explained by the theory. Even in this numerical example, it is not clear how the numerical errors in the right plot of Figure 1 are obtained.\n\n    (2) *inaccurate*: one of the main claims in this paper is that the theory can explain the empirical success of cosine/uniform log-SNR schedules compared to linear ones, with numerical evidence provided. However, I find the claim is inaccurate. If the authors meant to say linear schedule is bad due to large score error accumulation, it is not very accurate since the discretization error analysis [1] also dislikes the linear schedule. If the authors meant that their theory can explain that log-SNR is optimal, as illustrated in Figure 1-Right, I feel that is also inaccurate: in practice, the log-SNR schedule is not optimal if we want to optimize training, which is empirically studied in [2] and theoretically studied in [3]. \n\n2. **Questionable setting**: the theoretical setting assumes the score approximation errors are Gaussians, uniform in space. Although this setting makes the analysis work, whether it is reasonable is questionable. My concern is that in this oversimplified setting, some interpretations of the proved results might be misleading if we use it to understand diffusion models in practice.
