Lack of originality\n2. Missing motivation for Alg. 1\n3. (assuming the answer to q. 1 is yes) suspiciously non-standard treatment of the Wasserstein distance between PDs as optimal transport problem.\n\n1. The cited paper by Nigmetov and Morozov (by the way, as far as I know, the idea of modifying the shape of input by backpropagating through persistence diagrams first appeared in \"A topology layer for machine learning\" by Brüel-Gabrielsson et al., which probably should be cited) contains the matching loss as the main motivating example. Using the matching that realizes Wasserstein distance is a natural choice in some (but not all -- the paragraph below) scenarios.\n\nAnother point: the authors can mention in the conclusion a limitation of optimal transport approach: it is insensitive to spatial location of the topological features. If I had two holes far apart from each other, they can distorted so that the birth/death values for the deformed holes are such that Wasserstein  matching between the distorted version and the original matches spatially distant holes. Persistence diagram does not tell you anything about the location of your features in the input.\n\n2. I don't understand the need for Alg.1. If I naively use the critical set method for the target diagram that is given to me, I am trying to move the diagram to it directly. If I am using Alg. 1, I am computing some intermediate version and moving the diagram to this version -- but the gradients point exactly in the same direction. The paper needs to have at least enough experimental evidence that introducing this interpolated target buys us anything --- compare the convergence speed and the results of Alg. 1 with the \"matching loss for Wasserstein matching\".\n\n3. The paper seems to make it very important for the diagrams to have equal cardinality. The standard way of doing that is to add diagonal projections. Instead, the paper uses the 1/n weights which are quite suspicious and require careful explanation and motivation.\nBy the way, an interesting variation of the experiments for the paper setting could be as follows. Instead of trying to convert an optimal plan to a target diagram, use it directly. The plan wants 0.6 of the mass of the current point (b, d) to go to (b_1, d_1) and 0.4 of its mass to go to (b_2, d_2) --- let's just have these (contradicting) terms in the loss, say, for birth: 0.6 * (1/n) * (b - b_1)^2 + 0.4 * (1/n) * (b - b_2)^2. I assume that the mass of (b, d) is (1/n)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. When we compute the optimal matching (realizing the Wasserstein distance) between two persistence diagrams, it is crucial to be able to match points to the diagonal. The text in lines 259-268 and 347 suggests that the paper uses a different approach, considering exclusively off-diagonal points. Is this true?\n2. In Alg. 2, is the following interpretation of lines 4, 6, 7, 8 correct: we initialize measure \\mu with measure \\mu_k, then we solve the argmin in line 7 and the variables y_k are read off from it? It is a bit hard to parse, since the assignment in line 6 does not necessarily imply to a reader that further changes made to \\mu will be reflected in y_k-s.

This question is somewhat tangential to the paper’s main goal but could point to an interesting extension. Suppose we have *time-indexed persistence diagrams* (${D}_{t=1}^T$) from real data.
