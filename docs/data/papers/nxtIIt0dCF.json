For example, it cites a paper by Goktas et al. (2024) for solving the inverse equilibrium problem; there were earlier references that could be included here, for example, \"Inverse Game Theory\" by Kuleshov and Schrijvers. I would also suggest commenting further on the technical similarities between this present paper and the paper of Goktas et al. (2024); from my reading, there are several similarities, and the present paper should explain more clearly the parts of the formulation that are new. Another closely related paper is \"Computing Optimal Equilibria and Mechanisms via Learning in Zero-Sum Extensive-form Games\" by Zhang et al. (2023). That Lagrangian formulation of that paper is closely related to Theorem 3.1 and the subsequent Algorithm 1, which is also based on performing a certain binary-search procedure. The paper by Zhang et al. also addresses sequential auction design using deep learning, so the authors should discuss similarities and differences with that paper.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, I am struggling to fully understand the key assumptions that are necessary to make the approach sound. Partially observable MDPs are notoriously hard, but the paper makes some further assumptions to obtain Theorem 4.1. Some of those assumptions appear to be overly restrictive, such as Assumption 4---that transitions are independent of outcomes. From a theoretical standpoint, relying on partially obserable MDPs instead of extensive-form makes the problem computationally much harder, which is why such artificial assumptions are needed. Can the authors comment more on those assumptions and why they believe they are justified in practice?\n\nFinally, there are some parts of the presentation that are sloppy. Figure 2, for example, doesn't properly show the x-axis and there is an overlap between different labels that makes it hard to parse."}, "questions": {"value": "See above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "gcGoOVQjIr", "forum": "nxtIIt0dCF", "replyto": "nxtIIt0dCF", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22095/Reviewer_4jby"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22095/Reviewer_4jby"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22095/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761924658924, "cdate": 1761924658924, "tmdate": 1762942062845, "mdate": 1762942062845, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a computational framework for dynamic mechanism design (DMD) under Bayesian Nash incentive compatibility by formulating the problem as an optimization over parameterized games.

Integrating definitions with their use (e.g., in the POMG tuple) would make the exposition far clearer.

If independence is assumed, please explain whether this assumption affects only convergence rates or whether it constrains generality. If dependence exists, show how it is handled mathematically.\n\n[Lines 114–116]\n Only the transition and reward functions are parameterized by Θ, while the observation kernel is not. This asymmetry seems arbitrary. If the observation process depends on Θ, it should be parameterized consistently. Otherwise, explain why this simplification is valid, or why not doing so would cause problems in the analysis.\n\n[Lines 114–120] \nThe notation τ ∈ [(T−1)*] is nonstandard—please define it explicitly.\n\n\nThe symbol d is used ambiguously (is it a variable or differential operator?). If differential, it should probably be typeset upright.\n\n\nThe variable τ appears as both subscript and superscript in places—choose one convention for time indices.\n\n\n\n[Line 132] Crucial elements of the Bayesian formulation are deferred to the appendix. Without this material, the main text gives an incomplete picture of the equilibrium concept (it's just a regular NE), and belief states become important much later in the paper.\n\n[Line 362]  Similarly, convergence proofs and assumptions are entirely left for the appendix. These are essential for evaluating the soundness of the proposed optimization method.\n\n[Lines 135–140] The notation induces confusion between stochastic and deterministic policies.\n The interchange between P, π, and $P^{PO}$ is confusing. It is unclear whether the analysis applies to pure, mixed, or stochastic Nash strategies. Please formalize this consistently. I think the standard mixed definition, or the standard pure definition, would both suffice, as you only consider a single pure equilibrium anyway.\n\n\n[Lines 101–210]\n Sections 3.1–3.2 repeat *essentially* the same definitions three or four times (once for general actions, again for types, then for reporting). The symmetry between transition kernels and type evolution, and between observation kernels and observation of types, could be unified in one coherent definition instead of restating the structure each time.\n\n[Line 219] \n Please state explicitly and early on that the paper deals with Bayesian-Nash incentive compatibility (BNIC) rather than dominant-strategy IC (DSIC): this limitation was ambiguous.\n\n\n[Line 132]\n Crucial elements of the Bayesian formulation of BNE are deferred to the appendix.
