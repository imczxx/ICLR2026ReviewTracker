In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves as an ''interlingua'' between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding, software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments, we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an average performance gains of 10\\% over corresponding base models, and of as much as 8\\% over the existing model-size-matched SOTA on standard coding, browsing, tool use, and research benchmarks. All code and data will be released open source, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["agent", "training", "data"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b21856251c11d52c7750a9fcfa761d2cc93d2efe.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes the Agent Data Protocol (ADP), a lightweight actions–observations schema that standardizes heterogeneous agent datasets into a common “interlingua.” Thirteen public datasets spanning coding, software engineering, tool use, and web browsing are converted into ADP, then compiled into multiple agent harnesses via a single ADP→SFT step.

The experiments involve an unfair comparison. While the paper emphasizes the importance of unifying agent fine-tuning data formats through ADP, the comparative experiments do not use an equal amount of ADP and non-unified data.

Although the paper selects Qwen3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as baseline models, several tasks lack results for Qwen3-8B, which may raise concerns about the generality of the proposed approach.\n\n3. As a data-centric work, the paper does not provide a complete example of the ADP data format, making it difficult for readers to intuitively understand how ADP differs from existing data representations.\n\n4. The paper has several issues in presentation and formatting. For instance, some acronyms are not capitalized (e.g., \"agent data protocol\" in Line 015 should be capitalized), inconsistent capitalization appears throughout (e.g., Line 145), some abbreviations are introduced before their full forms (e.g., Line 245), and table captions are inconsistently formatted (Tables 3 and 4 have captions placed below, unlike others)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. I am curious about the extent to which ADP can outperform non-unified data when the amount of training data is controlled to be equal.\n\n2. The ADP framework currently supports only TextObservation and WebObservation, which limits its applicability to certain interaction scenarios. In real-world scenarios, environment observations may be more complex (e.g., structured JSON data or game environment states). How does ADP handle or generalize to such out-of-scope observation types?\n\n3. Table 2 shows that most datasets have high coverage of Function Thought. However, the paper does not further analyze these \"thought\" processes.
