The pioneering FAST tokenizer is the first to enable autoregressive VLAs for dexterous, high-frequency tasks by compressing action sequences via the discrete cosine transform. However, this leads to variable-length token sequences for fixed-length action chunks, which causes cascading errors, jerky motions, and reduced task success. We introduce Stable-FAST, a tokenization strategy that resolves this instability at its source by partitioning action trajectories in the training dataset into variable-length action chunks that yield token sequences with markedly reduced length variance. This simple but effective reframing enables the training of VLAs with stabilized inference and markedly reduced action instability. Extensive experiments on real robots, using multiple VLA backbones including the $\\pi_0$-FAST architecture, demonstrate that Stable-FAST improves action smoothness and increases the absolute task success rate by 10.8\\% on average, while reducing task completion times by over 40\\%. This offers a more reliable foundation for deploying autoregressive VLAs in the real world. We refer to the project page for the code and videos.", "tldr": "We introduce Stable-FAST, a tokenization strategy that stabilizes the length of token sequences of each action chunk and markedly improves the performance and action smoothness of autoregressive VLAs.", "keywords": ["Autoregressive Vision-Language-Action Models", "Action Tokenizer", "Inference Instability"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1caf0913d0479247d87c00f857c906be51eb88f3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}, "comment": {"value": "We identified significant flaws in the paper's experiments and are therefore withdrawing it for a detailed review.
