Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \\& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks. Evaluations across varying sparsity levels, sparsity patterns, and datasets highlight GBPN's superior performance, notable robustness, and generalizable capability.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Depth Completion", "Gaussian Belief Propagation", "Markov Random Fields", "Deep Neural Networks"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e6c4e147a3acfc1f046fa1f68af8a606579b866f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN) for depth completion.

Hybrid Learning-Inference Integration: The paper attempts a meaningful integration of graphical model reasoning with deep learning. Learning the MRF structure dynamically from images represents a conceptual advance over fixed priors or fully feed-forward architectures.\n\n2. Principled Treatment of Sparse Inputs: The method embeds sparse depth directly into the probabilistic inference process, rather than processing it as part of standard CNN input, offering a more theoretically grounded approach to the sparsity challenge."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Lack of Computational Analysis: The proposed approach introduces significant inference overhead due to iterative GBP and dynamic graph construction. However, the paper does not report any runtime statistics, GPU memory usage, or scalability discussion. Given the growing importance of efficiency in practical systems, this omission is concerning.\n\n2. Limited Empirical Gain: While the method shows SOTA iRMSE on KITTI, it underperforms on other key metrics (RMSE, MAE), suggesting the gain may not be consistent. On NYUv2, although the reported RMSE is strong, the deltas are small and the competitive landscape is already saturated.\n\n3. Weak Justification of Components: Ablation studies show marginal gains (~3mm RMSE difference on NYUv2), raising questions about the necessity of the complex model components, including non-local edge prediction, dynamic updates, and dual-pass U-Nets.\n\n4. Insufficient Analysis on Iterative Behavior: The authors claim that more iterations improve performance (line 290), but Table 2 only reports 3 and 5 iterations. It remains unclear whether the performance plateaus or continues to improve, and at what computational cost.\n\n5. Unclear Sparsity Robustness Comparison: In Figure 2, the RMSE of some methods (e.g., GuideNet, CFormer) increases as input becomes denser, which is counter-intuitive and not explained. Additionally, curves for many methods converge from 500 points onward, making relative robustness claims less persuasive.\n\n6.

For the same model, it is quite common that retraining multiple times yields variations of around 5 mm, which means such a small improvement is either unsuitable for ablation analysis or insufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of individual modules. It is also puzzling that the model’s accuracy degrades when the density of depth points increases, yet the explanations provided fail to address this anomaly satisfactorily. \n\nEven after this issue was highlighted by the reviewers in **NeurIPS comments** before, the authors showed no intention of taking concrete steps to rigorously validate the effectiveness of their method or to improve its interpretability.
