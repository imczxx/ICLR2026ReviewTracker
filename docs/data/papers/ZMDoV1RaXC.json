This work benchmarks existing Unsupervised Evironment Design (UED) methods, especially PLR-based ones, under the bacthed driving simulator setting.

In addition, a large part of the method section is to introduce previous works, making this paper looks like a benchmark paper. Considering that CL helps training is a common sense, this paper lack of novelty on both the method and conclusion.\n\n2. As this paper is engineering-oriented, one good direction to revise is to tune/benchmark the agents on widely-used benchmarks like WOSAC and nuPlan like what the Giga flow did. This can bring real-world impact. It would be better to see how CL can help self-replay agents achieve SOTA on those benchmarks in terms of performance and training speed. The outcome will add a lot of values to this paper, making it an new paradigm for addressing the agent simulation & planning.

It does not explore other prominent UED methods cited in its own related work, such as ACCEL or RE-PAIRED, which might have different scaling properties or performance characteristics.\n- The only baseline used for comparison is Domain Randomization (DR). While DR is the current standard and thus the most important baseline, the paper would be stronger if it compared against other, simpler curriculum heuristics (e.g., replaying failed episodes, or an annealed curriculum based on scenario complexity like the number of agents) to better situate the gains from a sophisticated method like PLR."}, "questions": {"value": "- The algorithmic contribution is primarily the integration of PLR.
