Our key contributions are: First, we prove a layer-wise UAT for residual networks by formulating ResNet and Transformer blocks in a unified form compatible with FNNs,\nensuring that each layer satisfies the UAT conditions (compact inputs and continuity). Second, using this layer-wise formulation, we demonstrate that RN training can be effectively modeled as a compensatory additive model, enabling sequential optimization where layers collaboratively reduce input-output divergence. Unlike conventional end-to-end training (which suffers from instability risks), our layer-wise approach ensures bounded learning and superior convergence. Third, we propose Layer-wise Progressive Approximation (LPA), a training paradigm that operationalizes sequential optimization while increasing the probability of achieving UAT-compliant approximations at each layer. Experimental results across both synthetic datasets and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10/100, Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate LPA’s significant advantages: up to 8.31% higher accuracy alongside early-layer convergence and improved training stability compared to conventional end-to-end approaches. We further show that adding an adaptive criterion to LPA\nautomatically discovers the effective layers and prunes the remainder, enabling aggressive compression, reducing model size by up to 79.17%. This suggests that simply scaling up the model is often unnecessary.

The paper conflates approximation (a representational property) with optimization (a training procedure), which are distinct things. The logic connecting UAT to the proposed method, especially in the last paragraph of Section 3, is unclear and unconvincing.\n\n**Technical soundness**: Due to the above conceptual issues, the technical grounding of the paper is questionable, making it more like a heuristic tweak. The proposed LPA algorithm essentially performs layer-wise training (Algorithm 1) given that $\\mathcal{L}$ is the loss function. This has nothing to with UAT, which concerns function approximation that does not involve training.\n\n**Presentation issues**: Figure 1 is difficult to interpret due to vague captions, and insufficient legends and labels.

The “gap” between prior UAT studies and the proposed approach is not clearly defined and well-motivated. The authors claim that prior works are architecture-specific (line 90). Does this mean those results were derived for modified versions of ResNet/Transformer architectures, while the authors target the vanilla versions? If so, what exactly differs, and why can’t prior results generalize?\n\n2. What new insights are gained by stating that UAT is “feasible to RNs” at the layer level? How does this provide practical or theoretical value for understanding residual networks?\n\n3. The terms “compensatory additive problem” and “oscillation risks” are undefined and unclear throughout the paper. Please provide formal definitions or intuitive explanations.\n\n4. Section 3’s analysis appears trivial: it essentially restates that a multilayer fully connected network with residual connections is a universal approximator. The derivation in Eq. (15) does not seem to introduce new theoretical insight. Could the authors clarify what is genuinely novel here?\n\n5. How does the layer-wise approximation analysis in Section 3 translate into the layer-wise training procedure in Section 4? These are conceptually different topics (representation vs. optimization).\n\n6. The theoretical results primarily rely on fully connected networks with sigmoid activations. How do they extend to modern ResNets or Transformers with non-sigmoid activations and more complicated structures? The appendix (B.2) provides only textual justifications without explicit mathematical conversion from CNNs to FCNs. If it cannot, isn't the whole approach still architecture-specific, just falling into the limitations the authors pointed out in previous works? As such, the theoretical part does not fill the claimed gaps at all. \n\n7. What is the computational cost or time complexity of the proposed training procedure? Since each layer requires retraining previous ones, it appears computationally heavy.\n\n8. Prior work (e.g., Greedy Layerwise Learning Can Scale to ImageNet, ICML 2019) already demonstrated over 90% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with layer-wise training, which I believe is the sequential training in this paper.

As described in Algorithm 1, a single training epoch appears to involve two full passes over the dataset. The first pass (lines 3-10) is itself computationally intensive, performing L nested backward passes for an L-layer network, resulting in roughly $O(L^2)$ computational complexity per batch. The paper provides no analysis of this overhead (e.g. training time vs. baseline). This makes it impossible to judge the practical efficiency of LPA.\n\n2. LPA is not compared with methods such as Greedy Layer-wise Training [1], Deeply-Supervised Nets [2], and Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling [3]. Without this, it’s unclear if LPA’s gains stem from its theoretical design or from known stabilization effects of progressive optimization.\n\n3. While the results on CIFAR and Fashion-MNIST are strong, these are relatively small-scale datasets. The paper's claims about improved stability and convergence would be far more convincing if demonstrated on a large-scale benchmark such as ImageNet. \n\n4. The writing can be improved.

For example, can we show that by LPA, the network always outperforms certain strong predictors? Some related works are also missing in this aspect.

Several typos exist, and there are notations that could be made clearer. \n2. I am not sure how strong the claim that 'prior work struggled to obtain generalizable conclusions because it attempted to model entire multi-layer architectures at once' is, because at least for ResNet, the UAT conclusion from a typical FNN could be easily adapted with minimal additional efforts.\n3. Line 155, in the derivation from single-layer RN to two-layer RN, the argument implicitly replaces a target $f_{2}(x_0)$ (a function of $x_0$) to $G_2(x_1)$ (a function of $x_1$.) Even though the authors state that $x_1$ is fixed from $G_1^*$, it holds only when there's an explicit mapping or invertibility assumption between $x_0$ and $x_1$ so that the target function can be reparameterized in the $x_1$-domain.
