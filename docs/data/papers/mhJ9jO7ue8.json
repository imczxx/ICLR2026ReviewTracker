Model misspecification and lack of overlap are common issues in observational studies, and they often lead to inconsistent and inefficient estimators of the average treatment effect. Estimators targeting overlap weighted effects have been proposed to address the challenge of poor overlap, and methods enabling flexible machine learning for nuisance models address model misspecification. However, the approaches that allow machine learning for nuisance models have not been extended to the setting of weighted average treatment effects for time-to-event outcomes. In this work, we propose a class of one-step cross-fitted double/debiased machine learning estimators for the weighted cumulative causal effect as a function of restriction time. We prove that the proposed estimators are consistent, asymptotically linear, and reach semiparametric efficiency bounds under regularity conditions. Our simulations show that the proposed estimators using nonparametric machine learning nuisance models perform as well as established methods given access to correctly-specified parametric nuisance models, illustrating that our estimators mitigate the need for oracle parametric nuisance models. We apply the proposed methods to real-world observational data from a UK primary care database to compare the effects of anti-diabetic drugs on cancer clinical outcomes.", "tldr": "We develop double/debiased machine learning estimators for censored outcomes that address poor overlap between treatment groups and model misspecification, enabling robust causal inference when standard methods fail due to extreme propensity scores.", "keywords": ["causal machine learning", "double/debiased machine learning", "survival analysis", "influence function", "limited overlap"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a72d7cea3a0b1dc8415f837d19e2725afa9156aa.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c78b25efaaf13f62c6b9954b3e9fcc8c8e272e69.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a DML-based framework for the WATEs under a survival setting, addressing the competing risks setting by considering the cause-specific restricted mean time lost.

Therefore, the corresponding efficient influence function for the parameter of interest can be obtained by applying the **same function** to the efficient influence function. This is not a challenging part of the problem in my view.\n\nFurther, the asymptotic properties of the estimator should also be well-established as long as the **same function** is well-controlled (e.g., satisfying Lipschitz continuity).\n\nThirdly, I do not see any other approach specific to the DML framework for survival outcomes with competing risks being used to address poor overlap, aside from overlapping weighting, which is also well-established.\n\nTherefore, I have reservations about accepting the paper."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The flow and presentation of the paper are well-organized.
