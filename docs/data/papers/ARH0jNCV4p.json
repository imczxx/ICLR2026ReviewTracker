Yet, these initial policies—often based on limited or biased information—can severely misalign with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early policy errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis–Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct. It substantially outperforms classical SMC perturbations and RL-based methods under misalignment, and we provide theoretical guarantees that DEPF resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Social Impact", "Policy Error Correction"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2c8ee36411257eb350a0d0ce9ab55e1fa07d48ed.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies recovery from severely misaligned initial priors in sequential Bayesian inference, with a focus on hazardous gas source localization.

The robot's controllable state space is effectively a convex region in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and the difficulty of searching in such a domain is not clear, regardless of the relative size of the agent and domain. An additional domain where exploration is very non-trivial would be a major improvement to the results. For instance, is an indoor search space not (with walls and rooms) relevant to the hazardous gas source seeking problem? I imagine a maze like environment might make this problem harder across the board. \n\n### Minor Weaknesses\n1. While the method is motivated by a real-world hazardous gas source seeking example, it would be valuable to see how the method performs across different domains using more generic metrics, such as return of an optimal RL agent trained on the collected data?\n2. I am curious how the exploration method compares against well-known exploration methods in model-free RL, such as random network distillation or optimism-based intrinsic rewards? Though, to be sure, the aforementioned methods seem outside the realm of relevance for PF-based methods.\n3. The ablation study ( section L ) might be better placed in the main paper because it provides important insight into the importance of all the components of the method.\n\n### Very Minor nit picks:\nLine 275 has a grammatical error."}, "questions": {"value": "To make explicit some of the questions I have from the weaknesses section:\n\n1. how might the method compare to generic exploration methods present in recent RL literature?\n2.
