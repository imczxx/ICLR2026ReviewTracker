Recent work explores simulating opinion dynamics with role-playing LLM agents (RPLAs)—language models assigned human-like personas that engage in multi-turn, multi-agent opinion exchange. However, existing RPLA simulations often produce unnatural group behaviors (e.g., premature consensus) and lack empirical benchmarks for evaluating alignment with real human interactions. We introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating the authenticity of opinion dynamics in multi-agent RPLA simulations. DEBATE contains 37,357 messages from 2,792 U.S.-based participants who engaged in multi-player, multi-round conversations across 107 controversial topics, reporting both public messages and private beliefs. We simulate these conversations using various LLMs and introduce multi-level evaluation metrics (at the utterance, individual, and group levels) to assess behavioral alignment between humans and RPLAs. Our analyses reveal key behavioral gaps: RPLA groups exhibit stronger opinion convergence and belief drift than humans, and individual agents show more systematic shifts in response to social influence. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of private self-reported opinions in shaping realistic agent behavior. Additionally, while supervised fine-tuning improves surface-level metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L, message length), it falls short on deeper alignment (e.g., semantic and stance alignment). DEBATE enables benchmarking of simulated opinion dynamics and supports future research on aligning multi-agent RPLAs' simulations with realistic human interactions. The dataset and codebase will be publicly released.", "tldr": "We introduce DEBATE, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating how well role-playing LLM agents simulate realistic human opinion dynamics in multi-agent conversations.", "keywords": ["Role-playing LLM agent", "social simulation benchmark", "multi-agent LLM system", "opinion dynamics"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f782d5a11cb3e3cff9c8b63fe9f64691c4e882be.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/68f7092b7e15ea5e6f5c3ec6102f84e61c93e11d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces DEBATE, a large-scale dataset of multi-player, multi-round discussions across controversial debate topics which can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM agents at simulating opinion dynamics.

The authors argue that existing RPLA simulations often show unnatural behaviors (like premature consensus) and lack a solid baseline against real human interactions.\n\nTo fix this, the authors built the DEBATE dataset. They collected data from 2,792 U.S. participants discussing 107 controversial topics. A core contribution is that the dataset captures both the public messages (tweets, chats) and the private, reported beliefs of the participants (before and after the chats). Using this benchmark, the paper tests several LLMs and finds significant gaps between AI and human behavior:\n- RPLA groups converge on opinions far more strongly than humans.\n- RPLAs show a systematic \"belief drift,\" sometimes towards false beliefs.\n- Simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) improves surface-level metrics (like message length) but actually harms deeper alignment (like stance and semantic similarity)."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- Important and Novel Problem: The paper tackles a timely and critical question. As LLMs are increasingly used to simulate social interactions, we urgently need rigorous ways to check if these simulations are socially realistic. DEBATE is, to my knowledge, the first large-scale empirical benchmark specifically for multi-agent opinion dynamics.\n\n- Data Collection: The study's design is its biggest strength. Separating 'public speech' from 'private belief' is a major contribution. It allows evaluation to move beyond simple text mimicry to the core of opinion dynamics: the gap between what people say and what they actually think.\n\n- Well-Constructed Benchmark. The benchmark itself is solid. The dataset is large and diverse (see Appendix E). The topic selection (mixing 'Depth' topics with ground truths and 'Breadth' topics) is smart. The three simulation modes, which test agents with decreasing levels of human context, provide a good way to measure agent autonomy.\n\n- Clear and Impactful Findings. The paper's conclusions are clear and important for the field. The finding that RPLAs over-converge (Fig 2d, 3b) and that SFT fails (or even hurts) deep alignment (Appendix N) are major takeaways. This suggests that simple imitation is the wrong approach for this problem."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Lack of Deeper Discussion on SFT Failure: The SFT results (Appendix N) are fascinating but underexplored. The paper states that naive SFT fails, but doesn't deeply explore why. Is it because the model learns to imitate an \"average\" human, losing individual diversity? Is the next-token prediction objective simply wrong for modeling a latent process like belief update? The paper would be stronger if it discussed alternative training objectives (e.g., RL based on realism, or explicit belief-tracking models).\n\n- Limits of LLM-as-Evaluator: The evaluation relies on gpt-4o-mini to classify topic relevance and stance (Appendix G). While the authors report 90% accuracy on a validation set, this creates an \"LLM evaluating an LLM\" loop, which can be risky. The authors should have reported the Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) among their human labelers. This would tell us how subjective or difficult the labeling task is in the first place.\n\n- Scope limits: The sample is US-only and dyadic; generalization to other cultures/platform structures remains uncertain."}, "questions": {"value": "see weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Wx1f9Sfkzn", "forum": "rMnZbCOhSS", "replyto": "rMnZbCOhSS", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22060/Reviewer_Kfex"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22060/Reviewer_Kfex"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22060/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761900560387, "cdate": 1761900560387, "tmdate": 1762942037500, "mdate": 1762942037500, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
