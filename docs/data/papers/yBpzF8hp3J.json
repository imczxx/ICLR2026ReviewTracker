The dataset consists of users, each with a subset $W_i$ of items from an unknown (or enormous) universe $\\mathcal{X}$ and the goal is to output a set $S$ with large overlap with the union $\\bigcup_i W_i$ while maintaining DP with respect to adding/removing any given subset $W_i$. For instance, in the set union problem, the goal is to output $S$ which is a subset of the union with as large cardinality as possible. Unfortunately, for this problem, there are no known absolute utility bounds: prior works can compare algorithms but have no guarantees on the size of the output. This paper investigates a relaxed objective which is missing mass. Consider the empirical distribution over the universe given by the input dataset (the multiset union of all $W_i$) and call this vector $f$. The missing mass is defined as the $\\ell_1$ norm of $ f_{\\mathcal{X} \\setminus S}$, the fraction of elements not contained in $S$. The authors note that $\\ell_0$ norm is the normal private set union objective and the $\\ell_p$ missing mass for $p > 1$ may also be of interest.\n\nThe first main result is about set union with $\\ell_1$ missing mass. The authors show that the standard weighted Gaussian mechanism (WGM) from prior work achieves a missing mass guarantee if the item frequencies $f$ follow a power law (Zipfian distribution). With a Zipfian exponent $s$, a simplified version of the bound is $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\max_i |W_i|}{\\epsilon N \\sqrt{\\Delta_0}}\\right)^{(s-1)/s}\\right)$ where $\\Delta_0$ is the standard \"contribution cap\": in a preprocessing step, each $W_i$ is subsampled to keep only $\\Delta_0$ elements.\nFurthermore, the authors show that the $\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon N}\\right)^{(s-1)/s}$ dependence is necessary for any private algorithm.\nThe authors show a simpler result on the $\\ell_\\infty$ missing mass without any Zipfian assumptions. This amounts to showing that there is a frequency threshold, above which, any item will be returned by WGM.\n\nThe authors show how to use the $\\ell_\\infty$ analysis to get utility bounds for top-$k$ selection and $k$-hitting set on unknown (very large) domains by first applying set union and then running a known domain algorithm. They use the $\\ell_\\infty$ missing mass bound from set union to get missing mass type utility bounds for top-$k$ and approximation algorithm bounds for $k$-hitting set."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- Achieving absolute utility bounds for private set union has been a challenge in the existing literature. By relaxing the objective to missing mass as opposed to just the cardinality of $S$ as well as introducing an assumption on the frequency distribution, the authors obtain absolute bounds on the utility of the standard WGM algorithm.\n\n- The upper and lower bounds on Zipfian data show that different algorithmic ideas cannot significantly improve upon the basic WGM algorithm in this setting (at least in terms of missing mass).\n\n- The authors show how these bounds can be translated to problems where set union can be used as a subroutine for the top-$k$ and $k$-hitting set problems.\n\n- One interesting facet of the theoretical analysis is that the preprocessing step, where sets $W_i$ are subsampled to have a maximum cardinality cap, is an important factor in the bounds. In prior studies of private set union, the details of step are not thoroughly investigated."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "An asymptotic bound on the missing mass of a mechanism in a specific setting would be more useful if it had implications in practice either by predicting practical performance in parameter settings or by allowing different algorithms to be compared theoretically.\n\n- The experimental results could be significantly more in depth: this would highlight several aspects of the theoretical work. Some concrete suggestions:\n  - It would be instructive to compare the theoretical error bound against empirical performance on synthetic Zipfian data.\n  - It would be useful to plot the frequency distribution on the real datasets to see if they follow a power law.\n  - Reporting the size distribution of $|W_i|$ would be interesting to compare the setting of $\\Delta_0$ to those statistics. The theoretical result suggests that $\\Delta_0$ should be set to $\\max |W_i|$ though increasing $\\Delta_0$ worsens performance for the Amazon games dataset and the small datasets. Is this because $\\Delta_0$ has exceeded the size of any $W_i$ or for another reason?\n- The statement that the gap between WGM and the policy baselines is smaller in the missing mass case compared to the $\\ell_0$ cardinality case is misleading. While the gap is 5 percentage points (MM is measured as a percentage), WGM performs up to 50% worse than the baselines in some instances when measured as a ratio. This is the apples-to-apples comparison to make when commenting that \"for cardinality... sequential methods often output $\\approx 2X$ more items [than WGM].\"\n- Comparison to more baseline algorithms would also be interesting. In the theoretical results, it is very reasonable to only analyze WGM as it is a well-studied algorithm and other candidate algorithms may be very difficult to analyze. On the other hand, if an important empirical takeaway is that \"WGM obtains MM within 5% of that of the policy mechanisms, in spite of their significantly more intensive computation,\" it would be useful to compare to other methods of Swanberg et al. and Chen et al. which offer better cardinality results while still using a similar amount of computation to WGM.\n- Missing mass analysis of any other algorithm, for example the weighted Laplace mechanism to start, would be interesting."}, "questions": {"value": "- Consider the statement \"Note that in Theorem 3.3 the missing mass decays as the total number of items N grows. Moreover, as C decreases or s increases, the upper bound on missing mass decreases.\" Should the second sentence be conditional on $N$ being sufficiently large compared to $T$ and $\\sigma$ (which should be the case for reasonable privacy parameter settings).\n\n- An interesting direction would be to show that WGM is close to optimal on Zipfian data for all $\\ell_p$ missing mass for $p > 1$. Is there any chance of showing something like this? Similarly, plotting missing mass as $p$ increases would be interesting, especially if the plots were significantly different for different algorithms.\n\n- Are both changes of (1) considering missing mass and (2) Zipfian data necessary for giving an absolute utility guarantee?
