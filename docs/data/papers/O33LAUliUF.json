In this work, we study the hypothesis that such creativity arises from an interpolation effect caused by a smoothing of the empirical score function. Focusing on settings where the training set lies uniformly in a one-dimensional subspace, we probe the interplay between score smoothing and the denoising dynamics with analytical solutions and numerical experiments. In particular, we demonstrate how a smoothed score function can lead to the generation of samples that interpolate among the training data within their subspace while avoiding full memorization. Moreover, we present theoretical and empirical evidence that learning score functions with regularized neural networks can have a similar effect as score smoothing, including in simple nonlinear settings.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["score-based diffusion model", "empirical score function", "norm-bounded neural network", "barron norm", "function smoothing", "subspace recovery"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ab0f43f0579886050c21bc4235aa0f791abf975a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies the effect of score smoothing on the ability of a diffusion model to generate samples outside the training data set. Most of the analysis revolves around a simply toy problem with evenly-spaced data points, where the analytic score functions (ESF) are known exactly.  It is shown that the scores learned by a regularized two-layer NN trained on this dataset is closely approximated by a smoothed version of the ESF. In the 1D case, and when the data manifold is a 1D subspace of a larger data space, the smoothed score (which models the NN score) ascribes some probability to regions on the data manifold that lie between the training data samples. At least in this limited setup, smoothed score functions offer a compelling explanation to 'generalization'."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. It is always great to have an analytic model that closely approximates the NN behavior. The authors have done a great job in picking a very minimal setup, modeling the score in closed form, and analyzing it thoroughly to draw their conclusions.\n\n2.

The core arguments in the paper, which are contained in Sec. 3 and 4, were a little difficult to get through for me. Part of the the problem was that a great deal of notation was introduced in the course of developing the argument that I missed the forest for the trees. I think it would greatly help the paper to have a sketch of the content of these sections precede the more detailed discussion. On a more minor note, making Fig. 2 wider, and stating explicitly that $\\lambda$ is the weight decay coefficient around line 161 would also help.\n\n2. The authors use the fact that regularizing the weight norm penalizes non-smooth scores. Later, in Sec. 6.2 they show an experiment where the NN scores smoothly interpolate a circular dataset, even _without weight decay_. This is attributed vaguely to the optimization dynamics. But does this not undercut your main thesis? That is, can you still claim that your smoothed PL ESF reflects the NN scores in more general scenarios where the latter is smoothed by mechanisms other than weight decay? In particular, is there reason to believe that such smoothing will produce a score with smoothness close to that of $r^{*}$? To be clear, this is a question about the _relevance_ of the smoothed PL ESF, rather than the soundness. If there is an answer in the paper that I missed please let me know. Otherwise, it appears to me that this is the primary weakness of the paper.\n\n3. In the extension to higher-dimensions, it would have been interesting to see a data subspace with some curvature, even a mild one. Would some sort of 'locally-flat' assumption help generalize your arguments to such a subspace?"}, "questions": {"value": "In proposition 1, if I understood correctly, the function $F^{-1}(\\epsilon)$ grows as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. That means $\\kappa$ becomes larger at small $\\epsilon$. So $\\delta_t = \\kappa \\sqrt{t}$ is small only when $t$ is very small. But we also know that the actual diffusion model is trained by evaluating the denoising score-matching objective from $t_{\\rm min}$ to $T$. If the smoothed PL ESF in Eq. (9) is a 'proxy' for the NN score in your analysis, should you not restrict yourself to using this score only till $t_{\\rm min}$. Then, is $\\delta_{t_{\\rm min}} = \\kappa \\sqrt{t_{\\rm min}}$ necessarily small?\n\nI have given a tentative score based on my current understanding of the paper.
