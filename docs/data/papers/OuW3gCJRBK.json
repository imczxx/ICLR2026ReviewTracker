However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five professional software of OSWorld, ScienceBoard and AndroidWorld. Our approach achieves a significant improvement  over a competitive open-source CUA, UI-TARS.

It allows agents to autonomously generate tasks and assess their success/failure in previously unfamiliar software environments without human intervention, advancing the capabilities of autonomous systems.\n\n### 2. **Task Generation and Evaluation Precision**\n   - **World State Model**: The paper introduces the **World State Model**, which enables precise environmental state captioning and step-wise trajectory assessment. This model provides fine-grained reward signals, significantly improving the precision of task evaluation.\n\n### 3. **Experimental Results and Performance Improvements**\n   - **Multi-software environment adaptability**: SEAgent demonstrates excellent adaptability, not only excelling in single-software environments but also in **multi-software scenarios**. Its validation across five professional software applications from **OSWorld** showcases its generalization.\n\n---"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Inconsistency in the Paper's Claims**  \n   The paper's claims are not fully self-consistent. Although the paper's title suggests **self-evolving** agents and emphasizes the exploration of LVLMs for autonomous exploration, the **World State Model** used for exploration in this study still relies on **human-annotated high-quality datasets**. This contradicts the starting point outlined in **line 53**, which advocates for agents to evolve without such dependencies. The paper should clarify this contradiction between the claimed self-evolving nature of the agent and its reliance on human-annotated data.\n\n2. **Lack of Novelty in Contributions**  \n   The contributions of the paper lack sufficient innovation. The **self-taught**[1] research has already demonstrated that additional training using high-quality critic modules can guide the improvement of LLMs through **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**, but with limited gains from multiple rounds of training. The paper uses **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**, a reinforcement learning method, for enhancement, but no additional conclusions are provided. One important question that remains unaddressed is whether more rounds of interaction could yield better results, as reinforcement learning theory suggests that continued interaction can lead to further improvements.  \n   On the other hand, the **specialist-to-generalist distillation method** may not be necessary in this context. In traditional RL, such a method is useful due to the small size of the network, where **Catastrophic Forgetting** may occur. However, for large models, multi-domain data mixing can be achieved during pretraining, and there is no clear need for separate training followed by distillation during the fine-tuning phase. The paper lacks ablation studies to analyze this point of innovation.\n\n3. **Experimental Setup Issues**  \n   The experimental setup is not entirely reasonable.  \n   - **Table 1** does not provide results for the World State Model under the **LS setting**, leaving this aspect of the model's performance unexplored.  \n   - **Table 2** raises a concern: is the training data size consistent across **general RL**, **SFT**, and **specialist-to-generalist** methods? From the descriptions in the paper, it seems that the **specialist-to-generalist** approach would likely involve more training data, but this is not explicitly clarified.  \n   - **Table 4**: The ablation study does not fully incorporate the innovative aspects discussed in **point 2**, specifically regarding the necessity and impact of the specialist-to-generalist strategy.\n\n4. **Writing Problems**  \n   The writing lacks rigor. For example, in **line 131**, the phrase should be \"Recently, ... has achieved\". Similarly, in **line 235**  \"in Section [???]\". Authors should check their writing more carefully.\n\n[1] Wang, Tianlu, Ilia Kulikov, Olga Golovneva, Ping Yu, Weizhe Yuan, Jane Dwivedi-Yu, Richard Yuanzhe Pang, Maryam Fazel-Zarandi, Jason Weston, and Xian Li. \"Self-taught evaluators.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2408.02666 (2024)."}, "questions": {"value": "See weekness above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "naqFmRtvo5", "forum": "OuW3gCJRBK", "replyto": "OuW3gCJRBK", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3275/Reviewer_e9MR"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3275/Reviewer_e9MR"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3275/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761751988489, "cdate": 1761751988489, "tmdate": 1762916642025, "mdate": 1762916642025, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "To address the issue that CUAs often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations, the authors propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.
