Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and  multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["time series", "time series forecasting"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bc21800b8aa59aafd1af1d5aa573e3f8aab3d55b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces Hermes, a multi-scale spatial-temporal hypergraph network for stock time series forecasting.

The authors propose Hermes, a novel spatial-temporal hypergraph network, designed to capture these correlations more comprehensively. The core of the framework integrates two primary modules into the hypergraph structure: **(1) Hyperedge-based Moving Aggregation**: This module utilizes a sliding window and dynamic temporal aggregation to model the non-simultaneous, causal (lead-lag) relationships that exist between different financial industries. **(2) Hyperedge-based Multi-scale Fusion**: To capture patterns at different time granularities (e.g., short-term cycles versus long-term trends) , the input time series is first decomposed into multiple scales. The fusion module then integrates this multi-scale information using a novel cross-scale, edge-to-edge message passing mechanism, which preserves the consistency of information at each scale while facilitating interaction between them.

The paper places great emphasis on correlations among industries and stocks. However, it is not clear whether these correlations are causal or merely coincidental. The problem of spurious correlations in financial time series has been extensively discussed in causal inference and econometrics literature. Without deeper validation or domain-based justification, it remains uncertain whether the discovered “industry correlations” truly reflect economic interdependence or are statistical artifacts. The authors should clarify how the model ensures that the identified relationships are robust and meaningful rather than coincidental.\n\nC2. The motivation for Hermes relies on the assumption that meaningful lead-lag correlations exist and can be exploited for forecasting. However, the paper does not provide any concrete case study or example illustrating such lead-lag phenomena within the benchmark datasets. Presenting one or two specific examples—where a leading industry consistently predicts another—would strongly substantiate the main hypothesis and demonstrate the model’s interpretability.\n\nC3. The notion of temporal lag is central to the model’s design, but its practical implications are not well explored. Specifically, how does the size of the prediction window affect model performance? In financial markets, larger windows often reduce predictive accuracy, yet true lead-lag effects may unfold over extended horizons. The current experiments overlook this interplay. \n\nMoreover, the appendix (page17) briefly notes that different datasets exhibit varying lag behaviors—this actually exposes a key limitation: each stock or sector may possess distinct lag features. A fixed hyperparameter for lag size may therefore fail to generalize. The authors should analyze the relationship between lag-window size, stock responsiveness, and predictive accuracy in more detail.\n\n**Overall Suggestion**\n\nWhile the model is technically well implemented, the paper’s core contribution remains underdeveloped. To make the work more meaningful, the authors might consider reframing the study to focus not merely on forecasting accuracy, but on uncovering and characterizing lagged inter-industry dependencies—a perspective that could have more value for quantitative finance.

Its core modules are heavily inspired by existing paradigms: The hyperedge-based moving aggregation module mirrors the 'patching' paradigm from recent attention-based time series forecasting, while the hyperedge-based multi-scale fusion employs a standard adaptive graph learning method. The contribution is more of an engineering integration rather than novel contributions. The authors should emphasize their main contribution.\n\n2.Section 3.4 is confusing and difficult to follow, making it hard to quickly grasp the main ideas. The authors claim that the lead-lag relationship matrix is based on the relationship between the first few points and the last point within the window (on line 276), which conflicts with Formulas 10, 11, and 12. Even worse, the provided code (see class HyperGraph_LeadLag) implements a third, different logic. This discrepancy makes the module unclear and irreproducible.

The claim is based on flawed reasoning, as the comparison fails to isolate the fusion module. The authors claim that Hermes outperforms the other two hypergraph-based baseline models even without the lead-lag module. However, the superiority is not obvious from Table 2 and the authors should quantify the comparison. Considering removing the skip-connection module would reduce performance, the authors should compare the “w/o Skip-Connection” against the baseline using only initial node embedding to verify whether the modeling actually improves forecasting or not.\n\n(3)In Section 4.4, the authors should compare Hermes with MLP-based models, which is vital to evaluate the performance-efficiency trade-off of Hermes against simpler models.\n \n[1]Shang Z, Chen L, Wu B, et al.
