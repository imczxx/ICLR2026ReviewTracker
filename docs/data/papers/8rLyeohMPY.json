However, they fail to achieve robustness for real-world flare-corrupted images as the synthetic data remains gaps with real-world data. In this paper, we propose a real-captured paired dataset named FlareReal600, which contains both real-captured image pairs and pure flare images. Compared with the existing flare removal dataset Flare7k++, our dataset is particularly effective for real-world scenarios as our data contains the faithful mapping between real flare-corrupted images and real flare-free images. Additionally, previous methods either lack sufficient receptive fields or achieve them with huge computational costs, which leads to flares being partly removed or hardly processing high-resolution images. Therefore, we propose a novel flare removal network named \\textbf{M}utual re\\textbf{C}eption f\\textbf{LA}re \\textbf{RE}moval \\textbf{N}etwork (McLaren), which utilizes convolutions with diverse kernel sizes and fuses them from the perspective of both spatial and channel dimensions to achieve a sufficient receptive field.

Introduction of a new real-captured dataset:\nThe paper introduces FlareReal, a real paired dataset for flare removal. This is a meaningful addition within this niche, as most prior datasets such as Flare7k++ rely heavily on synthetic images. Creating a real-captured dataset  under various lighting conditions helps bridge the realism gap and provides a valuable resource for future research in flare removal and related low-level vision tasks.\n2. Network design – clean and efficient integration:\nThe proposed Mutual Reception Convolution (MRConv) introduces a multi-kernel convolutional block that combines diverse kernel sizes and re-parameterization for efficiency. Although the idea draws on established components (multi-scale convolutions, depthwise separability, re-parameterization), the integration is clean and computationally practical for high-resolution flare removal. The network shows performance gains over baseline models."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited contribution of the dataset:\nAlthough the dataset introduces real-captured flare/clean image pairs, its scale (around 3,000 images) may be too small to substantially improve generalization beyond Flare7k++, which already includes 962 real-captured flare images. The diversity and acquisition conditions are not analyzed in depth, raising questions about whether FlareReal is large and varied enough to justify claims of “real-world generalization.” Moreover, dataset collection alone is not typically considered a significant contribution for ICLR unless it yields new insights or methodological advances.\n2. Limited novelty in network design:\nThe proposed Mutual Reception Convolution (MRConv) appears to be a reassembly of existing architectural concepts rather than a novel convolutional formulation. The design combines well-known ideas such as:\nMulti-kernel receptive field fusion (Inception-style)\nDepthwise separability (MobileNet-style)\nChannel reweighting (Squeeze-and-Excitation)\nResidual connections (ResNet)\nStructural re-parameterization (RepVGG)\nWhile these components are effectively integrated, the paper does not present a new mathematical operation, learning objective, or architecture paradigm elements typically expected in ICLR-level contributions.\n3. Lack of theoretical insight and limited analysis:\nThe paper does not provide theoretical justification or in-depth analysis to support the claim of achieving a “sufficient receptive field without heavy computational burden.” While empirical improvements are reported, there is no explanation of why the proposed design leads to better performance. Analyses such as effective receptive field visualization or feature activation analysis would have offered valuable insight into the model’s behavior and substantiated the design choices. The absence of such analysis limits the work’s interpretability and research depth.\n4. Insufficient experimental exploration:\nThe experiments on McLaren are relatively limited and do not fully validate the claimed advantages. More comprehensive ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and evaluations under varying noise or lighting conditions are needed to establish robustness. Furthermore, the paper does not report any computational or speed comparisons (e.g., FLOPs, runtime, memory usage) to substantiate its claims of efficiency and scalability. Without such analysis, it is difficult to assess whether McLaren truly achieves a better trade-off between performance and computational cost.\n5. Narrow scope and limited impact:\nThe paper focuses narrowly on flare removal, a specialized low-level vision task. It does not connect the problem to broader computer vision or machine learning themes such as representation learning, domain adaptation, or self-supervision. As a result, the contribution feels more incremental and applied rather than conceptually advancing understanding in computer vision.\n6. Poor presentation and citation quality:\nThe writing suffers from inconsistent referencing of figures and tables (e.g., “fig:Method(b)”, “tab:com”, “fig:mclaren”), which appear as placeholder labels rather than proper references. These issues, along with some grammatical errors, reduce clarity and professionalism."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The paper’s main contribution is the introduction of the FlareReal dataset, yet there is no clear mention of whether it will be publicly released. Could the authors clarify if there are concrete plans to make the dataset, along with its collection protocol and metadata, publicly available? If not, the contribution would have very limited practical and scientific value, as reproducibility and community impact would be severely constrained.\n2. The proposed Mutual Reception Convolution (MRConv) seems closely aligned with existing designs such as Inception, MobileNet, and RepVGG, which already combine multi-kernel processing and re-parameterization.
