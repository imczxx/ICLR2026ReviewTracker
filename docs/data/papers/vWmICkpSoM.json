Early detection of subclinical or subthreshold depression (SD) is critical for preventing its progression into major depressive disorder. Compared to other modalities like wrist-worn wearables, electroencephalography (EEG) offers greater clinical value due to its direct link to brain function. Task-state EEG can reflect the characteristics of task related brain regions, its requirement for subjects to perform time-consuming tasks renders it impractical for rapid, large-scale screening. Whereas, resting-state EEG (rs-EEG) has advantages of task-free nature and ease of acquisition. Crucially, it contains spontaneous neural activity and can reflect the dynamic information across the entire brain, which is theorized to contain the neural substrates of all potential task-states. This makes it a highly valuable, yet underutilized, tool for SD prediction and diagnosis. However, effectively extracting task-specific information from rs-EEG remains a major challenge, hindered by two primary issues: (1) the limited understanding of relationships between resting-state and task-state EEG, and (2) the absence of effective guidance for feature extraction of generated task related EEG. To address the issues, we propose ReTa-Diffusion, a novel framework designed to mine task-related features from rs-EEG for the early detection of SD. It comprises two core modules: a Bidirectional Decoupled Conditional Diffusion (BDCD) module and a Wavelet-Riemannian Feature Extraction (WRFE) module. Inspired by the principle that task-state EEG can guide the interpretation of resting-state data to improve diagnostic accuracy, the BDCD addresses issue (1) by disentangling and aligning features from resting and task states through a bidirectional diffusion mechanism, thereby generating task-state-informed EEG signals from resting-state data. Subsequently, the WRFE tackles issue (2) by capturing rich dynamic temporal patterns and functional connectivity from these generated signals, leveraging Riemannian manifolds and a cross-attention mechanism. Together, these modules enable effective feature learning from rs-EEG, significantly enhancing the generalizability and accuracy of early SD detection. The proposed ReTa-Diffusion is evaluated using five-fold cross-validation on three datasets, achieving a classification accuracy of 54.52% on multiclass classification tasks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 18.95%. Further validation through leave-one-subject-out and visual analysis confirms its robust cross-subject capability and the effectiveness of using task-state features to guide stress-level prediction from rs-EEG. These results underscore ReTa-Diffusion’s potential as a powerful tool for early depression screening and prevention.", "tldr": "By guiding the mining of stress features in resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) signals through task-state EEG signals, subclinical depression can be diagnosed.", "keywords": ["Conditional Diffusion", "Resting-state EEG", "Subclinical Depression", "Cross-subject", "Riemannian Feature Extraction"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f0d5dc98fbcc99b9f69af6b39f406b610cc2eba1.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/bd962c8aa19762d928c6f60fe69ce395d8d64165.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ReTa-Diffusion, a novel framework that predicts subclinical depression by uncovering task-like neural signatures hidden in resting-state EEG without requiring any actual task recordings.

This lends preliminary support to the model's core hypothesis and enhances its interpretability."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Despite its novel idea, this paper suffers from several major flaws in scientific rigor, experimental validation, and academic presentation, which severely undermine the reliability of its conclusions.\n\n**1. [Major Flaw] Fundamental Mismatch Between Research Problem and Experimental Paradigm**\nThis is the most critical issue in the paper. The stated goal is to detect \"Subclinical Depression\" (SD), a chronic and persistent mood disorder. However, the experimental paradigm employs an \"Acute Psychological Stress\" task induced by time-limited mental arithmetic.\n*   **Conflation of Concepts**: Depression and acute stress are fundamentally different in their neurophysiological mechanisms, time scales (chronic vs. transient), and underlying neural markers. The authors provide no scientific or clinical evidence to support the assumption that EEG features from acute stress can serve as reliable biomarkers for a chronic depressive state.\n*   **Misleading Conclusions**: Generalizing conclusions from an acute stress model to depression screening is scientifically unsubstantiated. This makes the paper's core contribution built upon an unverified, and likely incorrect, premise, severely weakening the entire scientific value of the work.\n\n**2. [Major Flaw] Critically Flawed Experimental Design and Evaluation**\nThe experimental framework is insufficient to support the paper's claims, and some results even contradict its own assertions.\n*   **Lack of a Crucial Baseline**: The paper's central claim is the superiority of its two-stage (generation + classification) framework. However, it completely omits the most important and direct baseline: **training a strong classifier directly on the original rs-EEG data** (e.g., feeding rs-EEG directly into EEGNet or the proposed WRFE module). The authors' claim that an \"end-to-end comparison is not feasible\" is unconvincing. Without this baseline, it is impossible to determine whether the complexity introduced by ReTa-Diffusion is beneficial, or potentially even detrimental.\n*   **Contradictory Ablation Study Results**: The results in Table 3 are perplexing. On the MIST-CNU dataset, \"Diffusion-TS + MLoss\" (Context-FID: 0.3743) performs significantly better than the full BDCD module (0.8232). This strongly suggests that the addition of the BDM (Bidirectional Decoupling Module) is actually **harmful** to the generation quality. The authors offer no explanation for this counter-intuitive finding. Furthermore, the paper does not clearly define what BDM and MLoss are, making the results difficult to interpret.\n*   **Insufficient Validation of the Core Task**: The main classification performance (Table 1) is reported on only a single private dataset (MIST-CNU). For a method claimed to have broad applicability, the lack of validation on other datasets severely limits the generalizability and credibility of the findings.\n\n**3. [Severe Flaw] Extremely Poor Academic Presentation and Reproducibility**\nThe paper's writing, structure, and attention to detail fall far short of the standards for a top-tier conference.\n*   **Missing Core Section**: The paper **completely lacks a \"Related Work\" section**. This makes it impossible for reviewers to situate the work within the context of existing research and makes the authors' claims about the relationship between rs-EEG and task-EEG appear unsubstantiated.\n*   **Absence of Critical Methodological Details**: The paper fails to explain a core implementation detail: how the 5-minute rs-EEG segments are **temporally aligned and paired** with the 28-minute, multi-level task-EEG data during training. This omission makes the method entirely irreproducible.\n*   **Numerous Writing and Formatting Errors**: An overly long abstract, lack of paragraph spacing, an empty Appendix C, an unfinished conclusion section, incorrect table citations (Section 3.2.1 discusses generative models but cites Table 1 instead of Table 2), and inappropriate content in the supplementary materials (e.g., screenshots of chats in Chinese) all reflect a profound lack of rigor and care in manuscript preparation.\n*   **Private Datasets**: Both datasets used for the core task evaluation are private, which hinders the community from verifying and building upon this work."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  **Regarding the Scientific Hypothesis**: Can the authors provide evidence from neuroscience or clinical literature to support a strong correlation or transferability between EEG features induced by an acute mental arithmetic task and the neural markers of subclinical depression? If not, how do you justify the scientific validity of using an acute stress paradigm to address the problem of chronic depression detection?\n2.  **Regarding the Critical Baseline**: Why was a direct end-to-end baseline, which involves training a classifier (e.g., EEGNet or your WRFE module) directly on the **original rs-EEG**, not included in the comparison? What makes such a comparison \"not feasible\"? Given that this is the most direct way to evaluate the added value of your entire framework, could you provide results for this experiment?\n3.  **Regarding Method Reproducibility**: Could you please elaborate on the training details for the BDCD module? Specifically, how is a single 5-minute segment of rs-EEG **aligned or paired** with a 28-minute segment of task-EEG that contains four different stress levels? Is it a one-to-one mapping, one-to-many sampling, or another mechanism? What is the rationale behind this design choice?\n4.  **Regarding the Contradictory Ablation Results**: In Table 3, the \"Diffusion-TS + MLoss\" configuration achieves a significantly better Context-FID score on the MIST-CNU dataset than the full BDCD model. Does this imply that the BDM component has a negative impact on generation quality?

Overstated Claim of \"Subclinical Depression\" and Clinical Relevance\n\nWhile the paper positions its objective as the early detection of subclinical depression (SD), the labels are derived from the Adolescent Life Events Scale, which captures self-reported stress exposure, not depressive symptoms or clinical assessments. Moreover, clinically oriented terms such as “diagnosis,” “early detection,” and “clinical screening” are used throughout, despite the lack of validated depression instruments and the small, non-clinical cohort. The terminology therefore overstates the clinical applicability of the work.\n\n2. Limited Use of Public Dataset\n\nAmong the three datasets used, only one is publicly available. However, it is used solely for evaluating EEG generation quality with SWD and Context-FID. No classification results are reported on this dataset, limiting both reproducibility and external validation of the core claims.\n\n3. Insufficient Justification for Diffusion Modeling\nThe use of a computationally expensive diffusion model is insufficiently justified. The paper does not provide comparative ablations or motivate why a diffusion-based approach is preferable over more straightforward generative models (e.g., autoencoders, domain adaptation methods) in this specific EEG application.\n\n4.
