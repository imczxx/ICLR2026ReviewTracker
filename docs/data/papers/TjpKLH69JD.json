The authors propose a two-stage, SO(3)-equivariant pipeline. Stage 1 involves training an SO(3) equivariant encoder–decoder model which is used to generate latent encodings from point clouds. Stage 2 trains an SO(3)-equivariant denoise operating on the latent encodings and is conditioned on spherical radar embeddings via a novel equivariant FiLM layer; conditioning features come from a spherical CNN. The full generative pipeline is end-to-end SO(3)-equivariant. The authors run a series of experiments on a simulated Frusta dataset due to a lack of high-frequency real-world data. The model is compared to two baselines, which do not have end-to-end equivariance constraints using a minimum matching distance (MMD) and F1 score for reconstruction accuracy, and total mutual difference (to show diversity/uncertainty benefits). The authors model beats the two baselines in terms of F1 score for the fully observed radar signals, however performs slightly worse than both baselines (for F1 score) for partially observed radar signals. Their equivariant model does have larger sample diversity as shown by the TMD scores, implying it is more uncertain about the true shape.

This is indeed the case as shown in table 1.\n\nThe improved efficiency over the Diffusion-SDF model is substantial, although the non-equivariant baseline is roughly as efficient as this proposed model too.\n\nIn figure 5, the generated sampled of the equivariant diffusion model appear much closer to the ground truths than the baselines."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Firstly, from table 1 the equivariant diffusion samples appear to not perform any better than the baselines on average. Specifically while for the full observations the F1 performance in the best, this is only be a very minor amount, and the MMD scores of the equivariant model are the worst of all models for both the partial and full observed datasets. \n\nSecond, in the abstract and introduction the authors mention the difficulty with partially observed data, and dealing with the uncertainty that arises from this. However their results in the partial test case are significantly worse for reconstruction accuracy (MMD and F1) than both baselines. The sample diversity in higher for the authors model which I agree one would think is due to the uncertainty of the true shape, but the significantly lower (0.1549 vs 0.2807) F1 accuracy is not insignificant. \n\nThird, the dataset is synthetic which is understandable and not necessarily a bad thing, however this specific dataset used contains only axially symmetric data. This seems like it would potentially help the performance of SO(3)-equivariant models, while true data may not be symmetric at all.
