This often results in suboptimal predictions when dealing with data segments that exhibit clear pattern regularities. To address this gap, this paper introduces Order-Preserving Patterns (OPPs) into time series forecasting for the first time and proposes a novel model that explicitly incorporates prior pattern knowledge by leveraging frequent OPPs as explicit priors. The proposed model utilizes a convolutional neural network to perform feature dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional labeled time series, extracting one-dimensional representations suitable for pattern mining. It then applies a sliding window and support counting strategy to discover frequent OPPs. An OPP matching mechanism is proposed to distinguish between OPP and non-OPP training samples. Additionally, a pattern constrained loss function is designed to guide the predicted values toward consistency with the prior pattern logic. This constraint is imposed from three perspectives—right boundary, left boundary, and intermediate positions—to ensure order alignment with the tail elements of the OPPs. Experimental results show that, on the ‘Perturbation Boundary’ of the SWAT and ETTh1 datasets, the proposed model achieves reductions of at least 31.45% and 4.35% compared with the SOTA models, respectively. The improvement becomes more pronounced when the window size exceeds the ‘Perturbation Boundary’.

The most significant issue is a lack of clarity and consistency in the core methodology. The dimensionality reduction step—a crucial prerequisite for pattern mining—is described as a CNN trained on unexplained \"timestamp-level labels\" for one dataset, while a simple PCA is used for another. This inconsistency feels ad-hoc and makes the framework seem less like a generalizable solution.\n\nThe reported performance improvements on the SWaT dataset are so extraordinary (orders of magnitude better than strong baselines) that they raise concerns about the experimental protocol. It is essential to confirm that the OPP mining process was conducted strictly on the training set, with no leakage from the test data. Without this confirmation, the results are difficult to trust. Finally, the \"Perturbation Boundary\" concept, invoked to explain why the model's advantage is limited to specific input lengths, feels like a post-hoc rationalization for a potential lack of robustness rather than a deeply analyzed phenomenon."}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "KPIZJVp189", "forum": "jKk7cbedHA", "replyto": "jKk7cbedHA", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2124/Reviewer_M3pn"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2124/Reviewer_M3pn"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2124/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761890922298, "cdate": 1761890922298, "tmdate": 1762916041554, "mdate": 1762916041554, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes Order-Preserving Patterns (OPPs) for time series forecasting and leverages frequent OPPs as explicit priors.
