Traditional machine learning approaches, like recurrent and graph neural networks, rely on iterative propagation, which tends to accumulate errors over time and space. Recent diffusion-based methods mitigate error propagation but require iterative sampling and often depend on problem-agnostic Gaussian priors, limiting both efficiency and effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose GiFlow, a Graph-Informed Flow Matching framework for spatiotemporal imputation. GiFlow replaces the typical Gaussian prior with a graph-informed prior constructed via spatiotemporal filtering of observable signals, which better aligns the source distribution to the target and thereby simplifies the generation trajectory. The flow field is parameterized by a hybrid vector field model that integrates spatial attention, temporal attention, and spatiotemporal propagation, enabling joint modeling of spatial and temporal dependencies. Unlike diffusion models, GiFlow is trained via direct regression and supports deterministic, few-step generation at inference. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets with different missing patterns and missing rates demonstrate that the proposed GiFlow outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in spatiotemporal imputation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["spatiotemporal imputation", "flow matching", "graph signal processing", "graph machine learning"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f4f7ef7914a6318a4ce6d162e6f312c344ef7dae.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a Graph-Informed Flow Matching framework for spatiotemporal imputation and conducts extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- S1： This paper conducts experiments on four datasets from the air quality and traffic domains, considers two types of missing patterns, and reports three categories of evaluation metrics."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- W1：As shown in Tables 1, 3, and 4, the performance improvement of GiFlow over the baselines is relatively small.\n- W2：The paper lacks comparisons with the most recent spatiotemporal imputation methods from 2024 and 2025, such as ImputeFormer (KDD 2024) and CoFill (IJCAI 2025).\nImputeFormer: Low Rankness-Induced Transformers for Generalizable Spatiotemporal Imputation, KDD 2024.\nFilling the Missings: Spatiotemporal Data Imputation by Conditional Diffusion, IJCAI, 2025.\n- W3：Although the paper claims that the proposed method is more efficient and requires fewer generation steps than diffusion-based models, it lacks theoretical analysis of computational complexity, as well as empirical evaluations of model parameters and runtime efficiency.

These models can be interpreted as a discrete, distilled, and consistency-enforced formulation of flow matching, aiming for higher inference efficiency. In the context of time-series imputation, the recently proposed CoSTI [2] model follows this line of thought. CoSTI can perform probabilistic imputations in a single step, but requires multiple runs to obtain deterministic estimates such as the median. Including a short discussion or even a small comparison in terms of inference efficiency would help clarify how GiFlow relates to this family of models and where it stands in terms of trade-offs.\n\n[1] Song, Y., Dhariwal, P., Chen, M., & Sutskever, I.

The combination may read as engineering integration rather than a conceptual innovation.\n2.\tThe paper emphasizes “deterministic, few-step” generation as a benefit over diffusion. That’s good for speed, but it gives up calibrated uncertainty, which is the key for imputation in scientific/operational settings. The paper neither quantifies uncertainty nor contrasts GiFlow’s point estimates with probabilistic metrics, so the claimed modeling advantage is just one-sided in speed/efficiency. \n3.\tThe prior is produced by adaptive spatiotemporal filtering with filtering factors chosen by minimizing equation 6. But X1 is the ground-truth complete signal, unavailable at test time. How are τ selected without leakage? Is there a learned predictor of τ from observables only, or are global τ tuned offline and fixed at inference?
