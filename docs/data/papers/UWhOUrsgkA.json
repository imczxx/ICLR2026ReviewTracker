In such recent applications, in addition to the relevance (similarity) of the returned neighbors, diversity among the neighbors is a central requirement. In this paper, we develop principled welfare-based formulations in NNS for realizing diversity across attributes. Our formulations are based on welfare functions---from mathematical economics---that satisfy central diversity (fairness) and relevance (economic efficiency) axioms. With a particular focus on Nash social welfare, we note that our welfare-based formulations provide objective functions that adaptively balance relevance and diversity in a query-dependent manner. Notably, such a balance was not present in the prior constraint-based approach, which forced a fixed level of diversity and optimized for relevance.  In addition, our formulation provides a parametric way to control the trade-off between relevance and diversity, providing practitioners with flexibility to tailor search results to task-specific requirements. We develop efficient nearest neighbor algorithms with provable guarantees for  the welfare-based objectives. Notably, our algorithm can be applied on top of any standard ANN method (i.e., use standard ANN method as a subroutine) to efficiently find neighbors that approximately maximize our welfare-based objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is practical and substantially improves diversity while maintaining high relevance of the retrieved neighbors.", "tldr": "This work develops novel welfare-based formulations for balancing diversity with relevance in nearest neighbor search", "keywords": ["Vector Search", "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search", "Nash Social Welfare"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/71cc9fd5231a234b959823ba006e525776da771c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a new problem setting and algorithms for the problem of similarity search with diversity. An interesting formulation is given where similarity and diversity are combined in one objective. The objective is tunable so as to cover some extreme cases: only relevance, only diversity, and mixing the two using hyperparameters. Diversity is measured with respect to a set of predefined attributes. The paper makes a distinction when an item has a single attribute and when it has many attributes. In the former case an exact algorithm is given. In the latter case the problem is shown to be NP-hard and the greedy method is shown to give a (1-1/e) approximation.

The paper contains lots of discussion and motivation. On the one hand this is a strength, on the other hand, it gets quite repetitive and tiring.

In the intro, the use of geometric mean is motivated by the argument that the geometric mean is larger than the min value of an item and smaller than the arithmetic mean. This fact alone is not a strong motivation, as the fact that the values are different does not necessarily imply that the solutions of the respective problems will be different. \nW3. The formulation is elegant, however, it needs to assume the presence of attributes, which might not always be the case. Another simpler notion of diversity, not covered by the setting of the paper, can be defined by employing the same similarity function used to compare the query with the data items.

Traditional NNS methods mainly focus on maximizing relevance, measured by similarity between a query and data points, while in more recent approaches, diversity requirements are specified using constraints. The main difference of the approach in the paper is that welfare requirements are proposed using welfare-based objectives grounded in Nash Social Welfare. More specifically, attributes of data points (such as color, brand, or seller) are modeled as “agents” in an economic system, where each agent’s utility depends on how well its associated attribute is represented among the selected neighbors. The collective welfare of the result set is then measured using a welfare function, such as the geometric mean in the case of NSW.
