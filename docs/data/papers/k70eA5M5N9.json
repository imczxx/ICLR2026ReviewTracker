However, in real-world scenarios, only a limited number of nodes are often labeled, leading to the few-shot node classification problem, which is a significant challenge for GNNs. Most existing research focuses on designing new models to adapt to this setting, but often overlooks structural information in the graph data, such as motif patterns, which can provide crucial cues for learning from a few examples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates motif representations into graph few-shot learning models. Specifically, we extract unique motif representations from the graph and introduce them as virtual nodes. To capture richer structural patterns, we further enhance motif extraction by adding cluster labels based on node similarity, thereby incorporating both structural and feature information. Additionally, we assign TF-IDF scores as edge weights between virtual motif nodes and original nodes to quantify the importance of their connections. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the performance of various graph few-shot learning methods.", "tldr": "A novel framework that integrates motif representations into graph few-shot learning model", "keywords": ["Graph few shot learning", "Motif"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c6405db2439611d312216cb1c61f6617ada37beb.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/2164e94d0bda2376fae5c626913f63c0f52cfaec.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses motif graph-based few shot learning and proposes a novel motif extraction and meta edge construction framework called MoEFL.

The pipeline clusters nodes by feature similarity to assign temporary labels, extracts motif patterns (mainly 3-node, optionally 4-node) under these labels, creates a learnable “virtual node” for each motif pattern, connects it to participating original nodes, and weights each virtual edge using a TF-IDF–style score; a two-layer GNN with a gating mechanism then fuses motif embeddings with node features before the few-shot head. The authors claim clustering enriches motif types and TF-IDF mitigates degree explosion, positioning the framework as a general add-on. Experiments on small (Cora, Cora-ML, WikiCS, CiteSeer) and larger (CoraFull, Coauthor-CS) benchmarks report consistent accuracy gains over the backbones and lower variance, while ablations on Cora show that the motif virtual node alone hurts performance but adding cluster labels and then TF-IDF recovers and improves it; scaling to labeled 3/4-node motifs dramatically increases pattern count (e.g., 1,760) and degrades results."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "- This paper focuses on graph few shot learning, which is relatively a novel question in current graph learning research.\n- The method is designed to integrate with various graph FSL backbones, and the authors report lower variance across tasks and consistent gains over different methods.\n- By using motifs plus cluster labeling, the approach injects structural information, does not rely on ground-truth labels."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The novelty of the proposed method is limited as the 3-node motif extraction in the framework explicitly follows a previous method (Chen et al., 2023).\n\n2.
