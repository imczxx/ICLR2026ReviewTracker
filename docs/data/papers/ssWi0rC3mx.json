In this paper, we reveal a fundamental vulnerability of UEs that emerges when learning starts from a pretrained model. Specifically, our empirical analysis shows that even when data are protected by carefully crafted perturbations, pretraining priors still allow the model to bypass the shortcuts introduced by UEs and capture semantic information from the data, thereby nullifying unlearnability. To counter this effect, we propose $\\textbf{BAIT}$ ($\\textbf{B}$inding $\\textbf{A}$rtificial perturbations to $\\textbf{I}$ncorrect $\\textbf{T}$argets), a novel bi‑level optimization formulation in which the inner level mirrors standard UE objectives, while the outer level enforces a dynamic association of perturbations with incorrect labels, deliberately misleading pretraining priors and preventing them from aligning with true semantics. This mislabel-perturbation binding mechanism blocks the pretrained model from readily establishing the true label-data relationship, so the learning process cannot quickly rely on image semantics and instead remains dependent on the perturbations.  Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and multiple pretrained backbones demonstrate that our approach produces UEs that remain effective in the presence of pretraining priors.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["unlearnable examples", "data privacy"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/22cb62f5ccc6e767d849e6eeb088131a94e8d7fd.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9a2b463e8fadd93bbf84a190a647ca03bfb1e9c7.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces BAIT to solve the problem that existing UE methods fail when fine-tuning on clean pre-trained image-classification models by binding perturbations to incorrect target labels.

The findings highlighted at the beginning of the paper that current UEs fail on pre-trained models do not seem to be that surprising, as this issue has been expressed in many previous studies.\n2. From a practical perspective, the key to solving this problem, in my opinion, is to fine-tune a larger model using the additional data collected. Although this experiment will be more difficult, the authors should try to discuss the practical significance of this issue.\n3. The paper doesn't seem to provide a thorough analysis or discussion of the relationship between pre-training data and fine-tuning data, or their impact on training, which is exactly what I'm most concerned about. If I perturb some data to prevent it from being trained and the model from learning, I'd first justify that the reduction in model performance (e.g., accuracy) is specific to the new data, and not to the original data. For example, a face recognition model might still accurately recognize the pre-trained data, but fail to recognize the perturbed data used in subsequent fine-tuning. This isn't a requirement for the author to verify this on a face recognition model, but I'd appreciate more in-depth analysis of this aspect.\n4. The authors use three figures in Figure 1 to demonstrate the failure of existing UEs on pre-trained models. Figures 1a and 1b are convincing, but Figure 1c is not. Although PT and TS have significant differences in the dynamics of parameter updates, the authors appear to assume that parameter updates correspond to the model's actual learning of semantic knowledge from the data, a claim they haven't carefully justified. In fact, the relationship between the update amplitude of model parameters, training epochs and model performance is more complicated ([How far are we from true unlearnability?(ICLR'25)]).\n5. The experimental part uses the Imagenet pre-trained model, but there is no experimental result on Imagenet and other larger datasets.\n6. Although the authors discussed transferability, they only discussed the transferability of pre-trained models and architectures, and lacked discussion of the transferability of more important downstream tasks. Furthermore, lack of verification and discussion of the data protection ratio (i.e., the poisoning ratio).\n7. Some papers also discussed the content related to UEs and pre-trained models, but the authors did not cite or mention them.

I also agree that for unlearnable examples the case of utilizing pretrained weights is much more likely (and a more realistic scenario) than train-from-scratch, so unlearnable examples must be able to hold up to this approach (please see weaknesses 3. on how to properly see whether the current method holds up to defenses).\n\nStarting from ImageNet pretrained models, Table 1 shows that their unlearnable examples reduce test accuracy by a wide margin. Their perturbations can prevent training (by reducing accuracy to nearly chance) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.\n\nBecause unlearnable examples like [2] use a surrogate for a particular dataset (i.e. CIFAR-10), the authors consider a fair comparison where they re-implement [2] but using an imagenet-pretrained model as the surrogate. Here, they again find that their approach is better."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The \"core innovation\" (L180-181) is an error-minimizing noise, which is explored in [2]. Technically, the original error-minimizing noise of [2] also \"binds perturbations to designated incorrect labels that are semantically different from the ground truth, deliberately steering learning away from genuine semantics.\" (L157-158) because [2] uses a pretrained surrogate model. By using a pretrained surrogate, the perturbations are like features of the pretrained model. \n\n2. I think Eq. 1 does not line up with what the authors are proposing. The authors state that \"the inner level mirrors the standard UE objective by injecting perturbations that discourage the model from encoding genuine semantic\" implying the optimization is over the perturbation but the inner \"s.t.\" objective says that we seek to find a theta (model params) that minimizes the expected loss (train a model on perturbed images). The $\\theta_i$ probably requires an additional \"level\" of optimization because those aren't fixed.\n\n3. Line 427 \"Resistance to defense strategies\". The only defense that should be considered is ISS [1] : I am particularly interested in an evaluation of *just ISS* (different JPEG compression qualities must be tried: 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, etc) instead of all the other \"defenses\" (cutout, cutmix, mixup, etc.) because JPEG has been shown to be so effective. This paper broke a number of existing \"unlearnable datasets\" but this submission only considers cutout, cutmix, mixup (which can no longer be considered a defense after the ISS paper). Additionally, being a class-wise perturbation, I recommend looking at the orthogonal projection [3] defense (Section 4.4 of [3]). They argue class-wise perturbations can be easily broken.\n\n4. Line 249: \"we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework against pretrained backbones on standard benchmarks\". The paper doesn't specify what evaluation means exactly. Do you mean that we finetune only the last linear layer of a model? If so, does the last linear layer starting from random weights or the pretrained weights? Alternatively, do you mean that we finetune all model parameters? Based on Eq. 2 it seems the answer is finetune all model parameters starting from pretrained model parameters, but this has to be stated clearly in words somewhere. Using the phrase \"craft effective UEs against pretrained backbones\" (L083) makes it sound like only the last layer is finetuned.\n\n[1] Image shortcut squeezing: Countering perturbative.
