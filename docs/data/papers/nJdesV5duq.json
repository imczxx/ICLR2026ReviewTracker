The framework is broken down logically into four distinct phases and corresponding components (VAE, Conditioner, Generator, Discriminator), which greatly aids reader comprehension.\n3.

Although the paper successfully introduces the crucial MPS metric (Joint Satisfaction), the reported percentage for the best model variant is quite low at 2.85% (464 molecules). While the absolute number of good molecules is promising, the low overall percentage suggests that the model still struggles significantly with simultaneous, stringent multi-objective optimization.\n2. The paper correctly notes that prior models do not report the joint satisfaction metric. This makes the new benchmark a necessary contribution, but the comparison table (Table 3) remains largely empty for key baselines. This comparison is needed to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.\n3. The discriminators are frozen before adversarial fine-tuning and are noted as an \"Observation\" due to the generator's low intrinsic entropy, rather than a theoretical guarantee. This simplification, while achieving stable convergence, potentially limits the full power of the GAN training process, which ideally involves co-training. A potential alternative approach is progressively unfreezing the discriminator.\n4. The paper uses the term \"antibiotic-like,\" and its biological validation is based entirely on in-silico methods (docking and QSAR). The results are strong, but the absence of any discussion of experimental validation means that there is still significant future work to verify the generated mols.\n5.

If the primary claim of the work is to generate antibiotic molecules, the generated molecules should appear drug-like. In particular, while the generated molecules exhibit high QED (≈0.8) and favorable synthetic accessibility scores, their chemical structures raise concerns about biological and medicinal relevance. Most examples appear overly aliphatic, lacking aromaticity, heteroatoms, and functional diversity—features typically associated with bioactive compounds. As such, these molecules satisfy scalar drug-likeness metrics without reflecting realistic pharmacophoric or structural complexity. QED and SA scores, while standard, are empirical correlates of drug-likeness and can overestimate the quality of compact, hydrocarbon-rich scaffolds that are synthetically simple but biologically inert. The absence of aromatic or polar functional groups limits potential protein binding and reduces chemical interpretability. To substantiate claims of pharmacological realism, the authors should complement QED/SA evaluations with functional diversity metrics (e.g., H-bond donors/acceptors, aromatic rings), scaffold diversity analyses, and medicinal chemistry filters (e.g., Lipinski, PAINS).

Were docking molecules also used for training? Without such details, overfitting or data leakage cannot be ruled out.\n- **Performance comparison:** Table 3’s baseline results (InstGAN, L-MolGAN, etc.) are quoted from original papers, not re-evaluated on the same dataset. Hence, comparisons may not be fair.\n- **Statistical rigor:** Results should include p-values or confidence intervals, especially in Fig. 4’s property distributions and docking metrics.\n- **Biological validation:** Docking was performed on only 281 ligands (DHFR) and 9 outperforming cases (DNA gyrase). It is unclear why these specific subsets were chosen, and whether they were representative.\n- **3D structure realism:** The paper repeatedly uses terms like “structural realism”, yet all operations are in 2D graph space. Without 3D conformation or geometric checks, this claim seems overstated.\n\n*Suggestion:* Replace “structural realism” with “topological realism” unless 3D geometries are directly modeled, or add a 3D-based evaluation (e.g., RMSD or alignment metrics).\n\n**Conceptual and Referencing Issues:** Some background statements may misrepresent prior works.
