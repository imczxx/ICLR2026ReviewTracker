Subsequent stages of post-training involving instruction-tuning or safety training often introduce new facts not present in parametric knowledge, giving rise to hallucinations. While it has been empirically shown that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on new knowledge may exacerbate the problem, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a controlled fine-tuning experiment, focusing on closed-book QA, and find latent directions that causally contribute to hallucinations. Specifically, we fine-tune LlaMa 3.1 8B base on 7 distinct single QA datasets, controlling for the percentage of new knowledge and number of training epochs. By measuring performance on the test set, we validate that incrementally introducing new knowledge increases hallucinations, with the effect being more pronounced with prolonged training. We leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to mechanistically analyze residual stream activations across 42 checkpoints and propose a model-diffing approach for capturing causally relevant latents in this context. Our findings underscore the importance of curating post-training datasets that align with the base model's parametric knowledge and offer novel insights into how models change when integrating new knowledge.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Sparse Autoencoders", "Steering", "AI Safety", "Interpretability", "Alignment"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
