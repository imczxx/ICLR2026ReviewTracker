Existing methods mainly rely on direct cross-modality mapping, yet they often overlook the neural mechanisms of visual processing, which leads to three major limitations. First, a feature physiology mismatch arises because high-level semantic features extracted by image encoders do not align with the low-level neural responses evoked by rapid visual stimulation. Second, most approaches emphasize cross-modality alignment while neglecting the similarity of neural representations within the same category, which results in poor intra-modality semantic consistency. Third, brain-image alignment typically depends on static image-text semantic spaces and therefore lacks dynamic semantic priors that interact with brain activity. We introduce NeuroAlign, the first neuroscience-inspired framework for brain-vision alignment. NeuroAlign mitigates the feature physiology mismatch by integrating bottom-up structural perception with top-down semantic modulation, enhances semantic consistency through intra-modality self-supervision and cross-modality intra-class constraints, and leverages large language models (LLMs) to provide dynamic semantic signals that interact dynamically with brain responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuroAlign achieves state-of-the-art performance on both intra-subject and inter-subject retrieval tasks, which validates the effectiveness of this neuroscience-guided alignment strategy.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Brain-Computer Interface", "Neuroscience-Inspired Alignment", "Dynamic Semantic Guidance", "Visual Retrieval"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1079df7b8aa914e3b5842d6cb014e47ff7b0f44c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces NeuroAlign, a neuroscience-inspired framework for aligning brain (EEG), vision, and language modalities to improve visual retrieval from brain signals.
