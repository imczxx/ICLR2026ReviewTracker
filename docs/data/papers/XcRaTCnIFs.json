Although existing UDA methods devote substantial effort to modeling temporal shifts, they often rely on simple spatial alignment across domains, thereby limiting their capacity for effective adaptation. \nReal systems in the wearable domain exhibit sensor-wise domain shift, including changes in placement or orientation, which necessitates the explicit consideration of inter-domain spatial sensor relations. \nTherefore, we introduce IDSA, Inter-Domain Sensor Alignment for wearable MTS-UDA, a plug-in module that augments any base UDA loss with two complementary components: (i) an inter-domain sensor transport that learns a cross-sensor relation matrix from domain-specific sensor embeddings and transports target channels toward the source, and (ii) a channel decorrelation regularizer that sparsifies intra-domain graphs to suppress redundant or noisy couplings. Our sensor transportation loss is shown to be equivalent (up to a constant) to the discrete $1$-Wasserstein objective. When used as a plug-in with Deep CORAL or CLUDA, IDSA achieves consistent gains across five HAR and sEMG benchmarks compared to recent baselines in activity classification accuracy, achieving up to a 37.37% improvement in F1 score on the WISDM HAR dataset.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Domain Adaptation", "Multivariate Time Series"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f2815c2fe3654f62f0ac1901d2596766e3f0208a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles the Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) problem for multivariate time-series in wearable sensor domain.   \nIt motivates from the sensor-wise domain shift, where sensor placement/orientation or other factors might change for each individual in the same domain.

While the paper presents the idea of “inter-domain sensor alignment” as new for multi-sensor time-series data, there is extensive prior literature on multivariate time-series domain adaptation using structurally similar techniques, such as correlation or covariance alignment (e.g., Time Series Domain Adaptation via Sparse Associative Structure Alignment, AAAI 2021, and related works). These works address domain shifts in the spatial dependencies of multivariate time series. It seems that the main difference between these works and the proposed method lies in the conceptual distinction between “multi-sensor” and “multi-variate” alignment, making the originality of this paper appear incremental. In addition, the paper in AAAI 2021 also considers sparsity.\n\n2. The authors emphasize handling differences in sensor \"placement or orientation\", yet the experimental setup appears to use datasets with identical sensor configurations across subjects, which does not actually reflect such spatial misalignment. This weakens the empirical justification of the claimed contribution.\n\n3. The paper is vague about the meaning of the channel dimension (N) in the learned representation Z. According to Section 5.1, the sensor embedding P has the same dimension N×T as the input MTS data, implying that each of the N channels corresponds to an axis or variable rather than a complete sensor unit, as each sensor usually has multiple axes. If this is correct, then the modeling operates at the channel/variable level rather than per sensor, which questions whether the alignment is truly “sensor-wise.”\n\n4.

Is the proposed method limited to domains with identical sensor deployments (same sensor types, positions, and count)?

In Section 5.1, the representation dimension N is stated to “match the input dimensions of MTS data.” Does N correspond to individual sensor channels or sensors as composite entities? This clarification is important because if each channel corresponds merely to one axis of a sensor, the problem reduces to conventional multivariate variable alignment.\n\n3. Could the authors explicitly differentiate their formulation from existing multivariate time-series adaptation approaches that align correlation or covariance matrices of multiple variables?
