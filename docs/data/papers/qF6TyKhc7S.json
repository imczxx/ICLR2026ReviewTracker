To address this issue, watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

However, the work lacks a detailed comparison or empirical analysis to substantiate this claim. In practice, the proposed methods appear to introduce additional computational costs due to multiple rounds of hashing, clustering-based decoding, and trial-and-error decoding processes.\n- The decoding accuracy heavily depends on the specific embedded information. When the numbers of majority and minority bits are similar, decoding accuracy tends to be higher. In contrast, when the embedded bits are highly imbalanced (e.g., significantly more 1s than 0s), the variance in token distribution across shards diminishes, making decoding less effective. For instance, embedding 4 bits into 16 tokens with the message 1100 may yield shard distributions of {8, 8, 0, 0}, while 1110 could result in {5, 5, 6, 0}, illustrating that the decoding feature, variance in shard token counts, depends on the specific bit pattern.\n- The proposed system cannot embed messages consisting entirely of 0s or 1s, or containing long substrings of identical bits. While the paper claims such occurrences are rare, this assumption may not hold when messages are short or divided into small blocks (as in MajorMark+). For example, when r=2 and b = 8, approximately 23.4% of the code space becomes infeasible, which is non-negligible.\n- The system’s ability to distinguish between watermarked and non-watermarked text—crucial for LLM watermarking—is insufficiently evaluated. Although Appendix A.12 briefly discusses false positives, it omits key experimental details such as the threshold selection procedure and evaluation setup. Detection accuracy also seems to depend on the specific embedded message. Integrating and analyzing the detection method as part of the main algorithm would strengthen the work. In addition, this problem is a critical problem actively studied by the literature.\n- The claim that a larger green-list ratio preserves text quality is overstated. While a larger ratio may help preserve fluency, it does not inherently ensure quality. The evaluation primarily relies on perplexity (PPL), which is limited in capturing semantic or stylistic fidelity. Additional text-quality metrics and qualitative comparisons would provide a more comprehensive assessment. Moreover, further justification is needed for using the top-5 hit rate as a key metric, as it could be trivially optimized by restricting watermarking to the top-5 tokens.\n- Several experimental details are insufficiently described. For instance, when evaluating robustness against copy-paste and paraphrasing attacks, the ratio or extent of modified text should be explicitly reported."}, "questions": {"value": "+ How is the embedded information selected during evaluation?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "nyBUrjGkDZ", "forum": "qF6TyKhc7S", "replyto": "qF6TyKhc7S", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6174/Reviewer_tnCJ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6174/Reviewer_tnCJ"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6174/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761470478548, "cdate": 1761470478548, "tmdate": 1762918519360, "mdate": 1762918519360, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes an LLM watermarking method that leverages the majority bit and uses a clustering-based decoding strategy to improve the watermarking performance.

The authors observe that existing methods suffer from this trade-off, which is governed by the size of the \"green list\" of preferred tokens. To overcome this, they propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking paradigm. The core idea is to construct the green list based on the majority bit λ of the message m, which theoretically guarantees a large green list ratio (γ ≥ 0.5) and thus preserves text quality. Crucially, MajorMark abandons traditional frequency-based decoding and instead employs a clustering-based strategy to recover the message by analyzing the distribution of token occurrences across vocabulary shards.\nThe paper further introduces MajorMark+, an enhanced version that partitions the message into blocks for encoding, leading to even better text quality.
