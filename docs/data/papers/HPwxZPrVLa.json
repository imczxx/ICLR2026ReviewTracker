We present $\\textbf{SimCity}$, a multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to model an interpretable macroeconomic system with heterogeneous agents and rich interactions. Unlike classical equilibrium models that limit heterogeneity for tractability, or traditional agent-based models (ABMs) that rely on hand-crafted decision rules, SimCity enables flexible, adaptive behavior with transparent natural-language reasoning. Within SimCity, four core agent types (households, firms, a central bank, and a government) deliberate and participate \nin a frictional labor market, a heterogeneous goods market, and a financial market. Furthermore, a Vision–Language Model (VLM) determines the geographic placement of new firms and renders a mapped virtual city, allowing us to study both macroeconomic regularities and urban expansion dynamics within a unified environment. To evaluate the framework, we compile a checklist of canonical macroeconomic phenomena, including price elasticity of demand, Engel’s Law, Okun’s Law, the Phillips Curve, and the Beveridge Curve, and show that SimCity naturally reproduces these empirical patterns while remaining robust across simulation runs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Macroeconomic", "Social Simulation", "Large Language Models", "Multi-Agent System"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a132a5c89595ae4ae0aecea09e30abe63f7e4168.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents an ABM with agents using LLM for decision making.

Claims of emergent macro relationships are undercut by weak statistical evidence and small samples. For example, the reported Phillips and Okun relationships often have large p-values (e.g., r=-0.14 with p=0.68) over short simulated horizons, which is insufficient to establish the presence, slope, or stability of the curves; visual fit alone is not adequate for ICLR standards. A more rigorous inference protocol (longer horizons, confidence bands, bootstrap across seeds, sensitivity to sampling windows) is needed to substantiate the claims. \n2. Novelty relative to existing LLM-agent simulators is incremental and not crisply isolated. The paper contrasts with EconAgent and others, but does not specify which additions (heterogeneous goods, firm templates, VLM siting, central bank rule) are necessary or sufficient for each “stylized fact,” leaving the core methodological advance diffuse rather than sharp. A targeted ablation matrix mapping components to outcomes would clarify unique contributions beyond a larger scenario scope. \n3. The economic modeling depth is thin, limiting credibility as a macro platform. Key mechanisms, matching frictions, wage-setting, investment dynamics, and price stickiness, are mostly delegated to prompt-driven LLM behavior, with minimal microfoundations, calibration, or validation against external elasticities; even the Taylor rule employs fixed coefficients without estimation. Without calibration or targets (e.g., impulse responses, variance decompositions), the framework risks being a narrative sandbox rather than a quantitatively informative model. \n4. The urban/spatial component is largely cosmetic and weakly evaluated. A VLM “decides” geographic placement and the map renderer shows clustering, but there is no spatial equilibrium, land market, congestion, or transport cost model; the paper presents no quantitative urban metrics (e.g., Moran’s I, monocentric gradients, commuting flows) to support claims about urban expansion dynamics.

This work compares results with traditional work (ABM models, etc.). However, SimCity uses far more goods than the baselines, making some selected economic laws incomparable (such as Engel's Law, which the authors mention in line 398 in further tests). Table 2 shows SimCity can only be compared with other work on very few dimensions.\n\nW1.2. Several p-values in the Phillips Curve are not significant. The authors claim that a larger sample size could resolve this issue, but without empirical evidence. SimCity and EconAgent have comparable agent numbers, but EconAgent's results are significant, suggesting the problem may not only lie in sample size as claimed. Okun's Law results also only show that EconAgent has stronger and more significant correlation, which does not match Table 2.\n\nW1.3. Line 365 claims the negative slope can be reproduced with other seeds, but the p-values in Figure 6 also show non-significance. The experimental results contradict the claims. These phenomena cannot explain why SimCity performs worse despite using more complex mechanisms.\n\nW1.4. Line 409 claims the ability to capture elasticity, but this is very likely self-fulfilling behavior based on prompts. As shown in Listing 4 on page 22 (lines 1200-1208), Engel's Law appears to be explicitly modeled to guide agent behavior. Since the prompts already contain economic laws, we cannot determine whether this phenomenon reproduction is spontaneous agent behavior or a result of the prompts.\n\nW1.5. In Table 2, the authors claim to have verified price stickiness, but there seems to be no mention of this anywhere in the paper. Although line 464 mentions this dimension, there is no supporting data evidence.\n\nW1.6. For the volatility in Table 2, only the upper right image in Figure 3 provides results throughout the paper, but there is no explanation for this data. We cannot know how the data was calculated, nor is it clear what the change rate refers to.\n\nW2. RQ3 has limited relevance to the research theme. Urban spatial layout has no obvious relationship with the macroeconomic laws discussed in this work. Additionally, although this work uses VLM to spontaneously form this layout, it does not verify whether this layout approximates actual situations. RQ3 lacks coherence with the other questions.\n\nW3. SimCity appears to be merely an extension of EconAgent and does not provide more contributions at the methodological level of framework design. VLM site selection is also just a simple application of VLM without exploring the significance of this technique within the framework."}, "questions": {"value": "Minor suggestions:\n\nS1.

Limited depth and heterogeneity of reasoning.\n\n- Although the agents exhibit more advanced reasoning than traditional rule-based ABMs, the reasoning pipeline remains highly templated and prompt-constrained. As seen in Figure 8, each agent’s behavior follows fixed goal structures and standardized input-output formats. Moreover, heterogeneity among agents is derived only from observable states, while unobservable characteristics (like risk preference on investment) are indirectly inferred from those observables. To improve realism, the reasoning process should model latent attributes explicitly. One constructive direction would be to employ a graphical model where LLMs operate at each node-to-node transition, enabling richer causal reasoning and interdependence among latent and observed variables. As it stands, the system’s “reasoning” is still closer to surface-level text completion than to genuine deliberative cognition.\n\nW2. Lack of micro-level interpretability of emergent phenomena.\n\n- The paper’s analysis of stylized macroeconomic facts is valuable, but the results are presented as static reports rather than explanations. Understanding which specific micro-decisions of the LLM agents led to each stylized fact (e.g., how wage bargaining dynamics produced the Phillips curve) would provide much stronger qualitative evidence of the model’s reliability. Without linking macro patterns to agent-level reasoning traces, it is difficult to assess whether the observed regularities are meaningful or accidental.\n\nW3. Absence of quantitative validation and benchmarking.\n\n- While qualitative reproduction of stylized facts is an excellent start, quantitative alignment with real-world data is essential if SimCity is to be used for policy simulation or empirical analysis. The paper does not evaluate how accurately its LLM-based reasoning reproduces empirical magnitudes compared to rule-based ABMs. For progress toward a scientifically grounded benchmark, the authors should report quantitative fit measures and conduct a direct comparison between traditional ABM reasoning and LLM-powered reasoning under equivalent conditions. In the AI community, incremental improvement is measured through benchmarks; adopting a similar philosophy via automated calibration and reporting measurable performance gains would make the paper much stronger for ICLR.\n\nW4. Scalability bottleneck due to linear LLM calls.\n\n- The current simulation scales linearly with the number of agents, as each agent invokes the LLM independently at every timestep. This linear dependency severely limits scalability. The authors were restricted to fewer than 1000 agents. A promising research direction would be to reduce this cost to sublinear (ideally logarithmic) scaling (possibly via hierarchical aggregation). While such efficiency is beyond the scope of an early-stage study, acknowledging and addressing this scaling issue would position the work toward future large-scale economic simulations."}, "questions": {"value": "-"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "NA"}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Ck6tssPPML", "forum": "HPwxZPrVLa", "replyto": "HPwxZPrVLa", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24730/Reviewer_8xEd"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24730/Reviewer_8xEd"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24730/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762151666639, "cdate": 1762151666639, "tmdate": 1762943178157, "mdate": 1762943178157, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
