While the dependence on $n$ is clear, understanding the interplay of all MDP parameters ($S, A, H$), $\\gamma_{min}$, $d$, $B$, $W$, etc., is less straightforward. The simplified analysis in Appendix B is helpful but doesn't cover the full algorithm.\n\n**Computability of Hellinger Confidence Set:** Constructing the Hellinger confidence set $\\Pi_{1-\\delta}^{offline}$ involves estimating the Hellinger distance between the BC policy and candidate policies under the estimated dynamics $\\hat{P}$. While Appendix A.4.3 provides an efficient calculation for the discrete case, the practical implementation for continuous environments resorts to an $L_2$ distance proxy in embedding space and constructive sampling around $\\pi^{BC}$. This discrepancy between the theory (Hellinger distance over trajectory distributions) and continuous implementation requires further justification or analysis regarding its impact on the guarantees.\n\n**Dependence on $\\gamma_{min}$:** The bounds depend on $\\gamma_{min}$, the minimum visitation probability of the expert policy. This value is unknown and hard to estimate. While Assumption 3 is milder than typical offline RL coverage assumptions, the practical implications of a potentially very small $\\gamma_{min}$ (specialized expert) on the bounds could be discussed further.\n\n**Choice of Embedding Function:** The experiments and Appendix A.1 highlight the critical impact of the trajectory embedding function $\\phi$ on performance. The theory assumes $\\phi$ is known, but provides little guidance on choosing or learning a good embedding, which remains a key practical challenge."}, "questions": {"value": "**Questions**\n\n**Continuous Implementation vs. Theory:** Could you elaborate on the theoretical implications of using the $L_2$ distance proxy in embedding space and the constructive sampling method for $\\Pi^{offline}$ in the continuous experiments, compared to the Hellinger distance over trajectory distributions used in the theory? Does this approximation affect the validity of the regret bounds in the continuous setting?\n\n**Sensitivity to $\\gamma_{min}$:** How sensitive are the theoretical bounds and the practical performance of BRIDGE to the value of $\\gamma_{min}$ (Assumption 3)? What happens if $\\gamma_{min}$ is extremely small, corresponding to a highly specialized expert?\n\n**Offline Data Quality:** The theory assumes offline data comes from an expert policy $\\pi$. The ablation in Appendix A.1 briefly explores noisy data. Could you comment further on how the theoretical guarantees might degrade if the offline data is suboptimal or contains non-expert trajectories? Theorem 4.1 seems robust to some noise via $\\gamma_{min}$ but assumes the *demonstrations* come from $\\pi^*$.\n\n**Computational Cost:** Calculating the Hellinger distance (even with the efficient method in Appendix A.4.3) and optimizing over the policy set $\\Pi_t$ (Line 7, Algorithm 1) seems potentially computationally expensive, especially as the state/action space grows. Could you discuss the scalability of BRIDGE? The appendix mentions runtime but doesn't explicitly compare the overhead vs PbRL.\n\n**Trajectory Embedding $\\phi$:** Given the significant impact of the embedding function shown in the ablations, do you have insights into how one might systematically choose or even learn an effective $\\phi$ in practical scenarios where the underlying reward/preference structure is unknown?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Gyzv0gkOzJ", "forum": "oIiQZfnSxP", "replyto": "oIiQZfnSxP", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18591/Reviewer_UYkF"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18591/Reviewer_UYkF"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18591/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761652189808, "cdate": 1761652189808, "tmdate": 1762928311230, "mdate": 1762928311230, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper \"fine tuning behavioral cloning policies with preference-based RL\" is a novel piece of work exploring the links between imitation learning and online pereference-based RL.

The authors briefly touch on the limitations this could impose - a more detailed analysis of this could be insightful. For example, what are the consequences for more practical domains where the appropriate underlying structure may be unknown?\n\nThere are various assumptions made throughout the paper which are mostly introduced as standard to the field, but the implications or limitations of these are not drawn out in detail.
