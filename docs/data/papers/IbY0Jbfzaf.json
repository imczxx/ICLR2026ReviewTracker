Current inverse folding approaches optimize for sequence recovery or single structural metrics, failing to simultaneously ensure global geometry, local accuracy, and ensemble stability—three interdependent requirements for functional RNA design. This gap becomes critical when designed sequences encounter dynamic biological environments.\nWe introduce **RiboPO**, a **Ribo**nucleic acid **P**reference **O**ptimization framework that addresses this multi-objective challenge through reinforcement learning from physical feedback (RLPF). RiboPO fine-tunes gRNAde by constructing preference pairs from composite physical criteria that couple global 3D fidelity and thermodynamic stability. Preferences are formed using structural gates, pLDDT geometry assessments, and thermostability proxies with variability-aware margins, and the policy is updated with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). On RNA inverse folding benchmarks, RiboPO demonstrates a superior balance of structural accuracy and stability. Compared to the best non-overlap baselines, our multi-round model improves Minimum Free Energy (MFE) by **12.3%** and increases secondary-structure self-consistency (EternaFold scMCC) by **20%**, while maintaining competitive 3D quality and high sequence diversity. In sampling efficiency, RiboPO achieves **11% higher pass@64** than the gRNAde base under the conjunction of multiple requirements. A multi-round variant with preference-pair reconstruction delivers additional gains on unseen RNA structures.

The contribution is thus fundamentally one of application, not invention.\n\n2. The paper offers no theoretical justification for applying DPO (a preference learning objective) to optimize physical criteria (like MFE and pLDDT). This lack of explanation for why DPO is the appropriate objective for this specific physical optimization task is a major theoretical weakness, suggesting a mechanical application without deep understanding.\n\n3. The central claim about the optimal performance arising from a \"fixed reference multi round DPO with a margin curriculum\" is purely empirical and anecdotal. Without any theoretical analysis or discussion on the behavior of the margin/curriculum in the context of the RNA energy landscape, this conclusion remains an unprincipled observation.\n\n4.

The paper introduces a highly complicated evaluation framework, SSTT (Section 3.4), which consists of 15 different metrics. However, most of these metrics are not actually used in the model optimization process. Preference construction relies only on pLDDT, RMSD, and MFE, and the reported results primarily focus on a small subset of about seven metrics. As a result, the necessity and practical value of introducing such a complex evaluation framework are unclear.\n2. The central motivation of the paper is to use DPO to encourage the generation of thermodynamically stable RNA structures. However, the approach to “stability” is based solely on ViennaRNA’s minimum free energy (MFE) prediction. MFE is an inadequate surrogate for true thermodynamic stability, and the predicted MFE structure often does not correspond to the experimentally adopted conformation. Therefore, optimizing MFE does not necessarily imply improved thermodynamic robustness or biological stability of the designed RNAs.\n3. The MFE structure is typically not the experimentally determined structure present in the dataset, nor is it the structure predicted by data-driven models such as RhoFold or EternaFold. The paper combines predictions from mutually inconsistent tools: RhoFold is used to predict tertiary structure, EternaFold is used to predict secondary structure, and ViennaRNA is used to derive the MFE structure for energy estimation. These three tools produce different structures, meaning that the optimization process is guided by multiple, incompatible structural targets. Using these conflicting structural definitions simultaneously raises concerns about the biological validity of the optimization objective.\n4. The paper does not explicitly address the trade-off between multiple objectives. Although the preference construction incorporates both structural fidelity and energy, the relative priority between these two objectives is never clarified. It remains unclear how the method balances potentially conflicting goals, or how the optimization procedure avoids collapsing toward one objective at the expense of the other. Without a principled mechanism for multi-objective trade-off, it is unlikely that the method can reliably achieve a desirable balance.\n5. In the ablation study, removing the SFT loss improves the energy objective while degrading structural metrics. This observation does not necessarily justify the inclusion of the SFT term; rather, it simply indicates that the model has moved to a different point on the Pareto frontier, possibly by chance. This further highlights the need for an explicit treatment of multi-objective trade-offs, which is currently lacking in the paper.\n6. The paper states that “In Section 4.4.2 we show that these shifts correspond to movement into more designable basins” (line 112). However, the term “designable” is not clearly defined, nor is the notion of a “designable basin” formally introduced or supported. Moreover, I was unable to locate a Section 4.4.2 in the paper.\n7. In Figure 1, the filter condition includes an MFE criterion, but this term does not appear in Equation (3)."}, "questions": {"value": "See the weaknesses part."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "C7oV0Isvu8", "forum": "IbY0Jbfzaf", "replyto": "IbY0Jbfzaf", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8981/Reviewer_2HaV"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8981/Reviewer_2HaV"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8981/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762216194879, "cdate": 1762216194879, "tmdate": 1762920711866, "mdate": 1762920711866, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
