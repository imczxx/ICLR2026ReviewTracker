Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs - are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they truly capture the rules of chess.\nTo investigate this, we train a 270M parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios, designed to reveal failures of systematic generalisation. Our analysis shows that Transformers exhibit compositional generalisation, as evidenced by strong rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental ‘syntactic’ rules of the game by consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles. In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions of pieces are randomised. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Language model", "transformer", "chess model", "out-of-distribution generalization", "rule extrapolation", "chess960"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b81833c2e1dea9265765289f3ed4cef93f1b3112.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce a number of OOD chess test sets based on variations of the game (Horde) and rare game positions (multiple pieces of the same color.)

We appreciate the suggestion to discuss these works more thoroughly, and we clarify below how our study is complementary to, and distinct from, these approaches.\n\n1. **Distinct research objectives**  \nRuoss et al. and Schultz et al. focus primarily on improving chess-playing performance, employing techniques such as legal-move constraints, external or internal search, or training on specific chess variants. Their aim is to build stronger chess models.  \nIn contrast, our paper is an empirical study of transformer reasoning and OOD generalization. Chess serves only as a controlled domain for analysis, not as a target task for performance optimization.\n2. **Broader and more systematic OOD evaluation**  \nRuoss et al. evaluate accuracy only on in-distribution datasets. Schultz et al. include an OOD-like setting involving random boards, but the evaluation is limited to a single dataset and focuses on legal-move accuracy.  \nOur work provides a substantially broader OOD evaluation across multiple dataset types, introduces additional metrics and stress tests, and uncovers several behavioral patterns not reported in prior work.\n3. **Novel conceptual contributions**\nOur analysis of strategic adaptation and training dynamics introduces perspectives not explored in the cited papers. Reviewers correctly noted that both papers assess models on Chess960. However:\n   - In Ruoss et al., the model is constrained to produce legal moves; without this constraint, legal-move accuracy is extremely low (Table A3), making OOD analysis difficult.\n   - In Schultz et al., the model is trained on Chess960 and then evaluated on Chess960; thus the evaluation is not OOD with respect to the training distribution.\n\n   In contrast, we train only on standard chess and evaluate on several chess variants without any enforcement mechanisms, allowing us to directly probe intrinsic OOD generalization.\nIn summary, we believe that of the five contributions described in the paper, contributions (1), (3), (4), and (5) are novel, whereas contribution (2) is explicitly included as a reproduction of a chess transformer to allow the OOD study and is not the primary focus of our work. \n\nWe sincerely thank the reviewers for highlighting that these papers should be discussed in our manuscript. We firmly believe that our contribution — uncovering how transformer models exhibit compositional generalization and strategic adaptation — is not redundant with the two prior papers. Nevertheless, we take the feedback seriously and will revise the manuscript to clarify the distinctions and explicitly discuss the relationship to Ruoss et al. and Schultz et al. in the related works section."}}, "id": "75n0AQ9iJi", "forum": "bs890te4so", "replyto": "bs890te4so", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21232/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21232/Authors"], "number": 5, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21232/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763654182022, "cdate": 1763654182022, "tmdate": 1763654182022, "mdate": 1763654182022, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
