These moderately forgettable samples often reside near decision boundaries and exhibit inconsistent learning behavior, contributing to elevated false negative rates and suboptimal boundary delineation. Existing methods lack effective mechanisms to identify and reinforce such samples, especially under patch-wise training constraints imposed by large-volume medical data. We propose an end-to-end online learning framework that systematically mines these moderately forgettable samples. Our method comprises three complementary modules: (1) Text-Guided Fusion, which incorporates CLIP-based text embeddings to guide semantic prototype learning and enhance feature representation; (2) Prototype-Based Scoring, which evaluates sample difficulty across intra-class consistency, inter-class distinction, prediction deviation, and model confidence; and (3) an Online Forgettable Sample Bank, which adaptively retains and replays informative samples through curriculum learning. Experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces false negative rates and improves boundary accuracy in clinically challenging scenarios.", "tldr": "We improve medical image segmentation by identifying and reinforcing \"moderately forgettable\" samples near decision boundaries using CLIP-guided prototypes and an adaptive sample bank, reducing false negatives and improving boundary accuracy.", "keywords": ["medical image segmentation", "moderately forgettable samples", "prototype learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d0a8ad7237cd4b18d8ebfdd2ec8efaaf0bdfce83.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a medical image segmentation framework that utilizes a hard-sample patch-wise replay method guided by prototypes, and incorporates CLIP text embeddings for encoder-decoder feature fusing in the U-Net architecture.

The CLIP text embedding may have a huge gap between natural image descriptions and medical images, and the performance gain may simply be the result of adding a powerful, high-dimensional, pre-trained feature vector that acts as a strong form of regularization or feature enrichment, rather than providing true *semantic guidance* derived from the text input. Without deeper analysis demonstrating that the text features align with medical concepts (e.g., via visualization or linear probing), the claim of semantic guidance is unconvincing (as those stated around line 198-200).\n4.

Motivation & Novelty\n\n1.1 Clarity of “Moderately Forgettable Samples”\nThe concept of “moderately forgettable samples” is central to this paper, but its definition remains informal. The authors should provide a clearer, quantitative criterion to demonstrate these samples from easy or noisy ones. Moreover, it remains unclear how the proposed method guarantees that the identified samples correspond to clinically meaningful hard positives rather than mislabeled or ambiguous regions.\n\n1.2 Technical Novelty and Contribution.\nThe proposed components (text-guided fusion, prototype-based scoring, and a replay memory bank) individually build upon well-established ideas. The authors should better highlight what is fundamentally new in their formulation or analysis compared with prior works on hard-sample mining, prototype learning, or CLIP-based semantic guidance, especially to appeal to a broader ICLR audience beyond medical imaging.\n\n\n2. Method\n\n2.1 Section 3.2 (Prototype-Based Scoring)\n\n(1) Line 235, “Our approach addresses these limitations by leveraging semantically-enhanced prototypes to provide both computational efficiency and semantic-aware patch-level scoring.” \n\nThis claim requires justification. How does semantic enhancement improve efficiency rather than add overhead? A brief complexity analysis or runtime comparison would clarify this point.\n\n(2) Line 278, “The four terms are normalized by the number of pixels to bring them to a comparable scale.” \n\nPlease analyze how this normalization affects the relative weighting among metrics, particularly for organs of different sizes. Could this bias the difficulty estimation toward small or large structures?\n\n2.2 Sect. 3.3 Forgettable Sample Bank\n\nHow does performance vary with different bank sizes, and what trade-offs exist between memory cost, sample diversity, and replay stability? A more systematic guideline or sensitivity curve would strengthen this part.\n\n\n3. Experiments\n3.1 The paper shows strong overall results but does not clearly isolate the effect of CLIP-based semantic fusion on prototype learning. Visualization or quantitative analysis would help demonstrate how text guidance improves the representation quality.\n\n3.2 How sensitive is the framework to the choice of frozen CLIP backbone (ViT-B/32 vs ViT-L/14)?\n\n3.2 The method introduces additional modules.
