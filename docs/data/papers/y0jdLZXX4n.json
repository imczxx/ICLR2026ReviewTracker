Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models, essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial structures, they remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint. In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume access to an empirical risk minimizer. In this work, we present a principled theoretical framework analyzing diffusion models, providing a state-of-the-art sample complexity bound of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-4})$. Our structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical and optimization components offers critical insights into how diffusion models can be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance of diffusion models.", "tldr": "Obtain state of the art sample complexity bounds for diffusion models.", "keywords": ["Diffusion Models"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/297132dddecab286134605ba7eaee6cd974e2a64.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper claims that it gives better sample complexity guarantees under relaxed assumptions.

This confused me a lot as I came into this paper expecting to see results on discrete diffusion.\n\nPresentation density:\nWhile technically solid, the exposition is heavy and at times repetitive (e.g., re-stating assumptions multiple times). Additionally, the paper has many typos and can be majorly improved. It lacks consistency in writing. Examples include lines 432-433, some times the word \"equation\" is with capital E, sometimes with lower case e, the footnote in the first page is split between pages and many more.\n\nSample complexity concern:\nAlthough the authors claim to improve the bound, something seems to be missing from their analysis.
