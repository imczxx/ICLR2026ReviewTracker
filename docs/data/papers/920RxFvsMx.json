While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the theo\u0002retical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration, specifically for\u0002mulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in goal-oriented multi\u0002agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically relevant information and trans\u0002mitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative perception framework that intro\u0002duces two key innovations: i) task entropy discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to maximize the efficiency in supplying prag\u0002matic information; ii) mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition. Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing communication volume by up to 108×.

Real-Time Latency in Two-Round Communication: RDcomm adopts a two-round communication mechanism (first sending a coarse abstract, then the receiver evaluates redundancy, and finally refined messages are sent). Although the abstract message constitutes only about 10% of the total communication volume, this mechanism introduces end-to-end latency and incurs synchronization and coordination overhead in real-time sensitive scenarios like vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. The paper lacks an analysis of the actual impact of this latency on perception performance, which is crucial for real-world deployment.\n\n2. Robustness of Mutual Information Estimation: The method relies on a GAN-style neural mutual information estimator to determine message redundancy. However, mutual information estimation in high-dimensional feature spaces is susceptible to sampling bias and training instability.
