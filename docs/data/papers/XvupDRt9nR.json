By invoking visual tools or generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for advancing multimodal reasoning.\nTo further advance this line of work, we present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image–text interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we design a model that performs interleaved image–text reasoning and natively generates ''visual thoughts'' by operating directly in the visual embedding space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible ''thinking with images''. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness of the model design. The DeepSketcher suite will be released.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Vision-Language Model", "Large Language Model", "Multi-model Reasoning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3aa11e5d2ae326021abcde9d71dbc91cc5e1e76f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces DeepSketcher, a new suite for multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Constructing an interleaved CoT dataset from code rendering is a novel and valuable approach. This method enables the generation of fine-grained, decomposable, and high-precision data, which is a significant challenge in the field.\n2. The proposed method, editing visual tokens via embedding editor is novel and interesting idea. This can be applicable to other tasks."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Model Comparison Scope:** The experimental comparison in Table 2 provides valuable context, but could be strengthened by including more directly comparable baselines. While models like VILASR and Mirage are included, their focus on general spatial reasoning (e.g., mazes) differs from DeepSketcher's mathematical reasoning objective. Including direct comparisons to state-of-the-art multimodal math reasoning models, such as Mulberry, TVC, and especially MathCoder-VL, would offer a clearer assessment of DeepSketcher's relative performance. MathCoder-VL seems particularly relevant given its use of a code-rendered dataset methodology and strong reported results.\n2. **Lack of Validation and Rigorous Ablation:** I think the paper's core claims about the model and dataset should be further validated.\n* **In-house Benchmark:** The indicator-500 dataset is used for evaluations and ablations, but there is no mention of it being human-validated to reduce noise and ensure quality.\n* **Model Ablation Clarification:** The ablation study for the \"Embedding Editor\" (Table 4) aims to show its benefit. However, the \"Text-only (Baseline)\" might not fully isolate the editor's contribution from the textual reasoning learned from the dataset. An alternative baseline, such as SFT-ing the base model (Qwen2.5-VL) solely on the text-only CoT traces from the DeepSketcher dataset, could provide a more direct comparison and potentially offer stronger evidence for the editor's specific advantages.\n* **Dataset Contribution Validation:** Demonstrating the value of the DeepSketcher dataset independently of the specific DeepSketcher model would be beneficial. The pass@8 metric for data curation offers some insight, but may be a limited proxy for overall dataset utility. Providing results from training other standard models (e.g., (1) base VLMs like Qwen2.5-VL with text-only SFT, (2) tool-calling models like PixelReasoner or Ground-R1 [1, 2], (3) intrinsic reasoning models like v1 [3] or Bagel-Zebra-CoT-7B) on the DeepSketcher dataset could further solidify its contribution to the field.\n3. **Readability:** Some sections of the paper could benefit from clearer structuring. For instance, dividing the content into more subsections might help improve readability and the logical flow of the arguments.\n\n---\nReferences:\n1.

As the author mentioned in the data generation pipeline, they successfully constructed a pipeline to map thinking and action into code manipulation of the given images. What motivates the authors to use an embedding editor in their training rather than simply using this pipeline to map it back and encode the edited image again? Training such an editor is extremely costly.\n\n2. The improvement of the proposed method is not that sound. The authors mentioned some baseline models, but training with different data, I do not think they can be used as a fair comparison. The author should include SFT/RL baselines with same amount of data, and tool calling baseline using the correct tool. For example, given the tool calling prompt of the code manipulation, how will qwen2.5-vl perform in a zero-shot manner?\n\n3. Performance comparison with basic CoT is needed. Also, the author mentions several type of image manipulation data, I would like to know how the model solves problem with these tools, including the distribution of the type of tools they use and whether they succeed with these tools. For example, drawing correct line.
