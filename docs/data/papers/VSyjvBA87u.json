While promising, existing GCL methods often lack explicit modeling of hierarchical item structures, which represent item similarities across varying resolutions. Such hierarchical item structures are ubiquitous in various items (e.g., online products and local businesses), and reflect their inherent organizational properties that serve as critical signals for enhancing recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose Representation-driven Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning (RHGCL), a novel GCL method that incorporates hierarchical item structures from learned representations for recommendations. First, RHGCL pre-trains a GCL module using cross-layer contrastive learning to obtain user and item representations. Second, RHGCL employs a representation compression and clustering method to construct a two-hierarchy user-item bipartite graph. Ultimately, RHGCL fine-tunes user and item representations by learning on the hierarchical graph, and then provides recommendations based on user-item interaction scores. Experiments on three widely adopted benchmark datasets ranging from 70K to 382K nodes confirm the superior performance of RHGCL over existing baseline models, highlighting the contribution of representation-driven hierarchical item structures in enhancing GCL methods for recommendation tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Item Representation", "Recommendation", "Contrastive Learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f70b678175d9fe68551eb4d9988a36767c5408a5.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes RHGCL, a hierarchical graph contrastive learning method for user-item recommendation that incorporates hierarchical item structures.

The deterministic polar coordinate partitioning seems arbitrary and overly simplistic. Why should semantic item relationships align with geometric sectors in a 2D embedding space? This lacks theoretical grounding.  \n\n4. No comparison with methods that learn hierarchical structures (e.g., differentiable pooling variations adapted for bipartite graphs).  \n\n5. The related work section (Appendix A) lists several hierarchical GCL methods for recommendations (HKGCL, HGCL, ReHCL, HEK-CL, HNECL), but none are included in the experimental comparison.
