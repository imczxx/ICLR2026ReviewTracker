Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data, showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However, effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency, as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical insights.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Out-of-distribution detection", "Unlabeled data"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7a66464325393965cea4490bdb7c3f40bbe40e46.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9882de1821352981ada99b995675138a4614efc1.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Medix, a method for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection that utilizes unlabeled \"in-the-wild\" data.

The most significant weakness is the insufficient discussion and comparison with the most relevant prior work. The core mechanism of using gradients from an InD model to identify OOD samples in unlabeled data is the central contribution of Du et al. (\"How Does Unlabeled Data Provably Help Out-of-Distribution Detection?\"). While Medix employs a median-based objective instead of a mean-based one, the paper fails to compellingly argue why this constitutes a fundamental advance rather than an incremental variation. The absence of a direct, quantitative comparison with this key work (and its subsequent developments) makes it impossible to assess the true marginal contribution of the median-centric approach.\n2. The empirical comparisons, while broad, overlook several recent and highly relevant state-of-the-art methods (e.g., [a,b]). This omission weakens the claim of superior performance, as it remains unclear how Medix fares against its most direct competitors.\n3. The iterative, greedy filtering algorithm (Algorithm 1) is computationally intensive. Although profiling results are provided, the cost may be prohibitive for very large-scale datasets or applications requiring frequent model updates, which is a common scenario in real-world deployments.\n4. The theoretical guarantees rely on assumptions such as i.i.d. samples and sub-Gaussian gradient coordinates. The practical validity of these assumptions, especially for modern deep networks and complex data distributions, is not thoroughly justified and could limit the real-world applicability of the bounds.\n\nReferences:  \n[a] Du et al.

If the reviewer understands correctly, the difference between SAL and Medix only lies in the procedures to use gradient information to identify candidate OOD data from the wild data. SAL can also be applied in the setting of dataset-level mixing. Therefore, the authors should **provide an in-depth discussion on the advantages of Medix over SAL, reinforced with additional experiment results or theoretical analysis.** \n\n2. **This paper omits a direct experimental comparison between SAL and Medix.** In fact, the reported results in the SAL paper indicate that SAL achieves nearly zero FPR95 on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 OOD benchmarks.

Therefore, the reviewer suggests that the authors **include a direct comparison with SAL and extend experiments on more challenging OOD benchmarks**, such as ImageNet-1k OOD benchmarks.\n\n3.
