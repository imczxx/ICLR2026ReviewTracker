However, manual annotation is costly and fixed vocabularies restrict scalability and generalization. Existing pseudo-labeling pipelines often overfit to biased distributions and generate noisy or redundant samples. Through our systematic analysis of data quality and distributional coverage, we find that performance gains come less from raw data volume and more from effective distribution expansion. Motivated by this insight, we propose DAL, a distribution-aware labeling framework for visual grounding. The proposed method first employs a dual-driven annotation module, where a closed-set path provides reliable pseudo labels and an open-set path enriches vocabulary and introduces novel concepts; meanwhile, it further performs explicit out-of-distribution (OOD) expression expansion to broaden semantic coverage. We then propose a consistency- and distribution-aware filtering module to discard noisy or redundant region–text pairs and rebalance underrepresented linguistic content, thereby improving both data quality and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on three visual grounding tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results, underscoring the critical role of distribution-aware labeling in building scalable and robust visual grounding datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["visual grounding; pseudo-labeling"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c7e52850c3f1bb98cc1eeb8b1633e53946411847.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes DAL (Distribution-Aware Labeling) for visual grounding that prioritizes distribution expansion over raw data volume.

One of the major weaknesses lies in the novelty of the data generation and filtering strategies. As a main contribution of this paper, the open-set and closed-set annotation operations follow a standard practice. Although the authors introduce an additional OOD expression expansion operation, the improvements it brings are relatively small (see Table 4, by introducing 90K extra data, the performance of “+ OOD expansion” is only slightly better than that of the dual-driven strategy). How about generating more open-set data to replace the OOD expansion operation?\n\n2. The authors claim that they find that “performance gains come less from raw data volume and more from effective distribution expansion”, but I cannot observe any direct evidence to support such a claim. Could the authors provide an explanation about the claim that the raw data volume is less influential on the performance gains than the effective distribution expansion?\n\n3. In Table 7, the authors have compared the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, GoundingDINO, and their DAL-enhanced variants. Since the DAL method requires to use of pseudo-annotated data to fine-tune the model, I am wondering whether the authors have performed the same fine-tuning operation on the original Qwen2.5-VL-7B and GoundingDINO models by using the human-labeled data in the RefCOCO/+/g datasets. If not, such comparisons may be unfair and cannot demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated pseudo-annotated data.\n\n4. In Table 9, the model trained with 100K human-labeled samples exhibits comparable performance with that trained with 700K pseudo-labeled samples. Does this mean that the quality of automatically generated annotations is weak and cannot be used in real-world applications, since the expansion of data amount also increases the overhead of computational and memory resources?\n\n5.

I hope the authors will address them thoroughly.\n\n- Q1. This manuscript essentially explores how pseudo-label generation techniques from unsupervised visual grounding can be used to enhance the performance of fully supervised models. While the overall idea is promising, the paper suffers from several serious issues in writing, methodology, and experimental design.\n\n- Q2. The core idea of this work shows a strong resemblance to CLIP-VG. Although the authors emphasize that CLIP-VG employs template-based pseudo-labels, in fact, CLIP-VG utilizes three sources of pseudo-labels: templates, scene graphs, and image captions. Notably, the image captions used in CLIP-VG are conceptually similar to the LLM-generated texts in this paper.\n\nFurthermore, the feature distribution presented in Figure 4 of this paper conveys essentially the same idea as the feature visualization in Figure 6 of CLIP-VG. Similarly, Equations (2) and (3) in this paper refer to a \"spatial filtering\" process that is nearly identical to the \"Reliability\" concept defined in CLIP-VG. The paper should dedicate more space and conduct more thorough comparisons with CLIP-VG, both in method discussion and experiments.\n\n- Q3. In terms of writing, Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are largely implementation details and do not contribute meaningful technical novelty. In particular, the \"dual-driven\" annotation strategy appears to be an engineering choice rather than a methodological innovation. It should not be placed in the main method section, and certainly does not merit the level of emphasis it receives in the introduction. It would be more appropriate to include this content as a preparatory explanation before the experiments.\n\n- Q4. The introduction fails to clearly articulate how the so-called \"distributed-aware\" is technically implemented during the generation and filtering stages. Most of the discussion focuses on empirical results without presenting substantive technical contributions. The concept of \"spatial consistency\", which the paper claims as a key aspect, is not novel, CLIP-VG already leverages spatial consistency (i.e., IoU) for pseudo-label filtering. However, the authors do not engage in much discussion or differentiation in this regard.\n\n- Q5. The authors note that \"increasing the amount of data generally leads to better model performance.\" After reviewing the experiments and Tables 1, 2, and 3, I find the evaluation strategy questionable and somewhat naïve. The authors use two additional models—QWen2.5 and Grounding DINO—to generate a large number of pseudo-labels. Then, they retrain a SOTA model (i.e., SimVG) using both the original and generated labels, and compare its performance with the original SOTA baseline. This comparison is fundamentally unfair, as the improved performance is likely due to the increased data volume rather than the proposed method itself.\n\nI would like to remind the authors that the core of a research paper lies in its technical contribution. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the same additional data should also be used to train the baseline SOTA model. Otherwise, the paper is merely reiterating a well-known conclusion: more data leads to better performance.\n\n- Q6. There are significant issues in the writing of the method section:\n\n(a) Section 3.3 appears unnecessarily convoluted, with complex equations that obscure the implementation details. For example, the paper does not explain how Equation (1) is actually computed.\n\n(b) The paper fails to explain how the \"intrinsic and relational similarities\" in Equation (4) are calculated. While CLIP-based cross-modal similarity is straightforward, it still requires a concrete explanation.\n\n(c) The computation of 𝑝(𝑓𝑇) in Equation (5) is not described at all.\n\n- Q7. Other issues: \n\n(a) Figure 2 does not specify what “SOTA” refers to.\n\n(b) Figure 3 does not clearly illustrate the pseudo-label generation processes from the three sources.\n\n(c)  There are traces of text generated by large language models in this manuscript."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "See Questions."}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "DoYqBDklfn", "forum": "oTlIfmU1nf", "replyto": "oTlIfmU1nf", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8952/Reviewer_esjU"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8952/Reviewer_esjU"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8952/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762156388420, "cdate": 1762156388420, "tmdate": 1762920688141, "mdate": 1762920688141, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
