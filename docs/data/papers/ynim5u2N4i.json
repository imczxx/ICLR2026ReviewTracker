Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration, resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner, allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE). Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task, called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in fidelity and consistency.", "tldr": "GenCompositor is capable of effortlessly compositing different videos guided by user-specified trajectories and scales.", "keywords": ["Diffusion Models", "Video Editing", "Video Compositing"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3aa598e5227d624d532bf09657db5b8fdc5e79ec.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/27f18c510c51d9af8b342e392cb17ce1d09641cc.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes GenCompositor, a generative video compositing method that can adaptively inject foreground video with user control into the background video.

This differentiates from existing works on video compositing as it utilizes the generative models to complete the task. From this perspective, the proposed task is similar to the existing one, but tackles the problem from a different technical perspective. \n\nIn addition to the task, the paper shows some strong points in curating the dataset required to evaluate on this task. If released, this should help further advance the research in this field. The paper offers a good motivation for why this problem is important and presents the components in the pipeline relatively well. Below, I will show the weak points that need particular attention."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The experimental visualization was not quite clear. For instance, by checking on Figure 1, what is the foreground object on the left top example of the figure? The depicted trajectory is also unclear in this case. It will be nice to have high-resolution and good-quality results. Similarly in Figure 7, the trajectory is not very clearly depicted. \n\nThe paper mentions the interaction between the added foreground object and the background, citing the explosion effect in Figure 1(a) as an example. This looks very interesting. However, I don't believe this paper presents sufficient technical details to explain why that happens. Usually, we will expect the added element to have a static presence. But this claim shows that the newly added element can adapt to the background content. This part is not supported by the technical details, at least not clearly presented. This is related to mask inflation, but not entirely. \n\nRegarding the input conversion, the user trajectory has been used to generate the mask video and masked video. The trajectory itself was not directly encoded. It will be nice to directly state what the conditions of \"c\" are in Eqn. (2). \n\nBased on the workflow of GenCompositor in Figure 2, the masked video and its corresponding mask video has been concatenated as the input. This indicates that the GenCompositor deals with the layout-aligned conditions. In Section 4.4, where ERoPE was discussed, the problem has been shifted to the layout-unaligned conditions. This creates some gaps in understanding, as the workflow in Figure 2 does not incorporate the layout-unaligned conditions. Will the layout-unaligned conditions change the workflow of the proposed GenCompositor? This creates some confusion here. \n\nThe role of the inflated mask could be better clarified. Initially, I was thinking that the mask regions were expanded to increase the size of the foreground object, if there is an imperfect foreground mask. A Gaussian filter was used to inflate the mask video. When looking at Figure 8, I have also noticed that the inflated mask was naturally generated as the foreground object changes. \n\nIn summary, the paper tackles an interesting task, and the presented pipeline is also feasible to address the proposed task. There are some technical contributions regarding the proposed pipeline, as well as the ERoPE part. The proposed dataset is also a good contribution. Therefore, the paper looks positive. However, the paper also shows the concerns listed above, which need to be addressed well. The corresponding answers to address these concerns would be critical for the final decision."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Appendix F shows that extending RoPE along height, width, or temporal dimensions yields nearly identical training loss curves, leading authors to conclude these three directions are equivalent. However, this dimension-agnostic behavior seems contradictory to the inherent spatial-temporal characteristics of videos. If ERoPE truly models spatial layout relationships, spatial extensions (height/width) should outperform temporal extension since they directly encode spatial proximity. Conversely, if it captures motion dynamics, temporal extension should be more effective given the causal and directional nature of video frames. The complete equivalence across all three dimensions suggests that ERoPE may simply function by expanding the position encoding to avoid feature conflicts, rather than genuinely modeling spatial-temporal interactions between foreground and background. Could the authors clarify this dimension-independence phenomenon and explain whether simpler alternatives (such as learnable position offsets for different video sources) might achieve comparable results?\n\n2.
