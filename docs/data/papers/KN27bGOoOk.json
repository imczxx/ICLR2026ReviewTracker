While algorithms such as Network Dissection and CLIP-Dissect achieve great empirical success,\na rigorous theoretical foundation remains absent, which is crucial to enable trustworthy and reliable explanations. In this work, we observe that neuron identification can be viewed as the *inverse process of machine learning*, which allows us to derive guarantees for neuron explanations. Based on this insight, we present the first theoretical analysis of two fundamental challenges: (1) **Faithfulness:** whether the identified concept faithfully represents the neuron's underlying function and (2) **Stability:** whether the identification results are consistent across probing datasets.  We derive generalization bounds for widely used similarity metrics (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, IoU) to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble procedure that quantifies stability along with **BE** (Bootstrap Explanation) method to generate concept prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the practicality of our method, providing an important step toward trustworthy neuron identification.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Mechannistic interpretability", "concept identification"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/16a23625422c5e63504e1a96f46663b9e49f5478.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/480264fe67cdebd91b5086c81c4bb9ff6a927843.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles neuron identification through an inverse-learning lens: instead of training a model to fit data, it “identifies” a concept 𝑐 that best matches a fixed neuron (or neuron set) 𝑓. The authors formalize faithfulness as population-level similarity sim(𝑓,𝑐) and prove uniform generalization bounds showing that maximizing empirical similarity on a probe set yields near-optimal population similarity. They further introduce a stability notion via a bootstrap wrapper that produces prediction sets of candidate concepts with a provable coverage lower bound. The theory is instantiated for common similarity metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUROC, IoU), yielding rate expressions that translate into practical sample-size and metric-selection guidance.

However, it remains unclear whether the probing set and concept set used for this comparison are consistent across both methods. Specifically, CLIP Dissect employs images from the model’s training data as the probing set and utilizes a concept set of approximately 2K words, while NetDissect uses the Broden dataset, which includes segmentation mask annotations but contains far fewer samples. Therefore, when applying the proposed Bootstrap Ensemble procedure under the original settings of each method, the resulting bootstrap datasets and outcomes are unlikely to be derived from identical conditions. A clarification on this point would strengthen the validity of the comparison.\n- The paper introduces five similarity metrics, accuracy, AUROC, IoU, recall, and precision, as general evaluation measures. However, the applicability of each metric highly depends on the label type of the probing set and concept set. For example, IoU typically requires pixel-level ground-truth segmentation masks, making it suitable for NetDissect (which uses the Broden dataset) but not directly applicable to CLIP-Dissect, which lacks such annotations. Therefore, it would be beneficial to clarify whether different metrics are selectively used depending on the label types of the probing and concept sets if all five metrics are claimed to be generally applicable, to provide additional explanation on how each metric is adapted to different concept identification methods."}, "questions": {"value": "- How broad is the applicability of the approach (e.g., beyond vision, beyond single neurons, beyond simple concept sets)?\n- The focus is on individual neurons and concept alignment.
