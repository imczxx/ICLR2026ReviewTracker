These scenarios give rise to submodular optimization problems with partition-based constraints, where the desired solution set should be in some sense balanced, fair, or resource-constrained across these partitions. While existing work on submodular cover largely overlooks this structure, we initiate a comprehensive study of the problem of Submodular Cover with Partition Constraints (SCP) and its key variants.  Our main contributions are the development and analysis of scalable bicriteria approximation algorithms for these NP-hard optimization problems for both monotone and nonmonotone objectives. Notably, the algorithms proposed for the monotone case achieve optimal approximation guarantees while significantly reducing query complexity compared to existing methods.\n Finally, empirical evaluations on\nreal-world and synthetic datasets further validate the efficiency and effectiveness\nof the proposed algorithms.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["submodular cover", "fairness", "matroid constraint", "submodular optimization"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5157bc57c7f03159edb96dccb46943b15a3bcbb8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Addressing the limitation of traditional submodular cover problems that overlook partition structures and fairness constraints, this paper systematically investigates three constrained submodular cover variants for the first time: non-monotonic SCP (Submodular Cover with Partition Constraints), monotonic SCKP (Submodular Cover with Knapsack Partition Constraints), and monotonic SCF (Submodular Cover with Fairness Constraints). Its core contributions are as follows: (1) proposing a \"submodular maximization-cover conversion framework\" that transforms cover problems into more tractable maximization problems (SMP/SMKP), breaking the bottleneck of traditional methods that directly design cover algorithms; (2) designing bicriteria approximation algorithms (nonmono-bi, greedy-knapsack-bi, Block-Fair-Bi) for the three problem types, achieving optimal approximation ratios in monotonic scenarios while significantly reducing query complexity; (3) validating the proposed algorithms on both real-world (Corel5k, ImageNet_50) and synthetic datasets, demonstrating their superiority over baselines such as STREAM and GREEDY-Fair in terms of function value achievement rate, budget optimization, and fairness balance."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "It is the first systematic study of the submodular cover problem with partition constraints, covering practical scenarios such as fairness and budget allocation, and has strong application value.\n\nThe proposed \"block greedy\" strategy effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional greedy algorithms under partition constraints, balancing the approximation ratio and query efficiency.\n\nAll algorithms provide strict approximation ratio guarantees and are detailedly derived through methods such as induction and concentration inequalities."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I did not identify any major weaknesses in this paper.
