Solving OPF directly in large-scale power systems imposes a high computational burden, whereas compact approximation models, particularly multilayer perceptrons, have been introduced to improve efficiency. However, existing small-scale DNN-based models fail to meet the demands of highly dynamic grid topologies and multi-contingency solution requirements, due to their limited adaptability to topological changes and insufficient fitting capability. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a graph self-attention-enhanced framework to optimize N-1 SCOPF solving. Specifically, a residual-based graph self-attention architecture is proposed to enable topological variation adaptation and scalable network expansion in depth and width. Furthermore, the Explained Variance Score (EVS) is introduced as a direct quantitative metric to evaluate the fitting performance of the proposed framework. Experimental results on the IEEE 9, 118, 300, and 2000-bus systems demonstrate that increasing the scale of the graph self-attention framework effectively enhances its fitting performance on N-1 SCOPF problems.", "tldr": "apply graph neural network for N-1 security power flow", "keywords": ["N-1 security-constrained optimal flow", "graph attention mechanism", "explained variance score", "machine learning"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a1e21154f3433816cc71773f8004c5ed8cb80a6b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/bf15edfc96dcd7ec72a398998d945aefa337160a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces DeepOPF-GAF, a Graph Self-Attention Framework, for solving the N-1 Security-Constrained OPF (SCOPF) problem, which is at the center of power system optimization.

The actual methodological contribution is applying larger graph neural networks, not fundamentally solving N-1 SCOPF in a novel way. Previous works (Velloso & Van Hentenryck, 2021; Liu et al., 2022b; Pham & Li, 2024) have already addressed N-1 scenarios, and other work discussed N-1 scenarios for larger grids using graph neural networks (Cambier van Nooten et al., 2025).\n\n2) Missing contingency classification: In practical N-1 SCOPF, not all contingencies are equally important. The paper treats all contingencies uniformly without: \n\t⁃\tpredicting which line outages/generator failures will cause binding constraints, \n\t⁃\tfiltering or ranking contingencies by severity, \n\t⁃\tany computational strategy to handle the combinatorial explosion in large systems (2000-bus system could have ~2000+ contingencies). \n\n3) Scalability concerns inadequately addressed: \n\t⁃\tThe paper mentions ignoring \"unsolvable scenarios\" (lines 326-329) without discussing how many scenarios were discarded or the implications. \n\t⁃\tFor the 2000-bus system, how many total contingency scenarios were considered? The computational and memory requirements are not discussed\n\t⁃\tTraining with \"100 samples per scenario\" (line 331) seems limited for establishing generalization. \n\n4) Limited architectural novelty: The proposed architecture is essentially a standard stacking of existing GAT and GCN layers with residual connections. The specific design choices (why alternate GAT/GCN layers? what depth/width trade-offs?) lack theoretical or empirical justification. \n\n5) Weak experimental design:\n\t⁃\tNo comparison with recent GNN-based OPF methods (only comparing variants of their own architecture in Table 6)\n\t⁃\tNo comparison with the specifically cited N-1 SCOPF work (Pham & Li, 2024)\n\t⁃\tNo analysis of out-of-distribution performance or topology transfer\n\n6) Generalization not addressed:\n\t⁃\tAll experiments use uniform sampling [70%, 130%] of base load - what about different load distributions?\n\t⁃\tNo testing on different network topologies than training\n\t⁃\tNo discussion of seasonal or daily load patterns\n\n7) \tEdge Features Completely Unspecified. Line 244-246: \"edge features represented by the adjacency matrix of bus system”. Critical missing information:\n\t⁃\tWhat are the actual edge features? Just binary connectivity (0/1)?\n\t⁃\tOr do edges include g_ij, b_ij (conductance/susceptance) from Equations 2-3?\n\t⁃\tFor line failures, Equation 10 sets g_ft = b_ft = 0, but nowhere is it explained how/where these are input to the model\n\t⁃\tEquations 11-15 (GAT mechanism) show no edge features - only node features h_i, h_j\n\t⁃\tStandard GAT uses only node features; if edge features exist, how are they incorporated?\n\n8) Graph Modification Process Undefined. Lines 326-327: \"faulty lines in the graph adjacency matrix is disconnected\" and \"invalidates the generator status”. Unclear:\n\t⁃\tIs the adjacency edge removed entirely, or set to zero weight?\n\t⁃\tGenerator failures: P^max_g and Q^max_g are listed as inputs (line 244), but are they set to zero (per Eq. 9) or is there a separate binary mask feature?\n\t⁃\tHow does the model distinguish \"no line exists\" from \"line exists but failed\"?\n\n9) No Topology Generalisation Experiments. Missing critical evaluations:\n\t⁃\tTrain on subset of contingencies, test on unseen contingencies\n\t⁃\tAdd/remove buses or lines not in training set\n\t⁃\tCompare against fixed-topology baseline to quantify adaptation benefit\n\n10) Comparison with Related Work Insufficient. Line 90-91 criticizes Zhou et al. (2022) as \"difficult to modify nodes and add branches\"\n\t⁃\tNo side-by-side comparison of topology handling mechanisms\n\t⁃\tNo experiments showing this method can add nodes/branches either\n\t⁃\tPham & Li (2024) specifically addresses N-1 SCOPF with GNNs \n\t⁃\tSee other references for relatable work.\n11) Contradictory Claims. Line 107-108: \"provide reasonable solutions for variable topologies\" (emphasis on adaptation), but line 425-427: \"topology changes are minimal\" (downplays variation).
