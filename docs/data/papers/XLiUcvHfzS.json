For this, VLMs deterministically map images and text descriptions to a joint latent space in which their similarity is assessed using the cosine similarity.

In this work, we propose post-hoc uncertainty estimation in VLMs that does not require additional training. Our method leverages a Bayesian posterior approximation over the last layers in VLMs and analytically quantifies uncertainties over cosine similarities.

The key insight is to apply a Laplace approximation over the last linear projection layers of pre-trained VLMs to obtain Gaussian posteriors over the parameters. This gives a local second-order uncertainty around the learned weights, thereby inducing probabilistic embeddings for both modalities. This also allows the model to analytically compute a distribution over cosine similarities, leading to uncertainty estimates without any retraining, architectural modifications, or additional data. The authors further propose ProbCosine, an analytical approximation for the mean and variance of the cosine similarity under this Bayesian formulation, avoiding costly Monte Carlo sampling.

The formulation is well-grounded in Bayesian deep learning literature and bridges it with the practical need for scalable uncertainty estimation in large multimodal models.\n- **Practicality and scalability:** The method is traning-free and model-agnostic, requiring only access to the final projection weights and not the original training pipeline. The approach introduces negligible computational overhead (<5% runtime, <0.11% GFLOPs), making it attractive for large-scale or resource-constrained deployments.\n- **Analytical Contribution (ProbCosine)** The derivation of a closed-form Gaussian approximation for cosine similarity uncertainty is elegant, interpretable, and computationally efficient. This is a non-trivial mathematical contribution that generalizes beyond this specific application.\n- **Strong Empirical Evaluation:** Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets (Flowers-102, CIFAR, Food-101, ImageNet-R, UCF101, SUN397) and tasks (zero-shot classification, active learning). The paper also shows comparison with strong baselines: temperature scaling, test-time augmentation, and probabilistic embedding models. Results show consistent improvement in calibration metrics (ECE) and competitive or improved accuracy.\n- **Robustness and Generality:** The method performs well even when the Hessian is estimated on proxy datasets, showing robustness to missing original training data. The paper provides ablations on hyperparameters (τ, λ) and data subset sizes for Hessian estimation.\n\nOverall, the main paper is well-written and complemented by detailed appendices with derivations, algorithms, and hyperparameters.\nThe authors mention plans to release code, aiding reproducibility."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- **Assumption of Independence (Modality Factorization)** The method assumes independence between image and text modalities (P ⊥⊥ Q) to enable tractable posterior estimation. Although the authors justify this as a local approximation around the MAP estimate, it weakens the theoretical rigor since VLMs are inherently cross-modal. Also, the impact of this assumption on downstream uncertainty fidelity is not fully explored. Can the authors comment on this?\n- **Limited Scope of Bayesian treatment:** The Laplace approximation is applied only to the final projection layers, while the encoders remain deterministic. This limits the expressiveness of the uncertainty model, potentially underestimating uncertainty arising from deep feature extraction. Although, I understand  that an approximation to the entire encoder layers would be a huge sacrifice for efficiency/practicality, could the authors comment on any other plausible reasons why/why not to consider this?\n- **Evaluation of Uncertainty Quality:** While calibration metrics (ECE, NLPD) are reported, it would strengthen the paper to show qualitative examples or diagnostics of uncertainty estimates (e.g., in failure or domain shift cases).\n- **Active Learning Evaluation Setup:** The active learning results are promising but limited to relatively small-scale benchmarks (OfficeHome, ImageNet variants). It is unclear how the approach would scale to real-world large-scale active learning pipelines or multimodal retrieval settings.\n- **Comparative baselines:** The paper primarily compares with test-time augmentation and temperature scaling, but omits comparison with recent Bayesian adapters or probabilistic prompt tuning methods (e.g., BayesAdapter [1]). A direct comparison could more clearly position BayesVLM in the landscape of uncertainty-aware VLMs.\n- **Interpretability of Uncertainty:** Although the authors claim interpretability under corruptions, the paper could better visualize what kind of uncertainties are captured (epistemic vs. aleatoric). Without this, it’s difficult to assess if BayesVLM truly models epistemic uncertainty or merely produces smoother predictions.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Morales-Alvarez, Pablo et al. “BayesAdapter: enhanced uncertainty estimation in CLIP few-shot adaptation.” (2024)"}, "questions": {"value": "- **Direct baselines.** Can the authors comment on adding ProLIP (frozen or few-shot adapted) [1] and CLAP4CLIP (single-task setting) [2] as baselines on selected zero-shot datasets to validate BayesVLM’s calibration per FLOP gains?\n- **Data requirements:** When estimating the Hessian with proxy datasets, how do you ensure alignment between proxy and original data distributions?

For efficient posterior inference, we utilise independent probabilistic models for each modality and derive an analytical expression for the distribution over cosine similarities. Lastly, we showed the effectiveness of _BayesVLM_ on zero-shot and active learning tasks.\n\n**Strengths:** We are happy to read that our paper has been described as \"**mathematically solid**\" [VDEV], that it provides \"**better calibration performance [...] with small computation overhead**\" [9dNF], and is \"**novel and conceptually elegant**\" [88Gp]. We also appreciate the recognition that our analytical expression of the distribution over cosine similarities (ProbCosine) is an \"**elegant, interpretable, and computationally efficient**\" [88Gp] approach that \"is a **non-trivial mathematical contribution that generalizes beyond this specific application**\" [88Gp].\n\n**Common questions:** We identified the following common questions and concerns about our paper. Below, we give a high-level response to those questions and the changes/additional experiments performed. Detailed responses are found in the individual responses to each reviewer. \n\n- **Validity of the independence assumption [VDEV, 9dNF, 88Gp]:** A recurring question of the reviewers was about the independence assumption made in our work. This assumption follows from building surrogate models that satisfy the common iid assumption and is crucial for efficient computation of the approximate posterior. While a full assessment of the assumption is computationally challenging, we conducted a proxy experiment to provide insights into its validity. Empirically, we found only moderate cross-modal dependence in the Hessian, indicating that, while some secondary interactions between the modalities are disregarded, the primary interactions are not cross-modal and are therefore captured by BayesVLM. Thus supporting our approach. Further details are given in the comments.\n- **Sensitivity/bias wrt the proxy dataset [9dNF, 88Gp]:**  Some reviewers raised concerns about potential bias from/sensitivity to the proxy dataset chosen in closed-source settings. In response to these concerns, we performed an ablation in which we progressively distorted images of the LAION-400M dataset to simulate an increase in distribution shift/bias in the proxy dataset. Our results indicate that BayesVLM remains robust under mild shifts, while stronger deviations (particularly those that compromise semantic content) lead to increased calibration error and higher NLPD. Further details are given in the comments.\n\n**Changes to the manuscript:** We have updated the manuscript with additional experiments in Appendix F.11 (Robustness wrt distribution shift of the Proxy Dataset) and F.12 (Additional Zero-shot Results on Adversarial ImageNet Variants) and colour-coded the changes in red. Additionally, following reviewer feedback, we moved the qualitative uncertainty analysis from Appendix F.6 into Section 4.3 in the main text.\n\nWe reply to each reviewer separately below in the comment section.
