However, current approaches often struggle to model intra- and inter-modal interactions efficiently and effectively due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the inputs. A major challenge is capturing critical prognostic events that, though few, underlie the complexity of the observed inputs and largely determine patient outcomes. These events---manifested as high-level structural signals such as spatial histologic patterns or pathway co-activations---are typically sparse, patient-specific, and unannotated, making them inherently difficult to uncover. To address this, we propose SlotSPE, a slot-based framework for structural prognostic event modeling. Specifically, inspired by the principle of factorial coding, we compress each patient’s multimodal inputs into compact, modality-specific sets of mutually distinctive slots using slot attention. By leveraging these slot representations as encodings for prognostic events, our framework enables both efficient and effective modeling of complex intra- and inter-modal interactions, while also facilitating seamless incorporation of biological priors that enhance prognostic relevance. Extensive experiments on ten cancer benchmarks show that SlotSPE outperforms existing methods in 8 out of 10 cohorts, achieving an overall improvement of 2.9%. It remains robust under missing genomic data and delivers markedly improved interpretability through structured event decomposition.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Computational Pathology", "Multimodal Learning", "Cancer Survival Prediction"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6bf7db243f8eac4152fb36d0c1b9575ce82a738d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces SlotSPE, a novel framework for multimodal cancer survival analysis that integrates histology images (WSIs) and genomic data.

The model selectively activates the most predictive slots for each patient via a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style decoder, enhancing personalization and sparsity. A key feature is a biologically-guided cross-modal reconstruction task, where the model learns to predict gene expression from histology images, thereby enforcing meaningful alignment and enabling robust performance even with missing genomic data.

The novelty of this work is limited, as both the Slot Attention and MoE modules have been widely used across various tasks, including survival analysis.\n\n2. The overall writing and structural organization of the paper are quite unclear:\n\n    (1) In the Selective Slot Activation section, the text notes “Conceptually, each slot is treated... A lightweight gating function $\\phi$ predicts a retention score for each slot.” The description claims that the output is of dimension $N_t$, while according to the accompanying formula, it should be a scalar score—which is inconsistent.\n\n    (2) In the paragraph “Then the top-K slots are selected using the Gumbel-Top-K...”, the variable $\\widetilde{w}$ is of dimension $S$, where $S$ denotes the number of slots before selection. It is unclear whether the softmax is applied to the selected slots or to all slots.\n\n    (3) Throughout the paper, many variables—especially those with subscripts—lack clear definitions, which seriously hinders readability.\n    \n    (4) Figure 2 is not introduced or referenced in the main text, making its purpose and relevance unclear.\n    \n    (5) In the paragraph “Given the omics-derived slots $S_g$,...”, the specific role of $S_g$ is not clarified—does it serve as initialization weights or as fixed guidance for new slot generation?\n\n    (6) Section 3.2 as a whole lacks appropriate references to figures, leading to poor readability.\n\n    (7) The paper’s organization is confusing; for instance, to understand the “reconstruction” part, the reader must jump to Appendix B.3, which in turn refers to Equation (5) that appears in the following section—this disrupts the logical reading flow.\n   \n    (8) In Section 3.2 (Slots Interactions), the description of self-interaction and cross-attention mechanisms is vague—it is not specified whether these operations are performed on all slots or only on the selected ones.\n\n    (9) In Section 3.3 (Training and Inference), the reader is directed to Appendix B.5 for the total loss, yet the survival loss is not clearly defined. What exactly constitutes the “standard survival prediction loss”? Moreover, without Equation (18), it is impossible to infer the last two terms of $L_{\\mathrm{surv}}$ from the main text, which indicates significant ambiguity in the writing.\n\n3. The authors are encouraged to clarify the unique aspects and improvements of the MoE mechanism used in this work in comparison to the previously published paper such as [1], in order to emphasize the genuine novelty of the proposed approach.\n\n    [1] From Single-Cancer to Pan-Cancer Prognosis: A Multi-Modal Deep Learning Framework for Survival Analysis with Robust Generalization Capability."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the **Weaknesses**."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "C2Rnryx12y", "forum": "WqCRSn2WAY", "replyto": "WqCRSn2WAY", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2775/Reviewer_kV7i"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2775/Reviewer_kV7i"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2775/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761891241542, "cdate": 1761891241542, "tmdate": 1762916371039, "mdate": 1762916371039, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
