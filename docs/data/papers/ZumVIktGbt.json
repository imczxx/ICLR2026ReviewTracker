However, extending this paradigm to open-ended generation is challenging because there is no unambiguous ground truth. Relying on single-dot supervision often leads to inefficiency and reward hacking. To address these issues, we propose reinforcement learning with verifiable reference-based rewards (RLVRR). Instead of checking the final answer, RLVRR extracts an ordered linguistic signal from high-quality references (i.e, reward chain). Specifically, RLVRR decomposes rewards into two dimensions: content, which preserves deterministic core concepts (e.g., keywords), and style, which evaluates adherence to stylistic properties through LLM-based verification. In this way, RLVRR combines the exploratory strength of RL with the efficiency and reliability of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments on more than 10 benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models confirm the advantages of our approach. RLVRR (1) substantially outperforms SFT trained with ten times more data and advanced reward models, (2) unifies the training of structured reasoning and open-ended generation, and (3) generalizes more effectively while preserving output diversity. These results establish RLVRR as a principled and efficient path toward verifiable reinforcement learning for general-purpose LLM alignment.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "verifiable reference-based rewards", "open-ended generation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/33109e51fd337abb8a453f3c25436d8366ce21fc.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/0e89156ab749984182d447b0de755a2df3d06590.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents RLVRR, an approach to extend verifiable rewards to open domain generation by generating reward chains from high-quality references.

Content-based rewards still rely on the mere notion of LCS with keywords, which seems gameable and doesn't capture deeper semantics. While the authors perform ablations that only calculate the fraction of keywords, which are completely vulnerable to reward hacking by models via keyword stuffing, LCS is not as easily hacked. However, what if cases where some sentences are permuted compared to the references, which leads to smaller sequential overlaps, get passed over even if they are virtually equivalent? Doing some reward value analysis with a few curated examples like that could be interesting. \n2. Style-based rewards seem to be focusing on very surface-level characteristics. For example, in Figure 1, one of the stylistic properties evaluated is the markdown formatting, specifically the hierarchy of the title (exactly \"###\"). Could these rewards be overly strict? It doesn't make sense why \"#\" would be better than \"###\" given the question. Moreover, the program just uses \"###\" in answer, but what if the answer was something like \"Decentralization doesn't f###ing work\" (using ### for censoring rather than formatting). \n3. Additional experiments to validate the importance and impact of the LLM-based weighting scheme. Currently, the comparison is only done between no-weighting and weighting, and even there, the differences **don't look statistically significant** except for FollowBench. It would be interesting to compare it with a reasonable random weighting scheme to see if the weighting is much better than random.\n4. Computing \"false positives\" and \"false negatives\" of the reward chain: Doing a study with a small subset of data, where references are specifically engineered to break the reward functions (like the example given in weakness 2) and then seeing if the reward chain catches them or gives a false positive as well as references which are equivalent by the content is reorded (e.g sentnece permutation mentioned in weakness 1) and seeing if the reward chain misses them (false negatives) would be interesting. While the empirical results suggest that such scenarios might be unlikely in organic rollouts, it would be interesting to study whether this method has potential weaknesses that could surface in other scenarios or could be exploited for some sort of data poisoning attack.\n5. The ablations show that keyword quality matters more than quantity. This suggests that the reference quality also indirectly matters (since bad references would yield bad keywords). This makes me wonder if these techniques would be useful at all for learning from noisy references. It feels like the style-based rewards would also overfit to the formatting style of noisy references, and the inferior keywords would quickly degrade performance."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

While RLVR works well for reasoning tasks (like math and code) where correctness can be verified from the final result (\"verifiable dots\"), it struggles with open-ended generation where there is no single ground truth. RLVRR tackles this challenge by introducing reference-based verifiable reward chains. The core idea is that instead of rewarding only the final verifiable answer, RLVRR derives an ordered linguistic reward chain from reference responses.\n\nThe method decomposes the reward into two verifiable components: (a) content reward that measures inclusion and order of key content elements (keywords or entities) extracted from references, using a two-level hierarchical keyword extraction (key points --> keywords). Alignment is computed via Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between reference and generated keywords; (b) style reward that checks adherence to stylistic properties using small, verifiable Python functions automatically generated by an LLM (e.g., enforcing markdown format, word length, structure). These are weighted based on LLM-estimated importance. The policy is trained with the GRPO algorithm, optimizing expected rewards with a KL regularization term relative to a reference model.\n\nThe authors evaluate their approach using Qwen2.5 (3B, 7B) and Llama3.1 models. They use 10K RL training samples constructed from a 100K instruction-following corpus. The baselines compared are SFT (10K & 100K), Random, BLEU-based, Reward Model (RM), Generative Reward Model (GRM), RLPR, and DPO. The benchmarks used are focused on open-ended generation: AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, IFEval, FollowBench, and other domains: MMLU (knowledge), ARC (reasoning), MATH (math), HumanEval (code).

It also demonstrates cross-domain robustness, integrates with math reasoning (RLVR), and maintains generation diversity."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- One major weakness is that RLVRR captures only rule-based content and style fidelity; it may miss deeper semantic or ethical nuances that require human judgment. For example, the \"content reward\" relies entirely on an LLM judge, which is responsible for extracting critical keywords from the reference responses (the paper claims these keywords capture the \"semantics\" of the reference). However, this does not truly capture semantics for reasoning tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH, OlympiadBench); it may only work for tasks like essay generation or plain natural language responses. For mathematical reasoning, adhering to certain tokens does not in any way ensure the generated response is correct, and there are no inherent discrepancies. The idea of extracting key points and then keywords is a reasonable abstraction, but it is unclear why it should improve performance on mathematical reasoning tasks. Furthermore, for these tasks, shouldn't the \"verifiable dots\" also be included in the reward? The final answer is at least as important as, if not more important than, adhering to key points or keywords.\n\n- For the style reward, the authors use an LLM to generate a Python verifier function that checks properties like answer length and markdown formatting. These rewards capture surface-level stylistic/formatting patterns rather than the semantic equivalence of the generated and reference responses. It is not clear how these align with tasks like Knowledge, Reasoning, or Math benchmarks. While such patterns may be useful for open-ended instruction-following tasks, they make little sense for Knowledge, Reasoning, or Math tasks.\n\n- The metrics used for the different benchmarks should be clearly defined, and more appropriate/fine-grained metrics for instruction-following should be considered. For example, \"length-controlled win rate\" or using \"GPT-4.1-mini as the evaluation judge\" are weak metrics for evaluating instruction following. They do not effectively capture how well the instruction is followed or, more importantly, whether the \"content\" and \"style\" of the generated responses are adequate."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5Hc2HiXY4u", "forum": "ZumVIktGbt", "replyto": "ZumVIktGbt", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8131/Reviewer_ExFE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8131/Reviewer_ExFE"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8131/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762285531146, "cdate": 1762285531146, "tmdate": 1762920103300, "mdate": 1762920103300, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
