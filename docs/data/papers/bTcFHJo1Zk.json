Namely, given the threat model of real-world deployment of LLM detectors, the recommended and generally adopted metric in the field is TPR @ fixed low FPR [1]. The use of accuracy and F1 scores is inconsistent with this threat model, making comparisons somewhat difficult, especially since more recent LLM detection methods, particularly zero-shot ones such as Binoculars and Fast DetectGPT, were optimized for TPR at a fixed low FPR, potentially sacrificing performance on other metrics. I strongly suggest that authors replicate at least some of their result tables with the relevant performance metrics, showing consistency with the rest of the field. \n- Autoencoder LLMs fine-tuned for detection are known to perform well and generalize well on the in-distribution training data, but demonstrate problematic FPR on the out-of-distribution texts [2].

We are very encouraged that our method is seen as **“a novel translation-based adversarial training framework”** (aEgz), whose training procedure is **“useful and enhance the effectiveness of MGT detectors”** and **“model-agnostic and can be used on existing detectors”** (9HJS), and that it **“combine several existing well-performing methods … in a non-trivial manner”** (CasE). We appreciate that our problem is recognized as **“a critical and timely subject” in low-resource LLM-generated text detection\"** (CasE), and that TASTE is viewed as **“enhancing robustness and cross-lingual generalization” with “significant improvements in F1 score”** (aEgz). We are also grateful for the positive comments on clarity and presentation, including **“exceptional clarity” of figures, “underlying assumptions are sound”, and “writing is accessible and easy to understand”**(S8Qh), as well as **“the manuscript and the underlying ideas are both overall excellent”** (CasE) and **“the motivation and logic of this paper is clear”**(9HJS).\n\nIn our rebuttal, we have carefully addressed every weakness (W) and question (Q):\n\n* **Reviewer 9HJS.**\n  We clarified that TASTE is explicitly designed for zero-shot low-resource languages and already outperforms all baselines on languages without dictionaries. We added a dictionary coverage study (10–100%) showing that even small/noisy dictionaries still bring substantial gains over the best baseline, and we conducted a human evaluation (3 annotators, 100 pairs, 3 dimensions) confirming that adversarial examples remain readable and coherent, with only moderate and expected degradation.\n\n* **Reviewer CasE.**\n  We clarified that the full implementation (code, requirements, documentation) has been in the supplementary material since before the review phase, and we will release code, datasets, and checkpoints on GitHub and Hugging Face upon acceptance. We added TPR@FPR=1% results on M4 (where TASTE achieves the best cross-lingual mean TPR) and TPR/FPR on SemEval-2024 (OOD) at the same thresholds, and we detailed the token→word mapping for dictionary substitution, how LAAL with gradient reversal suppresses language-specific cues, how performance degrades gracefully as dictionary errors increase, and the methodological differences from RADAR that explain TASTE’s stronger multilingual robustness.\n\n* **Reviewer S8Qh.**\n  We enriched the evaluation by reporting training cost (about 40 minutes for 3 epochs on a single RTX 4090) and adding a full inference-time comparison, showing that encoder-based detectors like TASTE have much lower latency than metric-based methods, which is crucial for deployment. We clarified fairness by noting that all adversarially trained methods (RADAR, GREATER-D, TASTE) share the same mBERT backbone and setup, and we showed that under deployment-relevant metrics (TPR@FPR=1%), zero-shot settings, and OOD robustness, TASTE achieves state-of-the-art average performance across languages and attacks. We summarized our existing loss and hyperparameter ablations (attack strength and dictionary quality) and explained our focus on encoder-only detectors (efficiency, calibration, stable thresholds), while pointing to LLM-based detectors as future work.\n\n* **Reviewer aEgz.**\n  We added extensive ablations on importance estimators, comparing attention-based, perturbation-based, and random variants against our gradient-based design on multilingual accuracy and attack success rate, and found that the gradient-based TASTE gives the best cross-lingual accuracy and lowest mean attack success. We linked the key hyperparameter controlling attack strength to our analysis in Section 6.1 on replacement ratio versus accuracy, robustness, and training time, highlighted that our robustness evaluation already includes strong phrase-level multilingual attacks (back-translation, paraphrasing) on 9 languages and 8 attacks where TASTE has the lowest average attack success rate, and quantified the cost of our co-evolution training (one attacker update and one detector update per batch, about 40 minutes on 10k samples with ~10 GB GPU). We also introduced experiments on pseudo-label noise (0/10/20% flips) and smaller surrogates (ALBERT-base-v2, Pythia-70M), showing that TASTE remains robust to realistic noise levels and does not rely on a large surrogate, and we examined training dynamics, with loss curves and a brief stability discussion to be added in the revised manuscript.\n\nWe again thank the AC and all reviewers for their constructive feedback, which has helped us substantially strengthen the paper. If you have any further questions or suggestions, we would be very happy to discuss them during the rebuttal period and will respond as promptly as possible."}}, "id": "b7kyt4nRBR", "forum": "bTcFHJo1Zk", "replyto": "bTcFHJo1Zk", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6562/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6562/Authors"], "number": 17, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6562/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763257692617, "cdate": 1763257692617, "tmdate": 1763257692617, "mdate": 1763257692617, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
