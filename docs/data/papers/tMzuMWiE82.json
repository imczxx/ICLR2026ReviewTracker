However, the principles and values that guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely unexamined. To address this, we introduce the {\\bf Social Welfare Function (SWF) Benchmark}, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing.

Are models meant to get higher on this? Is that really a good thing? Why can't a model be justified in prioritizing not fairness, efficiency, or the product of the two, but something else? I'm excited about benchmarks that tackle complex social topics like social welfare allocation, but I worry this is not the right framing. It may be better framed as a \"Tracker\". This also means I take issue with the terminology of \"welfare allocation skill\" since the models could be skilled but just not normatively aligned with the authors.\n2. It seems there are many idiosyncrasies of prompting that could be shaping these results (e.g., \"only the three most recent turns of history are retained as input\"). The contribution would be stronger if the ranking of models were shown to be robust to such details. For example, the authors could build alternative systems that get at the same fairness vs. efficiency trade-off and identify whether results are robust to that. I am not convinced by the paper that we are really finding out durable, interesting features of different models.\n3. I don't see why there is an \"Algorithm\" in this paper. It doesn't seem to contribute anything beyond restating the LLM decisions and scoring criteria. There is no sophisticated algorithm at play here, as far as I can tell.\n4.

Gini coefficients are not uniform, in that in some conditions reallocating a single task from an agent with more tasks to one with less has different marginal impacts than in other conditions. Mutiplying the two metrics together also ensures that the optimum will be a balance between the two metrics under most realistic conditions. (Relatedly, Figure 3 would be better with contours showing equal overall scores.)\n\n- There isn't a clear normative argument that higher scores on this benchmark are preferable. There exists a theoretical maximum possible score which is determined by the relative abilities of the model population (and it isnt' 1.0), but this is largely arbitrary and not the result of a principled stance. Since higher scores are not necessarily better, I question whether this is actually a benchmark. \n\n- The implied focus on a specific way of weighting the two sub-metrics isn't necessary for the task to be useful. I would rather have seen how well the LLM can execute on a given target Gini and efficiency, more similar to the prompting tests at the end. This alternative setup would allow humans to retain the moral agency of choosing how they prefer to balance these objectives rather than delegating that responsibility to the LLM.\n\nThere are experimental choices which don't seem helpful to the clarity of the paper:\n\n- What does the benchmark gain by using actual models and real tasks for the population rather than just having hidden probabilities of success? Clearly a lot of effort was put into scoring these tasks that doesn't add much informational value to the results.\n\nSome of the results are not well-supported by the evidence:\n\n- In line 349, a claim is made that top models balance their allocation between the two metrics. This is circular, since not doing so would mean they were not top models (as a result of the multiplicative headline score).\n\n- Paragraph 362-377 is not conclusive. To show this would require an experiment showing that the same result occurs when using different ELO scores for initial seeding.\n\n- Line 422 implies an empirical validation of a fairness/efficiency tradeoff that exists by construction and needs no empirical validation.\n\nThe related work is too broad and doesn't cover the actual related work. Paragraph 444-456 is way too broad and  lacks scientific evidence for claims such as \"richer forms of intelligence\". 458-469 is also too broad. There are existing works that evaluate the behaviour of LLMs in game theoretic settings which would be the appropriate comparison here such as https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4493398.\n\nThere are small details which are missing:\n- Lines 205-212 need citations.\n- How many repetitions were run? What are the error bars on these results?\n- It would be worth checking that there are not innate biases in choosing between the assigned LLM names.

The top 4 arena models (ranked 1 or 2) all achieve below 52 on efficiency which is significantly lower than the most efficient models. \n\n- The paper presents a lot of results in large tables but no summary statistics to draw conclusions from the data. For example, computing the correlation between Arena Score and SWF Score would allow the reader to much better understand the data. \n\n- The random strategy performs better in SWF than most models ,potentially indicating that this task isn’t well suited to LMs.\n\n- The choice of aggregating fairness and efficiency using a product seems somewhat arbitrary and the results seem like they would be highly dependent on the choice of aggregation. It would help to explain how the SWF metric connects to existing measures of social welfare or otherwise provide justification for the metric.\n\n- The paper includes no error bars or measures of variance on the aggregate values. For example, the average row in Table 2. This makes it difficult to gauge the statistical significance of the average values, which is especially important given that there is high variance across different models.\n\n- The paper investigates the fairness-efficiency relationship on just a single type of task, which limits the generality of several of the claims about LM behavior in general.

If so, do you know why the models perform so poorly? This worse than random performance makes me worried that the domain is too difficult for the models and not suitable for properly evaluating the fairness/efficiency tradeoff.\n\n- The results related to prompt sensitivity are interesting but also raise the concern that the results might not be generalizable across different settings. Do you think the results might change significantly if other parts of the problem setup were altered? Or if other parts of the prompts are changed?\n\n- Only the last 3 rounds of dialogue are kept in the experiments.

The long-horizon nature of the agents' trajectories offers realistic complexity for understanding agents actions over time instead of one-shot decisions and the systematic evaluation across 20 models provides substantial comparison points across model families and architectures. Clustering tasks that induce consistent performance across the agent group is also a clever technique for ensuring that the LLM allocator is actually faced with a dilemma, which is important to the environment.\n\nThe paper is easy to follow and the authors motivate their design decisions well. Despite the concerns I raise about the relevance of this somewhat toy setting to real-world human welfare allocation below, the task/environment captures a well-constructed and grounded decision making problem. Thus the authors findings in section 3.3 that conversational ability poorly predicts allocation competence is still interesting and informative as this suggests that the reasoning required for effective decision-making represents a distinct capability not captured by standard benchmarks. Similarly, the finding that top Arena heavily index on the initial labels of the agents' profile suggests that if allocation preferences are malleable behaviors that easily influenced by prompt engineering, we should be careful about deploying such systems in high-stakes contexts."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "My main concern is that the features of the environment fall short of capturing the nature of high-stakes settings that affect human welfare.

In light of this, the allocator's prioritization of group productivity and heavy indexing on the performance profiles of the agents seems unsurprising (and almost preferable)-- the fundamental incentive structure seems to only reward efficiency so its not clear why the models should be fair when this would only achieve spreading tasks evenly at the cost of performance but not really benefit the agent in some way.\n\nOverall, the current work presents an agent simulation environment that might be more useful for understanding AI-AI group dynamics than how models might impact real-world human welfare allocation."}, "questions": {"value": "In addition to the main weaknesses mentioned above, a few smaller questions/suggestions:\n- Are there any interpretable characteristics of the task flow clusters that emerged? \n- Fish et al., 2025 (EconEvals: Benchmarks and Litmus Tests for LLM Agents in Unknown Environments) seems related and it would be useful to understand this paper's contributions in comparison to it.\n- The output constraint experiments show models become \"more utilitarian\" when forced to reason briefly, but is it possible that justifying equitable distributions just requires more elaborate moral reasoning and thus more tokens, so only rather than revealing an inherent utilitarian bias in the models?\n- With the addition of more diverse tasks, like writing or social reasoning, maybe the current formulation of this study be used to understand how an allocator assigns tasks to agents with different strengths and capabilities (e.g. qwen for math vs llama for writing or language-related tasks) to ensure highest group benefit."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "vBNtJjNB4Y", "forum": "tMzuMWiE82", "replyto": "tMzuMWiE82", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24823/Reviewer_fw5Z"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24823/Reviewer_fw5Z"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24823/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762307392134, "cdate": 1762307392134, "tmdate": 1762943207652, "mdate": 1762943207652, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
