The failure of one or more sensors can severely degrade performance and is exacerbated by two fundamental and intertwined issues: the Representation Gap between heterogeneous sensor data and the Contamination Effect from low-quality modalities. In this paper, we propose Midas, a novel framework that tackles both root challenges simultaneously through a synergistic integration of meta-learning and knowledge diffusion. To mitigate the Contamination Effect, Midas employs a meta-learning-driven weighting mechanism that dynamically learns to down-weight the influence of noisy, low-contributing modalities. To bridge the Representation Gap, it introduces a diffusion-based knowledge distillation paradigm where an information-rich teacher, formed from all available modalities, refines the features of each student modality. Comprehensive experiments on the large-scale  MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets demonstrate that Midas achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving robustness in numerous missing-modality scenarios.

I personally find this unacceptable as different experimental setups may lead to unfair comparisons. While I am not able to examine the code from both papers in exhaustive detail and many settings are not clearly specified in the papers, I notice that the optimizer, learning rate, and training epochs appear to be different.\n    - Comparing Table 1 in X-Fi with Table 1 in this paper, the I and R modalities are missing. Why are these modality combinations not compared? If the proposed method is trained on only the D, L, and W modalities while the baseline methods are trained on all 5 modalities, this is clearly an unfair comparison.\n    \n2. The proposed method is merely wrapped in elaborate language without offering anything new:\n    - Meta-learning: This is essentially learning weighted averaging weights for modality features.\n    - Stochastic missing modalities training: This is simply modality dropout.\n    - Diffusion-based knowledge distillation: This just adds a diffusion model before feature alignment.\n\n    The first two are existing methods, and the last one's contribution is difficult to understand.

I believe Table 5's direct comparison between X-Fi's parameter count and the proposed method's model parameters is unreasonable, as they have completely different structures.

I am uncertain why the paper heavily emphasizes human sensing, and what unique challenges of human sensing are being addressed here.\n    \n5.
