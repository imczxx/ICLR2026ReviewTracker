To address this gap, we introduce MetaEvo, a novel framework that reframes agent evolution as a meta-optimization task. Instead of learning directly from experience, our core idea is to first enhance the agent’s intrinsic meta-ability—its capacity to learn how to effectively revise and improve itself. MetaEvo operationalizes this concept through a three-stage pipeline powered by a modular agent system. First, a meta-optimization stage explicitly trains the model on abstracting high-quality principles. These principles are then accumulated in a curated memory and subsequently retrieved by an execution module to guide generation on new tasks. Extensive experiments across a diverse suite of mathematical reasoning and multi-task benchmarks demonstrate that MetaEvo consistently and significantly improves model performance, enabling more robust and generalizable reasoning behaviors.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Agent System", "Meta-Optimization", "Continual Evolution", "Principle Abstraction"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0b40ed5be4468cb4a31e7391077f5c9985b29628.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a5d14dc925362f501e0929ff193e8dc81e48f43a.zip"}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
