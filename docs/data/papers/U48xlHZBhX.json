While Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) excel at producing statistically plausible signals, they often fail physiological validation due to neglecting the underlying causal mechanisms governing cardiovascular dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce CausalDiffusion, a novel Causality-Embedded DDPM that learns and embeds dynamic causal knowledge directly into the reverse diffusion process. One core of CausalDiffusion is to learn sample-specific causal graphs by dynamically weighting a static base graph, which is constructed offline by synergizing domain knowledge with causal structures discovered by the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm. These adaptive causal embeddings modulate the U-Net denoiser at multiple scales, transforming causal graphs into structured regularizers that constrain the generative pathways to physiologically plausible manifolds. On the challenging task of continuous blood pressure waveform generation from ECG and PPG inputs, CausalDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating remarkable robustness, particularly under arrhythmic conditions where pure data-driven models degrade. Furthermore, we showcase the framework's generality by applying it in the PPG-to-ECG synthesis task, where it achieves superior performance in generating complex waveform morphology. By synergizing the generative power of diffusion models with the rigor of causal reasoning, our work establishes a new paradigm for building reliable and interpretable generative models in biomedicine and beyond.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models; Causal Inference; Dynamic Causal Graph; Physiological Signal Synthesis"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7ce351d2c411d0c0e7cef79b49cfd2f34eb98d31.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes using causal graphs to guide the stable and physiologically meaningful generation of signals.

Reported AAMI compliant SBP and DBP errors strengthen the practical angle.\n- Ablation against a matched DDPM highlights the incremental value of causal conditioning, especially under arrhythmic patterns where out of distribution effects are stronger.\n- The methodology is mostly mathematically consistent, with correct conditioning of the reverse transition mean and an explicit accounting of dynamic graph weights in the GCN aggregation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The claimed causal component rests on applying FCI to a static, hand engineered feature matrix pooled across samples. This discards temporal directionality and potential lag structure that are central in cardiovascular dynamics. State of the art time series causal discovery methods, such as PCMCI+, DYNOTEARS, and related approaches, directly model lagged dependencies and invariances under interventions or environment changes. The paper should either justify FCI on static features or adopt a method designed for time series with latent confounding. [1, 2, 3]  \n- The preprocessing step that removes one variable from any highly correlated pair before FCI, to guarantee invertibility for partial correlations, is a strong heuristic. It risks eliminating truly causal yet redundant variables and it introduces selection induced correlations. At minimum, sensitivity analyses across the correlation threshold and across alternative CI tests are needed.  \n\n- The training objective mixes L2 and L1 losses on the noise prediction without discussing scale balancing beyond a scalar λ. Since the auxiliary loss supervises a component predictor that subsequently defines the graph embedding, any mismatch in loss scales can bias the effective conditioning. Please report the variance of the noise term across timesteps, and provide calibration of $\\lambda$ and $\\lambda_{L1}$ via validation curves or an uncertainty analysis.  \n- The reverse process uses fixed variances, standard in DDPM, but physiological signals have heteroscedastic noise. Reporting learned variance experiments or at least a justification for fixed variance would strengthen the claim that improvements stem from causal conditioning rather than a favorable noise schedule, for example the cosine schedule.  \n\n- The ablation contrasts CausalDiffusion against a plain DDPM. Given the pipeline has several coupled pieces, please ablate: i) prior only, G_prior, ii) data driven only, G_data, iii) base graph Abase without dynamic modulation, iv) dynamic modulation with shuffled G_prior edges, v) removal of the auxiliary physiological predictor, and vi) replacement of GCN with a simple MLP. Without these, it is hard to attribute gains to causal guidance rather than to additional representation capacity.  \n- The dynamic modulation matrix M is central but opaque. Provide qualitative analyses of Adynamic distributions and case studies contrasting healthy versus arrhythmic samples to show that domain plausible dependencies, for example PTT related edges, are up weighted when appropriate.  \n\n- Cross dataset generalization is not evaluated. Both tasks are trained and tested within MIMIC III derived splits or a single site arrhythmia cohort. A credible causal prior should help under dataset shifts. Evaluate on an external cohort or at least perform leave patient group out evaluations stratified by demographics, sensor type, or acquisition site.  \n- Uncertainty and calibration are missing. For clinical usability, report prediction intervals for SBP and DBP and coverage under the AAMI envelope, as well as calibration curves for HRV metrics and QRS detection. Compare against conformal baselines.\n- Some table entries appear inconsistent, for example Mamba on MIMIC III shows RMSE 5.16 and MAE 13.64, which violates MAE <= RMSE for non negative errors or suggests a unit mismatch. Please double check metric definitions and units, or explain if different normalizations were used.  \n- The proprietary arrhythmia dataset lacks details on labeling, patient selection, and signal pre processing decisions, for example zero padding to fixed length 500. Clarify whether padding artifacts influence evaluation windows and how beats are segmented. Provide inter rater or algorithmic quality control for arrhythmia annotations.  \n\n- The comparison set focuses on generic sequence models and DDPM. Recent causal generative modeling lines introduce explicit structural causal models, SCMs, or interventional controls within diffusion or likelihood based generators. The paper should position against these, even if tasks differ, and discuss whether CausalDiffusion supports counterfactual sampling or interventional queries. [4, 5, 6]\n- Physics informed and constraint based training is a large, adjacent literature. The paper could compare against stronger priors like differentiable simulators or hybrid PINN diffusion models rather than only regularizers in the loss. [7, 8]\n\n- Graph construction requires multiple hyperparameters, feature engineering choices, and statistical thresholds. A thorough appendix with exact feature lists per task, selection thresholds, CI test \\alpha, and the learned modulation architecture would substantially aid reproducibility. Some of this exists, but several key items are currently high level.  \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Runge J.
