Recent methods --- including forecasting error models, representation learning, augmentation, and weak-label learning --- have achieved strong results for specific anomaly types such as sudden point or gradual collective anomalies. While many prior works report window-level metrics that may mask errors, several recent methods evaluate at the point level as well. Our goal is to use a stricter point-wise protocol to make masking effects explicit. We introduce FREE (Free point-wise Anomaly Detection via fold-bifurcation), a framework that reframes detection as tracking a system’s proximity to a critical transition. FREE extracts stress signals from a forecasting model and integrates them with a fold-bifurcation inspired ODE to produce the risk state, flagging anomalies once it crosses a threshold calibrated on normal data. This requires no anomaly labels and detector training, enabling free and efficient detection. By modeling anomalies as stress accumulation toward a tipping point, FREE naturally aligns with point-wise detection, providing a unifying and interpretable perspective that complements type-specific methods. Experiments on 40 benchmarks against 34 state-of-the-art baselines show that FREE achieves competitive or superior performance, with particular strength under strict point-wise evaluation.", "tldr": "point-wise anomaly detection via fold-bifurcation", "keywords": ["time-series", "anomly detection"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/769a43ac89dff2ee5250d33fa9221edfd62f3db3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents FREE (Free point-wise Anomaly Detection via fold-bifurcation), a framework for time-series anomaly detection that targets strict point-wise evaluation rather than coarse window-level metrics.

Clear comparative plots would help, ideally accompanied by visualized uncertainty assessments to show reliability and confidence.\n\n4.Regarding thresholding, the confidence-interval analysis feels insufficient.

The author(s) say \"However, most approaches are evaluated under coarse window-level settings, which can mask their limitations in the stricter point-wise anomaly detection scenario.\" This is not entirely true. There are recent papers with multiple types of anomaly detection capabilities. Example include: [1], [2], and many more. \n2. The evaluation metric F1 score has been establised as a biased metric in recent literature [1]. Why does the author not use mathematically proven good metrics like VUS-PR defined in [1]?\n3. The evaluation should be done on well establised anomaly detection benchamarks such as in [1], and should be compared with recent SOTA methods on more datasets.\n4. Since the proposed method does patching, masking etc., what is the runtime complexity of the method? In terms for both theoretical and empirical evidence. Since anomaly detection is needed in realtime in most usecases, runtime is a very important factor.\n5. The authors say \"many real-world failures arise not from isolated spikes but from the gradual accumulation of stress that drives a system toward a critical transition.\" This is not true in several situation when external factors create anomalies, or even periodic anomalies. \n6.
