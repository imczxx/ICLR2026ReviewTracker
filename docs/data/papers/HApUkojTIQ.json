Typically, as new data becomes available, an existing solution must be updated to incorporate the latest information. In addition to seeking a high-quality solution for the task at hand, it is also crucial to ensure consistency by minimizing drastic changes from previous solutions. Applying this approach across many iterations, ensures that the solution evolves gradually and smoothly. \n\nIn this paper, we study the above problem in the context of clustering, specifically focusing on the k-center problem. More precisely, we study the following problem: Given a set of points X, parameters k and b, and a prior clustering solution H for X, our goal is to compute a new solution C for X, consisting of k centers, which minimizes the clustering cost while introducing at most b changes from H. We refer to this problem as label-consistent k-center, and we propose two constant-factor approximation algorithms for it. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods on real-world datasets.", "tldr": "We present a new notion of clustering consistency with applications to clustering evolving data, and we design methods with constant-factor approximation guarantees.", "keywords": ["Clustering", "$k$-center clustering", "approximation algorithms", "algorithmic robustness"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dea35aa36ab4be7e7ee4ab127d077ef1890d2666.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7e6d24a61a5f371a3a57dc20ea053fdf2b5233cc.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a new problem formulation in the context of k-center (or in general center-based) clustering, named label-consistent clustering.

The paper supposes an evolving pointset, akin to the fully dynamic setting. The task tries to minimize changes in the point assignments in the pointset $X_t$ given a solution $\\mathcal H$ of the pointset $X_{t-1}$ at time $t-1$ (e.g. see lines 50-57). However, in Definition 3, it seems like $\\mathcal H$ is already a solution for $X_t$. This might create some problems, as for example some points that were centers in $X_{t-1}$ might not be in in $X_t$. Therefore, $\\mathcal H$ might not be a subset of $X$. Would the definition still be valid? And would the algorithms still work?\n- Theorem 1 is hardly a contribution, as it follows directly from the hardness of k-Center. \n- Issues with the presentation of the algorithms:\n    - In Section 4.2, the authors should explain that they take all distances, sort them and binary search the correct value for $ r^* $, as right now, for anyone outside the clustering community, it would be really hard to understand how the algorithm would have access to $ r^* $ without reading the appendix.\n    - In line 7 of Algorithm 1, points are taken from $H \\setminus C$, but $C$ should be empty. Should it be $H \\setminus C_0$?\n    - At first sight, it seems like $b$ is never used in the algorithm, which is puzzling. In fact, $b$ seems to be used to check if the solution is feasible when looking for the correct value of $r^*$. This should be explained clearly.\n- The paper has a superficial literature review, and there seems to me some missing related work:\n    - The paper only briefly discusses the literature on consistent clustering, which tries to control recourse. [Lattanzi and Vassilvitskii, 2017], [Lacki et al, 2024] and [Forster and Skarlatos, 2025] are cited, but not discussed in detail. The authors should clearly explain the differences between previous work and label-consistent clustering. [1] also deals with recourse, but was not cited.  \n    - Consistent or low-recourse algorithms have been proposed for problems other than clustering, but have not been discussed. E.g. see [2], [3] and references therein. \n    - The paper does not discuss dynamic k-center algorithms (e.g. [4], [5], [6]), even though this framework seems to be the main motivation for this paper.\n- There is no indication whether the gap between the lower bound of 2 and the upper bound of 3 can be closed with an algorithm that is polynomial time (i.e. not FPT) or not. Such a lower bound or a 2-approximation algorithm would have made the contribution much stronger. This is of course a *minor* weakness, I understand that achieving this might be really hard.  \n\n----\nReferences:\n\n- [1] Fichtenberger et al. Consistent k-Clustering for General Metrics.

They present a $2$ approximation (to the best possible $k$-center clustering under these constraints) running in FPT time in the number of centers, and a $3$ approximation running in polynomial time. They also extend their algorithms to generally work with evolving data by using the output of the previous time step as the historical solution to the current time step. Both their algorithms start by assuming they know the radius of an optimal label-consistent clustering, $r^*$, since they can obtain it by binary searching for the best value.\n\nTheir first contribution is an algorithm OverCover that gives a $2$ approximation. The algorithm works by guessing the set of centers in $H$ that do not change in a new optimal solution, called $H^*$, then uses the classic algorithm of Hochbaum and Shmoys on the remaining unclustered data to obtain a $2$ approximation. The guessing of centers causes the blow up in the terms that depend on $k$.\n\nTheir second contribution is a $3$-approximation algorithm that runs in polynomial time. In the first phase, the algorithm runs the classic algorithm above to obtain a set of centers. In the next phase, each center in this set is swapped with a center from its own cluster that is also a historical center. The historical center with the highest weight is chosen, which is the number of points currently within an $r^*$ radius of the center that also used to belong to its cluster in $H$. Finally, historical centers are added in decreasing order of their weights until the current solution reaches $k$ centers.\n\nThey also extend existing lower bounds to show that label-consistent $k$-center is NP hard to approximate within a less than 2 factor, and also W[2]-hard to approximate to the same factor when parameterized in the number of centers.\n\nFinally, they evaluate slightly modified versions of their algorithms against the classical one by Hochbaum and Shmoys, the FFT algorithm that iteratively searches for the farthest point to explore, and the algorithm by Ahmadian et al. for resilient clustering.\n\nSummary recommendation: I would weakly recommend rejecting the paper due to the above-mentioned doubts. Specifically, I do not immediately get the motivation for defining the model in this way as well, which, if the authors could talk about in their rebuttal, would be useful for situating their contributions more in context. The theoretical part and the experimental part also have coherent messages separately, but I could not see if the algorithms implemented had any of the guarantees that were proven earlier.

Another, which I've personally seen more of, is to ask that the algorithm maintains a good approximation to the overall best solution, but with low recourse. In the latter setting, the guarantee is measured with respect to all clusterings instead of just the ones within swap distance $b$ of the current clustering. Is there a reason for choosing the former (which also gives guarantees with respect to really bad historical clusterings) here? Are they equivalent in some way? Is there a reason for considering the setting where the algorithm might get bad historical solutions that it did not come up with but was given to it as a warm start? Are there bounds that say that any algorithm that maintains a close-to-optimal solution must have high recourse necessarily?\n- The first algorithm requires iterating over all possible $H^*$s which is very costly and not part of the implemented version of the algorithm, which makes it practically infeasible.
