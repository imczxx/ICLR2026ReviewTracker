My detailed concerns are outlined below."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **Scope of the “entire robotics stack.”** The claim of covering the “entire robotics stack” is an overstatement. The library primarily targets robot learning for manipulation tasks and omits major subfields such as SLAM, sim-to-real transfer, and broader perception and control systems. The authors should moderate this claim to accurately reflect the covered scope.\n2. **Ambiguity in “explicit” vs. “implicit” models.** The terminology used to distinguish explicit and implicit models is confusing. The paper conflates learning-based methods with implicit models, whereas both explicit (e.g., flow models) and implicit (e.g., energy-based) formulations exist in machine learning. Clarifying what each abstraction encompasses, and specifying how methods that explicitly model the world or action distributions (with or without data) fit into this taxonomy, would improve clarity.\n3. **Clarity on compounding errors.** The paper states that classical, modular methods (labeled as explicit models) suffer from compounding errors, but so do monolithic, data-driven policies (labeled as implicit models). It is unclear how the monolithic networks mitigates this issue. The authors should clarify whether their choice genuinely addresses compounding errors or simply shifts where they occur.\n4. **Definition of middleware.** The role and scope of “middleware” are not clearly defined. A brief explanation in the main text of what components or functionalities are included under this term would improve clarity for readers.\n5. **Language and grammar issues.** The paper would benefit from a grammar and spell check. Some (nit-pick) examples include:\n    - “aboard robots” → “onboard robots” (more standard usage)\n    - “parallely to low-level control” → “in parallel with low-level control loops”\n    - “the the” → “the”\n    - “coexistance” → “coexistence”\n6. **Reproducibility of supported methods.** It is unclear whether the methods implemented in *LeRobot* reproduce the results reported in the original papers? If not, how large is the gap? Providing a clear mapping (e.g., method X on benchmark Y) and where to verify such reproduction within the repository would help assess reliability of the implemented algorithms.\n7. **Extensibility and community contribution.** Including brief documentation or a section describing how to add new robots, learning methods, and simulation environments would make the framework more approachable for community contributors.\n8. **Future directions.** A short discussion on planned extensions—such as supporting additional teleoperation devices, robot types, and learning methods—would help situate the library’s development trajectory.

It addresses a very pervasive and relevant problem of a typically fragmented robotics stack, for which having simple and unified tooling would greatly enhance productivity and rampup time for beginners. It has various subcomponents that address different parts of the stack: hardware integration, local and streaming datasets in a shared format, async inference for action chunking based models, RL and IL constructs, simulation integrations etc. All of these together are an excellent starting point for someone looking to conduct research and development on low-cost readily available robots in a non-production setting.\n\nOn balance, I am slightly leaning towards accepting the paper as it would provide a reference to people using the tooling to conduct research and for publications. However, I do feel that the core functionality of the library has several avenues for improvement (some iterative and others fundamental)."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "- This is clearly a significant contribution that will help a lot of additional people easily take up robotics and experiment on well-integrated low cost robots. Someone who would previously have been blocked on a part of a complicated stack can use the abstracted tooling of the library to get started quicker and with lesser frustration.\n\n- The library supports a lot of popular models and algorithms that have been shown to work on real robots in a variety of settings.\n\n- The library contains support for asynchronous inference (i.e. that used in modern models that use action chunking and related methods). The functionality to use a hybrid cloud-robot inference is also very useful.\n\n- The dataset tooling seems very useful, especially the structure which helps handle larger scale datasets with millions of trajectories.\n\n- I find it positive that the paper explicitly lists the limitations of the library. This is absolutely understandable since it is in active development."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- While the overall library seems excellent as a starting point for someone learning about robotics or who wants to get started with minimal friction with a toy problem, it seems pretty raw for something like production usage. The parallel I would like to draw here is of pytorch, which was suited for both simplicity and production robustness.\n\n- Local porting of large datasets seems very slow compared to what should be possible. E.g. 7+ days of processing time for DROID should be able to be sped up significantly by better parallel processing and systems engineering.\n\n- I feel like LeRobot overindexes on what is ‘popular’ in the current robotics/ML types of models and algorithms (e.g. RL and imitation learning), but lacks some essential functionality that a user would likely need to resort to a third party library for. An example of this is optimized motion planners or IK solvers that could run in either real or simulation environments, which could give ground truth data to train particular e2e models.\n\n- Simulation is often a critical component of end-to-end robot learning. I would have liked to see additional support for additional simulation frameworks (e.g. IsaacSim or Genesis). This to me, would abstract away a lot of the friction a typical user needs to undergo to setup the simulation environment itself. Note: MetaWorld and Libero seem impractical for a lot of real world tasks compared to something more comprehensive.\n\n- A crucial element of deploying robotic systems in the real world is a robust safety layer. In my opinion, the deployment portion of the library should treat safety as the most important principle and contain abstractions that allow for this to be realized (e.g. add protective stops based on certain criteria). While these are typically also implemented in the firmware of the robot itself (e.g. as protective stops or estops), having an added layer on top that can focus on the specific logical safety considerations would be helpful when directly coupled with (for example) the RobotClient / PolicyServer\n\n- (not relevant to the assessment of the paper) It was impossible to not know where the work came from, given that the library is already very popular in the online robotics/ML community."}, "questions": {"value": "- Do you have any detailed benchmarks for the throughput of LeRobotDataset and StreamingLeRobotDataset as opposed to something like MCAP?\n\n- Do you plan to add GELLO teleop support?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "9HqELpQxVQ", "forum": "CiZMMAFQR3", "replyto": "CiZMMAFQR3", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22004/Reviewer_5MwV"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22004/Reviewer_5MwV"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22004/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762157051252, "cdate": 1762157051252, "tmdate": 1762942014129, "mdate": 1762942014129, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
