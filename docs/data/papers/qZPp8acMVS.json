Conventional caching methods reuse features across timesteps to reduce computation, but introduce approximation errors that accumulate during denoising—a problem exacerbated under large sampling intervals where significant feature variations amplify errors. Recent prediction-based approaches (e.g., TaylorSeers) improve efficiency but remain limited by sensitivity to feature variations across distant timesteps and the inherent truncation errors of Taylor expansions.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel **C**urvature-**A**ware **R**esidual **P**rediction (CARP) framework, which shifts the prediction target from raw features to residual updates within Diffusion Transformer blocks.  We observe that residuals exhibit more stable and predictable dynamics over time compared to raw features, making them better suited for extrapolation. Our approach employs a rational function-based predictor, whose theoretical superiority over polynomial approximations is rigorously established: the numerator performs linear extrapolation using adjacent features, while the denominator incorporates discrete curvature to adaptively modulate the strength and behavior of the prediction. This design effectively captures the alternation between gradual refinements and abrupt transitions in diffusion denoising trajectories. Additionally, we introduce a curvature-guided gating mechanism that regulates the use of predicted values, enhancing robustness under large sampling steps. Extensive experiments on FLUX, DiT-XL/2, and Wan2.1 demonstrate our method's effectiveness. For instance, at 20 denoising steps, we achieve up to 2.88× speedup on FLUX, 1.46× on DiT-XL/2, and 1.72× on Wan2.1, while maintaining high quality across FID, CLIP, Aesthetic, and VBench metrics, significantly outperforming existing feature caching methods. In user studies on FLUX, CARP receives nearly 25\\% more preference than the second-best method. These results underscore the advantages of residual-targeted prediction combined with a rational function-based extrapolator for efficient, training-free acceleration of diffusion models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Generative Models"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/310e71c3c1f41395ffa0b3ceae2cc90c7061615d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the CARP: a training-free, curvature-aware residual prediction scheme that ensures theoretical superiority over current prediction-based methods and reuse-based acceleration methods by shifting the prediction target from raw features to residual updates within the Diffusion Transformer Blocks.

Limited evaluation scope and lack of scaling/generalization evidence.\n\nThe evaluation focuses exclusively on three Diffusion Transformer architectures (FLUX, DiT-XL/2, and Wan 2.1), each tested only under a 20-step denoising schedule. However, the curvature-aware predictor’s stability and error behavior could change under longer sampling horizons (e.g., 50 steps or 100 steps), where residual trajectories evolve more gradually but accumulate error differently. Assessing CARP’s performance across multiple step settings would provide stronger evidence of its robustness.\n\nMoreover, although CARP claims to be architecture-agnostic, all experiments are conducted on Transformer-based diffusion models. It remains unclear how well the curvature-aware residual prediction generalizes to UNet-based diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) or EDM, where spatial convolutional dependencies differ substantially from DiT’s attention-driven dynamics.
