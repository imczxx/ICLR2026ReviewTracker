This is the first result showing that alternation improves over the simultaneous counterpart of GDA in the constrained setting.\n    For games without an interior equilibrium, we show an $O(1/T)$ local convergence rate with a constant stepsize that is independent of any game-specific constants. \n    In a more general setting, we develop a performance estimation programming (PEP) framework to jointly optimize the AltGDA stepsize along with its worst-case convergence rate. \n    The PEP results indicate that AltGDA may achieve an $O(1/T)$ convergence rate for a finite horizon $T$, whereas its simultaneous counterpart appears limited to an $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate.", "tldr": "We show O(1/T) convergence rates of alternating gradient descent-ascent in bilinear two-player zero-sum games, with an interior Nash equilibrium or in a local region", "keywords": ["Two-player zero-sum games", "Alternating gradient descent-ascent", "Performance estimation programming"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3931a11c3bc64395e1b16ca287dfef0b112a92a8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/110507e63a141cf341428d388fc12bca885d5032.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies the problem of the average convergence rate of online gradient descent-ascent in bilinear zero-sum games.

Specifically, the global $O(1/T)$ theorem (interior NE $(x,y)$) requires a stepsize scaled by $\\min( \\min_i x_i, \\min_j y_j )$, which are unknown in practice and may be extremely small. No adaptive rule is provided that attains the same rate without such knowledge.  \n- In addition, if the interior NE is near the boundary, the admissible constant stepsize can be impractically tiny. There is no quantification of worst-case constants or a detection-and-retuning mechanism, and this will also leads to a bad convergence guarantee.\n- The other concern is that the global analysis relies on the existence of an interior NE. When no interior NE exists, the same energy monotonicity fails; the paper does not provide an in-process diagnostic to decide which regime one is in.\n- For the second result with local convergence rate, while the learning rate now is not dependent on $\\min( \\min_i x_i, \\min_j y_j )$, this requires the initial point to be close to an NE, with the distance also dependent on these problem-dependent constants."}, "questions": {"value": "- Is there an adaptive stepsize rule (e.g., backtracking based on duality-gap trends or energy-surrogate monotonicity) that achieves the same $O(1/T)$ rate when an interior NE exists, without using $\\min\\{\\min_i x_i^*, \\min_j y_j^*\\}$ a priori?  \n- I wonder whether there is some way to detect the existence of an interior NE in an online fashion.
