Our method couples a discrete diffusion process for sequences with an $SE(3)$-equivariant diffusion for rigid-frame translations and rotations over all-atom coordinates. The architecture supports flexible conditioning,\nand is further enhanced at inference via lightweight RL techniques that optimize task-aligned rewards. \nAcross de novo RNA design as well as complex and protein-conditioned design tasks, our approach yields high self-consistency and confidence scores, improving over recent diffusion/flow baselines trained from scratch. Results demonstrate that leveraging pre-trained structural priors within a joint diffusion framework is a powerful paradigm for RNA design under data scarcity, enabling high-fidelity generation of standalone RNAs and functional RNA–protein interfaces.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["RNA design", "Diffusion models", "Generative models"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c2971be5ca85c7d4d27c3025cd51c6d4dcdc4993.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a novel joint RNA sequence and structure denoising model that integrates the RoseTTAFold2NA structural prediction network as the denoiser within a generative diffusion framework.

The primary evaluation relies heavily on self-consistency metrics (scTM, scRMSD, sc-lDDT), which measure the agreement between the generated structure and the structure predicted from the generated sequence.

The work employs highly complex, high-dimensional inputs (full protein sequence and backbone coordinates) as conditioning signals injected directly into the main backbone. Unlike simpler conditioning approaches, the efficacy of using such complex conditioning without dedicated analysis is questionable. A deeper justification or ablation is needed to validate that this complex, integrated injection mechanism is superior to simpler or more modular conditioning strategies."}, "questions": {"value": "The content in this section is identical to the points raised in Weaknesses.
