Popular PIML approaches, including neural operators, physics-informed neural networks, and neural ordinary differential equations, are typically fit to objectives that simultaneously include both data and physical constraints. However, the multi-objective nature of this approach creates ambiguity in the measurement of model quality. This is related to a poor understanding of epistemic uncertainty, and it can lead to surprising failure modes, even when existing metrics suggest strong fits. Working within a Gaussian process regression framework, we introduce the Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE) score. Bypassing the ambiguities of test losses, the PILE score is a single, uncertainty-aware metric that provides a selection principle for hyperparameters of a physics-informed model. We show that PILE minimization yields excellent choices for a wide variety of model parameters, including kernel bandwidth, least squares regularization weights, and even kernel function selection. We also show that, prior to data acquisition, a special data-free case of the PILE score identifies a-priori kernel choices that are \"well adapted\" to a given PDE. Beyond the kernel setting, we anticipate that the PILE score can be extended to PIML at large, and we outline approaches to do so.", "tldr": "We derive a single objective criterion for physics-informed machine learning that can be optimised to ensure both a strong fit to data and adherence to a differential equation.", "keywords": ["physics informed", "gaussian process", "model selection", "uncertainty quantification"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/289394d7048a25e247ffd0b32d2b64f4129e0439.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f24c9f1a6acb1be4d2c44a4311aa0e3448ebba4e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces the Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE), a novel, uncertainty-aware model selection criterion for Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML).
