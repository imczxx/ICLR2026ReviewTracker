By adaptively training a surrogate guardrail, our method achieves high-fidelity replication of the victim guardrail’s behavior. To systematically evaluate this attack, we construct a legal–moral question–answering dataset designed to measure rule-reversal performance. Extensive experiments across two benchmark datasets and three commercial LLM systems, including ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen, demonstrate that GRA achieves a rule-matching rate exceeding 0.92 while requiring less than $85 in API costs.

The vulnerability they exploit—information leakage through black-box input-output queries—is a well-established problem in machine learning security. The actual contribution is demonstrating that existing vulnerabilities apply to guardrail components and developing a specific attack method (GRA) for this context, not discovering a fundamentally new vulnerability class. This overclaim weakens the paper's credibility, as the novelty lies in the exploitation technique rather than in identifying previously unknown security risks.\n\n- the authors use 3 metrics to show GRA's performance, but I do not understand there metric can reflect it. Measuring behavioral similarity between surrogate and victim outputs—similar behavior does not definitively prove that the underlying rules or decision logic have been extracted, only that the surrogate mimics observable patterns.\n\n- The paper's threat model and attack methodology only address output-side guardrails that filter LLM-generated responses, while completely ignoring input-side guardrails that block or sanitize user prompts before they reach the LLM. Real-world commercial systems may employ dual-layer protection with both input prompt filtering and output response filtering.\n\n- There are two gaps leaves the central premise—that guardrail extraction poses \"significant security risks\"—as an unproven assertion rather than an empirically validated conclusion:\n    1. The paper demonstrates that guardrails can be reverse-engineered but critically fails to show the practical exploitation consequences. The authors do not provide evidence of responsible disclosure to the commercial providers and get acknowledgment that this constitutes a genuine security vulnerability \n    2.

You claim to introduce a \"new class of vulnerabilities\" in guardrails, but model extraction attacks exploiting observable input-output behavior have been studied.

Would it be more accurate to frame your contribution as \"the first systematic application of model extraction attacks to guardrail components\" rather than discovering new vulnerabilities?\n3. Your evaluation relies on behavioral similarity metrics. However, similar outputs don't necessarily mean you've extracted the underlying rules or decision logic—it could just mean you've trained a model that happens to make similar predictions. How do you validate that you've actually reverse-engineered the guardrail's policy rules rather than just creating a behavioral mimic?\n4: In a true reverse-engineering validation, one would compare extracted rules against ground truth. Since you don't have access to the actual guardrail rules, what evidence supports that your surrogate has captured the underlying policy versus merely overfitting to observable patterns?\n5. Your threat model only addresses output-side guardrails (filtering LLM responses), but commercial systems likely employ input-side guardrails that block malicious prompts before they reach the LLM. Why is input filtering completely absent from your methodology and evaluation?\n6. Can your GRA method be extended to extract input-side guardrails, and if so, how would the methodology differ?\n7. Did you conduct responsible disclosure by reporting your findings to OpenAI (ChatGPT), DeepSeek, and Qwen3 before publication? If so, did they acknowledge this as a legitimate security vulnerability?\n8. You demonstrate guardrail extraction but don't show how this enables attacks.

This assertion appears unsubstantiated. The field of LLM reverse-engineering, particularly \"Prompt Stealing\" or \"Prompt Extraction,\" is already well-researched (see citation below). Prompt stealing is, in essence, a form of reverse-engineering attack targeting system instructions or guardrails.\n\nThe critical flaw of this paper is its complete failure to compare the proposed attack with these known prompt-stealing techniques. The authors must clearly articulate how their work fundamentally differs from this prior SOTA. If a guardrail is essentially a form of \"prompt,\" what is the advantage of the proposed method over existing attacks? This lack of comparison significantly diminishes the paper's contribution and novelty.\n\nUnconvincing Evaluation Metrics:\nThe paper claims to use a \"comprehensive set of seven metrics\" to evaluate attack effectiveness. However, a closer inspection reveals that they \"are just different metrics on a classification task\" (e.g., success rate, precision, recall, etc.).\n\nFor a reverse-engineering task, especially one involving the recovery of natural language rules or prompts, such simple classification metrics are \"too easy\" and far from sufficient. For example, does a \"failed\" attack recover partial information about the guardrail? How semantically close is the content recovered from a \"successful\" attack to the original guardrail?\n\nThe authors are severely lacking more meaningful evaluation metrics, such as \"text similarity\" (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore, or other embedding-based similarity calculations), to measure the proximity between the recovered guardrail (text) and the ground-truth guardrail (text).
