However, their black box nature limits their use in critical areas like drug discovery. Moreover, existing explainability methods often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or substructures due to the message-passing dynamics, which entangle local representations with information from the entire graph. As a remedy, we propose SEAL (Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), an interpretable GNN that divides the molecular graph into chemically meaningful fragments and limits information flow between them. As a result, contributions of individual substructures reflect the true influence of chemical fragments on prediction. Experiments on both synthetic and real molecular benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL consistently outperforms existing methods and produces explanations that chemists judge to be more intuitive and trustworthy.", "tldr": "We introduce an interpretable graph neural network for molecular property prediction that decomposes predictions into sum of fragment contributions.", "keywords": ["interpretability", "graph neural networks", "molecular property prediction", "message passing neural networks"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fb2aba24f966af4d4074c02a739d9ede68636024.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/377c3de5c11f126761a41c731a1df4091f9f2ec9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper aims to build an interpretable GNN model that quantifies the contribution of chemically meaningful fragments, ensuring that the explanations better align with domain knowledge.

The results are clearly presented through figures and tables.\n\n3.\tA user study is included to examine the differences between human understanding and graph explanation techniques, providing an interesting perspective and direction for future research."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited novelty. The paper lacks significant novelty. Explaining graphs at the fragment level and using message-passing schemes have been studied in several prior works [1–4]. The proposed method does not appear to introduce a new concept or contribution beyond these approaches.\n\n2. Questionable methodological claim. The authors claim that “a final embedding of each node reflects not only its own properties but also the cumulative properties of distant atoms.” However, Section 3.2 adopts a similar approach to existing methods, making this claim of methodological uniqueness questionable.\n\n3. Lack of detailed explanations. Some statements lack sufficient detail, making the paper difficult to follow. For example, in Line 95, the authors state that in both Cao et al. (2024) and Wang et al. (2025), fragments may contain significant signals from other parts of the molecule, thereby reducing local interpretability. However, the proposed method still allows information flow between fragments, so the distinction between approaches is not clearly explained. Similarly, in Line 105, the authors claim that Wu et al. (2023) use the BRICS method for fragment-level explanations; however, that method is not included in the comparisons.\n\n4. Unclear selection of baselines. The choice of baseline models is questionable. HiGNN is primarily designed for property prediction, yet it is used here for an explanation task. The authors do not compare their method with other interpretable GNN models but instead focus on post-hoc methods and a property prediction model, limiting the fairness of the evaluation.\n\n5. Simplistic evaluation and overly strong results. The model assumes linear independence in the final step (Section 3.1) and aggregates via summation. The evaluation tasks appear overly simple: in Table 4 (AUROC) and Table 5 (F1), the classification models achieve scores of 1.0 or very close to it. This raises concerns about potential data leakage or task simplicity and whether the proposed method can generalize to more complex benchmarks [5].\n\n6. Unsupported statements. Some claims lack experimental or theoretical justification. For instance, in Line 155, the authors state that “the lack of bias would cause an equal distribution of contributions across all fragments, diminishing interpretability.” It is unclear how the label distribution affects this behavior or why the absence of $b$ would reduce interpretability.\n\n7. Inconsistent or unclear visualizations. Several visualizations conflict with or are difficult to reconcile with the fragment decomposition method. For example, in the right panel of Figure 1, it is unclear how the shown functional groups are derived from the decomposition process. Similar issues appear in other figures as well.\n\n8. Questionable benchmark selection. The chosen benchmarks are not well justified. The synthetic dataset, B-XAIC, is not a widely recognized benchmark. For real-world datasets, explanation datasets such as Mutagenicity are available but not used. The rationale for benchmark selection and fairness of comparison should be clarified.\n\n9. Minor errors and missing details.There are some minor issues in the manuscript. For instance, in Line 256, “Hierarchical GNN” should be “HiGNN.” Some figures lack column labels or sufficient annotation of important nodes or subgraphs in the appendix.\n\n10. Inconsistent interpretation granularity. While the paper claims to provide fragment-level explanations, it also proposes atom-level explanations. In some cases, the atom-level model (SEALAtom) performs better than the fragment-level model (SEAL), which raises concerns about the claimed benefits of fragment-level reasoning.\n\n\n1, Yu, Z. and Gao, H., 2024.

Only three real-world datasets are used for more robust assessment, limiting generalizability. There exist many other datasets which are not used in this work. For instance, in the paper of HiGNN (Zhu et al., 2022) there are 11 real world datasets and none of them is investigated in this paper.\n\nA big part of the evaluation checks alignment with ground-truth substructures but does not verify faithfulness with respect to the model’s decision process, which is instead done only with 2 datasets. An explanation should first be evaluated for the faithfulness using standard metrics (Fidelity, Inv Fidelity): if a model learns a spurious bias, the correct explanation should reflect that bias. Only after confirming model alignment, comparisons to chemical ground truth are meaningful. Let me cite Agarwal et al, 2023: \"trained GNN model may only capture one or an entirely different rationale. In such cases, evaluating the explanation output by a state-of-the-art method using the ground-truth explanation is incorrect because the underlying GNN model does not rely on that ground-truth explanation. In addition, even if a unique ground-truth explanation generates the correct class label, the GNN model trained on the data could be a weak predictor using an entirely different rationale for prediction. Therefore, the ground-truth explanation cannot be used to assess post hoc explanations of such models.\"\n\nFragment extraction is presented as a generalizable mechanism, but the experiments rely exclusively on pre-defined methods (BRICS), which fail to pinpoint atomic-level contributions (e.g., Boron atom in Figure 4), and do not capture long-range interactions crucial for complex properties.\n\nBenchmarking against relevant self-explainable GNNs (GNAN, GIB, VIB, PiGNN, KerGNN) is scarce as only one method is used as comparison, weakening the claims of superiority or novelty in interpretability.\n\nComparison to leading molecular property predictors (e.g., Grover, MultiChem, HyperMol) is absent.\n\nThe user study is incorrectly posed and totally useless, as the question asks which part of the molecule is thought to better impact the solubility. However, the quality of explanations should be primarily checked against the model. The user cannot know whether the highlighted part is truly the one impacting the model’s prediction. Additionally, no information is provided on the number and specialty of the study participants. The reviewer would assume that they are chemists. However, it is obvious that a chemist would be biased toward using functional groups, as that is exactly how they reason, but there are no other methods among the techniques that actually use fragments."}, "questions": {"value": "Can the authors address why evaluation against other self-explaining GNN methods was omitted?\n\nCan the authors address why other real world datasets were omitted?\n\nWhy wasn't fidelity calculated on B-XAIC datasets?\n\nHow do the authors ensure that user studies accurately evaluate faithfulness of explanation with respect to the model (rather than human chemistry bias), and provide more details about study participants?\n\nWhy do the authors only do Figure 6 on Fidelity with 30% of masking?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "73Bn3PhtWx", "forum": "I2wq6fFSef", "replyto": "I2wq6fFSef", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21080/Reviewer_onw9"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21080/Reviewer_onw9"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21080/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761563856692, "cdate": 1761563856692, "tmdate": 1763000000126, "mdate": 1763000000126, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper propose a new algorithm called SEAL that identifies fragments in molecule and constraints message passing architecture.
