This article focus on the generalization theory and sensitive frequency decoupling topic which is a hard and unsolvable question right now given one plane measurements. One Plane measurements is also widely used in real experiments and in practical it has wide use.\nAsymmetry  tiny verfication test will be attached in appendix shortly, which can prove the generability of the architecture. Of course, for asymmetry, we need to remove the force symmetry component \n\n6.**Successfully bridging the 1--3 → 4--9 gap** IT requires architectures that can explicitly reason about variable cardinality and combinatorial structure, rather than hoping standard networks will interpolate/extrapolate from purely data-driven patterns.\nThis article discuss from math and physic aspects creating a physics-informed neural network architecture that performs significantly better than other traditional methods."}}, "id": "4j5L3d9y8T", "forum": "jS3EKPSaAR", "replyto": "jS3EKPSaAR", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15167/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15167/Authors"], "number": 12, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15167/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763106695315, "cdate": 1763106695315, "tmdate": 1763184847745, "mdate": 1763184847745, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
