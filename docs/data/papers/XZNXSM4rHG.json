MRMR contains 1,502 queries spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements. First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise, enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries and documents are constructed as image–text interleaved sequences. Unlike earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in more realistic and challenging scenarios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multimodal Retrieval Benchmark", "Reasoning", "Multimodal LLMs"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/102573dedcacd446a6b01c1578848c0c1f154973.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a multimodal retrieval benchmark with an emphasis on reasoning-intensive retrieval across 23 domains.\nIn the proposed benchmark, the authors introduce three distinct types of retrieval tasks -- knowledge retrieval, theorem retrieval, and contradiction retrieval.\nThe paper evaluates various multimodal retrieval setups (e.g., text-only, two-stream, multimodal, and document-as-image models) covering several frontier models on the MRMR benchmark.

In the overall design of the benchmark, the authors separated documents by discipline for the experiments. However, creating a large database by mixing documents from all disciplines and performing retrieval might present a more challenging setting. This cross-disciplinary retrieval scenario could provide an even more difficult test for the models.\n\n3. The authors discuss retrieval within specific disciplines, which is an interesting topic, but they have not addressed cross-disciplinary retrieval.

In contrasting this work with existing MMIR benchmarks, some key contributions of MRMR (also pointed out by the authors) include: (1) multi-disciplinary expert-level questions (most benchmarks focus on the general knowledge of Wikipedia), (2) reasoning-focus with more complex IR instructions (most benchmarks focus on semantic matching or text IR/QA), and (3) image-text interleaving in queries and data (most MM benchmarks are VQA-focused with a single image). \n\nFor each question type {Knowledge, Theorem, Contradiction}, the authors first describe their method for selecting questions, collecting/validating positive and hard negative results, and adding a background set of reasonable negative examples to construct the corpus.

To begin with, even if I am being a bit pedantic, these technically aren't all contradictions (e.g., Figure 1 vehicle design is 'non-compliance'). Also, in looking through the specific cases, 'negation' is a bit contrived (albeit shown to perform poorly in the empirical results) and I can think of other cases and possibly a general hierarchy of \"matching a description that isn't there\". Basically, it is somewhat preliminary and likely deserves its own study.\n- The dataset is high-quality, but relatively small as compared to other related datasets in Table 1.
