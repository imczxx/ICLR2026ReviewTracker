Solutions would have major implications for security, verification, interpretability, and understanding biological networks. The key challenges are the massive parameter space, and complex non-linear relationships between neurons. We resolve these challenges using two insights. First, we observe that almost all networks used in practice are produced by random initialization and first order optimization, an inductive bias that drastically reduces the practical parameter space. Second, we present a novel query generation algorithm that produces maximally informative samples, letting us untangle the non-linear relationships efficiently.

However, I have many concerns with this paper as follows:\n\n### Presentation weaknesses\n\n1. Underwhelming presentation: I find the writing of this paper to be underwhelming, if not poor. For example:\n\n  - Introduction: the authors should spend a separate paragraph, if not a section, elaborating their contribution. Besides, the storytelling in the introduction is also not well-written. \n  - Results: right after the introduction, the authors go directly to demonstrating this result. This is a very weird flow, at least for me. The authors should at least: (1) have a formal problem setting, (2) state the assumption clearly and concisely, and compare with prior works about the setting. Then the author can go to their methodology, and then the results. \n  - Methods: the method section is even mentioned AFTER the results section, making it very hard to keep track. I need to know what the authors are trying to do, what new insight/methodology the authors are proposing, before even looking at the results.\n\n2. Many critical typos: apart from the presentation, I do not think that the author did a good job of screening the typos of this paper. For example, Tables 4 and 5 have a clear format error, though they are critical components of this paper. \n\n### Technical weaknesses\n1. Missing key components: the number of population $p$, which is a key component of their method, is mentioned NOWHERE in the paper. Without such information, it is very hard to evaluate the computational efficiency of this method. Besides, to make the sampling scheme of the proposed method to work reasonably, $p$ should be reasonably high. However, I assume that it would make the method very computationally inefficient, increasing at least $p$ times compared to using a single student.\n\n2. The experiments are small-scale.\n\n3. The results are not promising:\n  - High error with even small models: even for small models, the error rate can be of 430,200% (for CNN) and 517,200% (for RNN) (see Tables 4, 5). This is very upsetting. \n  - Highly unreliable: In the Limitation, the authors mentioned that the success rate is about two-thirds of the time. This is another critical weakness that cannot be treated as a \"normal limitation\". At least, the authors have to have some scheme to detect failure WITHOUT accessing the true model. If not, the proposed method will be very weak, and the reported results will also be unreliable. \n\nThese are the most critical issues of this paper that I can detect. Due to the reasons above, I unfortunately have to recommend a strong rejection of this draft. I recommend that the authors make multiple passes through this draft, make it at least look reasonable, and send it to their colleagues for cross-reviewing before even trying to submit this draft to any other conference."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "jdldX37Sgk", "forum": "eOYuPJjyKB", "replyto": "eOYuPJjyKB", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21753/Reviewer_hac2"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21753/Reviewer_hac2"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21753/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761864834406, "cdate": 1761864834406, "tmdate": 1762941919092, "mdate": 1762941919092, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a method for exactly reconstructing the full parameters of a neural network, given its architecture, initialization and optimization method, using only query access.
