Originality: This paper tackles an underexplored issue in LLM RL. The proposed PODS framework and max-variance down-sampling criterion represent an interesting aspect of efficiency optimization. This work distincts from existing prompt-selection or gradient-accumulation approaches. The idea of selective subset section is conceptually simple and original.\n2.

The experiments are comprehensive, spanning different model sizes, datasets, and hardware setups.\n3. Clarity: The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The motivation for the problem is clearly illustrated. The presentation of algorithms and visual comparisons are well-structured. \n4. Significance: The work addresses a bottleneck in scaling reinforcement learning for LLMs, reducing memory and communication overhead during policy updates. Given the rising computational costs in reasoning-focused RL for LLMs, the proposed method is timely and practically impactful. This framework can be integrated with other RL variants, increasing its potential influence and relevance for large-scale LLM training."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. LImited scope empirical validation. As mentioned in the limitation section, the evaluation is conducted on mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH) with rule-based reward models. These tasks have well-defined, verifiable rewards, which may overstate the benefits of the method. The paper would be significantly strengthened by including results on other multiple tasks where reward distributions are noisier and less binary.\n2. Dependence on single baseline RLVR algorithm. Although the method is claimed to be algorithm-agnostic, all experiments and analyses are built around GRPO. It remains unclear whether the same variance-based selection criterion would hold for other RL frameworks.  Demonstrating adaptability across multiple RL algorithms would make the contribution more convincing.\n3. Lack of deeper theoretical justification of learning dynamics. The paper provides a sound combinatorial analysis for max-variance selection but does not connect this formally to expected policy improvement or gradient variance reduction. Without a theoretical link between rollout diversity and learning efficiency, the variance criterion, while intuitive, remains heuristic.\n4. Limited discussion of potential trade-offs: While the paper reports 1.7×–3× speedups, it provides little detail about wall-clock breakdowns (e.g., inference vs. update time) or the communication cost savings. Furthermore, potential drawbacks such as off-policy bias or degradation of gradient fidelity with extreme down-sampling ratios are acknowledged but not empirically investigated.\n5. Meanwhile, the LLM used in this paper is simply 3B and 7B, of which the inference time consumption and training time is fair. However for larger LLMs, the inference time and training time increase significantly. The time complexity of subset selection, nlogn, is not that important, especially for rollout number of 64 and subset size 16. The reduction of average training seconds per training step is mainly caused by the reduction of training data. Therefore, the time complexity of this subset selection is fair theoretically but limited in actual training."}, "questions": {"value": "1. The evaluation focuses exclusively on GSM8K and MATH which have verifiable and relatively noise-free rewards. Can the authors discuss any preliminary evidence or theoretical reasoning suggesting that the max-variance down-sampling rule remains effective under noisy or sparse reward distributions?\n2. While PODS is described as algorithm-agnostic, could the authors explain what modifications, if any, would be required to adapt PODS to reinforce++ or to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) setups? Please provide one of the demonstration results.\n3. Since PODS alters the effective training distribution by selective sampling, does this introduce off-policy bias relative to standard on-policy GRPO?\n4. Have the authors considered or tested any correction mechanisms (e.g., importance weighting) to mitigate this potential bias? A short theoretical justification or empirical comparison could help assess the trade-off between efficiency and policy fidelity.\n5. The proposed max-variance rule is intuitive and empirically effective, but the paper does not formally connect it to expected policy improvement. Could the authors provide analytical or empirical arguments showing that higher reward variance indeed correlates with more informative gradients or faster convergence in GRPO-like updates?\n6. The paper reports wall-clock speedups, but it would be helpful to see a breakdown of inference time, policy-update time, subset data selection time, especially in distributed setups.\n7.

The authors propose PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling): for each prompt, generate a large pool of rollouts, score them with the verifiable reward, and then select only a small, most informative subset for the policy update. The key technical piece is a max-variance selection rule: choose the size-𝑚 subset whose rewards have the largest variance, which they show always corresponds to “take some of the lowest and some of the highest” rollouts; this yields an efficient $O(nlogn)$ algorithm. Plugged into GRPO, PODS achieves 1.7×–3× faster wall-clock to the same or better accuracy on GSM8K/MATH and across Qwen2.5 and Llama 3.2 models, on both single-GPU (LoRA) and multi-GPU (full-param) setups."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Mild off-policy effect not deeply analyzed. By selecting only a subset of generated samples, the method introduces some off-policy bias relative to pure on-policy GRPO. In practice it seems fine (results look good), but the paper could say more about stability under very aggressive down-sampling (e.g. keeping 2 out of 64).\n3. Assumes you can cheaply over-generate. The whole story relies on the common RLVR setup where generation is the easy part. In settings where inference is also bottlenecked (long contexts, tools, multi-turn), the benefit may shrink.\n4.
