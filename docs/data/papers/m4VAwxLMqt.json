In this paper, we present **SafeRBench**, *the first benchmark that assesses LRM safety end-to-end—from inputs and intermediate reasoning to final outputs*: (i) ***Input Characterization:*** We pioneer the incorporation of risk categories and levels into input design, explicitly accounting for affected groups and severity, and thereby establish a balanced prompt suite reflecting diverse harm gradients. (ii) ***Fine-Grained Output Analysis:*** We introduce a micro-thought chunking mechanism to segment long reasoning traces into semantically coherent units, enabling fine-grained evaluation across ten safety dimensions. (iii) ***Human Safety Alignment:*** We validate LLM-based evaluations against human annotations specifically designed to capture safety judgments. Evaluations on 19 LRMs demonstrate that SafeRBench enables detailed, multidimensional safety assessment, offering insights into risks and protective mechanisms from multiple perspectives.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Safety", "Large Reasoning Model", "Benchmark", "Evaluation"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/37a44d4f1c13a7961cf421d891f508821f7f1f5c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a benchmark SafeRBench that assesses large reasoning models safety from inputs, and intermediate reasoning to outputs. through structured input characterization, micro-thought chunking for fine-grained analysis, and human-aligned safety evaluation"}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "Existing benchmarks have many limitations.

One of the main claims of novelty is that this work evaluates reasoning trace safety. However, based on this paper, it's unclear why it's insufficient to evaluate the input + output without reasoning traces. It would strengthen the paper if the authors could provide quantification of how much reasoning traces matter. For example, use an LLM judge to evaluate how safe (input + output) is vs. (input + reasoning trace + output).\n\n2. Some of the evaluation metrics need justification and clarification.

SafetyBench seems to be the same. Many existing benchmarks label risk categories on inputs and not outputs, such as WildGuard, AIR-Bench, etc. This contradicts the claim that input risk categories is a novelty of the current work.\n\n4. fig. 2: it's a stretch to call a low-medium-high scale a spectrum, when it only adds an intermediate level to binary categorization. nvidia/Aegis-AI-Content-Safety-Dataset-1.0 contains labels categorized into safe, needs caution, and unsafe (with specific risk category). this is similar to the stratified risk levels of the present work, which undermines the claimed novelty\n\n5. fig. 3: please find alternative ways to illustrate the evaluation results.
