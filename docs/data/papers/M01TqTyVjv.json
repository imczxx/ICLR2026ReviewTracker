Effective diet recommendations must jointly consider user profiles, eating history, health conditions, and food nutritional and quality data. Current methods are flawed, often focusing on limited factors, suggesting unhealthy or unpalatable foods, or proposing micronutrient-rich foods unsuitable for certain health conditions. The core challenge is managing the heterogeneous, hierarchical, and complex interconnected nature of dietary data, including diverse profiles and meals with intricate nutritional interactions beyond the capability of previous approaches. We introduce PanaCea, a hypergraph neural network framework that integrates authoritative nutrient composition databases, large-scale population dietary intake data, electronic health records, and food healthfulness scoring systems to provide personalized and health-aware food recommendations. Evaluation in NHANES, a nationally representative dietary survey, demonstrates our framework's ability to effectively balance recommendation relevance with nutritional safety, achieving superior performance on ranking metrics and novel nutrition-focused measures. PanaCea provides a comprehensive framework for clinically informed dietary recommendations that can be adapted to various health conditions and datasets, offering practical potential to support healthier eating behaviors across diverse populations while maintaining individual personalization.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Nutrition Informatics; Health-Aware Recommendation; Hypergraph Learning; Multimodal Fusion"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b7839cffda85bbdcd98e0fba956939e51191f629.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes PanaCea, a clinical hypergraph framework for personalized and health-aware diet recommendation. Unlike traditional recommenders that treat foods as independent items, PanaCea models each meal as a hyperedge connecting a patient, the meal context (type, time, location), and multiple co-consumed foods. The system integrates three authoritative datasets—NHANES dietary and health records, FNDDS nutrient composition, and Food Compass healthfulness scores—to create clinically grounded patient and food profiles. The framework operates in two stages: (1) a hypergraph-based multi-task retrieval module that aligns patient preferences, clinical similarity, and meal completion signals, and (2) a nutrition-aware re-ranking stage that applies patient-specific safety constraints (e.g., sodium, sugar, glycemic risks). Evaluated on NHANES, PanaCea outperforms collaborative filtering and graph-based baselines on both ranking metrics and nutrition-focused measures, improving constraint satisfaction rates from 61% to 74%.

The experimental gains of HGNN over LightGCN (Table 2) provide clear evidence for the value of this higher-order structural information.\n- The framework does not just filter by clinical rules post-hoc; it injects clinical awareness directly into the learning process. The multi-task objective's clinical alignment task ($\\mathcal{L}_{pl}$) and the \"patients-like-me\" kNN prior (Eq. 8) are intelligent ways to force the embedding space to respect clinical similarity. The reported negative correlation ($\\rho = -0.329$) between embedding similarity and clinical distance is strong evidence that this alignment is successful.\n- The fusion of three distinct, large-scale, and authoritative datasets (NHANES, FNDDS, Food Compass 2.0) is a massive data engineering effort that provides an unprecedentedly rich foundation for this problem. This is a significant contribution to the community, especially with the promise to release the processing pipelines.\n- The introduction of nutrition-centric indices like Constraint Satisfaction Rate (CSR) and Mean Fractional Constraint Satisfaction (MFCS) is essential for evaluating this task.

The LINeR re-ranking stage, while effective, is the least-developed part of the paper. It is described as a non-trained module that applies \"diabetes-focused continuous penalty\" $c_{dm}(u,f)$.

More explanation or illustrative examples are needed to clarify how these hyperparameters were defined and validated.\n- The current design seems hard-coded for diabetes. It is unclear how the system would handle patients with complex, comorbid conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, which impose different or even conflicting nutritional constraints (e.g., on protein, sodium, or potassium intake). In practice, diabetic patients often have multiple co-existing conditions. A truly “clinically-aware” framework should generalize beyond a single disease—ideally by learning a re-ranking policy rather than relying on hand-crafted penalties for each condition.\n\n2. The framework is evaluated on over 20 years of NHANES data, which should result in an extremely large hypergraph. However, the paper omits fundamental statistics such as the number of patients ($|\\mathcal{U}|$), foods ($|\\mathcal{F}|$), and meal hyperedges ($|\\mathcal{E}|$). There is also no discussion of computational complexity, training time, or inference latency. In particular, the “patients-like-me” kNN prior (Eq. 8) could pose a significant inference bottleneck. Furthermore, key statistics of the three datasets and descriptive hypergraph properties are missing, limiting reproducibility and scalability assessment.\n\n3. The paper repeatedly mentions the importance of context (meal type, time, location). Figure 3 even shows a \"Context Node\".
