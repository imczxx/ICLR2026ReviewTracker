To address this, this work introduces a new class of neural fields designed for coherent wave-based phenomena, called neural Gaussian radio fields (nGRF), which combines the efficiency of explicit primitive-based representations with a novel differentiable operator. nGRF replaces view-dependent, computer graphics-centric rasterization with direct, complex-valued aggregation in 3D space that natively models wave superposition and interference. Consequently, this reframes the learning objective from a function-fitting task to a well-posed source-recovery problem. In evaluations, nGRF demonstrates superior performance across diverse environments. In indoor scenarios, it achieves 10.9 dB higher prediction SNR than state-of-the-art methods while reducing inference latency from 242 ms to 1.1 ms (a 220$\\times$ speedup). For large-scale outdoor environments where existing approaches fail, nGRF achieves an SNR of 26.2 dB. Furthermore, the proposed method reduces the required measurement density by 18$\\times$ (0.011 vs. 0.2-178.1 measurements/ft$^3$) and cuts the training time from hours to minutes (a 180$\\times$ reduction), enabling rapid adaptation to dynamic environments.

Channel Rendering**\n- It's somewhat unclear on why the channels are rendered in the manner proposed (Sec. 3.3). Specific points below.\n- The spatial weighting $w_i$ term appears to upweigh contributions of gaussian \"virtual transmitters\" when $p_{rx}$ is close to the gaussian $\\mu_i$. This seems intuitive, but however appears to overlook cases when there are obstructions. Specifically, for two equidistant rx locations (one with LOS and another with NLOS), it appears that weights would be similar.\n- A related concern is the 3DGS equivalent notion of \"depth compositing\". If a surface (I suspect another gaussian) is in between the rx and tx, the formulation of how this gaussian attentuates the channel is not discussed.\n- Furthermore, $w_i$ appears to only be a function of the receiver position, not the transmitter. Assuming reciprocity, wouldn't the weight be influenced similarly by a change of tx position?\n\n**2. Analysis: Learnt Gaussians**\n- While the overall quantitative results are promising, I find one particular analysis missing: distribution/insights of the gaussians learnt. On the vision/graphics side, this is fairly easy to intuit, that Gaussians primarily lie on surfaces of objects. However, in the RF setting, it's less clear what these represent. Are they representing the \"surface\" of an object, or virtual transmitters, or both?\n- Further more, are variations of gaussian contributions smooth wrt locations of rx? \n- My overall concern is overfitting: that the parameters are learnt in a manner that is not \"physically consistent\" (e.g., phantom gaussians out of bounds of the scene) and leading to degenerate solutions.\n\n**3. NLOS performance**\n- From Eq. 3, I see that LOS and NLOS fields are learnt separately. This is a fair assumption if we know the geometry of the environment. However, this does not seem to be an assumption and makes me wonder how LOS/NLOS are determined in practice? \n- Additionally, with evaluation, going by the description in Appendix B., it appears that uniformly sampling rx locations would over-represent LOS rx locations. I request the authors to clarify how dominant are LOS rx locations (which can admit very easy solutions and does not test model's ability to generalize).\n\n**4. Real-world evaluation**\n- The paper is solely evaluated in synthetic scenarios. While I believe this has its own merits and good for the most part (allows more controlled evaluation), it would be interesting to see some real-world validation. \n- One suggestion would be the DICHASUS dataset, which has been used in other works for evaluating RF models. \n\n**5. (Minor) Directivity**\n- Directivity of the antenna is not considered. This is a major factor in RF propagation.\n\n**6. (Minor) Frequency Generalization**\n- While the paper presents initial findings on frequency generalization, it appears to support it using a single qualitative example (Fig. 3b). I suggest a slightly more rigorous evaluation by quantitatvely including a reasonable size of examples."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the section above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "X6MUyiGEIW", "forum": "0izu8IWJ5z", "replyto": "0izu8IWJ5z", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24268/Reviewer_kWx8"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24268/Reviewer_kWx8"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24268/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762017511010, "cdate": 1762017511010, "tmdate": 1762943024926, "mdate": 1762943024926, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
