We present DiffWind, a physics-informed differentiable framework that unifies wind–object interaction modeling, video-based reconstruction, and forward simulation. Specifically, we represent wind as a grid-based physical field and objects as particle systems derived from 3D Gaussian Splatting, with their interaction modeled by the Material Point Method (MPM). To recover wind-driven object dynamics, we introduce a reconstruction framework that jointly optimizes the spatio–temporal wind force field and object motion through differentiable rendering and simulation. To ensure physical validity, we incorporate the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) as a physics-informed constraint, enforcing compliance with fluid dynamics laws. Beyond reconstruction, our method naturally supports forward simulation under novel wind conditions and enable new applications such as wind retargeting. We further introduce WD-Objects, a dataset of synthetic and real-world wind-driven scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior dynamic scene modeling approaches in both reconstruction accuracy and simulation fidelity, opening a new avenue for video-based wind–object interaction modeling.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Physics-based Modeling", "3D Dynamics", "System Identification", "Differentiable Physics"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bb01b270f2fba1175c4cf9dfb1caa527a3400a2a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ad1bda13c23812493aaedf38f378fd8d4faea980.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces **DiffWind**, a physics-informed generative framework that reconstructs and simulates **hidden wind fields** from **multi-view videos** of wind-driven objects.  \nThe core idea is to jointly optimize the **latent wind field** and the **object motion** under physical constraints.  \nDiffWind represents wind using an **Eulerian grid** and objects using **Lagrangian particles**, coupled via the **Material Point Method (MPM)** for differentiable wind–object interaction.  \nThe method further enforces **fluid dynamics consistency** through a loss derived from the **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)**, ensuring physically plausible flow.  \n\nThe authors also construct a new dataset (**WD-Objects**) containing both synthetic and real scenes of deformable objects driven by wind.  \nExperiments show that DiffWind achieves high-quality 3D reconstruction, realistic forward simulation, and plausible “wind relocation” (transferring estimated wind fields to new objects or scenes).  \n\nOverall, this is a technically strong paper with detailed derivations — good job by the authors."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 4}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "- **Novel problem formulation:** One of the first attempts to jointly reconstruct *hidden wind fields* and *object dynamics* from visual observations, bridging 3D reconstruction, differentiable physics, and generative modeling.  \n- **Strong technical depth:** The coupling of the Eulerian grid (wind) and Lagrangian particles (objects) via MPM is elegant and physically grounded.
