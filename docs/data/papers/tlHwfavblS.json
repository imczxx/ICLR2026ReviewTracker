In this work, unlike spectral relaxations that embed permutations into an orthogonal space and often result in inaccuracies, we maintain the problem in its original combinatorial form. By shifting the affinity spectrum to ensure positive semidefiniteness, we cast the trace‐maximization over partial permutations as a convex‐in‐P formulation. Our minorization-maximization scheme then replaces this with a sequence of exact linear‐assignment subproblems, the row-/column-sum constraints of which are totally unimodular, guaranteeing integral solutions with no rounding. This direct, combinatorial approach delivers a monotonic objective ascent, convergence to a KKT point, and achieves superior accuracy, cycle consistency, and runtime on image-matching benchmarks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["combinatorial optimization", "minorization-maximization scheme", "partial multi-matching", "permutation synchronization"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1d0e42f03829d810bbeeb355c37dbdacc03a22c8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b184922a8b7a1bcc8116b34721b1debddd1c88c3.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper addresses the multi-graph matching problem, focusing on how to exploit cycle consistency to refine a set of reasonably good pairwise initial matchings.

Early work on this problem motivated by applications in cryo-EM and computer vision, seeks to take permutations (which give feature correspondences between a pair of images) and \"synchronize\" them globally which means that cycle consistency (i -> j -> i) is preserved. Initial approaches were spectral relaxations but more powerful methods have been developed. The approach described here argues to stay in the combinatorial setting. It first convexifies the trace obj and then solves a sequence of linear subproblems. The constraints for these subproblems involve a matrix that is totally unimodular. So integral solutions (similar to max-flow/min-cut setting) are guaranteed - at least for every iteration. This gives monotonic convergence to a KKT point.

The analysis is relatively easy to follow. No major claims, basically monotonic progress to KKT. The experimental analysis shows that it works well and runtime etc are competitive.

But for a well studied problem, a strong technical result would include analysis of approximation ratio (under some assumptions) or convergence rate etc. This paper gives neither.

The experiment results are a little underwhelming. Yes it does cover some of the datasets in those original papers. But the paper should do more to convince the modern ML community that the problem is worth studying and the experiments enable important downstream applications. In its current form, I'm afraid that the results in the narrow scoping shows benefits but broadly, it does not make a strong case for which modern use cases will benefit. For example feature matching across views is now handled by much more sophisticated features/models. Is permutation synchronization still a valid issue there?"}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Cycle consistency is either fulfilled or not, so you cannot be superior here and fulfill it more.\n- The experimental evaluation is repetitive and tedious. I would like to have all results in one table, with best and second best results highlighted. Right now there is a lot of repetitive text that just repeats the results from the tables. Add the ETH3D results to the main part but have an average over all four subproblems. Improve the tables (highlight whether higher or lower is better).\n\nConceptual:\n- A lot of space is taken up by the total unimodularity of (8). I think it is just another variant of the linear assignment problem, so one could have derived exactness from that without the more involved proving TU (which also is almost exactly like the proof of unimodularity for the linear assignment problem anyway).\n- I am not sure about the projection approach to solving (8). First of all, it can be reformulated to be a linear assignment problem and offloaded to a combinatorial algorithm. Second, for first order methods I think the Sinkhorn Knopp Algorithm is state of the art.\n\nExperimental:\n- I think reporting the objective from (8) is the most important metric, since it directly measures the algorithm's performance. Other metrics like F-score, inlier ratio etc. take into account learning aspects that are outside the bounds of what the algorithm does.\n- The experiments only convey an aspect of the potential performance. The proposed approach only does permutation synchronization, while other approaches can optimize w.r.t. arbitrary costs and can additionally incorporate quadratic terms that will typically result in better solutions. As such, while I believe that the proposed method can be better on pure permutation synchronization, this is less important when one can run other solvers like the one from Kahl et al on arbitrary linear and quadratic costs.\n- Relatively few problems are considered.
