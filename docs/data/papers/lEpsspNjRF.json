While recent generative models have improved by incorporating the geometry of protein pockets, they still overlook the biochemical functional interactions between proteins and ligands. Crucial interactions include hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and $\\pi-\\pi$ stacking, which are essential for binding affinity and structural stability. This oversight leads to strained, high-energy ligands that may geometrically fit but functionally misalign with the binding site. To bridge the gap, we introduce a Functionally Grounded Molecule Generation Network (FGMOL) that operates in a unified structure-function alignment framework, enabling molecular generation to align with protein-ligand interactions, extending beyond mere geometric fitting. Our design of \\method introduces: (1) Interaction-Aware Embedding, which annotates protein atoms with explicit interaction types and feed them into SE(3)-equivariant neural networks; (2) Interaction-Informed Motif Alignment, which leverages differentiable clustering and Sinkhorn matching to align protein-ligand functional motifs; and (3) Interaction-Guided Generation with Bayesian Flow Network, which jointly models ligand coordinates and atom types via Bayesian updates in continuous space, conditioned on protein-guided cross-attention.

The authors do not adequately differentiate their method from these existing methods.\n\nSeveral aspects of the design of FGMOL are questionable:\n-  It seems to me that interaction-aware features should be considered not only for the protein but also for the ligand.\n- You state that you are also clustering ligand atoms based on similar interaction semantics, but that is not possible if you do not have interaction-aware features for ligands.\n- Binding motifs could consist of interactions of multiple types, but FGMOL restricts clusters to groups of atoms with similar interaction semantics.\n\nFGMOL lacks technical novelty since it îs largely a combination of existing methods, I.e. BFNs, SE(3)-equivariant NNs, the clustering method of Yang et al., 2018, the sampling approach of Qu et al., 2024.\n\nThe authors claim their cross-attention mechanism promotes \"synthetically feasible\" structures, but provide no evidence for this. The SA scores in Table 1 show only marginal improvements (0.70 vs 0.69 for MolCRAFT). They should benchmark using computational retrosynthesis tools like AiZynthFinder to actually demonstrate synthesizability. See Gao et al. (2024) \"Reframing structure-based drug design model evaluation via metrics correlated to practical needs\" for relevant discussion.\n\nIt is well known that docking scores and interaction counts correlate with molecular size - larger molecules naturally form more contacts and get better scores. The authors report improved Vina scores and interaction counts (Figure 3b-d, Figure 4) but do not control for molecule size. Without normalizing for molecule size, we do not know whether the docking score improvements are real or just due to generating larger molecules."}, "questions": {"value": "1) What are the commonalities and the differences between FGMOL and Diff and FLOWR?\n\n2) Do you really use interaction-aware features only for the protein?

DiffSBDD, DiffBP, VoxelBind, and GraphBP should be considered as references for assessing context-conditioned ligand generation. Without such baselines, it is unclear whether the proposed method outperforms or even matches these diffusion-based models on the same functional benchmarks. I strongly recommend evaluating on CBGBench, with more metrics against DiffSBDD/DiffBP.\n\n- Weak Figure and Visual Presentation\n\nFigure 2 is very difficult to interpret. The text is tiny, the schematic elements are disproportionately spaced, and large blank areas make it visually unbalanced. Readers cannot easily infer the data flow, diffusion/BFN steps, or conditioning mechanism from this figure. Given that this figure is central to the method, poor readability significantly undermines the perceived maturity and polish of the paper. I recommend redrawing it with consistent color coding for protein vs. ligand vs. latent variables, readable font (>8 pt in print), clear annotation of the process.\n\n- Ambiguity in Feature Construction and Generation Consistency\n\nThe description of interaction embeddings is unclear. You mention that interaction types are represented as one-hot encodings and embedded as input features, but in most docking/complex datasets, such embeddings are computed by external software (e.g., PLIP or PyRosetta) — which requires both the protein and the ligand structures as input. \nThat raises several questions:\n\t 1) During generation, the ligand does not yet exist — so what interaction embedding is used as input to the model?\n\t 2) If the embedding is a learned latent variable, how is it initialized or constrained?\n\t3) Is there a post-generation validation step that checks whether the predicted interactions correspond to physically meaningful patterns (H-bonds, π–π stacking, salt bridges, etc.)?\n\nIn previous work such as CBGBench, generated structures were re-scored using molecular interaction software to verify whether the distribution of recovered interactions matched experimental distributions. This paper does not include such an analysis, making it difficult to claim that the model indeed preserves functional interaction types or site-specific contact statistics. Or providing more visualization on certain diseases' targets to show that the generated molecules keep the preferred functional interactions of protein pockets."}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "4Lt21tdqkW", "forum": "lEpsspNjRF", "replyto": "lEpsspNjRF", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3031/Reviewer_2Zp9"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3031/Reviewer_2Zp9"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3031/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762008427300, "cdate": 1762008427300, "tmdate": 1762916507722, "mdate": 1762916507722, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
