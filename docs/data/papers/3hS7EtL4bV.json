We propose PGRF-Net, a novel architecture designed to achieve state-of-the-art performance while providing actionable diagnostic insights. At its core, PGRF-Net uses a Multi-Faceted Evidence Extractor that combines prototype learning with the discovery of dynamic relational structures between variables. This extractor generates four distinct types of anomaly evidence: predictive deviation, structural changes in learned variable dependencies, contextual deviation from normal-behavior prototypes, and the magnitude of localized spike events. This evidence is then processed by an Adaptive Evidence Fusion Network, which learns to weigh each source via data-driven gating. PGRF-Net is trained via a two-stage unsupervised strategy for robust extractor learning and subsequent fusion tuning. Extensive experiments on five widely-used public MTSAD benchmarks demonstrate its superior detection performance. Crucially, by decomposing the final anomaly score into these four evidence types, our model facilitates diagnostic analysis, offering a practical step towards more transparent MTSAD.", "tldr": "PGRF-Net: A 2-stage unsupervised MTSAD model.

The stated objective is to close the gap between high detection performance and diagnostic transparency by decomposing an anomaly score into four interpretable “evidence” channels: (i) predictive deviation, (ii) structural deviation in learned inter-variable dependencies, (iii) contextual deviation from normal-behavior prototypes, and (iv) localized spike magnitude. Methodologically, the model has two stages: a Multi-Faceted Evidence Extractor and a Gated Evidence Fusion Network that learns instance-dependent weights for the non-predictive channels and combines them with prediction error. Training is fully unsupervised, with Stage-1 losses for prediction and prototype/graph regularization, and Stage-2 losses for gate suppression on pseudo-normal samples plus entropy sharpening. Experiments on five public benchmarks (MSL, SMAP, PSM, SMD, SWaT) report state-of-the-art average F1 and competitive AUC-ROC/PR, along with qualitative “five-panel” diagnostic visualizations linking anomaly attributions to changes in relational masks."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- A clear diagnostic framing of MTSAD that operationalizes interpretability via four disjoint evidence channels and a gated fusion mechanism. This goes beyond post-hoc explanations by making attribution a first-class training target.\n\n- The two-stage training is well-motivated: learn robust features and prototypes first; then calibrate evidence attribution with gate suppression on pseudo-normal samples and entropy sharpening for selectivity.\n\n- Sensible regularization of the structural channel (sparsity, acyclicity, temporal stability vs. a baseline mask) reduces degenerate graphs and contributes to stable, interpretable dependency patterns.\n\n- The paper asserts “competitive or superior” performance; averaged F1 and AUC-PR are high, but per-dataset AUC-ROC/PR tables show mixed margins and sometimes narrow differences. Statistical significance (e.g., paired tests across seeds) and variance bars are not reported; claims of superiority would be stronger with formal significance tests."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The structural deviation relies on a learned baseline mask (M_base) defined via Early-training averages on presumed normal data. If the normal set contains regime shifts or drifting dependencies, M_base may encode mixture regimes; deviations may then over- or under-fire. The paper does not quantify how sensitive S_struct is to mis-specified normal baselines, distribution shift, or domain drift within normal periods.\n\n- The acyclicity constraint is imposed on structural prototypes so that convex combinations remain DAG-like. However, instantaneous correlations in cyber-physical systems can be cyclic (feedback loops). For domains with known cycles, forcing DAGs may bias the learned mask and redirect anomaly mass to other channels, potentially mis-attributing structural anomalies as contextual or predictive deviations.\n\n- The use of point adjustment and best-F1 thresholding is conventional, but can inflate event-level detection and mask temporal localization quality. While AUCs are reported, there is no comparison on strict point-wise metrics.\n\n- The interpretability story is qualitative. The paper would benefit from quantitative interpretability metrics (fidelity, stability, human-utility studies) or counterfactual tests (e.g., perturb relationships to see whether S_struct changes in expected directions, with calibration curves).\n\n- Figure 1 could be improved; excessive whitespace and mixed concepts dilute key information, with small labels."}, "questions": {"value": "- DAG Constraint vs. Cyclic Dependencies: Many industrial/biological systems have feedback loops. By imposing acyclicity on structural prototypes, are you baking in a bias that pushes cyclic phenomena into other channels (e.g., S_ctx or Spred)? What breaks if the true dependency graph is nearly cyclic (or dense), and how would relaxing DAG constraints (e.g., allowing small cycles with penalties) affect S_struct fidelity?\n\n- Baseline Mask (M_base) Stability: M_base is averaged from early-training masks. If normal data itself is multi-modal or drifting, the mean mask may be unrepresentative. Why not prototype-ize M_base itself (i.e., multiple baseline masks with selection), or define baselines by time-clustered regimes? What empirical evidence shows M_base is stable and representative, and how sensitive is S_struct to the time window used to compute it?\n\n- Stage-2 suppresses explanatory gates on pseudo-normal samples identified by low Spred. This equates “predictable” with “normal.” How does the method behave when contextual drifts are predictable (low Spred) yet abnormal relative to prototypes (high S_ctx)? Could gate suppression systematically down-weight contextual evidence in such cases, and have you measured the false-negative impact under controllable scenarios?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "I0mLBly73E", "forum": "3hS7EtL4bV", "replyto": "3hS7EtL4bV", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7687/Reviewer_VBHJ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7687/Reviewer_VBHJ"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7687/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761657842109, "cdate": 1761657842109, "tmdate": 1762919747327, "mdate": 1762919747327, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes PGRF-Net, an unsupervised framework for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that reframes detection as a diagnostic process.
