Unlike full-rank Gaussian kernels, triangles are a natural, locally-flat proxy for surfaces that can be connected to achieve highly complex geometry. When coupled with per-vertex Spherical Harmonics (SH), triangles provide a rich visual representation without incurring an expensive increase in primitives. We leverage our new representation to incorporate optimization objectives and enforce spatial regularization directly on the underlying primitives. The main differentiator of our approach is the definition and enforcement of soft connectivity forces between triangles during optimization, encouraging explicit, but soft, surface continuity in 3D. Experiments on representative 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis datasets show improvements in geometric accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art algorithms without sacrificing visual fidelity.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Novel View Synthesis", "3D Reconstruction"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/aad847ac699c25ab4776b2bbd4183c83123398e7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new idea of using triangles as the primitive to replace 3D Gaussians for the splatting.

Although this may make the approach more complex, it could lead to a fairer quantitative comparison.\n2.

Additionally to established losses like SSIM and depth smoothness, the authors propose a scene loss that softly encourages connectivity between neighboring triangles with aligned normals and rotations with the goal being emerging closed surfaces during optimization.\nThe paper includes an empirical evaluation for surface reconstruction on DTU and novel view synthesis on the Mip-NeRF360 dataset.\nFurthermore, the authors ablate on the choice and weightings of depth smoothness and connectivity / scene loss terms."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The paper is well written and very easy to follow and understand.\n  - The introduction motivates the task and the proposed approach well.\n  - The related work is very detailed and covers many existing approaches.\n  - The method is is mostly clearly described.\n  - The paper is honest about its experimental results.\n- The paper includes multiple technical contributions:\n  - The RTS representation based on triangle primitives intuitive.\n    - Colors are interpolated based on the Spherical Harmonic coefficients of the triangle's vertices.\n    - Surface normals per triangle are computed based on cross-products between edges and then alpha blended.\n  - I find the idea of the connectivity (scene) loss to encourage emergence of closed surfaces consisting of aligned triangles as in meshes especially interesting and novel.\n  - The adaptive density control leverages the characteristics of the representation, e.g., by splitting triangles into 4, or making use of the edge connectivity for pruning criteria.\n- The method achieves the best performance in 3D surface reconstruction for some scenes of DTU and the best LPIPS result in novel view synthesis on indoor scenes of the Mip-NeRF360 dataset.\n- The ablation study w.r.t. loss terms and weighting shows the effectiveness of the connectivity loss.\n- The appendix provides additional implementation details as well as qualitative and quantitative results."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The quantitative comparison with baselines is not convincing.\n  - PGSR [1] is overall better in both surface reconstruction (Tab. 1) and novel view synthesis (Tab. 2) than the proposed method.\n    - The authors attribute this to \"the algorithm utilizes a full suite of multi-view objective functions that significantly improve the geometric reconstruction quality\" (line 443). It remains unclear (also from related work) what these technical differences are exactly and whether comparison is still fair or not.\n    - In any way, what prevents the authors from using the same objective functions for a fair comparison with PGSR?\n  - While on indoor scenes, the method's NVS performance is on par with baselines, the performance on outdoor scenes is quite poor, lacking significantly behind GOF [2] and PGSR [1] (3.41 less PSNR and 0.147 higher LPIPS).\n- The experimental evaluation is limited.\n  - The provided qualitative results are insufficient.\n    - The main paper includes only Fig. 7, which does shows three DTU examples without any comparison to baseline methods, and Fig. 8, which shows one novel view each for two DTU examples compared to only one baseline 2DGS, which is quantitatively only the 3rd strongest baseline for surface reconstruction, according to Tab.1.\n  - The paper misses to compare their method with baselines in terms of training and rendering speed as well as GPU memory requirements.\n    - The authors mention in the limitations (Sec. 6) that \"due to periodic nearest-neighbors search, there is a minor increase in run-time\".\n- The paper lacks a detailed comparison of their method with TriangleSplatting [3].\n  - This paper seems to be an extremely important related work, but the paper does not mention it at all in the introduction and mentions it in one sentence in the related work (line 146f.).\n  - It is very difficult to evaluate the technical novelty compared to this paper, especially regarding the proposed representation, as the authors inly mention that TriangleSplatting \"does not support any mechanism for [the triangles] to interact directly with each other\", i.e., claiming that their soft connectivity forces loss is novel.\n- Lack of clarity:\n  - The authors claim that previous approaches like 3D Convex Splatting [4] are \"more expensive than RTS\" (cf. lines 153-163). However, the difference to RTS here is not clear to me, especially since in terms of diffuseness of primitives this method seems to share a lot of similarities with 3DCS (cf. 181 and Sec. 3.3). Furthermore, as mentioned above already, the paper misses to evaluate efficiency in terms of time and memory and compare with baselines to support this claim.\n  - The triangles are parameterized by the three bisector lengths. It would be helpful for the reader to mention that a triangle is indeed uniquely represented by this.\n  - The initialization of the rotation matrix is unclear. First, the rotation is defined based on triangle edges and normals, but then you apply a random rotation to this matrix. Is the outcome then not just random too?\n  - \"The diffuse scalar is also set as a function of the average distance to the three nearest neighboring points.\" (line 212). What is the function? Or point to the appendix, if it is described there.\n  - In Sec. 3.5, the authors first describe the intuition and the behavior of the soft connectivity forces they introduce without actually defining the loss term. This is done later in Sec. 4.2. These two section should be merged to improve readability.\n   - The description of the second term in the connectivity loss (the normal part) is missing in line 356.\n\n- Minor weaknesses:\n  - Missing references for use of triangles as fundamental primitives in computer graphs (lines 58f.).\n  - The Fig. 4 is unnecessarily large / has a suboptimal layout for its message.\n  - Missing references: Which previous works do you refer to in line 209 \"Similar to previous works...\".\n\nReferences:\n- [1] PGSR: Planar-based Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and High-Fidelity Surface Reconstruction.
