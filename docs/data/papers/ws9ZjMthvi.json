I'd expect these to be addressed for this work to be considered for acceptance. \n## Understanding the Usefulness of Temporal Range\n1. **Major:** My main concern about this work is the significance of the proposed temporal range metric. While Section 3.5 and 7 argue that the temporal range can be used to identify whether a shorter or longer context should be chosen for the current model, it appears difficult to identify what context length would be ideal given the temporal range. For example, when comparing Table 1 with results in Figure 1 for different window lengths, I see that GRUs prefer a context length of ~8 in both Cartpole and Stateless Cartpole. However, it is unclear how that information could have been derived from temporal range values in Table 1. I would appreciate if the authors could shed more light on how exactly they believe their metric to be used for tuning architectures in these experiments.\n\nRelated to this major concern, I would also like to better understand the assumptions made for the temporal range metric.\n\n2. **Major:** Temporal range identifies the importance of prior inputs on the policy's final output vector but it is unclear why only the final output vector is considered. Imagine a task of 100 steps in which the agent early in the episode observes a code that it needs to enter into a keypad 90 steps away to reach the goal shortly after. Significant memory might be required to generate the action at timestep 90 when the agent reaches the keypad to remember the code, but hardly any memory might be needed for the final action when the agent is already in the last room in front of the goal. Am I missing something, or does the temporal range assume that the final output of the model is somehow the output that is most indicative of the memory required for a task?\n3. **Major:** As I understand the temporal range metric, a trained model with a sensible input window length will be needed in order to compute informative temporal range (otherwise no sensible $y_T$ will exist to compute the Jacobian for). If a model is trained with barely any context, then the temporal range metric would not be able to identify much temporal influence of inputs prior to the model context. This appears to be a chicken-and-egg problem. The temporal range is supposed to help practitioners choose a sensible model configuration, but a sensible model configuration is needed in order to obtain an informative metric. It would be helpful if the authors could shed some light on this problem, connected to concerns raised in weakness 1.\n## Experiments\n4. I find the results shown in Figure 1 and Table 2 quite surprising. I would have expected GRUs and LSTMs to solve Cartpole close to optimally without issue but final performance is stated to be 0.817 and 0.185 for GRU and LSTMs, respectively. I believe these results raise some questions.\n\t1. **Major:** Do you have any explanation as to why in particular the LSTM performance is so poor in Cartpole?\n\t2. **Major:** How did you tune/ obtain hyperparameters reported in Table 5 of the Appendix? Based on a single set of hyperparameters being stated, it appears that no specific tuning has been done for any architecture.\n\t3. For results in Figure 1, do I understand correctly that all algorithms have been trained with full episodes for temporal context and the Figure shows performance for each architecture when the model is only given historical context of limited length during evaluation? If so, I find it also rather surprising how the performance appears to degrade quite sharply when the context is allowed to build up for 64 time steps given that during training these models have presumably typically received longer sequences than 64 time steps. Do you have any explanation as to why performance appears to drop very significantly in most cases for longer context lengths?\n5. Figure 2 shows temporal influence profiles for LEM. How do these profiles look like for other architectures such as LSTMs or GRUs?\n6. Do you have an explanation as to why the profile of LEM for Copy $k=10$ looks very different from Copy with $k=1, 3, 5$? For smaller $k$, there appears to be a consistent increase in temporal influence over the time sequence with a peak around $k$ steps before the final step which makes sense given the task. I would have expected a similar graph for $k=10$ but instead there appears to be a declining impact from early to later time steps with a small spike ~$k=10$ time steps before the end."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

We are also glad the reviewers appreciated our experimental\nresults, highlighting that our experiments are \"well designed to prove\ncorrectness\" (71xh) and that our work \"combines its theoretical metric with\npractical experiments\" (aEpE).\n\nThe constructive suggestions allowed us to significantly improve the paper. We\nhave uploaded a revised version incorporating these suggestions, with critical\nchanges highlighted in blue. Below, we summarize the main improvements and\naddress the specific points raised by each reviewer. The following main changes\nwere made:\n\n* **Clarified TR interpretation:** We now emphasize that TR serves primarily as\nan interpretability tool for understanding how trained policies use memory,\nwith the practical benefit that it also provides an upper bound on required\ncontext length. This framing better reflects the metric's value for analyzing\nmodel behavior.\n* **Improved TR definition (Section 3):** We have strengthened our metric to\ncapture the full temporal influence of each observation. Instead of measuring\nonly how observation $x_t$ affects the *final* action $y_T$, we now measure\nhow $x_t$ influences *every subsequent action* $y_s$ for all $s > t$.\nSpecifically, the influence weight at position $t$ is now $w_t =\n\\frac{1}{T-t}\\sum_{s=t+1}^{T} \\|\\partial y_s/\\partial x_t\\|_F,$ which averages\nthe Jacobian norms across all future timesteps $s$ that could depend on\nobservation $t$. The Temporal Range $\\hat{\\rho}_T$ then computes the\nmagnitude-weighted average lookback using these $w_t$ weights. To improve\nrobustness and reduce variance, we compute TR by averaging over multiple\nevaluation trajectories rather than from a single episode. This reformulation\nis more robust because it captures the *persistent* influence of observations.\nIf $x_t$ matters for decision-making, it should affect not just one action but\na sequence of downstream actions. The averaging over $s$ smooths out noise and\nprovides a complete picture of how historical information propagates through\nthe policy.\n* **Enhanced experimental results (Table 2):** Through additional hyperparameter\ntuning, all models now achieve competent performance (LSTM reaches 0.960 on\nCartPole, see revised Table 2). The initial LSTM failure was due to suboptimal\nhyperparameter choices.\n* **Practical deployment validation (Section 6.3, Table 3):** To demonstrate\nTR's practical utility, we conducted deployment experiments using TR-guided\ncontext windows. Results show substantial performance gains: windowed policies\nachieve 201.1% retention on Noisy Stateless CartPole (0.953±0.068 vs. baseline\n0.474±0.017), 103.9% on Copy k=3, and 174.1% on Copy k=10. These improvements\ndemonstrate that TR provides actionable guidance for memory-efficient\ndeployment, not merely interpretability insights.\n* **Extended analysis (Appendix):** Added temporal influence profiles for all\narchitectures (GRU, LSTM, LinOSS) across selected tasks (Copy k=3, Copy k=10,\nNoisy Stateless CartPole), directly addressing Reviewer aEpE's Question 5. We\nalso added vertical lines indicating $\\hat{\\rho}_T$ values in window ablation\nplots (Reviewer 71xh's suggestion).\n* **Citation formatting:** Changed all citations to use `\\citep` and `\\citet`\nfor consistent parenthetical style (Reviewer 71xh).\n* **Improved figure captions:** Expanded all main figure and table captions to\ninclude the main message and relationship to paper narrative (Reviewer 71xh)."}}, "id": "PAGfKo5u71", "forum": "ws9ZjMthvi", "replyto": "ws9ZjMthvi", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22934/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22934/Authors"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22934/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763762309162, "cdate": 1763762309162, "tmdate": 1763762309162, "mdate": 1763762309162, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
