Yet, existing POI representations remain largely static, evolving from simple coordinates and metadata to visual features and, most recently, LLM-derived textual prompts, all of which describe what a place is, but not how it is actually used. We argue that human mobility provides a complementary and dynamic signal, capturing real-world visitation patterns that reveal how places function in practice. To this end, we introduce Mobility Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a pretraining framework that augments static text-embedding representations with mobility-derived signals from visit sequences, capturing dynamic usage patterns. Each visit is represented as a contextualized embedding that integrates the POI’s static attributes with its temporal and sequential context, including when the visit occurs and which visits precede or follow it. To address the long tail of sparsely visited POIs, we transfer visit distributions from data-rich locations to sparse ones, leveraging multi-scale spatial proximity to capture local and regional patterns. We evaluate ME-POIs on large-scale human mobility datasets across a set of map enrichment tasks. We find that augmenting strong text embedding baselines with ME-POIs leads to consistent and substantial improvements across all tasks, confirming that mobility-informed embeddings offer complementary information that enhances static representations and enables a richer understanding of how places are used. Notably, even mobility embeddings alone, without any POI semantics, outperformed text-based embeddings on certain tasks, underscoring a key novelty of our approach.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["poi embeddings", "mobility-augmented embeddings", "map enrichment", "geospatial applications"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/a4d0a3a044c2f708c0922c8afc80f67c9f8f1f4e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a24cced3a79a289058188fdda8e791127f8f5657.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper focuses on learning general representation of POIs and introduces a new embedding method leveraging information from human mobility data.

Instead of relying solely on static textual or visual descriptions of what a place is, ME-POIs models how a place is used, by encoding contextualized embeddings of visits that incorporate temporal and sequential context. Specifically, the method employs a Transformer-based visit sequence encoder, contrastive learning between visit and global POI embeddings, and a multi-scale distribution transfer mechanism that propagates temporal usage patterns from anchor POIs to sparsely visited ones.

The models applied to learn transition patterns, including location/time encoding, Transformer-based trajectory encoders and InfoNCE contrastive learning, are directly from prior works in mobility prediction or location representation learning. The framework mainly combines these existing ingredients rather than introducing new modeling mechanisms. Consequently, the contribution may be perceived as an incremental combination of established techniques.\n\nW2. The design of the visit distribution transfer mechanism lacks conceptual clarity. The paper suggests transferring temporal visitation patterns from anchor POIs to sparse ones, but the rationale for establishing such connections is not well-justified. It remains unclear why similarity in spatial proximity or limited co-visitation patterns should imply that sparse POIs should inherit anchor-level visit distributions. A more rigorous explanation or empirical validation of this assumption would strengthen the argument.\n\nW3.  In Line 288, the model introduces mixture weights learned individually for each sparse POI. This design raises a potential inconsistency: if sparse POIs are characterized by few visits and limited data, assigning additional learnable parameters to each of them does not seem to be sound. The approach seems to contradict the underlying motivation of handling sparsity, as the introduced parameters might overfit or fail to generalize given the scarcity of observations.\n\nW4. For text alignment loss (Eq. 12), it aims to derive similar representations for its text embedding and $z^{ME}_{p}$. However, if this alignment objective is fully achieved, the two representations would converge to nearly identical spaces, potentially eliminating the complementary information that the mobility modality is meant to contribute. In other words, the text-alignment loss may unintentionally collapse the two modalities rather than encouraging mutual enrichment.\n\nW5. The reproducibility of this work is problematic. The proposed framework assumes access to large-scale, high-quality mobility traces (e.g., Veraset datasets) that are proprietary and not publicly available, and the same limitation applies to the evaluation datasets. As a result, it would be difficult for the research community to reproduce or extend the experiments.\n\nW6. The comparison between ME-POIs and text-embedding baselines may not be entirely fair. All baselines are pretrained general text models used off-the-shelf, while ME-POIs receive additional fine-tuning on mobility data. It is not surprising that the method outperforms these baselines."}, "questions": {"value": "Q1. The inclusion of per-POI mixture weights (Line 288) seems counterintuitive under data sparsity, as each sparse POI is associated with limited visits.\n\nQ2.
