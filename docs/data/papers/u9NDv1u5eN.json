Despite significant progress in protein structure prediction, approximating conformational ensembles at physiological conditions remains a fundamental open problem. This paper presents a novel perspective on the problem by directly targeting continuous compact representations of protein motions inferred from sparse experimental observations. We develop a task-specific loss function enforcing data symmetries, including scaling and permutation operations. Our method PETIMOT (Protein sEquence and sTructure-based Inference of MOTions) leverages transfer learning from pre-trained protein language models through an SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network.
