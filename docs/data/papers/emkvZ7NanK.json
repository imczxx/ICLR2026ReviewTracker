Due to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series: concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting, designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received comparatively less attention.\n\nMotivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS, a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Time-Series Forecasting", "Distribution Shift", "Concept Drift"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d442c258b725a6ea7ceb23f31bb7835f764b3e5e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6c9bc8b674be25eedacfce9ab88da834b2ca8add.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper identifies two types of distribution shifts in time series forecasting: temporal shift (marginal distribution) and concept drift (conditional distribution).

This mechanism learns a surrogate feature, $X^{SUR}$, which is predicted as an auxiliary task. The paper also presents ShifTS, a model agnostic framework that first uses normalization (like RevIN) to handle temporal shift, and then uses a backbone model to jointly predict the target $Y^H$ and the surrogate $\\hat{X}^{SUR}$.

This surrogate acts as an effective regularization target during training, forcing the model to learn future relevant patterns.\n- The ShifTS framework is practical and model agnostic. It cleanly integrates a known temporal shift solution (normalization) with the proposed concept drift solution (SAM).\n- The experiments are comprehensive. They show consistent performance improvements across six datasets and multiple strong backbone models, and also outperform other distribution shift baselines."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The claim that SAM finds \"invariant patterns\" is not well supported by the mechanism. The method (Equation 1) is a learnable attention mask, not an explicit invariance optimization like in IRM. It seems to learn a *useful compression* of future features, but calling it \"invariant\" is a strong claim that needs better justification.\n- The paper introduces significant complexity with the SAM module and the aggregation MLP. However, the performance gains on SOTA models like iTransformer are sometimes small (e.g., <5% MAE gain on ETTh2/ETTm2). The marginal benefit versus the added complexity is questionable in these cases.\n- A critical and much simpler baseline is missing. The paper argues predicting raw $X^H$ is too hard, but $X^{SUR}$ is easier. This assertion must be tested by comparing ShifTS to a simpler multi task model that just predicts the raw $X^H$ as the auxiliary task."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  Can you please clarify how the SAM mechanism (Equation 1) specifically enforces invariance? The high weight patterns are defined as invariant, but it is unclear how the optimization process encourages this property over just learning a stable predictive signal.\n2.  To justify the complexity of SAM, could you add a baseline that replaces the $X^{SUR}$ target with the raw $X^H$? This would involve a multi task loss $\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{TS} + \\lambda \\cdot MSE(X^H, \\hat{X}^H)$. This comparison is essential to prove that the SAM slicing and attention is superior to just predicting the raw future features.\n3.  What is the impact of applying ShifTS to \"near-stationary\" datasets like Traffic or Weather, which were excluded? Does the method degrade performance in the absence of significant shifts, or does it robustly \"do no harm\"?\n4.  The aggregation step ($Agg(\\cdot)$ in Algorithm 1 and Figure 2) appears to be a key component.

In fact, this plot studies the effectiveness of ShiftTS w.r.t. the so-called concept drift defined in Def 2.2 in this paper. A good example is the Exchange dataset, which shows low mutual information but high performance improvement. Thus, it suggests that the performance is mainly due to the mitigation of the so-called temporal concept drift. This is also consistent of Fig. 3(b), which shows that the most significant performance improvement is between ShiftTS\\TS and Base.
