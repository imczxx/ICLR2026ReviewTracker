We bridge this gap with the *diversified multinomial logit* (DMNL) contextual bandit, which augments MNL choice probabilities with a generally submodular diversity function, formalizing the relevance--diversity relation in one model.\nEmbedding diversity renders exact MNL assortment optimization intractable. We develop a *white-box* UCB-based algorithm, $\\texttt{OFU-DMNL}$ that builds assortments item-wise by maximizing optimistic marginal gains, avoids black-box oracles, and provides end-to-end guarantees. \nWe show that $\\texttt{OFU-DMNL}$ achieves at least a $(1-\\tfrac{1}{e+1})$-*approximate* regret bound $\\tilde{O}\\big(\\tfrac{\\sqrt{K}(d+1)}{K+1} \\sqrt{T}\\big)$, where $d$ is the context dimension, $K$ the maximum assortment size, and $T$ the horizon, and attains an improved approximation factor over standard submodular baselines. Experiments show consistent gains and, versus exhaustive enumeration, comparable regret with substantially lower runtime. DMNL bandits serves as a principled and practical basis for diversity-aware assortment optimization under uncertainty and our proposed algorithm offers a both statistically and computationally efficient solution.", "tldr": "We propose the diverse multinomial logit choice model, which directly incorporates assortment diversity, and design a computationally efficient algorithm that operates effectively under this model.", "keywords": ["multinomial logistic choice model", "contextual bandits", "diversity", "regret analysis"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1c05aa306b0b670171fa9787251f8f6f0106b20b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e80eba78046ef437123bd221a2eb6431f8966b4f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Diversified Multinomial Logit (DMNL) Contextual Bandits, extending the Multinomial Logit (MNL) choice model to explicitly promote diversity in the chosen assortments.

While the formulation of the DMNL model is conceptually novel, the theoretical contributions are somewhat incremental. The improved approximation rate is a relatively straightforward derivation from the structure of the submodular function, which should be stated more of a proposition rather than theorem.\nThe item-size optimistic construction largely follows from UCB based algorithms that are commonly used in semi-bandit combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. Although the adaptation to the DMNL context is sound, it seems not introducing new insights beyond existing frameworks. The joint estimation of $\\theta$ and $\\lambda$ comes from a relatively simple reparameterization of the choice probability that effectively treating diversity as an additional feature dimension.
