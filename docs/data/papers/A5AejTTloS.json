We reformulate detoxification from a value-alignment perspective as a multi-principle constrained generation problem that enforces explicit harmlessness, guards against insinuations, stereotypes, microaggressions, and subtly discriminatory framing, and simultaneously maintains fairness consistency, and helpfulness. Specifically, we propose a diffusion-based process-level aligner, SafeManifold-Diffusion, a novel framework that combines conditional latent diffusion with a diffusion-map-based semantic safety manifold to enforce both semantic fidelity and value alignment. Given an offensive input, our model generates a rewritten sentence by simulating a denoising trajectory in latent space, conditioned on the original content embedding. To prevent the trajectory from entering semantically toxic regions, we construct a nonlinear safe semantic manifold from verified non-offensive latent representations using diffusion geometry, and constrain generation via explicit manifold projection at each sampling step. Experiments on four detoxification datasets demonstrate that SafeManifold-Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing both explicit and implicit toxicity while preserving intent, improving fairness, and producing more helpful outputs.

I suppose the subscript should be removed. c) In line 237, the dimensionality of the safe manifold is denoted as $d$, but in line 258 it is written as $d_m$. The authors should unify this notation. d) Please verify whether the symbol $t$ in Equations (8) and (10) represents the same quantity. If not, the notation should be revised to avoid ambiguity.\n\n* Lines 301–304 state that diffusion distance is a superior choice compared with Euclidean distance for constructing the safe manifold, which lacks empirical justification. The authors should add an ablation study that replaces the diffusion distance with Euclidean distance (or otherwise evaluates this alternative) to substantiate the claim.\n\n* In Figure 2 and lines 180–185, the forward diffusion process is mentioned. However, in the subsequent sections, the latent representation derived from the toxic input appears to be used only as a conditioning signal for the diffusion model, rather than as the clean data input of the diffusion process. Could the authors clarify how the forward diffusion of the input actually functions within the model?\n\n* Line 266 states that the safe manifold is constructed using non-offensive text samples. I would like to know the source of these data and the exact value of $N$. Intuitively, a small $N$ would produce an incomplete manifold to be projected onto, which limits the expressiveness. Could the authors provide further experimental results showing how the choice of $N$ affects model performance?\n\n* Section 4.4 states that intermediate states are projected at every step of the reverse diffusion process. However, when $t$ is large, $\\hat{z}_t$ is dominated by Gaussian noise, so I question whether it is necessary to apply projection in the early stages of diffusion. I would like to see experiments that confirm or refute this point.\n\n* During the full training-and-generation pipeline of the latent diffusion model, projection onto the safe manifold is applied only at generation time, which may cause the inputs encountered at intermediate generation stages to come from distributions unseen during training. Although the experimental results suggest this did not have a major impact, I believe stronger theoretical justification is needed to support the feasibility of performing projection exclusively at generation.\n\n* A minor suggestion: please expand the captions of Figure 2 and Figure 3 to make them self-contained, which would significantly improve the readability and clarity of the figures.\n\n* There is a missing citation at line 83.

As models become better at filtering explicit slurs, toxicity shifts to implications. The method shows strong empirical performance on the APPDIA dataset, which specifically targets these subtle forms of offense, outperforming standard baselines (Llama, Qwen)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "### Weakness 1: Risk of Over-Constraint on Out-of-Distribution Safe Text\nThe core assumption of the paper is that a \"safe semantic manifold\" can be adequately constructed from a fixed, curated corpus. \nBut by definition this manifold from \"curation\" is finite and limited. A significant theoretical risk is that this manifold characterizes only the support of the training data, not the vast and expanding set of all valid, safe utterances. When the model encounters highly out-of-distribution (OOD) such as specialized technical jargon, creative poetry, or complex mathematical reasoning, its latent representation may fall outside the learned manifold. This could lead to a blandness collapse, where nuanced or specialized inputs are rewritten into generic tookens, impacting usability of the model. The current evaluations (ParaDetox, APPDIA) focus on standard text and not on more general-purpose abilities.\n\n---\n\n### Weakness 2: Potential for Unintended Bias in Low-Density Manifold Regions\nThe reliance on density-based manifold learning techniques creates other risks, specifically bias by erasure. Consider a region that is either (a) under-represented in the curated corpus used for training the manifold OR (b) over-represented in toxic sentences, this may lead to bias. This is actually a well-studied problem in detoxification (unintended bias). For example, if the \"curated corpus of non-offensive text\" under-represents certain minority dialects (e.g., AAVE), these examples will form sparse regions in the latent space.\n\nGeometric projection methods often treat sparse regions as noise to be smoothed out. Perfectly safe sentences heavily featuring minority linguistic markers might be projected toward the dense center of the manifold (likely standard standardized English). While the paper claims to improve fairness, this specific inductive bias might actively homogenize cultural markers, risking erasing of minority terms in the decoded text.\n\n---\n\n### Weakness 3 (CRITICAL): Degradation of Linguistic Fluency and Grammatical Correctness\nTo me, the most concerning issue is the visible degradation of basic linguistic quality in the rewritten outputs. The method appears to achieve safety at the cost of breaking standard English grammar. The examples provided by the authors in Appendix A.2 (Table 4) demonstrate this failure mode explicitly:\n*   *\"There are many users on the trying to trigger individuals.\"*\n*   *\"You’t special, White?\"* \n*   *\"...but they may not achieve unrealistic.\"* \n\nThis suggests a fundamental conflict: forcing the latent state onto the \"safe semantic manifold\" appears to push it off the natural language manifold that the decoder requires for fluent generation. If a model cannot generate grammatically sound text, high safety scores are moot."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  OOD experiment is required: \nHow does SafeManifold-Diffusion handle safe inputs that are semantically distant from the corpus used to build the Diffusion Map? If you pass purely benign but highly specialized text (e.g., math problems from GSM8k or general IF using AlpacaEval) through the rewriter, do the BLEU/BERTScore metrics drop significantly compared to in-distribution conversational text?\n\n2. Identity Erasure: \nConsider an identity or race term that is highly correlated with toxicity.  For example, if a <race-word> co-occurs often with <toxic-word>, then race word risks erasure.Can you, using datasets like BOLD or a subset of RealToxicityPrompts show to what extent this occurs using your technique?\n\n3. Manifold Sensitivity: \nHow sensitive is the performance to the bandwidth parameter delta and the target manifold dimension m? Is there a sharp trade-off point where the manifold becomes too low-dimensional to retain semantic nuance?\n\n4. Reliability of Automated Metrics for Implicit Toxicity\nTeh authors design an \"ImplicitTox-Score\", which uses DeepSeek as a zero-shot judge to detect subtle harms like insinuations or subtly discriminatory framing. But does DeepSeek itself understand implicit toxicity? (For example, LLMs do not understand sarcasm very well) Could this make the claim of implicit toxicity weak? \n\n5. Fluency/Perplexity Analysis: \nYour own examples shown in appendix Table 4 show significant grammatical degradation. Can you please measure the perplexity drop/ Bleu change of the rewritten outputs using a larger, external LLM? It appears the strong manifold constraint might occasionally force the latent into regions that are semantically \"safe\" but grammatically unstable for the decoder."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "n/a"}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ZT0o1AGLEE", "forum": "A5AejTTloS", "replyto": "A5AejTTloS", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6626/Reviewer_uR96"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6626/Reviewer_uR96"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6626/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761947214999, "cdate": 1761947214999, "tmdate": 1762918944265, "mdate": 1762918944265, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focuses on detoxifying text.
