Constraining the rank of the transport plan yields low-rank OT, which improves computational complexity and statistical stability compared to full-rank OT.  Further, low-rank OT naturally induces co-clusters between distributions and generalizes $K$-means clustering. Reversing this direction, we show that solving a clustering problem on a set of _correspondences_, termed _transport clustering_, solves low-rank OT. This connection between low-rank OT and transport clustering relies on a _transport registration_ of the cost matrix which registers the cost matrix via the transport map. We show that the reduction of low-rank OT to transport clustering yields polynomial-time, constant-factor approximation algorithms for low-rank OT. Specifically, we show that for the low-rank OT problem this reduction yields a $(1+\\gamma)$-approximation algorithm for metrics of negative-type and a $(1+\\gamma+\\sqrt{2\\gamma}\\,)$-approximation algorithm for kernel costs where $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$ denotes the approximation ratio to the optimal full-rank solution. We demonstrate that transport clustering outperforms existing low-rank OT methods on several synthetic benchmarks and large-scale, high-dimensional real datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["optimal transport", "low rank", "approximation algorithms", "k-means", "co-clustering", "clustering"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8fda6425e2ea5551c5f6ee51836f3136d1745739.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/682219a801d324e5431312d28163df3acd801ef8.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Low-rank optimal transport (OT) aims to approximate the optimal transport plan by constraining it to have small nonnegative rank, effectively routing mass through a few latent anchors. This structure naturally induces a clustering of the supports—points that share an anchor form co-clusters across the source and target distributions. While the motivation for low-rank OT is scalability, the optimization problem itself is nonconvex and NP-hard, in contrast to the convex linear formulation of classical OT. However, practical algorithms for low-rank OT often lead to scalable approximations in practice.\n\nThis paper takes the inverse view: instead of discovering clusters through a low-rank constraint, it first computes a full OT map to register the supports, then clusters the induced correspondences to identify anchors, and finally reconstructs a low-rank coupling consistent with this clustering. The resulting “transport clustering’’ approach reduces low-rank OT to a single generalized k-means problem and achieves a provable constant-factor approximation (between 2× and 3×, depending on the cost function) to the best rank-K OT cost for metric or kernel costs.\n\nThe presentation is somewhat confusing. The introduction motivates low-rank OT as a scalable alternative to full OT, yet the proposed method begins by computing a full OT map, which appears contradictory. The paper does not clearly emphasize that the full OT is computed only once to extract reusable structure for downstream efficiency. As written, it reads as if the “scalable’’ approach is computationally harder, whereas the real contribution is to show that—despite the NP-hardness of low-rank OT—one can obtain a constant-approximation solution through a simple clustering reduction built from a single OT computation."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper tackles an interesting compression problem where the goal is to incur a one-time OT computation cost in order to learn clusters that enable faster and more structured future OT computations.
