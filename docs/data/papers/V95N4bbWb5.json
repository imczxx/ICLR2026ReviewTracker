Despite its transformative potential, two critical challenges limit its effectiveness: (1) stochastic noise in low copy number regimes, where Poisson fluctuations significantly distort binding signals, and (2) systematic biases between observed read counts and actual binding affinities due to experimental artifacts and amplification variability.\nWe introduce DEL-Ranking, a comprehensive framework that addresses these dual challenges through targeted innovations. To mitigate stochastic noise, we incorporate a dual-perspective ranking mechanism that prioritizes stable relative ordering relationships over volatile absolute counts. To bridge the read count-affinity gap, our Chemical-Referenced Correction (CRC) module identifies critical binding-related functional groups and leverages these structure-activity insights to guide precise count adjustments.\nA key contribution is our release of three novel DEL datasets featuring 2D molecular sequences, 3D conformational data, and functionally-derived activity labels—addressing a significant resource gap in the field and enabling more robust method development.\nRigorous validation across multiple datasets reveals that DEL-Ranking consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving a remarkable 28\\% improvement in Spearman correlation even under high-noise conditions. Our framework both enhances identification of high-affinity compounds and reveals novel functional motifs--Pyrimidine Sulfonamide, beyond known Benzene Sulfonamide groups.

The text says “The combined loss function consistently outperforms the standard ZIP approach in expected performance.” However, the ZIP loss and the rank loss are two completely different loss functions, so comparing their values is not exactly fair. Following that logic, we could imply that the best loss function would be a constant zero function. \n- In Equation 5, the inequality $r_i > r_j$ may indicate a problem with the loss function. Is it necessary if the expression being summed is perfectly symmetrical? $\\sigma_{ij}$ is obviously symmetrical and $Z$ is constant (always based on top predictions). The $\\Delta$ terms are not symmetrical, but they are multiplied by each other, making the product symmetrical. Why not use $j>i$ instead of $r_i > r_j$ then?\n- If in Equation 9, the sum for the con loss is over $j \\neq i$, and the margin of $\\tau$ is enforced for $i > j$, then the loss for $j > i$ would be huge (in fact, $f(\\hat{r}_i) - f(\\hat{r}_j)$ should be negative). \n- The loss functions in Algorithm 2 are different than the ones defined in the paper. \n- The code is not shared, and there is no reproducibility section that would explain whether the code will be published upon the paper acceptance.
