However, due to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE) to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting. Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities, presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.", "tldr": "We introduce CoRA, a general, effective, and interpretable framework to adapt Time Series Foundation Models on covariate-aware forecasting, achieving SOTA performance while requiring fewer training samples.", "keywords": ["Time Series Forecasting", "Adaptation", "Fine-tuning", "Time Series Foundation Models"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e8b82067b32d6d35ac4485753af98d8485004530.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces CoRA, a Covariate-awaRe Adaptation framework for adapting Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) to covariate-aware forecasting tasks.

In particular, you're not actually doing any statistical tests, if I understand the setup correctly. If this is the case, then perhaps it would be helpful discussing in a bit more detail to what extent the resulting approach actually resembles and has the same sort of interpretation as Granger causality, or whether we no longer have the same sort of interpretation anymore as there are no statistical tests conducted (showing that the weights correlate well as in Figure 7 is a good first step but leaves me wondering whether there's any sort of deeper connection, and whether we do have any sort of meaningful Granger causality interpretation from the resulting model itself). Perhaps rewording some of the exposition regarding Granger causality would be helpful to make it clear that the proposed CoRA method is not actually reasoning in a causal manner (from my understanding) so we aren't actually making any sort of statements about causality (in particular, the proposed architecture seems to only be inspired by but not the same thing as Granger causality, and Granger causality itself only has a valid causal interpretation under some key assumptions holding --- assumptions which don't appear to be discussed in this paper anyways). Separately, I find that equation (6) could just be interpreted as an attention mechanism, without trying to make any sort of connection to Granger causality. Perhaps commenting on this connection would be helpful.
