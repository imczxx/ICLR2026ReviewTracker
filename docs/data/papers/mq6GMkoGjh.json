However, focusing exclusively on leaderboard accuracy risks neglecting critical issues related to model reliability and safety in practical diagnostic scenarios. One significant yet underexplored issue is sycophancy — the propensity of models to uncritically align with user-provided information, thereby creating an echo chamber that amplifies rather than mitigates user biases. While previous studies have investigated sycophantic behavior in text-only large language models (LLMs), its manifestation in LVLMs, particularly within high-stakes medical contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce EchoBench, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate sycophantic tendencies in medical LVLMs. EchoBench comprises 2122 medical images spanning 18 clinical departments and 20 imaging modalities, paired with 90 carefully designed prompts that simulate biased inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. In addition to assessing overall sycophancy rates, we conducted fine-grained analyses across bias types, clinical departments, perceptual granularity, and imaging modalities. We evaluated a range of advanced LVLMs, including medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary models. Our results reveal substantial sycophantic tendencies across all evaluated models. The best-performing proprietary model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, still exhibits a non-trivial sycophancy rate of 45.98%. Even the most recently released GPT-4.1 demonstrates a higher sycophancy rate of 59.15%. Notably, most medical-specific models exhibit extremely high sycophancy rates (above 95%) while achieving only moderate accuracy. Our findings indicate that sycophancy is a widespread and persistent issue in current medical LVLMs, uncovering several key factors that shape model susceptibility to sycophantic behaviors. Detailed analyses of experimental results reveal that building high-quality medical training datasets that span diverse dimensions and enhancing domain knowledge are essential for mitigating these sycophantic tendencies in medical LVLMs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Sycophancy", "Large Vision-Language Models", "Medical VQA Benchmark"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/63f2f5e409ce48f2dcebef4bb6cfefcf60b9d767.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This article systematically reveals the critical safety issue of \"sycophancy\" in large models within medical scenarios: even top commercial models still exhibit excessive compliance with user biases in clinical Q&A, further demonstrating that high scores do not equate to truly \"understanding medicine.\" The authors construct EchoBench, covering 24 LVLMs, with fine-grained analysis across bias types, medical departments, modalities, and evidence granularity, while preliminarily exploring the causes of sycophancy and desensitization approaches.

While reasonably well-motivated and interesting from an applications standpoint (perhaps this paper would be better-suited for healthcare-focused venues?), the findings that VLMs are sensitive to prompting details and that they can be easily distracted by potentially misleading context is not entirely surprising. On the flip side, I think there are also many cases where we would actually want the model to be sensitive to the user-provided context, as the models are not always going to be accurate.\n- The finding that medically specialized models often perform worse than general-domain models (even the base models, like in LLaVA-Med V1.5 vs. LLaVA-V1.5-7B) on medical VQA tasks is not entirely surprising, as some prior works have already suggested this (e.g., [1]).\n- Some preliminary strategies for mitigating sycophancy (based on prompt engineering) are explored but are not extensive.\n- Limitations of the study are not discussed.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Medical Adaptation of Large Language and Vision-Language Models: Are We Making Progress?

The two statements seem a bit contradictory, as medically fine-tuned models should supposedly encode more, if not similar, levels of domain knowledge. Can you elaborate on this discrepancy? \n- Related to the point above, I wonder if the inability of follow task instructions may be an artifact of not using the \"right\" prompt to elicit the desired responses for the medically specialized models, given that it is mentioned as the reason for their failure.\n- Regarding mitigation strategies, why not consider a combination of adjustments to the system prompt (to avoid relying on the adversarial cues) and the self-correction ability?
