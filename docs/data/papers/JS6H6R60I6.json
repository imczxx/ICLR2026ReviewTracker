Forecasting HAB development and spread remains a challenge, especially in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems where advection, stratification, and episodic river inputs strongly shape bloom dynamics. Existing approaches often trade physical realism for statistical flexibility, limiting generalization across bloom regimes. We present a physics-informed deep learning framework for nearshore chlorophyll-a forecasting in the California Current System, integrating multi-sensor satellite products, atmospheric and ocean reanalysis fields, and static geospatial predictors. Three architectures are evaluated: a convolutional long short-term memory network (ConvLSTM), a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), and a physics-informed ConvLSTM (PINN) incorporating the two-dimensional advection–diffusion equation as a soft training constraint. A multi-year, 4 km-resolution dataset (2003–2021) is processed via a tailored feature engineering pipeline with quality-controlled gap-filling, rolling statistics, lagged predictors, and climatology-based anomalies. Models are assessed with strict spatiotemporal cross-validation, emphasizing spatial fidelity, bloom footprint representation, and predictor interpretability. Post-hoc explainability analyses identify key environmental drivers consistent with known upwelling–bloom linkages in the region. We present comparative skill assessments, spatial bias analyses, and predictor attribution results, highlighting the advantages and trade-offs of adding physical constraints to coastal HAB forecasting models.

The benefits of the physics constraint are primarily evident in spatial fidelity rather than in bulk RMSE or correlation, and the paper does not provide statistical tests to confirm whether these differences are statistically significant.\n2. The physical constraint itself is limited to a simple linear advection–diffusion term with an unspecified source component. It does not incorporate biological growth, decay, or nutrient interactions, which limits how “physics-guided” the approach truly is.\n3. The coarse spatiotemporal resolution of the inputs and targets is acknowledged as a limitation. Yet, the study does not attempt ablation experiments to verify that finer resolution or sub-weekly sampling would meaningfully increase skill.\n4. The transformer baseline appears disadvantaged because it treats spatial points independently rather than leveraging spatial attention. Using more recent spatial-transformer designs could yield stronger baselines and make the comparison fairer.\n5. The analysis of extreme events remains mostly qualitative.
