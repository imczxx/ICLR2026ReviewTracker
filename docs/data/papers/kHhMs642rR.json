However, measuring the quality of the features they uncover remains challenging, and there is no consensus in the community about which benchmarks to use. Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for each feature in the sparse coder. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they enable an LLM to predict the activation of a feature in new contexts. This method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the features in the sparse coder. In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.", "tldr": "Instead of evaluating whether explanations match activating contexts, we evaluate how much are activating contexts similar between themselves.", "keywords": ["interpretability", "explanation", "sae", "transcoder"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/01ee88f8f9f74c3b8b866325ced01e3d3595f479.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a new method for evaluating Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). It argues that explaining latent directions in the SAE’s latent space through short textual descriptions is suboptimal for two main reasons. First, this approach complicates the evaluation process by adding hyperparameters and prompt-related variability. Second, a latent factor can be interpretable even if it cannot be concisely expressed in words.\n\nAs an alternative, the paper proposes an intruder detection framework. For each latent, four activating examples and one non-activating “intruder” example are sampled. Interpretability is then assessed based on how effectively humans, large language models (LLMs), and an embedding-based algorithm can identify the intruder.
