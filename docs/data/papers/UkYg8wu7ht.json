We present CTODS (Constrained Top-$K$ Overlapping Densest Subgraphs), a theoretically grounded polynomial-time algorithm that transforms graphs into hypergraphs by systematically identifying overlapping dense subgraphs as hyperedges. The algorithm achieves computational efficiency with $O(K \\cdot m \\log n)$ time complexity and $O(n + m)$ space requirements while ensuring connectivity-enforced subgraph discovery through a principled distance function that controls overlap. Our adaptive parameter optimization framework enables robust performance across diverse network topologies, from citation networks to geometric structures. Extensive empirical validation across eight benchmark datasets demonstrates the method's superiority, achieving consistent improvements of 1-3\\% over existing approaches on seven datasets. The framework effectively models higher-order interactions that remain inaccessible to traditional pairwise representations, establishing a principled foundation for hypergraph-based machine learning applications across multiple domains.", "tldr": "We propose a novel framework for hypergraph generation using top-𝐾 densest overlapping subgraphs and demonstrate its efficiency in enhancing the performance of hypergraph neural networks for  different graph structures and application domains.", "keywords": ["hypergraphs", "hypergraph neural networks", "hyperedge generation", "overlapping densest subgraphs", "node classification", "graph representation learning"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/38a8c4d0985d608b76b6a56af0300731e4b1afd6.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ccef55acb2f4d76f4ef3dccf5a360ecfa17ed7a5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a hypergraph construction approach from a graph through constrained top-K densest subgraphs.

If the task does not come with inherent hypergraph structure (eg co-authorship network), it is unclear why turning a pairwise graph into a hypergraph would necessarily be helpful (even though it might be a generally useful technique in network science). Along this line, recent studies such as [1] have demonstrated that hypergraph neural networks are not necessarily better than classical graph neural networks with for example clique expansion. To better justify their approach, the authors need to show convincingly hypergraph construction is indeed required for a certain type of tasks. \n\n**Technical aspects.** Several technical aspects of the paper should be clarified and improved:\n- In Eq.(5), why use product of cardinality of the two sets but not the size of the union set, as the commonly used Jaccard index?\n- Why do the authors propose a two phase algorithm? How are the “additional densest subgraphs that are distinct” in phase 2 differ from those in phase 1? This lacks proper justification and needs to be explained more clearly (ideally via an illustration of the overall algorithm).\n- Related to the point above, it is confusing to see the objective function in Eq.(6) and then another optimisation with a different objective function in 4.3.\n- In Eq.(6), the $L_i$ and $L_j$ should be $\\mathcal{L}_i$ and $\\mathcal{L}_j$ as defined before.\n- The optimisation problem at the beginning of 4.3 should be defined using a sum over all indices $i$, if multiple $\\mathcal{L}_i$ are being optimised together.\n- Multiple functions in Algorithms 1 and 2 are not explained, making it difficult to understand how they work.\n- The authors mentioned in 4.2 that existing iterative approaches are suboptimal, however it looks like the proposed method is iterative as well. Can the authors clarify on this point and how their method addresses the limitation of previous iterative approaches? \n\n**Experiments** The experimental results should be clarified and strengthened: \n- The authors cited three papers in Introduction and also mentioned “our HGNN” a couple of times but it is unclear which HGNN method is being used. \n- The authors mentioned “graph-to-hypergraph conversion approaches” in 5.1, however star expansion and clique expansion are methods for hypergraph-to-graph conversion. Also, in order to apply the proposed method, my understanding is that we need to start with a graph dataset. However, hypergraph datasets such as Cora-CA are included which presumably already contains defined hyperedges. These aspects need be to clarified. \n- Only three hypergraph neural network baselines are included in the experiments. The authors should either include more baselines (some of those can be found in [1]) or discuss why they are not suitable to compare against. \n- There are no ablation studies to demonstrate that minimising overlap using the proposed loss function would indeed contribute to the learning performance.\n\n[1] Tang et al., “Training-Free Message Passing for Learning on Hypergraphs,” ICLR, 2025."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses above for the specific points I would like the authors to address."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "qVfMR1MtXm", "forum": "UkYg8wu7ht", "replyto": "UkYg8wu7ht", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12543/Reviewer_uC1n"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12543/Reviewer_uC1n"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12543/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762088912272, "cdate": 1762088912272, "tmdate": 1762923403807, "mdate": 1762923403807, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
