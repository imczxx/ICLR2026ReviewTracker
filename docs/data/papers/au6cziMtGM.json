This ability is crucial not only for advancing 3D generation research but also for practical applications in animation, editing, and digital content creation. Existing approaches either operate directly on geometry, limiting them to shape-only morphing while neglecting textures, or extend 2D interpolation strategies into 3D, which often causes semantic ambiguity, structural misalignment, and texture blurring. These challenges underscore the necessity to jointly preserve geometric consistency, texture alignment, and robustness throughout the transition process.\nTo address this, we propose \\textbf{Interp3D}, a novel training-free framework for textured 3D morphing. It harnesses generative priors and adopts a progressive alignment principle to ensure both geometric fidelity and texture coherence. \nStarting from semantically aligned interpolation in condition space, Interp3D enforces structural consistency via SLAT (Structure Latent)-guided structure interpolation, and finally transfers appearance details through fine-grained texture fusion.

Limited generality and model dependency. The entire proposed pipeline is intrinsically tied to the specific architecture and latent representations of the Trellis model.

Insufficient analysis of module interactions. The paper introduces three progressive alignment components but does not thoroughly investigate the interplay between them. For instance, it remains unclear whether the semantic alignment in the condition space and the subsequent SLAT-guided structure alignment always work in harmony or could potentially introduce conflicting signals in some cases. A more detailed ablation study, perhaps with counterexamples, is needed to demonstrate that this progressive strategy is consistently synergistic and does not lead to contradictory guidance during the generation process."}, "questions": {"value": "1. In the semantic-aligned condition interpolation, the target condition tokens are permuted to match the source's semantic layout. While this benefits intermediate frames, could this permutation inadvertently harm the fidelity of the final generated target (when α=1)?

Could the authors discuss or provide analysis on this potential issue and whether the alignment strategy is adjusted near the endpoints?\n2. Given the potential for conflicting guidance between the different alignment modules (e.g., semantic vs. structural), could the authors provide further ablation studies that not only add modules progressively but also examine the performance of individual modules and other combinations?

The key design is that progressive 3D correspondence modeling guided by native feature cues from the source and target generation process, which can be applied for different 3D generation models.\n\nTo validate this, we implemented Interp3D across two additional 3D generation baselines, LN3Diff [1] and 3DTopia-XL [2]. Based on the new baselines, we first perform semantic-aware condition interpolation, and then instantiate the structural correspondence using each model’s native geometric embeddings (e.g., LN3Diff’s 3D latent tokens, 3DTopia’s primitive-level descriptors). These features provide stable geometric cues that let our structural alignment module plug in without modifying the backbone architectures. Finally, we apply our texture-refinement on their generative pipelines to complete the progressive alignment.\n\nAs shown in Figure 6 of Appendix A.0.1 (page 14), both approaches produce smooth and plausible morphings, confirming that Interp3D is a principled, architecture design rather than a model-specific enhancement.\n\n\n\n> **Parameter Sensitive Analysis.**\n\nWe conduct ablations for the similarity threshold $\\tau_0$ and the patch-size schedule $s_t$ on the hard cases of Inter3DData. We observe that the performance is robust across a reasonable range of thresholds. As shown in the Table below, $\\tau_0=0.6$ achieves the best balance between stable matches and robustness with 82.13 FID and 2.6082 PPL. \n\nFor patch size $s_t$, we also conduct ablations on different starting patch size selections.  A linearly decreasing schedule beginning at $s_t=64$ produces the most consistent geometry. This matches the rectified-flow generation behavior: early steps favor large patches to stabilize coarse correspondences, while later steps benefit from smaller patches to refine fine-grained geometry.\n\nThe configuration corresponds to the globally optimal setting across the benchmark rather than per-pair tuning.\n\n\n| $\\tau_0$    | – (no use) | 0.5     | 0.6         | 0.7     | 0.8     |\n| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- |\n| **FID ↓**   | 83.5071    | 82.7629 | **82.1281** | 82.3760 | 82.3982 |\n| **PPL ↓**   | 2.6107     | 2.6106  | **2.6082**  | 2.6118  | 2.6136  |\n| **LPIPS ↓** | 0.1186     | 0.1183  | **0.1179**  | 0.1185  | 0.1186  |\n\n**Table 1: Ablations on threshold selection $\\tau_0$**\n\n| $s_t$       | 1       | 8       | 27         | **64**      | 125     |\n| ----------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------- |\n| **FID ↓**   | 82.6624 | 82.3472 | 82.2640    | **82.1281** | 82.5908 |\n| **PPL ↓**   | 2.6218  | 2.6100  | **2.5940** | 2.6082      | 2.6176  |\n| **LPIPS ↓** | 0.1196  | 0.1187  | 0.1189     | **0.1182**  | 0.1184  |\n\n**Table 2: Ablations on staring patch size $s_t$**\n\n\n\n\n[1] Lan, Yushi, et al. \"Ln3diff: Scalable latent neural fields diffusion for speedy 3d generation.\" *European Conference on Computer Vision*. 2024.\n\n[2] Chen, Zhaoxi, et al. \"3dtopia-xl: Scaling high-quality 3d asset generation via primitive diffusion.\" *Proceedings of the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference*. 2025."}}, "id": "fRQLm2m9qC", "forum": "au6cziMtGM", "replyto": "au6cziMtGM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1763/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1763/Authors"], "number": 5, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1763/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763640460911, "cdate": 1763640460911, "tmdate": 1763647051216, "mdate": 1763647051216, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"title": {"value": "General Response for Manuscript Updated Information"}, "comment": {"value": "We sincerely thank all reviewers for their recognition and insightful feedback.
