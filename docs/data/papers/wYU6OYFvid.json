However, studies reveal that LLM-as-a-Judge systems exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where carefully crafted suffixes or prompts can easily manipulate scoring outcomes and cause abnormal score inflation, severely undermining evaluation reliability. Through systematic experimentation, we find that comparative evaluation tasks exhibit stronger robustness against such attacks compared to absolute scoring tasks. Building on this insight, we propose the CAP (Comparative Augmented Prompting) method, which enhances robustness by integrating a structured comparative mechanism into the absolute scoring framework. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, SummEval and TopicalChat, show that the CAP method effectively maintains scoring accuracy while significantly reducing the success rate of adversarial attacks, offering a promising solution for building more secure and reliable  LLM-as-a-Judge systems.", "tldr": "We propose CAP, a method that integrates comparative evaluation into absolute scoring to significantly improve the robustness of LLM-as-a-Judge systems against adversarial attacks.", "keywords": ["LLM-as-a-Judge", "Adversarial Robustness", "Adversarial Attacks", "CAP"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5a31df332d67f2afaf67089c4a5e5b766866a7e6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes CAP, which addresses the issue of \"against adversarial score manipulation\" that may occur in LLM-as-a-Judge, and uses comparison principles to inject absolute score evaluation to defend this issue.

The paper provides a preliminary study to investigate comparative evaluation versus absolute evaluation, and proposes a preference data generation scheme to generate high-quality and low-quality example anchors for models in comparative evaluation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. $\\textbf{Justifications of the key design choices are weak.}$ The paper provides insufficient justification or rationale behind its key method design:\n- The paper does not justify the choices of \"standard references geneartion\" in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3 .\n- Arbitrariness of standard vector thresholds: The paper sets the scoring thresholds for high/low standard reference texts as the 80th and 20th percentiles of the samples generated by the TUTOR model, but fails to explain why these two percentiles are the optimal choices, and there is also a lack of explanation and analysis regarding the number of generated samples.\n\n\n2. $\\textbf{Significant issue of efficiency trade-off is under-explored.}$ CAP has a critical practical limitation — extremely high efficiency costs. Although the paper acknowledges this trade-off, it does not conduct sufficient exploration or scenario-based analysis on it:\n- The quantitative gap is obvious: As can be seen from Table 5 (TopicalChat dataset) and Table 9 (SummEval dataset), compared with the \"no defense mechanism\" scenario, CAP increases the evaluation time of small open-source models by 40 to 70 times. For example, the FlanT5-XL model takes only 4.0 seconds to process a single sample without defense, but 162.4 seconds when CAP is enabled (CAPₗ configuration) and 283.5 seconds with the CAPₘ configuration; even for API-based models like ChatGPT-3.5, CAP adds approximately 100 seconds of extra time per sample.\n- Lack of optimization exploration: The paper describes this efficiency loss as \"a reasonable price to pay for robustness\" but does not explore improvement schemes that can enhance efficiency — such as reusing reference anchors for similar samples (instead of generating unique references for each sample), using a TUTOR model with a smaller parameter scale, or caching activation vectors. Without such optimizations, CAP is completely impractical in large-scale evaluation scenarios.\n\n3. $\\textbf{Types of tasks for evaluation are limited.}$ The scope of experimentation is relatively narrow, which makes it hard to assess the performance of CAP outside the tested tasks. All experiments focus on two types of tasks — text summary evaluation (SummEval dataset) and dialogue response evaluation (TopicalChat dataset). The paper does not apply CAP to other high-risk LLM-as-a-Judge scenarios, such as code generation evaluation or factual accuracy evaluation. For tasks where evaluation criteria are subjective or domain-specific, the definition of \"comparative reference text\" may be more difficult to delineate, and the effectiveness of CAP in such tasks has not been verified.\n\n4. $\\textbf{Lack of sufficient empirical analysis on preference data generation.}$ Specifically:\n- In Related Work, there is no review on the related methods for generation of preference data.\n- In ablation study, the comparative results of preference data quality are insufficient. The only comprative baseline for comparison is W-CAP, which uses different instructions to make the model generate high-quality summaries and low-quality summaries. This comparison with CAP may not be able to illustrate the effectiveness of Standard Vector Identification. It is needed to supplement comparative experiments such as: experiments using High-Standard Score and Low-Standard Score as preference data in the process of Standard Vector Identification, and experiments with other preference data generation schemes.\n- The paper can also benefit from a case study comparing the preference data generated by the proposed method with those generated by other relative methods.\n\n5. $\\textbf{This paper also has some presentation issues.}$ for example:\n- Multiple errors in the direction of double quotes, Lines 92 and 100.\n- The title of the prompt in Line 864 is incorrect.\n- In the experiment of Section 2, why is it reasonable to compare  between score and probability in Figure 2?"}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the weaknesses above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "No ethics concerns needed."}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "fr5evwfOnw", "forum": "wYU6OYFvid", "replyto": "wYU6OYFvid", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17609/Reviewer_7ZLQ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17609/Reviewer_7ZLQ"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission17609/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761639248170, "cdate": 1761639248170, "tmdate": 1762927474304, "mdate": 1762927474304, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems to adversarial score manipulation attacks by proposing CAP (Comparative Augmented Prompting), a defense framework.

Important and Practically Significant Research Problem:** The paper addresses the security issues of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, which represents a critical challenge in the current automatic evaluation field. The authors clearly demonstrate the severity of manipulation attacks, showing that adversarial attacks can inflate scores from 2.7 to 4.3. This research has strong practical value.\n\n**2. Comprehensive Experimental Design:** The experiments cover 5 judge models (2 open-source + 3 API-based) and 2 tutor models, testing white-box attacks (AdvSuffix) and black-box attacks (DSI, BED), and include ablation studies, adaptive attack testing, and efficiency analysis.\n\n**3. Clear Writing:** The paper is well-written with clear logic and smooth flow."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**1. Lack of Statistical Significance Verification:** The paper does not explicitly report statistical significance verification, including multiple repeated experiments and significance testing, making it impossible to determine whether the observed differences exceed the range of random fluctuation. The SummEval dataset contains 100 source documents, each with 16 machine-generated summaries, and the TopicalChat dataset contains 60 conversational contexts, each with 6 machine-generated responses. These datasets are relatively small in scale, and results from single experiments may be influenced by sample selection, making multiple repeated experiments particularly important for verifying result stability. The paper uses multiple large language models as judges and tutors, and these models have inherent randomness in the generation process, making repeated experiments even more necessary to verify experimental validity.\n\n**2. Relatively Simple Adaptive Attack Design:** The adaptive attack in Section 5.6 only uses prompts to \"ignore reference texts,\" which is a relatively basic attack strategy. Meanwhile, Table 7 shows that in some cases, the adaptive attack effect is even lower than standard attacks (e.g., FlanT5-XL: 12% vs 49%), further indicating that the adaptive attack design is insufficient.\n\n**3. Insufficient Parameter Selection and Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis:** The method involves multiple key parameters, but the sensitivity analysis is insufficient. Although Appendix B mentions sensitivity analysis, and Tables 12 and 13 display the αh and αl values under different dataset and model combinations, the main text does not adequately explain how these values were selected (through grid search optimization) and why different combinations require different parameter values. Although Appendix D.3 mentions selecting α values by \"calculating the mean and variance of the standard references\", and Figure 10 shows score changes under different α values, the explanation is insufficient. What are the selection criteria? How is the quality of high-standard and low-standard references balanced?\n\n**4. Insufficient Discussion of Method Limitations:** The paper lacks in-depth discussion of the method's applicable scope and failure scenarios. There is insufficient analysis of cases where defense effectiveness is poor in Tables 2-3 (such as Gemini-2.0 + DSI: 33%). There is no discussion of the impact of tutor model quality on defense effectiveness.
