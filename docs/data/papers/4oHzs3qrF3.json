Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment. Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout’s state-of-the- art performance, generating realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts.

The idea of using VLMs for layout generation is a sensible one, and having separate critics is also logical. The separation of semantic from physical concerns (i.e. whether objects are placed ergonomically to form a functional room, versus whether there are interpenetrations, floaters, etc.) is a good idea.\n\nExperiments are conducted on diverse prompts for nine room types, including several unusual ones for which the benefit of pretrained VLMs is clearer (since large training datasets would be hard to obtain). For evaluation, both physical and semantic correctness are measured; the latter is scored by another VLM. Quantitative results against three fairly recent baselines (LayoutGPT, Holodeck and LayoutVLM) show that the proposed method generally out-performs them across room types.\n\nPrompts vary in levels of detail, some simplify specifying a room type, others giving details of the furniture. In general adherence to the prompts is fairly good in the qualitative examples presented in the manuscript, and better than the selected LLM/VLM-based baselines in these cases.\n\nThere is an ablation study measuring the benefit of certain components, showing that each of them yields a noticeable contribution either to semantic or physical quality.\n\nThe paper is clear, well-structured, and pleasant to read."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "This is a complex pipeline that yields underwhelming results. In particular, the qualitative results in Figure 4 are greatly lacking realism – half rooms left empty, sparse layouts, and objects placed somewhat randomly around the edge of the room. Results are considerably worse than Merrell's work from 2012, and other more recent methods that are learnt from datasets (ATISS, etc.). Claims of \"realism\" and \"coherence\" are manifestly too strong. While I appreciate the proposed approach is intended to be training-free, these datasets and methods nonetheless exist and should be seen as defining state-of-the-art.\n\nThere are no related works prior to 2021 referenced, despite various methods existing dating back to at least 2011 (e.g. Interactive furniture layout using interior design guidelines, Merrell, SIGGRAPH 2011; Make it home: automatic optimization of furniture arrangement, Yu, TOG 2011; Automatic Generation of Constrained Furniture Layouts, Henderson CoRR 2017; Human-centric indoor scene synthesis using stochastic grammar, Qi CVPR 2018), among others.\n\nThe actual technical contribution is fairly small. Multi-agent systems for refining layouts etc. are now fairly well established, and the specific extensions here are small (without interesting technical novelties) and very domain-specific (hence not of great interest to the broader community).

The paper is well-written and easy to follow. All components are clearly described. \n2. Splitting the agents into planner and designer makes sense. Grouping furniture into groups and optimizing their locations together also seem to be a good idea."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Problem with the evaluation of the proposed method: \n1) room layout has a high degree of freedom and is very hard to judge automatically. In this paper, no human evaluation provided, and the qualitative results are very limited. \n2) Even out of the limited qualitative results, results are not promising. For example, Fig4, row4: the bottom half of the room is basically empty, which is not realistic. \n3) In general, for all the test cases presented in the paper, I find the prompts being not specific enough, and the constraints being too easy to fulfill given the large size of the room and very few furniture to put in. These make the proposed method seem unnecessarily complicated, as the constraints are likely to be fulfilled by some heuristic-based methods (such as the ones used in Infinigen [1]), without even involving VLMs.\nGiven the presented results, I'm not convinced that the proposed method is better than baselines such as Holodeck. I suggest that the authors to provide human studies, and provide more visualizations on rooms which much more complicated instructions. \n\n- Why is the evaluator necessary? From my understanding, the evaluator checks if the orientations of the placed furniture are correct, and if they are collision-free and lie within the room boundary. I think all these can be easily checked by hand-designed rules, why do you need VLM invlolved here?\n\n- Semantic refinement and Physical Refinement: the refinement could solve collisions when the rooms are very empty, but it becomes way harder to resolve when the placement of furniture becomes compact. It could be impossible for the model to adjust the local placement to satisfy all constraints. I.e., some global re-adjustment would be necessary at some moment. This global adjustment is common when humans design their room layout. Does your method have any stopping criteria when the refinement fails, and does it have any fall-back plans?\n\n- Overall, the contribution and the novelty of the paper are limited. The papers chain several off-the-shelf VLM agents together, which is not novel. The core components such as Physical Refinement is basically placing objects on regular grids to avoid intersections, and seems to be a liitle bit too trivial to be a solid contribution. \n\n\n- (minor) typo: L074 laxyout -> layout\n\n[1] Infinigen Indoors: Photorealistic Indoor Scenes using Procedural Generation"}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "VjiM4VzidG", "forum": "4oHzs3qrF3", "replyto": "4oHzs3qrF3", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24639/Reviewer_QBuM"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24639/Reviewer_QBuM"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24639/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761961293670, "cdate": 1761961293670, "tmdate": 1762943142660, "mdate": 1762943142660, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "DisCo-Layout proposes a multi-agent framework for indoor layout synthesis: a planner derives grouping and placement order from text and available assets; a designer produces initial object poses conditioned on a top-down view; and an evaluator uses structured VQA to check semantic and physical compliance.
