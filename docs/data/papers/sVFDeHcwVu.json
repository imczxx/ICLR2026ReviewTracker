How does this embodiment impact the way they learn? The role of embodiment in shaping learning dynamics is not well understood from a neuroscience or a machine learning perspective. In this study, we treat embodiment as a variable in artificial agents and study how changes in effector complexity reshape the dynamics of learning. Our hypothesis is that more complex effectors provide constraints that yield better transfer learning on new tasks, despite simultaneously posing a more complex control problem. We evaluated this hypothesis on area under the performance curve, and use time to sustained performance plateau as a parameter for task difficulty. Our results show that while a simpler effector excels when trained from scratch, a more complex effector yields superior performance after pre-training on another task. We further demonstrate that the improvement gained from transfer learning is greater for the complex effector. Our findings suggest that embodiment plays an important role in enabling efficient transfer, offering insights into the differences in learning dynamics between disembodied artificial systems and their biological counterparts.", "tldr": "A study on how embodiment shapes transfer learning: simple effectors train faster from scratch, but complex effectors yield greater improvements after transfer.", "keywords": ["Embodiment", "Transfer Learning"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b81d9f5b4309dcbc1f2f7fa15be83284f6fc5a87.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper aims to study the effect of embodiment complexity and the transfer learning efficiency, hypothesizing that a complex effector provides constraints that lead to better transfer learning.

Limited validation.\n\nThe main hypothesis that the authors claim to test is whether the effector complexity provides constraints that yield better transfer learning on new tasks [line 17-18]. I am not convinced that the current experiments are enough to validate the hypothesis. \n1) The only compared effectors are two kinds. \nI am not suggesting that the authors should look at all types of possible effectors, but I think two is too small a number for the main control variables. Furthermore, it intuitively makes sense that the arm would be a more complex effector, but there is no quantitative measurement of complexity suggested. Since they are comparing only two effectors, it is not convincing yet if these are generalizable results across different effects. Currently, there is only a very qualitative observation across two control variables, that 'arm effector' shows higher transfer efficiency than 'point mass' effector. I think there should be more experiments to draw a conclusion that 'effector complexity' causes better transfer learning. \n\n2) ...'provides constraints that yield better transfer learning' is not validated. \nThe authors only provide the comparison of performance metrics between two effector types; there is no evidence that this is because the complex effector provides more beneficial constraints.\n \n\n2. Choice of Metrics.\nThe authors propose two metrics for analyzing 'learning dynamics': 1) Time to Plateau (TTP) and 2) AUC, which are based on performance measurement of the fraction of time spent in the target zone. The writing does not fully justify the choice of those specific metrics and for example, TTP has multiple hyperparameters of choice (epsilon, delta thresholds) and the authors did not mention the effect or stability of the metrics across the hyperparameter choices. \n\nThe authors heavily use AUC metrics, but this metric does not take into account the final accuracy. That is, one model can have a higher AUC but lower final accuracy, and in this case, only looking at AUC won't give a precise comparison of the transfer learning effect. \n\nI think the term 'learning dynamics' is misused because the authors are only measuring efficiency or learning time, rather than other aspects that comprise 'learning dynamics'.   \n\n\n \n\n3. Interpretation/communication of results\n\nThere are a few points that I do not agree with the author's interpretation and explanations that cause confusion. In section 3.1, there are many parts where the authors use the aggregated term 'performance', but I think it needs a clear distinction between AUC (a proxy measure of learning efficiency) and final performance. \n\nIn lines [429-431], the authors claim PM shows negligible/negative transfer, while the ARm model consistently maintains positive transfer. However, this is not true according to Figure 6, as there are tasks where Arm shows negative transfers."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Where is TTP or a measure of task difficulty used?\n2. I don't think the experiments were done over multiple seeds?\n3. Is the choice of metric (fraction of the time target zone) conventional? What is the justification for this particular metric? Is there any alternative?\n4. Could you compare final accuracy, not only AUC, on the transfer task?\n5. What drives the observed effect?\nThe authors only perform validation on purely behavioral and performance-centered metrics. I wonder if authors have looked at the change of representation caused by the effector complexity and how it interacts with the transfer learning task.  \nI do acknowledge this might not be within the scope of the project, but nevertheless, I believe future work to extend the analysis into a representational level or more quantitative evidence on how affector complexity actually leads to helpful constraint will improve the contribution of the paper significantly.
