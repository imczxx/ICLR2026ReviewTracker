Specifically, the authors argue that when a sample is diffused all the way to pure noise, the strong generative capability of diffusion models can produce highly diverse reconstructions, thereby degrading anomaly detection performance. The paper focuses on optimizing the noise scheduler during both training and testing. In the training stage, the authors replace conventional noise scheduling strategies (e.g., cosine schedule) with one based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). During inference, they further adapt the noise strength per sample, again guided by the SNR.

The paper introduces a novel perspective by optimizing anomaly detection from the viewpoint of noise scheduling. In my opinion, this is an interesting and original angle, and to some extent represents a new direction for improving both the accuracy and efficiency of diffusion models for conditional time series generation.\n2.  The experimental evaluation is reasonably comprehensive. In particular, the ablation studies are well designed and clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed framework."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Similarly, from my perspective, the current version of this paper also exhibits several non-negligible weaknesses, summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Motivation.**\n   First, I acknowledge that generative models can produce diverse outputs when starting from different noise priors. I also notice that the paper (see Fig. 1) implicitly assumes that the denoised samples obtained from diffusion models correspond to “normal” (i.e., smooth) samples. This assumption itself is reasonable. However, later in the paper (lines 278–279), the authors state their own premise—*“the premise that time series anomalies manifest as high-frequency deviations from normative patterns.”*\n   Given this assumption, one could argue that existing diffusion-based methods are already capable of separating such high-frequency anomalies from normal patterns. Furthermore, regarding Fig. 1, I am skeptical about the second-row examples: such patterns could naturally arise from any sliding-window training process, and thus may not genuinely indicate anomalous behavior.\n\n2. **Writing and presentation.**\n   The narrative flow of the paper is not particularly convincing. For instance, the introduction of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is abrupt and lacks conceptual grounding, despite being the core of the entire framework. Merely pointing out the potential limitations of previous scheduling methods is insufficient; the authors should elaborate on how SNR-based scheduling specifically benefits time-series data.\n   In addition, Fig. 2 provides only a coarse overview. A more detailed modular diagram or code block would be valuable for understanding the system design.\n\n3. **Methodology.**\n   The claim made in the *Introduction*—that *“this new scheduler induces the model to learn normal patterns across diverse, SNR-calibrated corruption levels, enhancing robustness to noise perturbations and temporal heterogeneity”*—is intriguing but not well supported. I am not convinced that a more linear ($\\alpha$)-curve (as shown in Fig. 2) would directly yield these benefits.\n   Moreover, the first module of the method seems fully general and could be applied to computer vision or other domains, with no specific connection to time-series data. In contrast, the second module, *Diffusion Step Alignment*, appears to disrupt the previously optimized noise-level alignment, which raises additional concerns.\n\n4. **Experiments.**\n   When reading the *Experiments* section, I was expecting to see visualizations of real-world data similar to those in Fig. 1, which would strongly support the paper’s central claims—but none are provided. The main experiments focus solely on point anomaly detection, with weak evaluation on localization tasks.\n\n5. **Reproducibility.**\n   Although the authors state that they plan to release the code in the future, the current submission does not provide sufficient implementation details to ensure reproducibility."}, "questions": {"value": "1. See the Weaknesses part.\n2. Are the reconstruction results in Fig. 2 produced by the proposed method? If so, the quality of the reconstructed samples appears suboptimal—could the authors clarify this?\n3. In Fig. 3, the performance of DiffAD seems extremely poor, almost equivalent to random output. Could the authors explain the cause of this behavior or verify whether there might be an issue in the experimental configuration?\n4. How is the inference time reported in Table 12 calculated? Does it correspond to a single forward pass of the neural network, or to the entire denoising process? The reported time seems unusually large.\n5. Given that ImDiffusion has a relatively small number of parameters (also see Table 12), is the comparison fair?

It has two main parts. First, an signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) guided scheduler that replaces standard $\\beta$ schedules by targeting a terminal SNR and deriving per-step $\\alpha_t$ from a function $g(t)$. This makes the corruption level interpretable and consistent across runs. Second, SNR Implicit Conditioning (SIC) that estimates an input SNR by splitting each test window into a low-pass signal and a residual, then maps this estimate to a target signal-retention $\\alpha^\\*$ and chooses the closest diffusion step $\\hat T$. The reverse process then starts from $x_{\\hat T}$ and reconstructs to $x_0$. Anomaly scores are the reconstruction residuals on each window. The model uses a UNet-style backbone on 2D reshaped windows and keeps one set of hyperparameters across datasets.

This statement is also unclear.\n\n- In Sections 4.2 and 4.3, the variable $Z$ appears with both $l$ and $t$ subscripts, but it is unclear which one corresponds to $Z_0$ in expressions such as $\\mathbb{E}\\[\\||Z_0\\||_F^2\\]$. Please clarify the intended meaning of each $Z$ symbol.\n\n- The text suggests that $\\alpha_t$ and $M_t$ depend on each other, which reads as circular. Please state explicitly that a target terminal TSNR is first chosen, a specific example would clarify this. Also fix notation in the $\\mathrm{SNR}(t)$ equation (10) to use $\\bar{\\alpha}_t$ rather than $\\bar{\\alpha}_T$.\n\n- The paper repeatedly claims to achieve *deterministic reconstruction*, but the proposed procedure still **samples noise** when initializing the reverse process at $\\hat T$ via $x_{\\hat T} = \\sqrt{\\bar\\alpha_{\\hat T}}x_0 + \\sqrt{1-\\bar\\alpha_{\\hat T}}\\varepsilon.$ This is **not** determinism in the diffusion sense (which would correspond to DDIM with $\\eta=0$ or a closed-form sampling path). The goal of the paper is to get **input-consistent reconstruction rather than strict determinism**, so the terminology is confusing/misleading.\n\n- The paper reports only strict point-level metrics as the primary evaluation, but does not include point-adjusted or event-level scores used by many prior TSAD works. While strict evaluation is commendable and should remain the main protocol, adding point-adjusted or event-based metrics (even in the appendix) would allow fair comparison with earlier baselines that report only lenient metrics. Without both views, it is difficult to fully contextualize the reported gains.\n\n- Efficiency is mixed up with speed rather than real compute cost. Table 12 shows higher GFLOPS than DiffAD and ImDiffusion but still lower runtime, which suggests the model is actually doing more work per input but runs faster thanks to better GPU utilization or code efficiency. It is therefore unclear whether the method is truly efficient or simply well-optimized.\n\n- It is unclear whether the proposed *SNR Implicit Conditioning* actually achieves the intended effect. The paper does not report the distribution of selected start steps $\\hat{T}$ (e.g., mean and standard deviation per dataset), so it is difficult to verify that the ISNR-based selection is meaningful. A simple baseline would be to perform reconstruction starting from a fixed reduced step (e.g. $T/2$) as a hyperparameter, instead of always starting from full corruption. Without such comparison, it is hard to tell whether the gains come from the conditioning mechanism itself or from simply using fewer denoising steps."}, "questions": {"value": "- What do the superscripts in $x^{\\text{tar}}$ and $x^{\\text{con}}$ stand for?

Ambiguous dimensionality description.

The proposed SNR Implicit Conditioning assumes that normal sequences exhibit lower frequencies while anomalous sequences exhibit higher frequencies. This assumption is not universally valid. Some anomalies manifest through amplitude or trend deviations rather than frequency differences. Moreover, for frequency-dominant anomalies, existing frequency-domain methods could already achieve superior performance, diminishing the uniqueness of the proposed mechanism.\n\n6.
