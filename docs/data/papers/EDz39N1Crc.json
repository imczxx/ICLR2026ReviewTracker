Inference time uncertainty, which may provide a real-time signal to the model or external control modules, is particularly important for applying these concepts to improve the large language model user experience. While many of the existing papers consider model calibration, comparatively little work has sought to evaluate how closely model uncertainty aligns to human uncertainty. In this work, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using both established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they align with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model calibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment to human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer preference. For those successful metrics, we find moderate to strong evidence of model calibration in terms of both correctness correlation and distributional analysis.", "tldr": "We investigated whether a collection of LLM inference-time uncertainty measures show evidence of human similarity and calibration, with positive results for both.", "keywords": ["large language models", "alignment", "uncertainty quantification", "calibration"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7b1fa1bc73beffec0b7bf04af9e42549cef9bdfb.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/0716a95b6cc31e99f6d9e6f4733a13db30682ede.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "How aligned are LLMs' uncertainty to people's judgements of uncertainty?

The authors primarily use two datasets, which are public surveys conducted in the US, to gather human opinions. These datasets consist of questions asked over a wide range of dates (2017-2023), and are often on topical issues such as politics. Therefore, the human distribution is not stationary; however, all the LLMs tested are off-the-shelf open-source models, and therefore will have static cutoffs and remain stationary over the time period. Some questions will not make sense based on the cutoff in question, either due to the question already being resolved by the cutoff date, or because the premise of the question is not relevant at the time of the cutoff date yet.\n2. Furthermore, the actual impact of the current design is limited. The current design only looks at the aggregate human distribution of responses and how closely LLM logit distributions align with these out of the box – and this is alignment turns out to be weak w.r.t. the top token. Instead, the authors could have directly stated a goal such as using LLMs to replace humans in population surveys (a line of work which does have prior art and interest); and then conducted interventions to try and improve the simple baseline scores reported (such as prompting variations, etc).\n3. The paper does not provide examples of questions from the above human survey datasets, so I had to go track these down myself to find out what they look like.\n4. Regarding calibration, the authors detail some motivation for why they don’t simply use out-of-the-box normalised entropy, but this should be conducted as an ablation rather than simply stated.\n5. ‘Global’ entropy as used in the paper comes with the concomitant risk of distributional shift due to domain change, but this is not commented on nor experimented with by the authors.\n6. The analysis of calibration is restricted to simply the MCQ setting (which the authors acknowledge), even though it is easily extensible to the open-ended setting. Furthermore, only a single dataset is used, MMLU (though I acknowledge that this single dataset consists of multiple subject topics), and so out-of-distribution analysis – an important element of calibration analysis – cannot be, and is not, done here.\n7. The calibration section has no comparisons to baselines at all despite the plethora of previous works examining e.g. ECE on MMLU. It is therefore not clear what the intended contribution of this analysis is.\n8. One of the contributions listed in the introduction is the claim that top-p sampling in LLMs is equivalent to the notion of the highest density credible set in Bayesian statistics. The authors state that this is “an important but previously un-noted connection between the fields”. However, there is no justification or exposition in the paper to support this statement.

Analysis of the human agreement is conducted using three metrics: one focusing on measuring choice selection agreement, another focusing on preference ordering alignment, and the third one focusing on the discrepancy in human uncertainty and model’s uncertainty. \n      1.a.) Given the focus on measuring alignment between human group-level uncertainty and various UQ methods’ uncertainty, it is unclear why the first two metrics are necessary (the metrics are independent of any UQ method and instead fully rely on the model distribution). Could the authors motivate the relevance of including such analysis in the paper?\n      1.b.) To measure uncertainty alignment between UQ methods and human uncertainty, the paper proposes to measure the linear correlation between the UQ method and the entropy of the human distribution per answer. While using entropy provides an aggregate view of human uncertainty it loses information about which answer choice the model is more confident about. For instance, for a multiple choice question with 4 answer choices, the two distributions have the same entropy but refer to two completely different settings: [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75],  [0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0]. In other words, if I understand the setup correctly, the use of entropy as the proxy for human group-level uncertainty followed by pearson correlation may be an overoptimistic measure of alignment. This is further validated by lines 215-238 which state that models are only moderately aligned in the top-token but have different multiple choice ordering. Can the authors please clarify whether this is a problem and how they tackled it (e.g., post-hoc manual analysis)?\n3. In Section 5.1. The paper mentions the use of Spearman correlation between binary correctness and UQ measures (lines 274-275). However, due to the discreteness of the correctness variable, my intuition is that this is an ill-suited metric. Can you motivate this metric choice?\n\n\n**Clarity**: \n1. The paper positions itself as “inference-time uncertainty in LLMs”, defining this class of methods as “measures that are able to be calculated at any time during generation, without additional auxiliary generations” and “inference time measures are uniquely useful [...] without significant added computation”. However, in my understanding such definition does not exclude training time approaches – approaches which are not discussed in this paper. I suggest the authors further clarify the definition or that consider training-time approaches, i.e., approaches that approach calibration through fine-tuning models.\n2. Table 1 caption (page 4): add information about what bold faces mean.\n3. Lines 272-277 mention the analysis being split in two phases but only one phase is discussed: the analysis using Spearman correlation.\n4. Line 432 mentions “model itself may be unusually negatively calibrated”. Please explain what negatively calibrated implies, since in the original classification definition calibration values can only be between 0 and 1.\n\n\n**Supporting arguments**:\n1.
