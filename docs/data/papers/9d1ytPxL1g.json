While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer promising potential to automate annotation, their capability to replace human annotators remains underexplored. \nThis paper systematically investigates LVLMs' annotation quality and the performance of models trained on LVLM-generated labels. Our analysis reveals that LVLMs achieve competitive performance on common categories but lag behind humans on uncommon or ambiguous categories. Surprisingly, models trained on LVLM-generated labels outperform those trained on human-annotated labels in certain categories, suggesting imperfections in human annotations. \nMotivated by these findings, we propose \\textsc{LVLMAnt}, a novel framework for image tagging, which aims to achieve human-level annotation ability. \\textsc{LVLMAnt} comprises two components: Prompts-to-Candidates (P2C), which employs group-wise prompting and annotation ensembling to efficiently produce a candidate set that covers as many true labels as possible while reducing subsequent annotation workload; and Concept-Aligned Disambiguation (CAD), which interactively calibrates the semantic concept of categories in the prompts and effectively refines the candidate labels.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate \\textsc{LVLMAnt}’s effectiveness in balancing annotation quality and automation, significantly reducing reliance on manual effort while achieving performance comparable to human annotations.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large vision-language model", "image tagging"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c559baadb857e9d3e7b09baa750833d45cc260e9.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/071c9f52985d9a206d1bd2dca040c32d07b1bd44.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates if LVLMs can be used as an alternative to Human annotations for image tagging task.
