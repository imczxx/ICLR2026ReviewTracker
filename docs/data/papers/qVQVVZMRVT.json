To address the limitations of existing non-uniform quantization methods, which typically rely on fixed codebooks and require costly optimization, we propose a novel arbitrary bit-width non-uniform Quantization (NuBitQ). The framework enables flexible, layer-specific quantization strategies, significantly enhancing adaptability and efficiency. Notably, traditional outlier compensation methods used in uniform quantization are ill-suited for the anomalous distribution characteristics encountered in our context. To address this, we design a novel outlier evaluation metric that integrates weight perturbation, activation distribution, and perturbation propagation. Based on this metric, we further develop an Outlier Compensation Plugin (OCP) that implements multi-level, fine-grained outlier compensation strategies, effectively mitigating performance degradation caused by outliers. Our approach avoids direct complex Hessian computation and fine-tuning, offering strong applicability and scalability. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks and across various model series demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "tldr": "Flexible arbitrary bit-width non-uniform quantization with multi-level outlier compensation for efficient LLM compression.", "keywords": ["outliers", "Quantization"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1fdc48a793844e59ebb7a31a6ac3ac31e015a4c3.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c94c85158b9166850edfb8e4d16f5afc9277f04b.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work studies the (1) Non-uniform quantization, (2) outlier impact, and (3) outlier compensation by minimization.

First, the final OCP methodology seems like the standard calibration with different levels of granularity. This resembles the AQLM's multi-phase optimization that first tackles the layer-wise quantization and then tackles the inter-layer error. Conceptually, there is nothing new about OCP, given that it has been extensively applied in dozens of PTQ works. \n\n- Moreover, the OCP method seems to be compatible with any quantization algorithms, not just non-uniform quantization. If this is the case, then the authors need to compare a lot of uniform baselines. \n\n- Third, I did not understand the necessity of Section 3.2.2. I have checked Appendix D for the detailed derivation of the outlier score. However, I should emphasize that the derivation is definitely not rigorous. The logarithm makes no sense to add. To me, this is just to prevent the exploding effect of the subsequent layers' weight norm. The Jacobian should contain the gradients of na on-linear function, while this work directly ignores them. Furthermore, this outlier score has nothing to do with outliers; it is just a metric to analyze importance. Again, this score seems to be applicable to all kinds of parameters and activations, not just outliers.

The authors argue that while non-uniform quantization reduces overall error compared to uniform methods, it creates novel and less-understood outlier patterns that are not concentrated in specific channels but rather distributed across what they term \"outlier blocks.\" To tackle this, they propose a two-part framework. The first part is NuBitQ, a flexible non-uniform quantization scheme supporting arbitrary bit-widths and layer-specific configurations without relying on costly Hessian computations. The second contribution is the OCP, a module designed to mitigate performance degradation from these outlier blocks. The OCP is guided by a novel, efficiently computed outlier score that approximates the impact of quantization error by considering weight perturbation, activation statistics, and error propagation through subsequent layers. Based on this score, OCP applies a hierarchy of compensation strategies at the sub-layer, block, and model levels.

This suggests that the OCP's effectiveness may be dependent on the underlying quantization scheme, potentially conflicting with the claim of broad applicability.\n\n2.The complete NuBitQ-OCP framework involves a considerable number of hyperparameters, including the quantization parameters, the number of compensation levels, and the thresholds that govern the selection of compensation strategies.
