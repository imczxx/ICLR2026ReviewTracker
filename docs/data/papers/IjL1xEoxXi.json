Tailoring the vanilla dual gradient ascent algorithm to the Sobolev geometry, we derive a scalable Sobolev gradient ascent (SGA) algorithm to compute the barycenter for input distributions supported on a regular grid. Despite the algorithmic simplicity, we provide a global convergence analysis that achieves the same rate as the classical subgradient descent methods for minimizing nonsmooth convex functions in the Euclidean space. A central feature of our SGA algorithm is that the computationally expensive $c$-concavity projection operator enforced on the Kantorovich dual potentials is unnecessary to guarantee convergence, leading to significant algorithmic and theoretical simplifications over all existing primal and dual methods for computing the exact barycenter. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior empirical performance of SGA over the existing optimal transport barycenter solvers.", "tldr": "This paper introduces a constraint-free, concave dual formulation for the Wasserstein barycenter, and proposes a scalable Sobolev gradient ascent algorithm with convergence guarantee.", "keywords": ["optimal transport; Wasserstein barycenter; concave dual; gradient ascent;"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/54b06d839ec86e52eb942fe9c8ba8f202c1d9536.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e8b22967798c89cbe3d17446a42c7b1b4959f5f4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper,  the authors propose an algorithm for computation of the exact Wasserstein barycenter for a collection of input distributions discretized over a regular grid.

For example, as the authors claim themself in lines 101-105, the developed algorithm is not suitable for the distributions of the dimensions higher than 3D. Besides, the algorithm is designed for the computation of the optimal transport barycenter under the quadratic cost function assumption. This point also could be listed among the limitations of the developed methodology. While I understand that the listed limitations might correspond not to the algorithm itself, but rather to the particular  class of the algorithms for exact barycenter computation, I have other concerns regarding the demonstration of the practicality of the proposed algorithm.\n\nSpecifically, all of the experimental results only show the ability of the method to compute the barycenter of distributions, but do not assess its ability to approximate well the optimal transport (OT) maps between each of the distributions and barycenter. I think that it is an important aspect since the learned maps have more practical use cases than the barycenter itself. Meanwhile, the authors do not perform comparison with the ground-truth barycenters which are known, e.g., for Gaussian distributions. Thus, I kindly suggest the authors to perform comparison of their approach with the ground-truth barycenter and OT maps in the setting with Gaussian distributions which are known thanks to (Chewi et al., 2020). \n\nThe related work section lacks the overview of recent methods for approximating the barycenter of continuous distributions (Fan et al, 2021; Chi et al., 2023; Noble et al., 2023; Kolesov et al, 2024a,b). I think these algorithms deserve mentioning since in lines 106-107 you write that “almost all existing barycenter algorithms are limited to 2D problems” which is not true when we are talking about the methods listed above. Thus, I kindly suggest the authors add the references in the related work sections and make the phrase in lines 106-107 more clear.\n\n**Overall**, I think that the experimental evaluation of the proposed approach  should be improved since now it lacks comparison with the ground-truth barycenters and OT maps which is important for clearly revealing the performance of the developed approach.\n\n**References.** \n\nFan, J., Taghvaei, A., and Chen, Y.
