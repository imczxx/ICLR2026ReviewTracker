While conformal selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR) control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y > c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as conjunctive or disjunctive conditions.  In this work, we propose the Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions and a global Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions, thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments.

The comparison with relevant baselines (Inter-cfBH, Union-cfBH) is appropriate and highlights the limitations of naive approaches.\n3.  **Clear Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written, with a logical flow from problem formulation to methodology, theory, and experiments. The figures, such as the illustrative diagrams, aid in understanding the core concepts."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  **Perceived Marginal Technical Contribution (Major Concern):** The fundamental idea can be viewed as generalizing the single-threshold selection $Y > c$ to a more general form $Y \\in I$. A significant portion of the theoretical and methodological machinery seems to be a direct adaptation of the established cfBH (Jin & Candès, 2023) framework.\n     - The problem could potentially be reframed by defining a suitable function $\\phi(Y, I)$ that encapsulates the multi-condition logic, reducing it to a single-threshold problem on $\\phi(Y, I)$. For instance, for an interval $I = (a, b)$, one could define $\\phi(Y, I) = \\min(b-Y, Y-a)$, where $\\phi(Y, I) > 0$ is equivalent to $Y \\in (a, b)$. A similar construction could be devised for disjunctive conditions. The core conformal p-value machinery and BH procedure from cfBH could then be applied to $\\phi(Y, I)$, potentially obviating the need for the newly proposed nonconformity scores and the specific \"global BH\" narrative. While the authors' approach of designing a regionally monotone score is one valid path, the paper would be significantly strengthened by directly addressing this alternative, more unified perspective. A discussion justifying why their specific decomposition (separate scores per interval + global BH) is preferable to a unified $\\phi$-function approach is crucial. The current presentation makes the contribution feel more like a specialized extension rather than a fundamental generalization.\n\n2.  **Clarity on Theoretical Novelty:** The proof techniques, particularly for Theorem 4.1, heavily rely on and extend the principles established in cfBH. The paper could more clearly delineate the specific novel technical challenges overcome in the multi-condition setting compared to the single-condition base.\n\n[1] Jin Y, Candès E J.

Please refer to weakness 1.\n2. **On Experimental Design and Interpretation:** \n    - The experiments primarily feature a small number of conditions (e.g., Tasks 1-6 in Table 2). A key claim of the method is its generalizability to diverse condition combinations. How does the power of MCCS scale as the number of intervals $K$ becomes large?\n    - The paper reports aggregate FDR and power. It would be insightful to analyze which specific conditions (which intervals ) contribute most to the discoveries. Does the global BH procedure lead to a balanced selection across all target intervals, or does it favor intervals with certain characteristics?\n3. **On the Equivalent Interval Representations:** Consider a target interval $I = (a, b)$. This can be equivalently expressed as a single interval or decomposed into two sub-intervals $(a, c] \\cup [c, b)$ (for $K=2$). While these two representations are semantically equivalent in defining the target set, will they lead to different algorithmic constructions?
