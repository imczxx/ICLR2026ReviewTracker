Network dismantling, the targeted removal of nodes to fragment a network, is essential for analyzing and improving system robustness. Existing dismantling methods suffer from key limitations: they depend on global structural knowledge, exhibit slow running times on large networks, and overlook the network’s latent geometry, a key feature known to govern the dynamics of complex systems. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Latent Geometry-Driven Network Automata (LGD-NA), a novel framework that leverages local network automata rules to approximate effective link distances between interacting nodes. LGD-NA is able to identify critical nodes and capture latent manifold information of a network for effective and efficient dismantling. We show that this latent geometry-driven approach outperforms all existing dismantling algorithms, including spectral Laplacian-based methods and machine learning ones such as graph neural networks and . We also find that a simple common-neighbor-based network automata rule achieves near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of minimal local information for dismantling. LGD-NA is extensively validated on the largest and most diverse collection of real-world networks to date (1,475 real-world networks across 32 complex systems domains) and scales efficiently to large networks via GPU acceleration. Finally, we leverage the explainability of our common-neighbor approach to engineer network robustness, substantially increasing the resilience of real-world networks. Our results confirm latent geometry as a fundamental principle for understanding the robustness of real-world systems, adding dismantling to the growing set of processes that network geometry can explain.", "tldr": "Latent Geometry-Driven Network Automata dismantles networks by estimating effective link distances on the latent manifold via local rules, outperforming all existing methods on 1,475 real-world networks and runs efficiently on large systems via GPU.", "keywords": ["network robustness", "network dismantling", "network geometry", "network science", "complex systems", "network automata", "graphs", "network topology"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b8dd71cdc81a1fc75731b750082ffc92fe4dc7af.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/239b53c8ae47e797744ac5f9d9c8850b58043a7f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Latent Geometry-Driven Network Automata (LGD-NA) for network dismantling—sequentially removing nodes to fragment a graph.

At present, it is an extension of small-world theory with no clear application.\n\n\n\n\nThe paper makes overly general claims about manifolds and the applications of this approach that must be scaled back, e.g, \"network geometry captures essential structural and dynamical properties of complex systems\". There is also the strong claim: \"a novel strategy to engineer network robustness\". The latter claim is unsubstantiated. Robustness is undefined; you are engineering graph-theoretical properties, not a precise notion of robustness.\n\nOriginally, small-world graph research showed that systems possess shared graph metrics. Now, you are using dismantling methods, but for what purpose? You need to show how dismantling impacts system performance. All you do is apply small-world theory with an application driven framework, and you MUST look at the application.\n\nYou need to be more precise about your use of manifolds and manifold theory. In complex systems, a latent manifold is a hidden, often lower-dimensional structure that captures the essential dynamics or configurations of the system. These manifolds are not directly observable but can be inferred from data using techniques like:\n\n--Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP, Isomap)\n\n--Autoencoders and variational autoencoders (VAEs)\n\n--Diffusion maps or spectral embeddings\n\n--Manifold learning in dynamical systems (e.g., Koopman operator theory)\n\nGraph metrics like small-worldness, degree heterogeneity, clustering coefficient, and community structure are NOT manifolds themselves, but they characterize the topology of networks that may be embedded in or arise from latent manifolds.\n\n--Community structure can hint at stratification or clustering on a manifold.\n--Small-worldness suggests short geodesic distances on a latent space.\n--Degree heterogeneity may reflect curvature or singularities in the manifold.\n\n Manifolds in complex systems can be:\n\n--Non-Euclidean: Curved, with nontrivial Riemannian metrics.\n\n--Stratified: Composed of multiple manifolds of different dimensions glued together (e.g., hybrid systems with discrete modes).\n--Singular: Containing points where the manifold structure breaks down (e.g., bifurcations, phase transitions).\n\nMulti-scale: Different dynamics dominate at different scales, requiring nested or hierarchical manifolds.\n\nSo while these metrics are topological descriptors, they can be indirect indicators of underlying manifold geometry.\n\nFor example, a system that can operate in multiple modes may have different structural properties important per mode. This corresponds to a system (in your sense) having different small-world metrics representing different modes.
