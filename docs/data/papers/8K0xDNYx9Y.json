To quantify the informational content of individual samples during training, we introduce a method that compares the loss value of each sample with the average loss of all samples, resulting in four fundamental scenarios. These scenarios can be combined to describe the transition process of a sample’s loss relative to the average loss throughout training. The informational value of a sample is then derived based on the influence weights associated with these four scenarios. However, computing the influence weights for all four scenarios requires substantial computational resources. To address this challenge, we approximate the sample transition process using one core scenario—where the loss of a single sample transitions from above the average loss to below it between adjacent phases of model training—to estimate the sample’s informational value. Additionally, since the informational contribution of a single sample may vary across different phases of training, we employ an early stopping iteration to determine the count of such core transitions, thereby obtaining a core subset of data enriched with high informational value for model training. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively eliminates redundant and noisy data, significantly enhances model performance when training on smaller target-scale core subsets, and remains effective on large-scale datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Data Pruning", "Loss Transition"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/df6322eee5896d5bd480a3c9a0dabbc015dc5d67.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/e2c1a08b106519bad34b8fea9edc8b02d7ba7a05.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes FATB, a zero-order data pruning method that identifies informative samples by counting how often a sample’s loss transitions from being above the dataset’s average loss to below it during early training epochs of a proxy model.

The abstract should be rewritten for clarity. The current version contains many undefined terms and overly abstract wording. For example:\n    1. The naming of FATB is not explained.\n    2. In line 20, the authors mention comparing the loss value of each sample with the average loss across all samples, resulting in *four fundamental scenarios*. However, there is no detailed explanation of what these four scenarios actually are. Since the abstract keeps referring to them, readers may find it confusing. Consider adding a pointer to Figure 1 at least.\n    3. Moreover, since the method focuses only on one transition, which is “*from above-average to below-average loss”.*  there is no need to mention *four scenarios*. It would be clearer to describe only the relevant transition and emphasize the core idea (lines 26–28): “the loss of a single sample transitions ~ to estimate the informational value of the sample.” This sentence best captures what FATB does, while lines 23–25 can be omitted as they do not contribute meaningfully to describing the algorithm.\n    4. In line 31, the phrase “Extensive experiments” seems like an overclaim, as the presented experiments are not that comprehensive.\n2. Section 3 lacks the clarity necessary for comprehension. The main issues are as follows:\n    1. The function $\\ell(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is not defined. At minimum, the authors should state that it represents the loss function.\n    2. In line 144, the authors define $U = {(x_m, y_m)}\\_{m=1}^M$ as the core data subset. However, since the training dataset $S$ was defined as ${(x_n, y_n)}_{n=1}^N$, this definition implies that the core subset simply consists of the first $M$ samples in $S$, without any selection process. The authors should redefine $U$.\n    3. It is recommended to denote the pruning ratio with a mathematical symbol (e.g., $r$) rather than plain text (pr) for consistency in notation.\n    4. In Section 3.2, the term FATB never appears, even though “Method” is the title of the section. The authors should explicitly state that “This method is referred to as FATB.”\n    5. In Section 3.1, vectors are written using bold notation (e.g., $\\mathbf{x}$), but starting from Section 3.2, the boldface is dropped (e.g., $x$). For consistency, the authors should choose one notation style and use it throughout.\n    6. Method section (lines 189–249) needs a substantial rewrite.\n        - Over-definition without use. Equations (5)–(10) introduce several constructs that are never used later. If they are not required by the final algorithm, they should be removed or moved to the appendix.\n        - Focus the method on the single relevant transition. The core idea of FATB is the transition from *above-average* to *below-average* loss. Other “scenarios” are ancillary and better treated as ablations, not as main-text definitions. Defining scenario (a), scenario (b), … in the body then discarding them obscures the contribution.\n        - Reduce indicator-function nesting. The manuscript repeatedly defines events via nested indicator functions (e.g., $\\mathrm{STP}(x_n,y_n;t)=\\mathbf{1}({\\mathrm{BSA}})$ where $\\mathrm{BSA}=\\mathbf{1}({\\mathrm{HTL}\\land \\mathrm{ETL}})$, and so on). This stacking is hard to read and easy to misinterpret. Define events once using plain-language predicates (or simple inequalities), then use a single indicator if needed.\n    7. The key quantity, FATB for each $(x_n, y_n)$, is defined as $\\sum_{t=1}^T \\mathrm{STP}((x_n, y_n); t)$, but it appears only as a sentence within the “In Summary” paragraph. This equation should be explicitly displayed in the Method section, preceded by a clear explanation that $\\mathrm{BSA}$ is a per-time event and that FATB simply counts how many times it occurs over $t = 1, \\dots, T$, where $T$ denotes the cutoff iteration.\n    8. In addition, consider adding a brief interpretation of FATB (for example, “higher values indicate more frequent transitions from hard to easy, implying greater informational value and higher priority for retention”).\n3. Rationale for selecting BSA is unclear. Additional ablations on the other three scenarios are needed. Although Table 5 reports results for the alternatives, accuracy alone does not justify the choice. Please explain why BSA should be considered more informative than the other scenarios, and include further ablations beyond accuracy.\n4. It appears that only a single random seed was used in the experiments. Since there is no mention of the number of runs or any reported standard deviation, the results seem to be based on a single trial. This raises concerns about statistical reliability. The authors should rerun each experiment with at least five different random seeds and report the mean and standard deviation. Without such analysis, the current results cannot be considered trustworthy.\n5. The set of baselines compared in the paper is outdated. To properly situate the method's performance within the current literature, it is crucial to include comparisons against recent and relevant SOTA methods. A few examples include CCS [1], D2-pruning [2], Dyn-Unc [3], and DUAL (with $\\beta$ sampling) [4].\n6. Although the method has only one hyperparameter, the cutoff iteration, tuning this parameter is essential and incurs a substantial computational cost. In particular, the authors search over all possible cutoff iterations every 10 epochs for each pruning ratio, which requires full training runs. Therefore, the claim that the method is computationally efficient because it can terminate early is not convincing. On the contrary, since the cutoff iteration must be searched for every pruning ratio, the method is computationally inefficient. Moreover, if a new pruning ratio (for example, 40%) is introduced, the search process must be repeated, further increasing the computational burden.\n7. Algorithm 1 in Appendix B should be rewritten for clarity.\n    - Avoid using plain text within the pseudocode. For example, lines such as “According to Equation 2, compute average loss $L_t$,” “Select top $n \\times (1-pr)$ samples with highest counts,” and “$Z \\gets \\text{selected samples}$” should be replaced with concise, formal pseudocode expressions.\n    - If the cutoff iteration $DT = T$ (the total number of iterations), the algorithm cannot return the selected samples, because $t$ runs only from 0 to $T-1$, and the if condition is satisfied only when $t \\geq DT$. This logic should be adjusted.\n    - When the if condition is not satisfied, the algorithm still returns $Z$ (line 20), but $Z$ has never been defined in that case. Moreover, there is no need to return $Z$ if the if block is never executed.\n    - For clarity, change the if condition to $t = DT$.\n    - Do not use set notation ${}$ as a comment.\n    - The variable $P$ (line 12) is introduced but never used anywhere. Clarify its purpose or remove it.\n    \n    In addition to these points, many other lines contain similar issues, so a full rewrite of the algorithm is recommended.\n    \n\n**Minor**\n\n1. The explanation of the results is overly verbose. The section mainly lists percentage improvements over Random or TDDS for every experiment, which does not provide meaningful insight. Summaries should focus on key trends or qualitative interpretations rather than raw percentage comparisons.\n2. On page 7, consider swapping the positions of Table 3 and the Large-Scale Dataset Evaluation Results paragraph to improve readability and logical flow.\n3. Comments on Figures and Tables:\n    1. The width of several tables exceeds the text area. Please resize them to fit within the main text width.\n    2. Figure labels and legends are too small and difficult to read; increase their font size for clarity.\n    3. The term “Static Random” seems unnecessary. Since all compared methods are static pruning methods and no Dynamic Random baseline is presented, this label can be simplified to “Random”.\n    4. In Tables 6 and 7 (Appendix), descriptions such as experiment setting should appear in the main text, not in the caption. Captions should contain only information essential for interpreting the table or figure.\n    5. In Table 5, all epoch numbers end with 9. It would be clearer to start counting epochs from 1 and align the values to round numbers rather than zero-based indexing.\n    6. Only the ImageNet results are formatted with three decimal places, while others use two. Please standardize the formatting for consistency.\n4. Please include a pointer in the main text to the results on the noisy dataset. Although these results are presented in the Appendix, readers may miss them without any reference in the main body.\n5. Throughout the paper, replace zero-order with zeroth-order for consistent and correct terminology.\n6. In line 230, change table 5 to Table 5 for consistency with capitalization style.\n7. In Table 1, correct EZLN to EL2N.\n8. Change the section title Proposed Methods to Proposed Method since the authors only propose FATB.\n9. The conclusion introduces new information. This section should focus on summarizing results and suggesting future work. The content in lines 484–485 should be explained earlier in the main text instead.\n10. In Appendix A, apply boldface formatting to Label Noise and Sample Corruption Noise.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Coverage-centric Coreset Selection for High Pruning Rates, ICLR 2023.\n\n[2] D2 Pruning: Message Passing for Balancing Diversity and Difficulty in Data Pruning, ICLR 2024.\n\n[3] Large-scale Dataset Pruning with Dynamic Uncertainty, CVPR Workshop 2024.\n\n[4] Lightweight Dataset Pruning without Full Training via Example Difficulty and Prediction Uncertainty, ICML 2025."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
