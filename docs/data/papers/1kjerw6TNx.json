As a fast-paced sport, badminton demands agility and rapid strategic decision making, making quick and precise predictions essential. Existing methods are primarily dependent on post-stroke trajectories, neglecting the underlying player and shuttlecock dynamics that fundamentally determine the landing point. Here, we propose a novel multimodal predictive framework, Conditional Gate-Based Cross-Fusion Network (ConFu). ConFu integrates four key information streams--three-dimensional (3D) shuttlecock trajectory reconstruction from monocular video, player dynamic localization, keypoint-based arm gesture, and stroke types--into proposed conditional gate LSTM and spatio-temporal transformer modules. Our model achieves a prediction accuracy of 92.6% with a mean absolute error of 0.20 meters, significantly outperforming existing methods by 7.8-10.5% in accuracy. Experimental validation on a real-world badminton dataset comprising 13,582 strokes demonstrates that ConFu provides immediate tactical feedback, saving 85% decision time compared to trajectory-based approaches. This time advantage is particularly valuable for practical applications such as enabling badminton robots to compute interception strategies. Our work establishes a foundation for intention-aware predictive models in dynamic sports environments, with broader implications for embodied AI and real-time human–machine interaction.

The model employs conditional gating and cross-fusion mechanisms to combine these multimodal cues and is trained using an L1 loss to predict the 2D drop point.

Some experiment selections are unclear as described in the Questions section.\n\n5. The model framework does not introduce much novelty. For instance, the module design seems to be a bit heuristic selection, e.g., using Transformer+CNN for 3D trajectory and conditional LSTM for gestures. It would be better if the authors could propose a unified and simplified structure so that it can be served as a fundamental architecture for future use.
