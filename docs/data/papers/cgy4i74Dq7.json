It first employs *Policy-Guided Supervised Fine-Tuning* to integrate explicit safety policies into the reasoning process, establishing a structured and interpretable foundation for safe decision-making. \nThen, PST applies *Safety Reasoning Preference Optimization* to encourage the model to generate safe, helpful, and informative responses while reducing oversensitive  and homogeneous characteristics.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that PST significantly reduces harmful outputs across multiple multimodal safety benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on general tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["MLRM", "safety", "alignment", "safety-helpfulness trade-off"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f10e50a3a1047959ad35047ca80c65739a571f2e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the safety-reasoning trade-off in Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs), highlighting that improved reasoning often coincides with increased harmful output rates.

The paper offers a clear and organized examination of safety degradation in MLRMs, identifying two representative mechanisms—visual attention drift and unsafe reasoning patterns. While parts of the analysis are qualitative, the work provides a useful foundation for understanding how reasoning-oriented tuning may influence safety performance across benchmarks.\n2.

The motivation underlying the claimed \"reasoning–safety trade-off\" is not entirely sound. In Section 3.1, the authors compare reasoning-tuned models with their corresponding base models and attribute the observed safety degradation to reasoning itself. However, this conclusion lacks causal rigor. The performance gap may simply stem from the absence of safety-aware data during reasoning-tuning rather than an inherent conflict between reasoning and safety. Moreover, the analysis does not control for data composition or fine-tuning objectives, which weakens the validity of the stated correlation.\n2. The failure analysis in Section 3.2 appears rather subjective. The authors summarize two types of failure modes but do not describe the process or key data used to derive them. For example, it remains unclear what proportion of the failed cases fall under *Visual Attention Drift* or *Unsafe Reasoning Patterns*. Moreover, no empirical evidence is provided to show that *Visual Attention Drift* directly causes unsafe behavior, the logical connection between the two is not clearly established, even though they are observed to co-occur statistically.\n3. The proposed Policy-Guided Safety Tuning (PST) framework is conceptually similar to existing approaches (e.g., Sun et al., 2023; Guan et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025). The paper does not clearly articulate how PST substantively differs from or advances beyond these prior frameworks beyond its multimodal setting. \n\n[1] Sun Z, Shen Y, Zhou Q, et al.
