The emerging field of AI Control (AIC) aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce the notion of Control tax---the operational and financial cost of integrating control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["AI control", "scalable oversight", "AI safety"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f27a38e39bddf301e7acc0f1b6184043fe5f9ab8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a370e3e070abab25f713f54527ed83e1ece9b32e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces the concept of Control Tax—the operational and financial cost of implementing oversight mechanisms in AI systems, especially under the framework of AI Control (AIC).

This formulation is original in that it treats oversight not only as a technical alignment problem but as a resource allocation problem. Prior work in AI control has largely focused on proving that monitoring protocols can succeed in principle; this manuscript instead addresses the conditions under which they are practically adoptable. The resulting framework allows different safety targets to be expressed in terms of budget and auditing strategy, which provides a concrete decision structure for practitioners considering real deployment contexts. \n\nThe empirical component is constructed with clear methodological discipline. The attacker and monitor models are evaluated using a standardized APPS coding task environment, which ensures controlled variation across experiments. Backdoored solutions are generated using an agentic multi-step pipeline that enforces correctness on public test cases and explicitly validates malicious triggers, ensuring that the resulting dataset meaningfully distinguishes intentional vulnerabilities from ordinary programming errors. The monitoring task is operationalized through a calibrated suspiciousness scoring procedure, rather than binary detection, which makes the measurements directly compatible with downstream auditing-budget analyses. The breadth of models evaluated, combined with balanced datasets and formatting normalization (e.g., comment stripping), helps reduce confounds arising from stylistic artifacts. \n\nThe theoretical modeling is presented with clarity. The manuscript explains how ROC curves derived from the monitoring evaluations map into dynamic auditing decisions in both batch and sequential settings. The derivation of safety probabilities under optimal attacker and defender strategies is shown with reference to established stochastic process frameworks, and intermediate assumptions are made explicit. The paper consistently connects the modeling back to operational interpretations, explaining not just the mathematical structure but also how the defender’s auditing schedule should be shaped across time. \n\nThe significance of the work lies in providing a tractable bridge between monitor accuracy metrics and deployment-level safety guarantees. Organizations deciding whether to deploy model oversight systems require not only performance comparisons but also cost and scheduling implications. This manuscript offers a structured method for inferring how much auditing is needed to maintain a desired safety level and how that cost changes when adopting a stronger or weaker monitor. These results directly inform strategy discussions in AI governance, red-teaming design, and scalable oversight implementation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The primary limitation of the work lies in the assumption of a stateless, non-adaptive attacker. In the empirical pipeline, the attacker generates backdoors independently and does not update strategy based on audit outcomes or monitor behavior. In practice, attackers (human or model-based) may iteratively probe the monitoring boundary, learn suspiciousness patterns, and reduce detection rates over time. The theoretical analysis also assumes that the red team maintains a fixed insertion probability optimized only with respect to the task horizon. Extending the framework to adaptive attackers—for example, those modeling the monitor as a learnable discriminator—would materially strengthen claims about real-world robustness. The manuscript acknowledges this scenario but does not examine parameter regimes in which adaptivity meaningfully alters the Control Tax. \n\nThe evaluation domain is restricted to code backdooring in APPS. This setting has several desirable properties (e.g., clear correctness signals, deterministic vulnerability definitions), but it differs from domains where oversight is often considered most critical, such as multi-step planning, agentic task execution, or socially mediated harm. The specific structure of programming tasks—particularly the existence of public test cases that constrain solution space—may limit the diversity of viable backdoors and thus the challenge imposed on monitors. It remains uncertain whether the same monitoring strategies and cost-safety trade-offs apply when failures are less crisply defined or when correctness requires implicit world modeling. A discussion of transferability, or a small-scale extension to one additional domain with less explicit ground truth, would clarify the scope of applicability. \n\nThe Control Tax curves depend on model cost estimates treated as fixed. In real deployment settings, inference cost varies substantially across hardware configurations, batching strategies, and licensing models. While this does not undermine the conceptual framework, it means the curves are best interpreted as relative guidance rather than directly actionable cost predictions. The manuscript could strengthen its practical significance by characterizing sensitivity to cost assumptions (e.g., showing how safety frontiers change when monitor cost decreases by an order of magnitude, or when attackers and monitors use locally deployed models instead of hosted APIs)."}, "questions": {"value": "How does the framework change if the attacker adapts to the monitor’s observed actions over time?\n\nHow sensitive are the cost-benefit conclusions to different pricing assumptions for inference compute?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "ww8kZZR4EL", "forum": "BpyR6Wkl1c", "replyto": "BpyR6Wkl1c", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12678/Reviewer_WjCo"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12678/Reviewer_WjCo"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12678/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761870742747, "cdate": 1761870742747, "tmdate": 1762923516255, "mdate": 1762923516255, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Control Tax, a framework for quantifying the operational and financial costs (“tax”) associated with adding oversight mechanisms—monitors—to AI systems.
