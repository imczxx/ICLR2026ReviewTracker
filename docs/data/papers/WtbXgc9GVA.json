I think the idea of applying direct optimization on low rank manifold for LLM training is already considered in LORO [1]. Although LORO is for pre-training, it can be applied to fine-tuning very easily (with a fixed pre-trained model). I'm wondering how the proposed method perform conparing to this variant of LORO? Since LORO is the first to consider this proposed approach of low rank manifold optimization, I feel the discussion is not sufficient in the current manuscript to compare to it.\n2. Clarity around G in Eq. (4): Readers may be confused because $G$ appears in the manifold parameterization but seems to disappear in later sections. It remains unclear which quantities are actually treated as trainable parameters in Algorithm 4 and which are only auxiliary. Please state explicitly what is stored, what is recomputed during retraction, and what constitutes the model’s trainable state.\n3. No memory footprint comparison: The paper measures time overheads but omits GPU memory / parameter-state comparisons vs. LoRA, DoRA, etc. A table counting trainable params and optimizer states per layer (e.g., Adam’s m/v vs. Riemannion’s HB state) would strengthen claims of “no prominent overhead.” This is an important piece of information that is missing, since LoRA is designed to be a parameter or memory efficient optimizer.\n4. For Table 1, is it exactly one set of hyperparameters used for Riemannion to achieve all these superior performance **across all tasks**? If so, I think this would be quite astonishing. If not, would it be a bit unfair if the authors didn't search hyperparameters for other methods?\n5. A minor point: The geometry section is readable, but several practical choices (which Ortho operator was used in which layer types; retraction accuracy vs. rank; momentum transport details) are scattered. I suggest consolidating everything into an implementable algorithm, not just one step as in Algorithm 4.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Mo, Zhanfeng, Long-Kai Huang, and Sinno Jialin Pan. \"Parameter and memory efficient pretraining via low-rank riemannian optimization.\" The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations. 2025."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "92RDg8HKNt", "forum": "WtbXgc9GVA", "replyto": "WtbXgc9GVA", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20503/Reviewer_vCt2"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20503/Reviewer_vCt2"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20503/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760928716705, "cdate": 1760928716705, "tmdate": 1762933931048, "mdate": 1762933931048, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposed a novel Muon-style LoRA vairant through the lens of Riemannian optimization.

Feasible Region of (Eq 14)**\n\nTo my understanding, the authors aim to initialize the LoRA factors such that it can be optimized towards the fastest loss decrease direction on the low-rank manifold. In this case, does that means we should constraint the norm (or magnitude) of the LoRA factors in Eq. 14? Otherwise, scaling the LoRA initializaiton will lead to larger Riemannian gradients. \n\n--------------\n\n**Concern 2. Ablation on LOI**\n\nFrom my experience, the intialization of LoRA factors is usually chosen to ensure the adapted weight is identical to the loaded pretrained model, ensuring the model does not deviate from the well-trained local optima significantly. However, it seems that in LOI, a non-zero modification is made to the adapted weight. Does this affect the performance of the model? I recommend the authors to add discussion on this issue, and provide ablation studies to clarify the impace of LOI on the general performance of the proposed method.\n\n--------------\n\n**Concern 3. Effectiveness of the proposed methods on classic low-rank matrix optimization.**\n\nTo my understanding, the derivation of the proposed methods does not relies on specific assumptions on the optimization task. I recommend the authors to provide additional experiments on classic Riemannian optimization tasks to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in solving classic low-rank matrix optimization problems [1] that are more general and natural than the LLM finetuning tasks.\n\n[1].
