We present GraphK, a novel encoder-sampler-decoder framework for graph generation that overcomes these challenges through structural flexibility and computational efficiency. Unlike autoregressive approaches constrained by vocabulary size (i.e. number of nodes in graph generation), GraphK enables both upsampling (generating graphs with more nodes than the input) and downsampling, providing fine-grained control over output graph size. By learning permutation-invariant latent representations and sampling new node embeddings via maximum likelihood estimation, GraphK generalizes across graph sizes and structures. For edge generation, we employ link prediction with a KDTree-based top-k neighbour search in the latent space, reducing computational cost. Based on the manifold smoothness assumption, our method effectively captures graph properties. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphK outperforms existing methods, accurately learns graph structures, and generates synthetic graphs without requiring explicit definitions.", "tldr": "We propose a non-autoregressive graph generation method that allows flexible control over graph size and structure using node sampling and neighborhood-based edge construction.", "keywords": ["Graph Generation", "Maximum Likelihood Estimation", "Link Prediction", "KDTree"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1f9c13fbfeb0e6defebdfa929c90b3ac92ea577c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/66efb1e0b7dd20c107aa6b8b14430991979cfd17.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes GraphK, a novel permutation-invariant and scalable graph generation framework.\n\n\nGraphK follows a modular encoder–sampler–decoder architecture:\n\nEncoder: Maps the input graph into a latent space using either Node2Vec or VGAE embeddings.\nSampler: Fits a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) on these node embeddings to enable scalable sampling, allowing upscaling or downscaling of graph size.\nDecoder: Generates edges using a k-nearest neighbor (KDTree) search in the latent space.\n\nGraphK claims three major advantages: 1) Permutation invariance (independent of node ordering)\n2) Scalability (generation beyond training graph sizes), and\n3) Computational efficiency (near-linear complexity).\n\nExperiments on synthetic community graphs, protein datasets, and CiteSeer show that GraphK achieves competitive or superior performance to GraphVAE, GraphRNN, and NetGAN under MMD-based structural similarity metrics (spectral, orbit, motif).\n\nWhile the paper is well written, clearly structured, and easy to follow, the experimental and theoretical evidence supporting its main claims remains limited.\n\n* Limited Comparison to Scalable Deep Baselines:\nWhile the paper compares against GraphRNN, NetGAN, and DiGress, it omits scalable graph generators such as **BiGG [1]**, which achieves state-of-the-art structure preservation with memory cost 𝑂(ElogN). Including BiGG baselines would enable a comprehensive evaluation.\n\n* Permutation Invariance: \nAlthough GraphK emphasizes permutation-invariant graph generation, the paper provides no formal proof or justification of this property. In particular, it is unclear how the gradient updates with respect to parameters remain invariant under node permutations, especially given that the Node2Vec encoder is not strictly permutation invariant (its random-walk–based embeddings depend on node identities).\n\n* Scalability:\nThe framework is theoretically claimed to scale to graphs with >10k of nodes [table 1] due to its 𝑂(𝑁log𝑁) decoding complexity. However, the largest empirical test involves graphs of only about 4,000 nodes. Demonstrating results on large graphs (>10K nodes) would provide stronger empirical support for this scalability claim.\n\n\n* No Ablation on Encoder Type:\nThe paper claims flexibility in encoder choice (Node2Vec, VGAE, etc.), yet no ablation or quantitative analysis is presented to validate this claim. Since the encoder choice critically influences the latent representation and downstream sampling, an encoder ablation would strengthen the paper claim.\n\n* Limited Dataset:\nThe experiments are limited to small and medium-sized graphs (protein, community, and CiteSeer datasets). Expanding to widely used benchmarks such as grid and lobster graphs—used in prior works including BiGG and GraphRNN would better demonstrate the generality of the proposed framework.\n\n[1] Dai, Hanjun, et al. \"Scalable deep generative modeling for sparse graphs.\" International conference on machine learning.
