While dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in predicting future node attributes, they often fail to capture the complex spatial-temporal interactions between nodes, limiting their performance. In this paper, we introduce STDMD, a novel dynamic GNN model that incorporates meta spatial-temporal decoupling to effectively capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in node attributes. By leveraging meta-learning, STDMD adapts to the evolving spatiotemporal patterns of node data, improving the accuracy and robustness of predictions. Specifically, our model dynamically refines spatial and temporal representations through an iterative meta-optimization process, allowing for more effective learning of dynamic node interactions. Furthermore, STDMD is designed to generalize across different dynamic graph structures, making it highly scalable and adaptable to realworld applications. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that STDMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its ability to model dynamic node attributes with greater precision and robustness.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Dynamic Graph Neural Networks", "Spatiotemporal Forecasting", "Meta-Learning"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/35ace82e8fbc2a0dd5d52a0a9749e5141b871cf1.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This study considers the dynamic node attribute forecasting task on discrete-time dynamic graphs (DTDGs).

The overall presentation of this paper need further improvement.\n\nIn lines 30-38, there are no related citations for the description of possible applications of node attribute forecasting.\n\nThe font size of Fig. 2 is too small, which is hard to read.\n\nThis paper does not provide any appendies to describe further details (e.g., see **W2**-**W6**), which are usually necessary.\n\n\n***\n**W2**. There a several unclear statements with weak motivations, which need further clarification.\n\nIn the caption of Fig. 1, it was claimed that 'traditional models mainly rely on direct spatial connections' but what traditional models and why (i.e, due to what mechanims)? It is suggested to combine the toy example in Fig. 1 with a set of concerete traditional methods (e.g., baslines in experiments) with clear citations, which can better demonstrate the limitations of existing techniques.\n\nIn lines 121-124, it was claimed that 'most existing methods focus on macro-level spatiotemporal features, overlooking fine-grained dynamics in evolving node attributes'. However, it reamins unclear how to define and measure macro-level and fine-grained sptaio-temporal features (e.g., in terms of what).\n\nIn lines 157-161, it was claimed that the proposed method consider dyanmic graphs, while the sketch in Fig. 2 shows that STDMD only uses a static graph (snapshot) as input, which may not be consistent. Moreover, dynamic node attributes wer also not illustrated in Fig. 2.\n\nFor the problem statement of node attribute forecasting (i.e., lines 159-161), should the edge set $E_{t+1}$ of next time step be provided as the input when predicting attributes ${\\bf{X}}_{t+1}$ of next time step. Otherwise, how does the node attributes forecasting task treat the variation of the lastest graph topology?\n\nThe definitin of dynamic graph in lines 189-192 is different from that in the formal problem statment (i.e., lines 157-159).\n\nMany details of STDMD (e.g., how to constuct support and query sets of both tasks via sampling) were not clearly demonstrated in the overview shown in Fig. 2. As a result, it is still unclear how does STDMD extactly work according to Fig. 2. It is suggested to combined Fig. 2 with a toy running example (e.g., a small dynamic graph where nodes are denoted by unique indices) to demonstrate how does it work.\n\nIt seems that Eq. (7) shoule use the element-wise multiplication (i.e., Hadamard product), while the current version of this paper uses the standard matrix multiplication operation.\n\n\n***\n**W3**. There is no pseudo-code to summarize the overall training and inference procedures of STDMD.\n\n\n***\n**W4**. Experiments are too simple, which may not fully validate the effectiveness of STDMD.\n\nWhile high scalability is one of the highlighted advantages of STDMD, all the datasets summarized in Table 1 are very small (i.e., in terms of the numbers of nodes, edegs, and time steps), which cannot demonstrate STDMD's high scalability. Some large datasets (e.g., with more than millions of nodes and time steps) are suggested to be added in experiments.\n\nThere are no descriptions to introduce details of dynamic attributes in each dataset (e.g., diemsnaionlity of attributes, physical meaning and value range of each dimension).\n\nEffciency analysis in Section 5.7 only compares the runtime of a small part of baselines, where results of some other baselines (e.g., GCN, GConvLSTM, STGCN, STSGCN, MegaCRN, MetaDGE, and DMetaGCRN as shown in Table 2) are missing.\n\nAlthough the complexity of STDMD was given Sectin 5.7, it remain unclear how to derive such a complexity by considering the overall training and inference procedures, as there are no detailed derivations for each step. It is also suggested to add further comparison with other baselines' complexities.\n\n\n***\n**W5**.

Another advantage of SOTA temporal link prediction / dynamic network embedding techniques is that they can support the advanced inductive inference, which can directly generalize the model trained on historical known topology to new unseen nodes.
