Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate clustering difficult.\nWe introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework that separates the observation and denoising space. \nThis separation is operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional observation space. \nThis unique ``input-space steering'' ensures the denoising trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers three key advantages:\n(1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via averaging, improve quality beyond the training set.\nWe evaluate robustness on both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset shifts. On real-world single-cell data,  our method demonstrates improved biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diffusion", "Plug-and-Play (PnP)", "Single-Cell Genomics"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d4d9b8d365060c473ecb846c2dd3b17b4be6aa70.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/5289b96ef3b864b5e374e9fe2de0442b5e9b3697.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces DICE (Diffusion Induced Cell Embeddings), a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework for denoising single-cell RNA-seq data.

Unclear problem framing and scope: The paper oscillates between four distinct objectives (atlas generation, batch integration, clustering, and denoising). This makes it difficult to assess the method's contribution.\n\n2. Insufficient quantitative evaluation:\n\n- The real-world experiments rely heavily on visual inspection of UMAP plots, which is subjective.\n\n- The authors claim that “across all four settings, DICE yields clearer separation in UMAP … than the PCA baseline, indicating more faithful recovery of the underlying classes.” However, the meaningfulness of this visual separation is unclear, given that UMAP does not preserve exact metric distances. If DICE truly recovers the underlying class structure better than PCA, then a simple classifier trained on these embeddings should achieve better precision/recall for predicting ground-truth cell type labels compared to the same classifier trained on PCA embeddings.\n\n- The paper suggests the method addresses batch effects and dataset shifts, yet provides no quantitative comparison with established integration methods (Harmony, Seurat integration, scVI).\n\n3. Missing experimental details and comparisons:\n\n- Hyperparameter sensitivity: Figure 5 shows dramatic sensitivity to ρ, but the paper provides no principled approach for selecting ρ in practice.\n\n- Robustness to k: k is set to 15 (synthetic), 25 (CITE-seq), or 15 (fetal brain), with the justification that it corresponds to “the elbow of the singular-value spectrum” for real data. However, no details are provided on how sensitive the results are to this choice. A sensitivity analysis would help assess the impact of different k values on performance.\n\n4. Questionable practical utility:\n\n- The model assumes an identical factor loading matrix V across reference and target datasets, but V represents transcriptional programs that differ across biological contexts. Obtaining reference data that simultaneously matches the target in cell type composition, tissue origin, disease state, and patient population characteristics is infeasible, limiting practical applicability.\n\n- Training takes ~11 hours for 9,000 cells; inference takes ~30 minutes for 1,000 cells with ρ=1. This is prohibitively expensive for typical single-cell datasets with 100K+ cells.\n\n- The cross-dataset experiment shows mixed results, raising doubts about generalization."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Any denoising method inevitably relies on certain distributional assumptions. The authors justify their design choices by citing prior work, which is reasonable, but the concern remains. For example, the Gaussian-noise assumption (“single-cell are often modeled with Gaussian noise,” line 251) may not always hold, and Eq. (5)–(6) depend on Gibbs sampling with intuitively motivated regularization terms. The authors may add further discussion or experiments exploring the impact of different likelihood/distributional assumptions (beyond current experimental setups) to demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the chosen modeling strategy.\n\nC2. Although the technical description is detailed, the paper would benefit greatly from a conceptual flowchart summarizing the input–output pipeline and the main computational steps. Such a figure would help readers grasp the end-to-end process—how data flow from raw expression profiles to denoised embeddings—without delving into mathematical detail, and would clarify the intuition behind core approximations or modifications.\n\nC3. In Section 1, the authors emphasize that applying image-based PnP frameworks directly to single-cell data is difficult because gene expression exhibits low-rank and correlated structure. However, the experiments do not compare DICE with straightforward or classical denoising baselines. Given that classic PCA is main baseline in the discussion, including or expanding such baseline comparisons would make the empirical validation more convincing.\n\nC4. It is unclear whether the key sentence \"Our framework is agnostic to specific preprocessing choices and accommodates diverse noise structures\" is supported or demonstrated in different places to prove that this paper is agnostic to preprocessing choices and tolerant to diverse noises. For example, do the noise level settings in the final experimental section reflect \"diverse\"?\n\nC5. The presentation is strong overall, but could still be refined. For example, Section 2 functions largely as preliminaries, yet the text uses first-person language and sometimes blurs whether new contributions are being proposed.

The evaluation compares primarily to a PCA baseline, which is too limited given the recent progress in single-cell denoising and clustering. Including comparisons with methods such as scSiameseClu, scDCCA, or SCDD would provide a more convincing empirical validation and better contextualize the proposed approach within current literature.\n2. One concern about DICE is that the generalizability to more complex data types is unclear. The method focuses solely on scRNA-seq gene expression and does not experimentally explore or theoretically support extension to multimodal or spatially-resolved single-cell data domains where denoising and latent structure recovery are at least as challenging.\n3. Although the plug-and-play approach is theoretically flexible, in practice the latent space is initialized via PCA (Section 3), and the factor loading matrix $\\widehat{V}$ is reused for high-dimensional projections throughout. As a result, the overall performance is partially determined by the initial PCA mapping and its limitations (e.g., axis alignment, linearity)—potentially biasing the outcome, especially when compared to nonlinear baselines (e.g., deep autoencoder, contrastive methods). The choice to always use PCA as a latent basis appears arbitrary and is not justified against recent nonlinear alternatives.\n4.
