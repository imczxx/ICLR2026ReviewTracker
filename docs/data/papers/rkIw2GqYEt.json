Despite recent advances, distilled models frequently suffer from superficial pattern memorization and subpar generalization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel distillation framework that moves beyond simple mimicry to instill a deeper conceptual understanding. Our framework features two key innovations. \\underline{\\textit{First}}, to address pattern memorization, Explanatory Inversion (EI) generates targeted ``explanatory probes'' that compel the student to articulate the underlying logic behind an answer, rather than just memorizing it. \\underline{\\textit{Second}}, to improve generalization, Explanatory GRPO (\\texttt{EXGRPO}) uses a reinforcement learning algorithm with a novel Dialogue Structure Utility Bonus, which explicitly rewards the student for maintaining a coherent reasoning process across these probes. Extensive evaluations on 12 datasets demonstrate significant improvements. Using Gemma-7b as the student model, our method yields an average \\textbf{20.39\\%} increase over zero-shot performance and a \\textbf{6.02\\%} improvement over the state-of-the-art distillation baselines. Moreover, models distilled with our method show remarkable training efficiency (e.g., surpassing vanilla fine-tuning with \\textbf{10-25\\%} training data) and strong generalization to out-of-distribution tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Model", "Knowledge Distillation"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/22a5b2b227b71e446495a81184830989d09db701.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/1afa920208bbdf6c52fcd3b6128ed1382bfd73f9.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a novel framework for distilling reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs) into smaller, efficient student models.
