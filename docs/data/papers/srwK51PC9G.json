To capture this structural programmability in a unified form, voxel representation provides a natural choice: it can express diverse classes of metamaterials including truss, shell, and porous metamaterials within a single cubic discretization. However, existing voxel-based generative models face severe limitations. The vast design space, combined with sparse and costly datasets, leads to a generalization dilemma: models tend either to memorize known designs, sacrificing novelty, or to produce invalid, low-quality structures. To address this, we propose VOXPLORER, a generative framework that couples voxel representation with latent space regulation and guided exploration. VOXPLORER introduces a repel-and-sink (RAS) mechanism to smooth and densify the latent distribution of valid structures, and a short-range repulsion (SRR) guidance during diffusion to promote exploration beyond memorized regions while preserving validity. We further contribute a systematic benchmark for voxel-based metamaterials and develop an evaluation module that jointly assess quality, novelty, and diversity. Extensive experiments show that VOXPLORER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving +8.9% in quality, +46.4% in novelty, and +128.6% in diversity on average across two datasets, establishing a principled pathway toward systematic discovery of next-generation metamaterials.", "tldr": "We propose VOXPLORER, a voxel-based generative framework that regulates latent space and guides diffusion to overcome the quality–novelty trade-off, enabling discovery of high-quality and novel metamaterials.", "keywords": ["metamaterial design", "voxel generation"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/176f84acf55ad333c7114df058e4b8a53f4206ad.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces both a benchmark for evaluating generative models generating metamaterials, and their own technique for performing this generation.\n\nI think the paper is limited as it only considers methods based on the voxel-representation, and I also think there are plenty of things that can be improved regarding clarity in the paper.

The authors position the unified representation as a major motivating factor, but the experimental results reflect experiments over trusses and shells separately. Does VoxPlorer continue to function as designed in the presence of distinct classes? I'm particularly curious whether the latent space regularization and diffusion sampling can effectively perform their roles over a combined dataset.\n\n2. Since the negative voxel samples are critical to your latent space construction, it would be nice to include more information about their definition and construction process in the main paper. The current supplemental section is also somewhat sparse. Did your noising process include any consideration for symmetry or periodicity? Did you perform any checks on the resulting \"negative\" samples to ensure that they are invalid as desired? What criteria are used to determine (in)validity? Relatedly, do you track the relative frequency of (in)valid designs generated by your models and/or other baselines? \n\n3. The constraints of symmetry and periodicity are discussed several times (and feature prominently in your evaluation metric suite), but they do not seem to factor into the system design in any meaningful way -- not in the latent space, regularization, diffusion, or negative sample creation. I'm particularly curious about the relationship between symmetry/periodicity constraints and the latent space, as the former attributes offer two principled axes for dimensionality reduction, yet it seems that they are not being used. It also seems as if this choice is made in opposition to the approach of MetaShell [Yang et al. 2024], since they're explicitly enforcing cubic symmetry (and with it, periodicity). Is there a reason that you chose not to (or were unable to) leverage these structural constraints?\n\n4. Methods like 3D-CDM are specifically designed for performance-guided inverse design, so I wonder how meaningful it is to compare their novelty/diversity metrics in an unconditional generation setting.

Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures whose remarkable properties—such as negative Poisson’s ratio or high stiffness-to-weight ratio—stem from their geometry rather than composition. They are vital in applications ranging from soft robotics to energy absorption. The voxel representation, which discretizes 3D space into solid or void cells, is particularly advantageous for unifying diverse metamaterial classes like truss, shell, and porous designs. However, voxel-based generative models face the generalization dilemma, where the vast design space and limited datasets lead to models that either overfit to known designs (losing novelty) or generate invalid structures (losing quality).\n\nTo tackle this, integrates two key innovations: latent space regulation and guided exploration. First, it encodes complex voxel structures into a low-dimensional latent space using an autoencoder enhanced with a Repel-and-Sink (RAS) mechanism. RAS ensures a smooth, dense latent distribution while clearly separating valid and invalid regions, mitigating mode collapse. It consists of three parts: Inter-Class Repulsion (IeR), which simplifies the decision boundary between valid and invalid samples; Intra-Class Repulsion (IaR), which prevents latent clusters from collapsing; and a Central Sink (CS), which maintains distribution compactness by pulling latents toward the origin. Together, these elements enhance robustness and maintain structural validity.\nIn the generation phase, the work employs a diffusion model for sampling new designs, augmented by Short-Range Repulsion (SRR) guidance. SRR introduces a force that repels the current latent sample from known training latents, encouraging exploration of new but still feasible design regions. The repulsion decays rapidly with distance, ensuring exploration remains within valid boundaries defined by RAS. This combination allows VOXPLORER to balance the competing goals of novelty and validity.\nTo address the lack of benchmarks in voxel-based metamaterial design, the authors developed a comprehensive dataset and evaluation suite. They contributed MetaTruss, the first large-scale voxel dataset for truss-based metamaterials containing 60,000 samples discretized into a 48³ grid, alongside the existing MetaShell dataset for shell-type structures. Their evaluation framework employs five metrics across three dimensions: quality (symmetry, periodicity, and connectivity scores), novelty (IoU distance from nearest training sample), and diversity (variety of unique nearest neighbors among generated samples).\n\nExperimental comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines like DiT-3D and 3D-CDM showed that VOXPLORER substantially outperforms existing models, achieving on average +8.9% improvement in quality, +46.4% in novelty, and +128.6% in diversity across datasets. On MetaShell, it matched or exceeded quality benchmarks while more than doubling diversity. Ablation studies confirmed that RAS effectively separates valid from invalid latents, while SRR significantly enhances novelty and diversity without degrading structure quality.\nOverall, VOXPLORER presents a principled and scalable approach for discovering next-generation metamaterials. By uniting latent space regulation through RAS with guided exploration via SRR, it successfully achieves a robust balance between quality, novelty, and diversity in voxel-based generative metamaterial design."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "The paper demonstrates remarkable strengths through its innovative generative framework, VOXPLORER, and its major contribution to the systematic benchmarking of voxel-based metamaterial design. Its first strength lies in offering a novel technical solution to the generalization dilemma (C1)—a persistent challenge in voxel-based generative models where methods often compromise between quality and novelty. VOXPLORER overcomes this trade-off with two ingenious mechanisms: the Repel-and-Sink (RAS) latent regulation, which introduces Inter-Class Repulsion, Intra-Class Repulsion, and a Central Sink to refine latent space organization and improve model robustness; and the Short-Range Repulsion (SRR) guidance, which ensures the exploration process avoids overfitting by pushing sampling away from memorized data while still generating valid, high-quality designs. These mechanisms collectively enhance generalization, producing novel yet feasible metamaterial structures."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Despite its impressive contributions, the paper also faces several weaknesses and practical challenges related to both the underlying voxel-based design field and the implementation of the VOXPLORER framework. A major limitation lies in the inherent challenges of voxel representation and data sparsity. The research domain itself suffers from an enormous design space—on the order of (2^{64^3}) possible configurations—while available training datasets remain extremely limited. Although the authors introduce the 60,000-sample MetaTruss dataset, voxel data remain costly to build and store, meaning that even the expanded dataset still represents a tiny and sparse portion of the possible design space. Consequently, VOXPLORER continues to operate under conditions of limited data coverage, which constrains the model’s ultimate generalization potential.\n\nAnother challenge arises from trade-offs in performance metrics. While VOXPLORER achieves a strong balance between quality, novelty, and diversity, these objectives are inherently competing. The Short-Range Repulsion (SRR) guidance successfully pushes the model toward unexplored regions of the latent space, boosting novelty and diversity; however, this exploration naturally comes with a modest deterioration in quality compared to standard diffusion-based methods. The paper acknowledges that this reduction is expected, as conventional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) tend to reproduce training samples—thus, by seeking novelty, VOXPLORER inevitably sacrifices a degree of structural refinement.\n\nOverall, these weaknesses highlight both the technical challenges of scaling voxel-based metamaterial generation and the computational sensitivity of VOXPLORER’s design, underscoring that while the framework marks a substantial step forward, further refinement and domain adaptation remain essential for broader practical deployment."}, "questions": {"value": "Thanks for the paper, it does seem like a good work to me, although I have some important questions which needs to be addressed.

I have a couple of question regarding Table 1. Seems like the authors have not mentioned why 3D-CDM and various other methods have score poorly on Snov and Sdiv, while Voxplorer does so much better. But that's not seen on the Quality Score? Also what's the contrast between MethaTruss and MetaShell.  Why other methods are more competitive for MetaShell. While lag behind heavily in MetaTruss. Does it have anything to do with the inductive biases your current approach has? Which is likely the case, when you specifically introduced the repulsion function.\n\n6. Regularization of latent space is definitely not a new topic of research, although all those regularization have come up with some limitation or the other. I request the authors to kindly add a good section on limitations, since it's quite evident with the results.\n\n7. I strongly encourage the authors to provide a detailed study of hyper-maters in order to control the latent space regularization. I couldn't find explicit detail on this topic. Do the latent space regularization and sampling have any associated hyper-parameters with which they can produce controllable results on Novelty and diversity? If no, then I think this should be included (I did not had the time to go over the appendix, particularly because it is not in the main paper and as a reviewer I am only assigned the time to review the main section).\n\nThe only talk on hyper-parameters which I saw is on eq 8 and 9, however there is no ablation study on that, Is the ablation in table 4 addressing that? If yes, then it should've been properly mentioned.\n\n8. I do understand that this paper does not necessarily need experimental validation to support the claim that there method does generate materials which are valid though first principle methods.
