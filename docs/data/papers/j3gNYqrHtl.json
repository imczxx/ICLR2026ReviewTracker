However, most existing methods primarily focus on capturing coarse-grained correlations between variables, overlooking a finer and more dynamic aspect: the variable interactions often manifest differently as time progresses.\nTo address this limitation, we propose FACT, an Fine-grained Across-variable Convolution architecture for multivariate Time series forecasting that explicitly models fine-grained variable interactions from both the time and frequency domains. \nTechnically, we introduce a depth-wise convolution block DConvBlock, which leverages a depth-wise convolution architecture with channel-specific kernels to model dynamic variable interactions at each granularity.\nTo further enhance efficiency, we reconfigure the original one-dimensional variables into a two-dimensional space, reducing the variable distance and the required model layers. Then DConvBlock incorporates multi-dilated 2D convolutions with progressively increasing dilation rates, enabling the model to capture fine-grained and dynamic variable interactions while efficiently attaining a global reception field.\nExtensive experiments on twelve benchmark datasets demonstrate that FACT not only achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy but also delivers substantial efficiency gains, significantly reducing both training time and memory consumption compared to attention mechanism.

In the frequency domain, it notably processes the signal by separating it into Amplitude (A) and Phase (P), modeling them independently. Furthermore, it restructures the 1D variable dimension into a 2D space and applies multi-dilated 2D convolution, efficiently achieving a global receptive field across all variables with fewer layers.

Fine-grained Interaction Modeling: Unlike existing models that focus on macro-level relationships of the entire variable set, the idea of capturing dynamic interactions at a fine-grained 'granularity' level (i.e., 'each time step' and 'each frequency component') is highly compelling. The method of assigning independent kernels to each channel (granularity) using depth-wise convolution to achieve this is technically novel and effective.\n2. Robust Dual-Domain Design: The dual-domain architecture, which considers both instantaneous interactions in the time domain and periodic resonances/phase relationships in the frequency domain, is very robust. The approach of modeling the frequency domain by separating it into Amplitude and Phase, which allows for more direct physical interpretation rather than just Real/Imaginary parts, is impressive. The ablation study (Table 3) clearly demonstrates that these two domains are complementary.\n3. Modularity and Generalizability: The core module, MDInception (the convolutional part of DConvBlock), was shown to improve performance not only within FACT but also when integrated into other baseline models (TimesNet, PatchTST, iTransformer) (Appendix E.1). Notably, it significantly boosted the performance of the variable-independent model PatchTST. This suggests the proposed module can function as a general-purpose solution for capturing inter-variable interactions."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limitation of the 2D Reshaping Assumption: The paper assumes \"no inherent order among variables\" and restructures the 1D variable list into a 2D grid. However, traffic datasets like PEMS and METR-LA possess an underlying spatial structure (road networks), where the variable (sensor) ID order might reflect adjacency information. This reshaping method, which ignores potential spatial locality, could destroy critical information. There is insufficient discussion on whether this assumption holds true for all 12 datasets.\n2. Lack of Interpretability for 'Granularity-Specific Learning': This is a core claim of the paper. However, there is no qualitative analysis (e.g., visualization) to verify what the depth-wise convolution kernels actually learn. For example, it is not shown whether specific kernels (channels) in the frequency-domain DConvBlock truly specialize in 24-hour periodicity versus 7-day periodicity, or whether time-domain kernels learn to capture interactions between specific variable pairs (like in Fig 1b) or specific time lags.\n3. Questionable Efficacy of A/P Transformation: In Appendix D (Table 6), the paper compares the proposed Amplitude/Phase (A/P) separation modeling with the Real/Imaginary (R/I) alternative. However, the results from both methods are nearly identical (e.g., PEMS03 MSE 0.194 vs 0.193, METR-LA MSE 0.704 vs 0.706). The A/P method requires additional non-linear operations (arctan, cos, sin), whereas R/I is a simple separation. Contrary to the paper's claim of being \"consistently the best,\" the data does not show a clear advantage for the A/P method over the R/I method. This weakens the justification for choosing the more complex A/P representation."}, "questions": {"value": "1. You assume no inherent order among variables for 2D reshaping. For datasets like PEMS or METR-LA where actual spatial adjacency between sensors is critical, did you verify if the mapping method (e.g., row-major, z-order curve) from 1D variable IDs to the 2D grid impacts performance?\n2. To support the core claim of 'granularity-specific learning,' could you provide visualizations (e.g., kernel weights, activation maps) to demonstrate that the learned DConvBlock kernels actually capture specific frequency bands or dynamic relationships between variable pairs?\n3. In Appendix D (Table 6), the performance advantage of the amplitude/phase separation method over real/imaginary or complex convolution methods is not significant. Beyond 'physical interpretation,' were there any practical advantages (e.g., faster computation, better training stability) to adopting the amplitude/phase method over the simpler real/imaginary method?\n4. The paper uses a 5-layer DConvBlock. Is there a specific justification or ablation study for setting the number of layers (N) to 5? A sensitivity analysis of performance and receptive field changes based on the number of layers seems necessary.\n5. You used the Inception module as the convolution backbone, but Appendix C shows that standard 2D convolution ('+Conv') also achieves competitive performance. How does the multi-branch structure of Inception compare to standard 2D convolution in terms of parameter count or FLOPs? Is the performance increase sufficient to justify the additional cost?\n6. You used a modified Inception as the backbone for DConvBlock. Did you consider combining the depth-wise convolution with a mechanism that explicitly models relationships between channels (i.e., 'granularity' in this paper), such as a Squeeze-and-Excite (SENet) block?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "72VysQbBbu", "forum": "j3gNYqrHtl", "replyto": "j3gNYqrHtl", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9329/Reviewer_4AVh"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9329/Reviewer_4AVh"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9329/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761808673054, "cdate": 1761808673054, "tmdate": 1762920963223, "mdate": 1762920963223, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes FACT, a novel convolutional architecture for multivariate time-series forecasting.

This index-based reshaping appears to lack prior support. This operation could potentially place physically unrelated variables adjacent to each other while distancing physically adjacent ones. This approach may not fully leverage the valuable physical-topological priors inherent in spatio-temporal data.\n\n2.Omission of GNN Baselines: This is a noticeable omission. The paper claims SOTA on several datasets with clear spatio-temporal structures (e.g., PEMS, METR-LA, Traffic) but fails to compare against Graph Neural Network (GNN) models specifically designed for such data (e.g., DCRNN, Graph WaveNet, MTGNN). GNNs are a standard baseline in spatio-temporal forecasting, and lacking this comparison somewhat weakens the convincingness of the SOTA claims on these specific datasets.\n\n3.Insufficient Theoretical Discussion: As mentioned, the paper does not provide adequate theoretical justification for the \"2D variable reconstruction.\" It relies heavily on empirical results for validation but lacks a deeper theoretical exploration of why this artificial pseudo-topology is effective, which is a slight pity for an ICLR paper.\n\n4.Interpretability Needs Improvement: As the 2D grid is an artificially constructed \"pseudo-space,\" the weights of the 2D convolution kernels may be difficult to map directly to real-world physical interactions, posing a challenge to the model's interpretability."}, "questions": {"value": "1.Could the authors further elaborate on the rationale for the \"2D variable reconstruction\" from a theoretical perspective (beyond just \"it works empirically\")? Why would an arbitrary, index-based grid be a better representation for variable relationships than the original 1D list or a true physical graph (as used by GNNs)?\n\n2.Why were GNN models omitted from the baseline comparison? Given that PEMS and METR-LA are standard GNN benchmarks, we strongly suggest the authors add comparisons against mainstream GNN models to truly substantiate the SOTA claim.\n3.Have the authors experimented with other reshaping methods, such as clustering-based reshaping, or projecting the sensors' true physical coordinates (latitude/longitude) onto a 2D space and then applying 2D convolution on this physically meaningful 2D image? This would at least preserve spatial locality.\n\n4.Permutation Sensitivity: The 2D reconstruction strategy seems dependent on the original index order of variables in the dataset. If the order of variables is permuted (e.g., swapping variable 5 and variable 50), would the model's performance change significantly?\n\n5.Generality of GNNs vs. Necessity of Topology: The authors mention GNNs in the related work but seem to avoid them in comparisons. Do the authors perceive GNN models (which require an adjacency matrix) as lacking \"generality,\" whereas FACT (which does not) is more general? If so, does FACT's SOTA performance on these spatio-temporal datasets imply a deeper conclusion: that physical-topological priors are not necessary for forecasting in these specific benchmarks, or perhaps that their importance has been overestimated?\n\n6.Physical Interpretation of 2D Reshaping in Frequency Domain: For frequency domain modeling, the variable dimension C is similarly reshaped into $\\sqrt{C} \\times \\sqrt{C}$. This operation seems even more abstract. In the time domain, \"variable 1\" and \"variable 11\" becoming neighbors is debatable; in the frequency domain, what is the physical meaning of applying a 2D convolution to the \"amplitude/phase of variable 1\" and the \"amplitude/phase of variable 11\"?
