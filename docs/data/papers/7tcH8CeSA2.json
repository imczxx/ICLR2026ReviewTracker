Recent work has shown that neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) models are able to model neural activity dynamics with high accuracy and interpretability of the underlying dynamics. However, existing NODE models treat all neurons as part of a homogenous group, preventing\nunderstanding how underlying neural populations (e.g. cell types) contribute to the overall dynamics. Here, we introduce Cell-Type NODE (CT-NODE) models. These models A) decompose the overall dynamics into components specific to each population, allowing understanding  each population's interactions with one another; and B) provide biological constraints on the contributions of excitatory and inhibitory populations towards the dynamics, using a variant of monotonic neural networks. Using both synthetic and recorded neural activity data during a naturalistic climbing task, we show that CT-NODE models can provide equivalent, or greater, accuracy of dynamics modeling compared to standard NODE models, while enabling a newfound biologically-constrained understanding of neural populations’ interactions and roles in the underlying dynamics.", "tldr": "Cell-Type NODE (CT-NODE) models break down neural dynamics by cell population, incorporating biological constraints to reveal how excitatory and inhibitory populations interact, offering better accuracy and interpretability than standard NODE models.", "keywords": ["Neuroscience", "Dynamical System", "Neural ODE", "Biological Constraints"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d6c62d21ec8188e6da244217d1345bf54ac45162.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/38be54e725fb2113f1e38cf558e406b6010989b1.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce CT-NODE, a framework for modeling neural population activity that incorporates biological constraints.

Next the CT-NODE construction is easy to follow.

With that it will also be valuable to provide quantitative performance values, as tables rather than bar-plots.\n- **Additional biological insights**: given the prior comment, and that the contribution mostly lies in biological findings, it will be valuable to include additional examples (real/synthetic) of its value.\n- **Acknowledged weaknesses**: the authors accurately describe existing limitations of the framework which will be valuable to address to increase its relevance -- \n(1) _deterministic dynamics_: the model's dynamics are deterministic; hence trial-to-trial variability in the neural activity is explained solely by different learned initial condition. This does not represent real, noise driven systems/measurements.\n(2) _cell type labels_: the interpretability/population analysis requires prior knowledge, labels.

The paper proposes something very similar to what was proposed by Jha et al. 2024, with the only substantial difference being the choice of neural ODEs as opposed to latent linear dynamical systems. While certainly more expressive, I disagree with the sentiment that these NODE-type models enjoy greater interpretibility. Rather, this class of models loses interpretibility in the sense that estimated connectivity/dynamics matrices are not readily extractable, whereas both flow fields and dynamics matrices can be directly inferred from LDS models (and their more expressive nonlinear variants like switching LDS). \n\nComparisons to other baseline models are only shown in the context of data reconstruction accuracy. However, no such comparisons are made for the overwhelming bulk of the presented results, such as cross-population influences interpreted by CT-NODE on both the synthetic and real neural data, as well as the cell type learning task. E.g. do other methods yield similar \"interpretations\", or does CT-NODE find a particularly unique/parsimonious interpretation of the data? Is CT-NODE especially good at cell type classification compared to other methods?
