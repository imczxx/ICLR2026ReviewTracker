Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) optimize average error and underperform on these rare but critical cases, while existing oversampling methods often distort molecular topology. We introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused) Gromov–Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues/eigenvectors and node features in a stable shared basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions, SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global structure. On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in rare target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Imbalanced Learning", "Imbalanced Regression", "Graph-based Learning", "Graph Representation Learning", "Molecular Property Prediction"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f3fe71f8c61f0afda5f85d7065f36ef2efab211a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces SPECTRA, a spectral-domain augmentation framework for imbalanced molecular property regression.

The specific interpolation process depicted in Figure 2 is presented through formulas rather than diagrams, making it less intuitive.\n2.

In Section 3.2, the formula for the FGW states that the alpha parameter balances structural similarity and feature similarity, but the experiments did not analyze the impact of the alpha parameter on performance.\n4. The article's formatting contains numerous errors. For example, in Section 4.1, the text references Figure 3, but the caption beneath the corresponding figure displays Table 3. This error has subsequently led to further issues in the formatting of figure and table captions throughout the text. The authors are urged to adopt a more conscientious approach, thoroughly review the content, and make the necessary corrections.\n5. Table 1 shows that all generated molecules are chemically valid (100% validity), but it should be demonstrated that the generated molecules possess practical application potential. The authors are advised to add quality analysis of the generated molecules.\n6.
