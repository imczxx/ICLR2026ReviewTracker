Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) optimize average error and underperform on these rare but critical cases, while existing oversampling methods often distort molecular topology. We introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused) Gromov–Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues/eigenvectors and node features in a stable shared basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions, SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global structure. On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in rare target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Imbalanced Learning", "Imbalanced Regression", "Graph-based Learning", "Graph Representation Learning", "Molecular Property Prediction"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c6dda0a1e3981696649d94b76dcdf5bd58333297.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces SPECTRA, a spectral-domain augmentation framework for imbalanced molecular property regression.

They were instrumental in identifying areas that needed improvement or clarification, and we believe the paper is significantly stronger because of your contributions. Because your reviews led to overall improvements, we thought it would be a good idea to compile these changes for you all. \n\n**Soundness:** We significantly strengthened the empirical and methodological rigor of the paper:\n* Added statistical significance tests comparing all methods against SPECTRA (Appendix, Table 6), demonstrating that SPECTRA’s improvements are statistically significant across datasets.\n* Added hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for alpha (balance between feature and structural information) and gamma (mixing parameter) (Appendix, Figure 9).. The results indicate that these parameters strongly influence performance, with the best results typically obtained for 0.25≤alpha≤0.70 and gamma∈{0.1,0.5}. Showing that a better balance in structural information improves performance while aligned with mixing coefficient.\n* In Section 4.1, we strengthened our analysis of the generated molecules. In addition to our original results-showing that the molecules are unique and novel (Table 1), expand scaffold diversity while remaining within chemically reasonable bounds (Table 2 and the new Figure 7 in the Appendix), and follow similar property distribution trends-we now improve Figure 4 by adding an analysis based on Lipinski’s Rule of Five. This widely used guideline in drug discovery evaluates physicochemical properties relevant to oral bioavailability, and our results show that the generated molecules fall within accepted ranges (Soundness).\n* We are running new experiments for a large dataset QM9 (133,885 molecules).\n* We have also moved the ablation study from Appendix to the main section, demonstrating the impact of each step of our model architecture. \n\n**Presentation:** We improved clarity, readability, and correctness throughout the manuscript:\n* Updated Figure 2 with a clearer diagram-like illustration of the spectral interpolation process, removing unnecessary formulas.\n* Improved Figure 6 for a more comprehensive understanding of runtime. This updated visualization more effectively shows that our method achieves competitive runtime and offers a favorable balance between predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. In general, it achieves comparable performance with SGIR, and it is 2-5X faster, with a runtime comparable with more time-efficient methods.\n* We also clarified the description of network alignment in the methods section. In its basic form, network alignment (or graph matching) seeks a correspondence between nodes in two graphs that best preserves their structural relationships [1]. In chemistry, this is commonly used to assess structural similarity across molecules [2].Without graph alignment, the node indices of the two graphs do not correspond, causing their eigenvectors to represent unrelated structural regions. Interpolating unaligned spectra produces Laplacians that no longer reflect meaningful graph structure, leading to invalid or chemically inconsistent molecules after reconstruction. Alignment is therefore essential to ensure that interpolation operates on comparable structural components.\n\n**Contribution:** We clarified the novelty and broader value of the work.\n* Articulated that SPECTRA is a model-agnostic structural augmentation method that generates valid new molecules, adding value for virtual screening and molecular design—distinct from embedding-based approaches like SGIR that augment without generating valid structures (molecules).\n* In addition to this, highlighting that SPECTRA achieves competitive performance with SGIR while offering significantly better runtime (2-5X faster).\n\n[1].Lázaro, T., Guimerà, R. & Sales-Pardo, M.
