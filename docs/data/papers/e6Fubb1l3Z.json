It argues that existing methods, which focus on transferring model parameters, are limited by \"neural incompatibility\" arising from architectural and parametric differences. The authors propose a new method, SemAlign, which instead uses layer outputs, or activations, as the medium for transfer. The method's core mechanism involves identifying and pairing critical layers, then using a \"semantic basis\" derived from the vocabulary to align the teacher's latent activations with the student's latent space. This aligned representation is then used as a supervisory signal to steer the student model's behavior.\n\nExperimentally, the authors evaluate SemAlign by transferring knowledge from Llama 2 13B models to a 7B student on four benchmarks. The results show that SemAlign outperforms parameter-space baselines like Seeking and LaTen on tasks such as MMLU and HumanEval. The paper also demonstrates strong performance when transferring from specialized teacher models on coding tasks."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

However, the empirical evidence provided specifically for this mechanism is thin. The concept of \"Vocabulary-Defined Semantics\" is adopted from prior work, and its validation within this paper is limited to a single experiment in Figure 2. This experiment, which validates the \"resolution of semantics\" hypothesis, is conducted on a Qwen3 model, while all main performance experiments are conducted on the Llama 2 family. There is no direct evidence or ablation to confirm that this specific decomposition/recomposition process is truly superior to other forms of representation steering, or why it works robustly on the LLMs.\n\n2. **Narrow Experimental Scope.** All main experiments are confined to a single model family (Llama-2 7B/13B) plus two code-specialized variants as teachers, leaving generality to other families untested. While Table 1 shows \"Seeking\" notably overshoots the 13B teacher on GSM8K and MBPP, the finetuned-teacher transfer results in Table 2 report only the coding benchmarks (HumanEval/MBPP), excluding MMLU and GSM8K, and thereby sidestepping these patterns on knowledge/reasoning tasks. This limited coverage weakens the claim of broad transfer and makes the comparative story less convincing.\n\n3. **Insufficient Analysis.** The proposed pipeline is complex, involving specific choices for layer attribution, layer pairing, semantic alignment, and a joint optimization objective. The paper provides almost no analysis to disentangle the contributions of these individual components. While ablations are briefly mentioned in the Introduction, the results are not presented, making it impossible to understand the underlying factors driving performance. Furthermore, the single analysis experiment in Section 5.3 (Figure 4) is disconnected from the main experiments (Qwen 3 vs. Llama 2) and fails to provide a comparative visualization for the baseline methods. Without comparison with Seeking or LaTen, we cannot visually confirm the authors' central hypothesis that the proposed framework better resolves neural incompatibility than prior work."}, "questions": {"value": "None"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "IeCvbvdNBM", "forum": "e6Fubb1l3Z", "replyto": "e6Fubb1l3Z", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20594/Reviewer_Df7g"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20594/Reviewer_Df7g"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20594/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761968842777, "cdate": 1761968842777, "tmdate": 1762934002674, "mdate": 1762934002674, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents an approach to parametric knowledge transfer between models of the same family that share the same vocabulary.
