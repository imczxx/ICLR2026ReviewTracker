However, general-purpose VLMs perform poorly on RS tasks, and existing RS-specific VLMs still struggle with fine-grained understanding and focus primarily on optical imagery.  To address these limitations, we propose GeoAssistant, a tool-augmented multimodal assistant tailored for RS scenarios. GeoAssistant interprets user instructions, autonomously determines whether to invoke external tools, and synthesizes their outputs to generate precise responses. A key innovation of our approach is its capability to process both optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, enabling a wide range of tasks, including visual grounding, object detection, segmentation, and multifaceted reasoning. To support this, we construct the first cross-domain, tool-augmented instruction dataset for RS, addressing the critical challenge of task-specific data scarcity. We also introduce GeoAssistBench, a comprehensive benchmark for cross-domain, multi-task dialogue in RS, and use it to evaluate GeoAssistant. Our results show that GeoAssistant consistently outperforms existing RS-specific VLMs across diverse tasks, demonstrating its practical value for real-world RS applications.", "tldr": "GeoAssistant is a tool-augmented, multimodal assistant that can autonomously uses external tools to analyze both optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery.

Regarding Table 2, the composition of the \"General Understanding\" data category in Table 2 is unclear. What specific tasks or data distributions (e.g., VQA, captioning) comprise the 198K optical and 249K SAR samples?\n\n2. Regarding Tables 5 & 6, the performance comparisons in Tables 5 and 6 (RSVQA benchmarks) are incomplete. They omit other relevant and contemporary RS VLM models such as SkySenseGPT (2024) and VHM (2025). To my knowledge, these models fit the evaluation settings (e.g., fine-tuning for RSVQA-LRBEN) and should be included for a fair assessment of the state-of-the-art.\n\n3. The most significant weakness is the potential data leakage in the SAR-related evaluations. The proposed training dataset includes SARLANG-1M (Table 2), and the benchmark also uses SARLANG-1M for evaluation (Table 3 & 8). This means the model is tested in a \"with finetune\" setting. However, the baseline models it is compared against (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL in Table 8) appear to be evaluated in a \"zero-shot\" setting. This is an unfair comparison. If GeoAssistant were compared to the officially reported, fine-tuned performance of models like Qwen2-VL (from the original SARLANG-1M paper), it is questionable whether it would still show superior performance, thus casting doubt on the framework's claimed effectiveness.\n\n4. Regarding Table 8, there is an inconsistency in the reported baseline results in Table 8. Why does the performance of LLaVA-1.5 perfectly match the official SARLANG-1M-CapBenchmark, while the performance of Qwen2.5-VL differs from it? This discrepancy requires an explanation."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Given that this is an RS-specific model, why was the general-purpose CLIP chosen as the visual encoder instead of a domain-specific, pre-trained encoder like RemoteCLIP or SkySense-O's backbone, which are optimized for text-image alignment in remote sensing?\n\n2. In the proposed GeoAssistBench, apart from the \"Task Planning\" evaluation (Table 4), are the other tasks (e.g., VQA, Referring Detection) evaluated only on the final generated answer? Or does the evaluation protocol also assess the accuracy of the intermediate steps, such as whether the correct tool was invoked by the agent to arrive at the answer?\n\n3. Regarding the task planning accuracy in Table 4, the paper claims the 100% success rate is due to its \"architectural design.\" I am curious what specifically causes the significant performance gap between GeoAssistant and other agents (like RS-Agent). The authors should provide a more in-depth analysis or ablation study to substantiate this claim beyond just citing the architecture.\n\n4. I am curious if the model can collaboratively use multiple tools in a multi-turn dialogue to solve a complex problem. For example, can it first apply a de-clouding tool to a cloudy image, then execute a detection or segmentation tool on the processed image, and finally summarize the content?\n\n5.  I think the model should learn when to call a tool and when not to. This is learned from the mix of \"General Understanding\" data (no tool) and \"Tool-Augmented\" data. The paper provides an ablation on the training strategy (Table 10) but not on the data composition. What is the impact of the data ratio (e.g., ~448K general vs. ~107K tool samples) on the agent's tendency to call (or not call) tools? An ablation showing performance with different data mixtures would be highly insightful."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "0DwEZtvvtD", "forum": "xvRpSz6rr6", "replyto": "xvRpSz6rr6", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22510/Reviewer_JqBi"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22510/Reviewer_JqBi"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22510/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761573272830, "cdate": 1761573272830, "tmdate": 1762942249883, "mdate": 1762942249883, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work is a multimodal vision-language assistant built for remote sensing, designed to handle both optical and SAR imagery.
