Firstly and most importantly, the problem itself is of limited interest to the community. While the QCD problem is very useful and widely studied in practice, it is unclear how useful the proposed ARL and ADD evaluation methods are in realistic scenarios. I can imagine that in simulation environments, the proposed estimators could be used to approximate the ARL without simulating until the actual stopping time (which can be very time-consuming, as ARL values are often on the order of 10⁴ or 10⁵). However, even in such settings, the exponential approximation often provides sufficiently accurate results, and in some cases, closed-form expressions for the ARL already exist—allowing the detection threshold to be determined simply by solving an analytical equation. In real-world scenarios, where finite sequence lengths are common due to data collection constraints, the proposed KM-ARL and KM-ADD require multiple sequences to obtain the Kaplan–Meier estimator. This substantially limits the applicability of the proposed method, as in many practical situations there is typically only a single data stream for which detection is performed, and multiple independent streams with the same distribution may not be available. Secondly, the methodology itself is based on the well-known Kaplan–Meier estimator (KME), a standard technique in survival analysis, and therefore offers limited methodological novelty.\n\nMoreover, the presentation could be improved for clarity; definitions and assumptions are sometimes imprecise or ambiguous (e.g., in Eq. (1)), see questions below."}, "questions": {"value": "I have a concern about the definition of ADD in Eq.(1). Typically, in the QCD literature, there are two common definitions of detection delay. One is the conditional average detection delay, which involves taking an additional supremum over all possible change-points $ \\nu = 0, 1, \\ldots $ in Eq.(1); the other is the Bayesian setting, which further takes an expectation over the change-point $\\nu$ in Eq.(1). Both metrics do not depend on a specific change-point $\\nu$, whereas the definition in Eq.(1) does if I understand correctly. Since the detection delay can indeed vary across different change-point locations—as has been well documented in the QCD literature—the current definition of ADD in Eq.(1) is, in a sense, not precise. \nMoreover, as mentioned in Section 5 (\"two types of change-point distributions: geometric and uniform\"), I assume the authors are considering a Bayesian setting. If so, it would be more appropriate to use the commonly adopted Bayesian ADD definition. To my understanding, in Sec 5, the authors assign different (random) change-points for each sequence but estimate the ADD under the assumption that the detection delay distributions for different change-points $\\nu$ are identical. This assumption does not generally hold for many detection algorithms.\n\nFor the real-data results, the authors conclude that the proposed methods “...reduce both bias and variance compared to baseline estimators...” While it is clear from Figure 1 that KM-ARL and KM-ADD can indeed reduce variance, it is not evident why they also reduce bias. In this real-world dataset with limited sequence lengths (and substantial censoring), there is no known ground-truth value for ARL or ADD to support such a conclusion.\n\nMinor: It should be clarified in Eq.(1) whether the expectation is also taken over the randomness in the observed sequence length $T$, or if $T =\\infty $ is assumed (i.e., no censoring)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "sBcL8h8I17", "forum": "R3dkexJWju", "replyto": "R3dkexJWju", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6802/Reviewer_DqTG"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6802/Reviewer_DqTG"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6802/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761974695384, "cdate": 1761974695384, "tmdate": 1762919072460, "mdate": 1762919072460, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
