However, existing self-reflection either performs revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training, both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g., SLOT) techniques.", "tldr": "SRGen is a lightweight, test-time framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively self-reflect and correct uncertain token generations, significantly improving reasoning performance and reducing errors.", "keywords": ["Test-Time Scaling", "Self-Reflection"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/20c5e335f9722d240fed629129491305b5199b9b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/0e26c1db37e49c86aeba2d6cd65dec88b0c1a3a3.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a new test-time framework called Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen) to address the fragility of LLMs in multi-step reasoning tasks.

This may not be practical for real models, especially when models already have long inference times due to their thinking outputs. Specifically the main results are for k=5, which is already quite extensive in terms of % increase of inference time.\n* Another concern I have is the evaluation.\n1. First of all, there are a lot of methods that improve reasoning abilities these days. So it would be nice to see a side-by-side comparison of SRGen with these methods. The paper only seems to evaluate SLOT on one base model vs SRGen. This is not convincing for generalization.\n2. The second issue is the choice of datasets for benchmarking. The paper only uses math competition questions (AIME, HMMT, AMC), but not any other reasoning benchmarks. However, the method should be general and could improve things like coding or logic puzzles or tabular reasoning. That would strengthen the contributions.\n3. It would be natural to see how SRGen combines with RL-based methods. If you could get gains with SRGen on top of math-specific post-training, then that would be cool. But I am kind of skeptical if this is possible. I acknowledge that Qwen Math has been post-trained for Math.\n\n* Another question is that here has been a lot of work on decoding to improve factuality, such as DoLA (https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03883) or SLED (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02433). Alternatively in your related work paragraph “Identifying and Leveraging Critical Tokens” you mention many papers that also leverage critical components. How does SRGen compare empirically to these methods? They are very natural baselines, and I don’t think just comparing to SLOT is enough.\n\n* A final issue, which is somewhat more minor. The authors claim that the method can be useful and plug-and-play. But it has multiple new hyperparameters, which are generally hard to get right. So I am not sure if the added complexity of these hyperparameters is consistent with the claims that the authors make."}, "questions": {"value": "* Do you think SRGen will work for other benchmarks that involve other types of reasoning?

A 50% increase is a lot, and I am not sure I would call it practical. Also is there a memory overhead as well as computation for computing the corrective vector?\n* In your related work paragraph “Identifying and Leveraging Critical Tokens” you mention many papers that also leverage critical components.

The paper states that SRGen can be composed with other test-time self-reflective approaches, but only one model, SLOT, is chosen. In fact, the combinatorial ability with other models is not limited to training-based methods. Besides, there exist other training-free methods closely related to self-reflective generation such as contrastive decoding (Kim et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2025), which could also be used to demonstrate the compatibility.\n\n3. The main experiments (Table 2) lack a comparison to other self-reflective methods; thus, the performance gap to the training-dependent methods is unknown.\n\n4.

The authors’ rationale is unconvincing. The paper avoids direct comparisons with mainstream self-refinement / test-time methods by claiming prompt/template confounds, and instead reports only “SRGen vs. base” deltas. I am afraid that this is not acceptable. If one insists on “isolating SRGen’s contribution” by adding only SRGen to a base model, then any naive token-level tweak could be shown to yield incremental gains under favorable conditions—this would not meet standards and would be harmful to researchers in the community who are trying to pursue the methods that are really valuable for their tasks.

The evaluation is almost exclusively on math competition tasks with math-tuned models. Even there, one model degrades with SRGen (DeepSeek-R1-Llama-7B), contradicting the “consistent gains” narrative. If the claim is to improve reasoning, the paper should evaluate non-math tasks as well (e.g., coding, commonsense/multihop QA), not just math.\n\n3. Not truly proactive; blind to confident errors: SRGen triggers only on high-entropy (uncertain) tokens. Confidently wrong steps (low entropy) will not be corrected.

To my understanding, theorem 1 essentially reformulates a Lagrangian equivalence, but these are general and not directly tied to the proposed objectives. The theory should instead clarify how the specific losses interact and what guarantees or intuitions they provide. \n- **Hyperparameter impact (Figure 5)** The hyperparameter $\\lambda$ shows weak or inconsistent influence compared to window size and standard deviation multiplier. Extreme values do not interpolate smoothly and cause only ~2% performance variation. This raises questions about whether both loss terms are necessary. Further analysis on other datasets and models is required—this is a major concern, not a minor one.  \n- **Early-step reflection issue** Algorithm 1 never triggers corrections during early decoding steps because the entropy buffer must first fill up. Consequently, the first *N* tokens are never candidates for reflection, even though early reasoning steps often determine final correctness. The authors should test a variant that enables early intervention through warm-start entropy estimates.  \n- **Dataset limitation** The experiments are restricted to math datasets. The authors should verify whether SRGen generalizes to non-mathematical reasoning or commonsense tasks.  \n- **Loss formulation intuition** Regarding the $\\mathcal{L}_{CE}$ term, it is unclear why the correction vector $\\delta$ must be applied to all past token paths. Why is it insufficient to compute the cross-entropy only over the current decoding path? As sequences grow, a fixed context window should suffice rather than propagating from the initial token $y_0$.    \n- **Critical-token bias** Appendix G shows that high-uncertainty tokens are dominated by function words (e.g., “the,” “so,”) rather than semantically or mathematically meaningful tokens. This suggests that entropy spikes may not always mark reasoning faults. The paper argues that this behavior identifies reasoning junctions, but ablations should test whether a content-aware trigger (e.g., POS-filtered or step-type-aware) would yield better performance or reduce wasted activations.  \n- **Self-consistency baseline coverage** Figure 3 shows improvements with sampling various reasoning paths, but the baselines are limited. Stronger baselines such as diverse prompt seeds, temperature sweeps, or ToT-style search under equal budgets should be included to better evaluate whether SRGen genuinely improves per-sample reasoning quality.  \n- **Efficiency and fairness of comparison** Table 1 lacks clarification on whether all results are obtained under comparable inference budgets.
