Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods. For the unsupervised and semi-supervised modalities, respectively, these are: i) detecting unusual landscape from the Mars Rover camera and unusual Galaxies from ground based imagery (complex, real world datasets); ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and subsets of ImageNet as the in-distribution (ID) class.", "tldr": "Compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere improves the anomaly detection ability of the VAE", "keywords": ["variational autoencoder", "anomaly detection", "unsupervised", "semi-supervised", "high dimensional statistics", "hyperspherical coordinates"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5460c9b438b1764b81ed05e8d13721e282380d06.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/fb3226c89b83dd75d8ac265a4bbc5fb30640628a.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a method to compress the latent space of VAE for learning more distingushiable representations for AD tasks.

Lack of statistical rigor in evaluation:\nThe results section does not include any indication of how many runs were performed per method, nor are any measures of statistical variation (e.g., standard deviation, confidence intervals) reported. This is a major issue.\n2. Unmotivated choice of high-dimensional latent space:\nThe paper uses high-dimensional latent vectors (e.g., 100–256 dimensions) but provides no strong empirical or theoretical justification for this choice. It is unclear whether lower-dimensional latent spaces perform worse or whether the method’s advantages only emerge in high dimensions.\n3. Limited methodological accessibility:\nWhile the paper touches on complex geometric ideas such as volume concentration on hyperspheres and almost-orthogonality, these are presented without sufficient intuition or formal support. Notation is moved to the appendix. Readers unfamiliar with high-dimensional geometry will find it difficult to follow key parts of the method. More explanatory figures, examples, or visualizations would have helped greatly. I also do not understand what $a_{i,j}$ and $b_{i,j}$ are from the short description (even though I can make a probably correct educated guess).\n4. Unclear problem significance:\nThe paper assumes that measure concentration and “equator clustering” are problematic in standard VAEs for anomaly detection, but it does not provide convincing evidence that this is a real or significant problem in practice. No baseline analysis is presented to demonstrate that the equator effect harms anomaly detection performance. As such, the motivation for the proposed fix remains speculative.\n5. Notational problems (sometimes due to notation only being explained in the appendix): E.g. in (2) on the left hand side, you have $\\varphi_k$ for a fixed $k$ and on the right hand side $k$ is a summation index. Or why does setting a mean in (6) enforce a radius without fixing a standard deviation to zero?
