While prior work has advanced task performance through handcrafted or automatically generated multi-agent workflows, robustness remains largely treated as an afterthought, leaving systems vulnerable to external adversaries and internal failures.  We propose \\textbf{AutoRAS}, a framework for the \\textbf{Auto}mated design of \\textbf{R}obust \\textbf{A}gentic \\textbf{S}ystems. The core idea is to represent system design as a sequence generation problem over symbolic \\emph{primitives} that jointly encode structural connections and behavioral actions. This abstraction enables (i) principled construction of executable workflows, (ii) integration of dynamic \\emph{safety signals} distilled from execution traces into the design loop, and (iii) flow-based optimization that propagates rewards across entire sequences to handle credit assignment and equifinality. Through this dual feedback channel, where numeric rewards guide exploration and textual signals refine behaviors, AutoRAS systematically improves both external resilience and internal reliability. Experiments on four datasets under four attack settings against 11 baselines, including handcrafted and automated designs, show that AutoRAS attains state-of-the-art results on three datasets and consistently exhibits the smallest performance drop after attacks (average $2.13$). Additional transfer, ablation, and sensitivity analyses further confirm the effectiveness of our design.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Agentic system; Large Language Model; robustness of agentic system; Generative FlowNet"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/469a9f5521501ac990ee6917c8d5c5fe91d02640.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a framework called AutoRAS for automatically designing robust agentic systems.

This paper focuses on this specific problem, proposes a method for doing it, and shows that it works better than other methods. The findings align with expectations, and the idea of using primitives and flow exploration is interesting for designing agent systems."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "First, I find the proposed method overly complex. It combines a sequence generator, GFlowNets, Trajectory Balance, and a separate \"analyzer\" LLM for \"textual gradients\". It feels like a lot of moving parts just to generate a simple workflow. The 'primitives' idea seems like a re-branding of what many people are already doing with graph generation or even just scripting agent interactions. I find it hard to tell how this is fundamentally different from other automated agent design work like GPTSwarm or AFlow, which are cited but the distinction isn't made clear enough.\n\nSecond, the whole contribution seems to hinge on the \"primitives\". But the authors just hand-crafted these primitives themselves in Appendix D . The system is just learning how to stack these pre-defined blocks (like SAFE_Filter or AGT_COT). This doesn't seem to solve the design problem; it just pushes it down a level. The system isn't inventing a new robust workflow, it's just picking from a list of safety tools the authors already gave it. I would argue this is a much simpler search problem than the paper claims, and it's not clear if this approach can generalize beyond the authors' hand-picked primitive set.\n\nThird, I have concerns about the evaluation. The paper's method, AutoRAS, is explicitly trained using a reward function that includes robustness scores (r_ext, r_int). It's no surprise that it does well on robustness when it's the only method being optimized for it. I find it hard to tell if this is a fair comparison against baselines like AFlow or GPTSwarm, which were likely designed for performance, not for these specific attacks. Furthermore, the dataset sizes in Table 4 are extremely small. For ProgramDev, it only uses 6 training samples, and for MSMARCO, only 20. How can a complex GFlowNet model learn anything from 6 or 20 samples? This makes me question if the system is really 'learning' a general design policy or just overfitting to a few examples.\n\nSome typos:  line 155, the figure index is missing."}, "questions": {"value": "See weakness."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "xAYufckhqw", "forum": "8Bk0AMtyKf", "replyto": "8Bk0AMtyKf", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10452/Reviewer_5XBL"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10452/Reviewer_5XBL"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10452/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761792988466, "cdate": 1761792988466, "tmdate": 1762921751970, "mdate": 1762921751970, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces AutoRAS, a framework for the Automated design of Robust Agentic Systems.

The majority of production agentic systems today need constant maintenance as the frontier models get updated or the tool APIs improve. Significant engineering time is spent on optimiznig the prompt and system design of agentic systems to adopt to the new model or tool api updates. Therefore, any system that can automate agent design reliably significantly contributes to all frontier agents in industry and academia. \n- Clarity: The paper does a great job clarifying why its hard to design a reliable agent system automatically. It categorizes the challenges into three categories of entanglement, unpredictability, and equifinality and explains each category clearly. \n- Novelty: The authors leverage two techniques that are useful. 1) they integrate robustness in the reward function. 2) they leverage textual gradients to refine the prompts."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Application: Many of the real agentic systems working in production today leverage complex elements that cannot be mapped to the set of primitives the paper defines to begin with. For example, a coding agent such as cursor leverages fine-tuned models to apply a code change efficiently and reliably, which primitive can capture such modules? and how an automated system will arrive at such design? Many of the components in the current production agents come from carefully assessing the performance of different part of the system and crafting solutions to improve the performance. A system such as AutoRAS cannot replicate this process.\n- Experiments: The manually crafted agentic systems that the authors have picked for evaluations are very primitive. It would be great if they could also compare with a production grade agentic system."}, "questions": {"value": "- Why did the authors used smaller models the mini series from openAI and haiku and flash series from Anthropic and Google?
