While prior works primarily focus on either attention-based or diversity-based pruning methods,  in-depth analysis of these approaches' characteristics and limitations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct thorough empirical analysis using effective rank (erank) as a measure of feature diversity and attention score entropy to investigate visual token processing mechanisms and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Our analysis reveals two insights: (1) Using erank, we measure the actual diversity preserved by different pruning methods, and find via CHAIR analysis that this increased diversity in diversity-based approaches correlates with higher hallucination rates compared to attention-based pruning. (2) Attention-based methods demonstrate superior performance on simple images where information is easily concentrated, whereas diversity-based methods excel in handling complex images with distributed features. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel token pruning framework that adaptively combines the strengths of both methods. Extensive experiments show that our method delivers consistent high performance across both standard benchmarks and hallucination evaluation datasets. \nOur project page available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/AdaVTP-186A/", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multimodal Large Language Models", "Visual Token Pruning"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9a192a95384da6c30f5053eb4cc0a4db58b88c7b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/aa3e3e18d31c436003ef751cf1a5ea89ac1a8a7e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Large vision language models (LVLMs) generate hundreds of visual tokens that must be concatenated with textual tokens for processing, incurring quadratic time and memory costs. Many works have proposed attention‑based or diversity‑based pruning strategies to drop redundant visual tokens. Attention‑based methods keep tokens with high [CLS] attention scores but may select similar tokens, while diversity‑based methods maximize feature diversity but can discard important high‑attention tokens. The authors provide a systematic empirical study comparing these strategies across image types, using effective rank (erank) to quantify feature diversity and attention entropy to measure how concentrated the attention distribution is. They show that simple images (low erank / low entropy) benefit from attention‑based pruning, whereas complex images (high erank / high entropy) favor diversity‑based pruning. Furthermore, using the CHAIR hallucination benchmark, they find that attention‑based methods produce more conservative captions with lower hallucination scores, while diversity‑based methods capture more objects but hallucinate more. Motivated by these insights, the authors propose an adaptive token‑pruning framework. They explore tokens in descending order of attention scores and remove redundant tokens based on a similarity threshold that is adaptively set via a logarithmic mapping of erank.
