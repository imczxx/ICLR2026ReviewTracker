The core idea of treating distribution parameters as actions is a simple and interesting concept. It unifies diverse action spaces (discrete, continuous, hybrid) into a single, continuous control problem, potentially simplifying algorithm design\n2. The introduction of Interpolated Critic Learning (ICL) is a practical solution to the challenge of learning the critic in this new, higher-dimensional parameter space\n3. The authors test their method on over 30 tasks across continuous, discrete, high-dimensional discrete, and hybrid domains, consistently showing competitive performance"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The paper presents the transformation from discrete to continuous action spaces as a clear benefit, but does not sufficiently discuss the potential downsides. Discrete action spaces have a specific structure that is often leveraged by advanced algorithms. For instance:\n- Entropy regularization is commonly used in RL for promoting exploration in discrete spaces. It is unclear how an equivalent and effective exploration strategy would be implemented in the continuous parameter space. Simply encouraging entropy over the parameters (a vector of probabilities) is not the same as encouraging entropy in the resulting categorical distribution.\n- Methods like mirror descent are well-suited for optimization over the probability simplex. By moving to an unconstrained Euclidean space of parameters, these geometric advantages are lost.\n- Planning algorithms like MCTS are fundamentally built on discrete action branching. The proposed framework makes it difficult to see how such methods could be integrated. A deeper discussion of what is \"lost\" in this transformation and how the framework might address these challenges would significantly strengthen the paper.\n2. The paper should better position itself with respect to other works that also re-frame RL problems through representation learning. For example, \"Representation-Driven RL\" (Nabati et al.)  also learns a latent space for policies and uses bandit algorithms to guide exploration in that space. While the mechanism is different (RepRL learns a representation of the entire policy, whereas this paper redefines the action at each step), the high-level goal of shifting the problem into a more structured latent space is shared. Discussing these connections would provide a richer context for the paper's contribution.\n3. The comparison to PPO, a very strong on-policy baseline should be more convincing. PPO's performance is known to be highly dependent on implementation details and computational budget (e.g., total environment steps, number of parallel environments). Without a more detailed analysis or comparison against a highly-tuned PPO baseline known to achieve SOTA on these tasks, it is difficult to be certain that DA-AC's superior performance isn't an artifact of a weakly-scaled baseline. A stronger claim could be made by showing that DA-AC is more sample-efficient or reaches a higher asymptotic performance in a \"computationally unconstrained\" setting where both algorithms are given unconstrained resources."}, "questions": {"value": "- Could the authors elaborate on how entropy regularization could be effectively adapted to the distributions-as-actions framework? \n- How does one encourage diverse actions by acting in the continuous parameter space of that distribution?\n- What are the authors' thoughts on the compatibility of this framework with planning algorithms like MCTS, which rely on a discrete branching factor? \n- Does this reframing inherently limit the applicability to model-free actor-critic methods?\n- Regarding the PPO comparisons, can the authors provide more details on the implementation and tuning? For example, were the reported results for PPO based on a single-environment setup, or was it scaled with parallel environments as is common for achieving top performance?\n- The ICL technique uses linear interpolation between the policy's output parameters $U_t$ and the deterministic parameters $U_{A_t}$. Could you provide more intuition on this choice? For categorical policies where the parameter space is a simplex, does this linear interpolation respect the geometry of the space, or does it operate on the unconstrained logits"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "5vkzUXlHYZ", "forum": "4ol71wMPY8", "replyto": "4ol71wMPY8", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20834/Reviewer_Xv1R"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20834/Reviewer_Xv1R"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20834/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760730406965, "cdate": 1760730406965, "tmdate": 1762936329023, "mdate": 1762936329023, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a unified framework for handling both discrete and continuous action spaces, which traditionally require distinct design choices in reinforcement learning.
