It requires simulating and storing both forward and backward trajectories, leading to significant memory and runtime costs. Moreover, due to the log-variance computation in Eq. (8), the algorithm must maintain multiple trajectories for each source sample $x_0\\sim p_0$, further amplifying the computational overhead. This raises serious questions about the method’s scalability to high-dimensional or large-scale settings.\n\n- **Limited comparison with related methods.** The paper does not include comparisons with existing and more scalable energy-to-energy [2] and data-to-energy [3] approaches. These frameworks perform only forward simulations, efficiently handle trajectory storage, and are generally better suited for practical applications. Although [3] may be considered concurrent work, it was publicly available nearly three months before the submission deadline and should at least be discussed for completeness.\n\n- **Questionable experimental design.** The experimental evaluation is restricted to self-curated synthetic datasets and lacks standardized benchmarks, making it difficult to assess general applicability.\n\n(1) On synthetic datasets, it would be more informative to include samplers capable of energy-to-energy or data-to-energy methods, as these are the most directly comparable baselines.\n\n(2) The posterior sampling from latent formulated as $r(f(x), y) p_0(x)$ appears somewhat artificial and lacks a clear grounding in established probabilistic models. In contrast, a more canonical formulation sampling from energy-tilted data distributions $e^{r(x)/\\alpha} p_{data}$ is well studied in the literature. For estimating $p_{data}$, the authors could have leveraged normalizing flows [4], continuous normalizing flows [5], or VAE/diffusion-based ELBO approximations that provide explicit or approximate log-likelihoods. Furthermore, comparison against rejection sampling seems too weak; many stronger training-based or training-free posterior sampling methods could serve as more relevant baselines.\n\n(3) Evaluating the approach on more established and quantitatively meaningful benchmark tasks is required. At a minimum, incorporating comparative analyses against existing samplers on standard sampling problems would provide a more rigorous and convincing validation of the proposed framework.\n\nOverall, the absence of experiments on well-established benchmarks and the lack of comparisons with efficient samplers substantially weaken the empirical claims.\n\n- **Limited methodological novelty.** From a theoretical standpoint, the proposed formulation largely adapts the framework of [1] to the case where the energy function is defined on only one marginal. While this adaptation is logically consistent, it does not appear to introduce a fundamentally new methodological contribution beyond prior work.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] From Discrete-Time Policies to Continuous-Time Diffusion Samplers.\n\n[2] Sequential Controlled Langevin Dynamics.\n\n[3] Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Sampler.\n\n[4] Glow: Generative Flow with Invertible 1×1 Convolutions.\n\n[5] Normalizing Flows are Capable Generative Models."}, "questions": {"value": "- How exactly is Langevin noise incorporated into the proposed method?

While classical IPF has convergence results under certain regularity assumptions [1], it remains unclear whether those extend to the variance-based updates and off-policy sampling. A discussion of theoretical convergence would strengthen the contribution.\n- The paper lacks comparison with a closely related concurrent work, the Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Sampler [2], which also addresses SB estimation when one marginal is given as an unnormalized density. A direct comparison or discussion of methodological differences would clarify novelty.\n- In Table 1, the Path KL metric is reported as “larger = better.” However, by definition, the SB objective minimizes KL (P ‖ Q), suggesting that smaller Path KL values should correspond to more optimal bridges. If the smaller Path KL is better, then the reported results appear to indicate a tradeoff: the trainable-variance model improves Wasserstein distance but worsens Path KL.

These examples would be better testbeds for the method’s applicability than outsourced image generation, as in the latter case it is difficult to distinguish between failure modes of latent-to-image generators and the method itself.
