Let the covariance matrix among observed variables be cov(X).  The constraint D*cov(X)*D^T = cov(X) is just to require D to be orthogonal against cov(X).  There is no structural / causal implications for it.\n - Hence, the claimed contribution \"introduce the concept of induced covariance, a statistical property implied by causal structures\" is just following directly from linear algebra and does not constitute a meaningful causal result.\n - Such fully deterministic linear transformation is also contradicted to authors' own technical progression. E.g., at Equation 1 the hidden noise terms \"u_i\" are presented.\n - There is no identifiability analysis at all: no argument that the true causal structure can be recovered under any set of assumptions. Theorems 3 and 4 are stated abstractly without clear causal interpretation or practical significance.\n - The authors may also have misunderstandings about identifiability notion.  E.g., at line 151, \"This is a common problem in causal discovery as multiple graphs can describe the same data Spirtes et al. (2001).\"  It is actually not.  The problem that authors are presenting is simply rewriting the linear transformation.\n\n2. **Technical development is messy and difficult to follow: sloppy and inconsistent exposition**\n - For example, in the problem statement (line 110), \"We define I as the set of indices for independent variables and D as the set of indices for dependent variables. \"  However, the meanings for \"independent variables\" and \"dependent variables\" are not defined. The notation \"\\mathcal{I}\" is never used either.\n - Line 118, \"a vector with fewer than τ non-zero elements\" -- I believe the authors intended to say \"no more than\".\n - As mentioned earlier, in Equation 3, the authors define the causal model without exogenous noise, yet noise was present in Equation 1 when introducing the SCM.\n\n3. **Unprofessional and low-quality writing:**\n - The narrative flow is chaotic: basic definitions appear late, theorems are introduced without intuition, etc.\n - Sentences like \"by an average of 35% in precision and 41.5% in recall across all tested datasets.\" appear in abstract, without any explanation to the experimental setting.\n - The \"proofs\" and \"theorems\" are written more like algebraic manipulations than proper statements with clear assumptions and claims."}, "questions": {"value": "n/a"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "oSDCPA2Kun", "forum": "aS7EVadvZD", "replyto": "aS7EVadvZD", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22220/Reviewer_TCJT"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22220/Reviewer_TCJT"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22220/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760644537622, "cdate": 1760644537622, "tmdate": 1762942120960, "mdate": 1762942120960, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a method for causal discovery in linear SEMs based on a novel constraint termed induced covariance, where the observed covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ must factorize as $D \\sigma D^T$ with $D$ being the structural matrix and $\\sigma$ a diagonal noise variance matrix.

In the second graph of Introduction, the authors claim that causal discovery methods are generally classified into two categories: constraint-based methods and score-based methods. However, according to my experience, researchers in the causality community used to divide causal discovery methods into three categories: constraint-based, score-based, and functional causal model-based methods. LiNGAM is typically regarded as a FCM-based method rather than a constraint-based method.\n\n2. The authors classify variables of interest into independent variables and dependent variables, but they don't provide formal definitions of independent/dependent variables. According to my understanding, it seems that independent variables are root variables while dependent variables are non-root variables. But the authors also claim that each dependent variable is a function of a subset of independent variables that are considered as its parents, why cannot a dependent variable have another dependent variable as its parent?\n\n3. There is a typo in Equation (10), where $d_i^T \\sigma d_j^T$ should be $d_i^T \\sigma d_j$.\n\n4. In Equation (11), why do you minimize the rank and the trace of $D$? In other words, why do you think the ground truth is the one with the minimal rank and trace?\n\n5.

Conventional approaches that rely on independence tests or graph score optimization often suffer a significant loss of reliability when data are scarce.

In particular, the derivation from Equation (7) to Equation (10) assumes that the variables $x_i$ are largely uncorrelated implicitly; without this assumption, the equations do not hold as presented. While such an assumption would make the derivation understandable, the paper provides almost no discussion of it. As a result, readers may struggle to follow the theoretical logic and, more importantly, may fail to recognize the key assumptions underlying the proposed method, potentially leading to misunderstandings about the scope and applicability of the technique.\n\nAnother significant limitation is that the evaluation is conducted only on simulated data. Although the simulation results appear ideal under the assumed conditions, the paper focuses on scenarios with limited sample sizes, a setting that often arises in real-world applications. Therefore, it is essential to demonstrate the method’s performance on real-world datasets with small sample sizes to validate that the assumed conditions are realistic and practically relevant.\n\nFinally, the paper contains several inconsistencies and inaccuracies in its mathematical notation and presentation. For example, in Equation (1), the variables are denoted as $y$, whereas all subsequent equations use $x$, which is inconsistent. Moreover, in Equation (10), the right-hand side should correctly be $d_i^T \\sigma d_j$. Such issues in the notation of key equations are numerous and suggest a lack of careful proofreading.
