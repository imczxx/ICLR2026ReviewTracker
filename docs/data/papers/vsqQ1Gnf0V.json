To address these limitations, this paper proposes the LLM-HFR-RL framework, bridging the gap from risk prediction to clinical decision-making. This framework integrates three key technical innovations: (1) a longitudinal laboratory index summarization method leveraging large language models (LLMs), which transforms discrete test value sequences into clinically meaningful trend summaries; (2) a ternary cross-modal fine-alignment architecture that integrates semantic representations across structured test sequences, LLM-generated trend summaries, and clinical text; and (3) the novel integration of a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven decision engine, which learns optimal testing strategies via a multi-objective reward function to dy\u0002namically refine clinical decisions.

RL-Driven Decision Engine: Explicitly models the process from risk prediction to actionable, cost-aware clinical decision-making via a well-motivated multi-objective RL paradigm. The reward function is designed to jointly consider prediction accuracy, testing costs, and timeliness of intervention."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. While Table 1 (Page 8) summarizes main comparative performance, there is no discussion of how hyperparameters were tuned or controlled across baselines. The lack of confidence intervals, significance tests, or statistical reporting weakens the reliability of claimed improvements (e.g., is 0.5% AUC increase statistically meaningful?). Furthermore, it is unclear if all baselines were reimplemented or taken from published numbers; this distinction matters for fair comparison.\n\n2. Details Missing for RL Training and Stability: The integration of both PPO and a Q-learning auxiliary head appears innovative (Sections 4.3–4.4), but more justification is needed as to why combining two value-based RL approaches stabilizes training. No ablation or figure is presented to compare PPO-only, Q-learning only, and combined variants. There is also a lack of information on convergence criteria, reward clipping, or hyperparameter tuning strategies, which could impact reliability, especially on small/imbalanced medical datasets.\n\n3. Motivation for RL is unclear. The paper does not clearly justify why reinforcement learning is needed, since the final objective still relies on supervised prediction metrics (AUC/F1). The cost reward appears manually assigned rather than data-driven, and it is not explained how these cost labels were obtained or validated. Without showing that the RL policy meaningfully changes testing behavior or efficiency, the use of RL seems conceptually weak and possibly unnecessary.\n\n4. Redundant Discussion of RL-Related Work. The Related Work section repeats reinforcement learning (RL) studies twice—first as part of the general categorization of EHR modeling directions and again in a separate paragraph that restates the same references. This redundancy weakens the narrative flow and makes the section appear unfocused. \n\n5. Insufficient comparison with recent LLM-based approaches. The experimental evaluation mainly contrasts the proposed framework with traditional EHR models (e.g., LSTM, RETAIN, CGL), but omits comparisons with more recent LLM-driven or retrieval-augmented methods such as GraphCare (2024), DearLLM (2025), EMERGE(2024) and RAM-EHR (2025). These methods represent the current state of LLM-based medical reasoning and multimodal alignment. Without benchmarking against such contemporaries, it is difficult to assess whether LLM-HFR-RL provides genuine advances over the latest generation of LLM-enhanced EHR frameworks.\n\n6. Limited contribution from the LLM component. Although the framework leverages a large language model to summarize laboratory trends, the LLM’s role appears superficial—serving mainly as a text generator rather than an active reasoning or representation-learning component. The overall architecture largely combines existing encoding modules (BERT, LSTM, Transformer, RL) in a structured pipeline, giving the impression of a well-engineered composition rather than a fundamentally new integration of LLM capabilities into clinical reasoning or temporal modeling.\n\nRef:\n\nGraphCare: Enhancing Healthcare Predictions with Personalized Knowledge Graphs\n\nDearLLM: Enhancing Personalized Healthcare via Large Language Models-Deduced Feature Correlations\n\nEMERGE: Integrating RAG for Improved Multimodal EHR Predictive Modeling\n\nRAM-EHR: Retrieval Augmentation Meets Clinical Predictions on Electronic Health Records"}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Dzn3cNCI6F", "forum": "vsqQ1Gnf0V", "replyto": "vsqQ1Gnf0V", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20319/Reviewer_L5KX"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20319/Reviewer_L5KX"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20319/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761931288335, "cdate": 1761931288335, "tmdate": 1762933781179, "mdate": 1762933781179, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces an EHR temporal prediction model, integrating LLM temporal reasoning and graph analysis for multimodal data representation.

The general idea is still projecting cross modal data of an instance to a shared space, and maximize their cosine similarities. Well-established works [1], [2], [3] have operated on the same general idea, with only slight difference in implementation. What are the research gaps of existing cross-modal techniques? How the proposed technique differs and solves the existing research gaps?\n\n2) Require more rigorous experimental comparisons.\nWhile the method reports very good accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art models, I believe a more comprehensive evaluation will be more reliable and conclusive for the actual performance of the model. The paper only includes a single clinical task, specifically Heart Failure Prediction. However, in real-world use cases, many other clinically important prediction tasks may require a more in-depth analysis of the patient's health history, such as mortality prediction, readmission prediction, or prediction of other critical conditions, like COPD. Also, the results can vary according to the different patient split, or simply a random seed set during the training process. Reporting the results over multiple runs with statistical tests will make the conclusions more reliable and generalizable.\n\n3) No ablation studies: The paper mentions an ablation study in Table 3 (424-431), but that content is not present in the paper at all (Table 3 is actually a hyperparameter table). As such, the effectiveness of each proposed component cannot be justified.\n\n4) Unclarity in the application of LLMs: The paper uses a DeepSeek model to capture temporal trends in textual form. However, the paper does not mention which models (DeepSeek R1, V3?...) are actually used, the prompt used for this task, or other settings such as top-p or top-k. This is very critical information that was left out.\n\n5) Robustness to other pretrained/foundation models: How does this method translate when applying other LLMs for the task of reasoning, especially for lighter-weight models? As of now, the DeepSeek model seems to be a critical point of failure for the model.\n\n6) The problem of hallucination Additionally, how does the paper handle the problem of hallucination, which is prone to occur in specialized medical domains? If the LLM encounters hallucination going undetected, then that could render the lab value process modelling ineffective. The most \n\n7) Computation Cost: The paper utilizes a Large Language Model (possibly hundreds of billions of parameters) for reasoning, then another Pretrained Text Embedding model for representation (hundreds of millions of parameters). Compared with other contemporary works that utilize much more lightweight architectures, is this method applicable for healthcare institutions with limited resources, or use cases that require fast processing time? Is the few percent gap in accuracy justified to implement a much more complex, error-prone, and expensive system? \n\n8) Soundness of the Cross-model alignment mechanism: From what I understand, the alignment mechanism is a regularization function for similarity maximization between text and graph embeddings of the same patient. But does a rigid similarity maximization actually work well for two completely different modalities, encoding different information with vastly different architectures? Especially in the case of a used dataset, where only a small number of a few thousand samples are available, the effectiveness of the proposed method is in doubt. There is no theoretical justification or experimental results to support this proposal presented in this paper (maybe it's in the excluded ablation studies) either.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Radford, A., Kim, J.W., Hallacy, C., Ramesh, A., Goh, G., Agarwal, S., Sastry, G., Askell, A., Mishkin, P., Clark, J. and Krueger, G., 2021, July.
