Trading Visual Uncertainties in Multi-Agent Bandit Systems", "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multi-agent systems, but scaling them is economically unsustainable: coordinating heterogeneous agents under information asymmetry often spirals costs. Existing paradigms, such as Mixture-of-Agents and knowledge-based routers, rely on heuristic proxies that ignore costs and collapse uncertainty structure, leading to provably suboptimal coordination.\nWe introduce Agora, a framework that reframes coordination as a decentralized market for uncertainty. Agora formalizes epistemic uncertainty into a structured, tradable asset (perceptual, semantic, inferential), and enforces profitability-driven trading among agents based on rational economic rules. A market-aware broker, extending Thompson Sampling, initiates collaboration and guides the system toward cost-efficient equilibria. Experiments on five multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, MMBench, MathVision, InfoVQA, CC-OCR) show that Agora outperforms strong VLMs and heuristic multi-agent strategies, e.g., achieving +8.5% accuracy over the best baseline on MMMU while reducing cost by over 3×.

The decomposition of uncertainty into three types (perceptual, semantic, inferential)  is a key, intuitive design choice that enables fine-grained cost management.

If gemini-2.5-pro were included in Agora's agent pool, would you expect the Agora score to surpass 81.7%?\n\n**Uncertainty Quantification:** I found the uncertainty vector interesting. \n\n1. Could you provide a concrete example of how the uncertainty vector $[u_{perc}, u_{sem}, u_{inf}]$ is calculated from a VLM response? For instance, for the query in Figure 359, \"Is this place crowded?\", if an agent replies \"It seems somewhat busy,\" how are the numerical values for these three uncertainty dimensions estimated? \n2. Could we change the dimension of the vector? What would happen if we design the uncertainty vector $[u_{observation}, u_{answer}]$ or $[u_{perc}, u_{sem}, u_{inf}, u_{answer}]$​? \n3. How could we determine the weight of each dimension?\n\n**Framework Overhead:** The ablation study (Table 3) shows the \"Strategic Uncertainty Index\" ($U_{strategic}$) is the most critical component. As defined in Appendix C, computing this index seems complex, requiring an estimation of expected system-wide cost savings for all potential trades.

The broker’s utility (Eq. 6) multiplies several factors (distance, synergy, strategic uncertainty, decay). Ablations (Table 3) show sensitivity (e.g., removing Ustrategic costs ~3% accuracy), suggesting tuning burden and potential dataset‑specific overfitting.\n1. Entropy/dispersion‑based scores (and their mapping to Uperc/Usem/Uinf) can be model‑calibration–dependent; without shared calibration or normalization, one model’s probabilities may look more or less “uncertain” than another’s even on identical behavior. The paper formalizes the decomposition but does not detail cross‑model calibration procedures.\n2. Total uncertainty fuses dimensions with fixed weights (e.g., wperc=0.4, wsem=0.3, winf=0.3); if those weights were tuned on setups where the proposed method reduces the dominant dimension, Ufinal_epis could favor it. (Weights are reported as defaults; sensitivity within Agora is ablated, but cross‑method sensitivity is not shown.)\n1. In the main body, head‑to‑head comparisons with alternative routing/multi‑agent strategies are only shown on MMBench V11 Test (Figure 4). For the other datasets (MMMU, MathVision, InfoVQA, CC‑OCR), the main table contrasts Agora vs. single models / external SOTAs, not against routing/MAS baselines—so readers can’t verify cross‑dataset superiority of the coordination strategy from the main text alone.\n1.
