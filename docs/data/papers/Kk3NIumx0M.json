Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating heterogeneous static attributes and dynamic physiological signals. In this paper, we propose a multimodal language model framework IOHFuseLM. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we transform static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experiments on two intraoperative datasets and one arrhythmia dataset demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms baselines in IOH identification and generalizes effectively to abnormal heartbeat detection, underscoring its potential as a versatile solution across physiological domains.

So as soon as this value has dropped below the critical value for more than X seconds, an alert could be made just by monitoring the raw blood pressure readings.\n\nSo the added value of a forecasting system must be to detect when this might happen ahead of time. But how far ahead? And what can you do about it?\n\nFig 2 itself suggests the \"historical\" input signal to the prediction starts about 200 seconds before the MAP event and ends about 50 seconds before the event. What is the value of an alert that happens 50 seconds before the event will be easily readable on a bedside sensor? What interventions are possible and what is the added value of an extra 50 sec of notice? \n\nLater in Sec 5, the paper seems to use \"prediction horizons of 5, 10, and 15 minutes\". So I guess counter to what's shown in Fig 2, the model tries to predict 5 or more minutes ahead. This seems more actionable, but again, what would you do about it? What's the intervention that's possible, and is 5 minutes warning enough to do it? Beyond just recall, other metrics like true negative rate and positive predictive value are probably necessary to judge if model-supported interventions are worthwhile.\n\n\n### M2: Value of the diffusion model seems constrained since trend signal not modified\n\nThe diffusion model is set up to only perturb the residuals, not impact the core trend (obtained by weighted averages of the raw signal at multiple scales). If the core trend is not perturbable, I don't see how this can generate lots of interesting other plausible MAP signals with or without IOH. \n\nFor example, I don't think this procedure can:\n\n* add shifts or delays in the core trend signal\n* change the amplitude of the core trend signal in consistent fashion\n\nCan the authors comment on why flexible models of residuals alone are enough to achieve interesting variability in the sampled time series?\n\n\n### M3: Does the intended value of the domain adaptive pretraining have a clinical basis?\n\nThe domain-adaptive efforts in Sec. 4.3 seem abstractly interesting, but can we really explain most of the variations in MAP signals by age or sex or other static factors? I'd expect background demographics or surgery type to explain very little of the interesting signal in MAP. Is there documented clinical evidence that such factors play a substantial role in MAP patches? E.g. are their well known patterns in MAP signals that clinicians refer to as being particularly associated with the elderly or with certain types of surgeries?\n\n### M4: Loss design for the fine-tuning does not seem understandable or reproducible\n\nI don't understand Eq 12 or know how to implement Eq 12. The dimensionality of the terms in the RHS is unclear... what is used to compute the MSE values there?\n\n* Is Eq 12 saying that each *timestep* in a MAP series can be labeled as either IOH or not, and we weight the IOH timesteps more than other timesteps?\n* Or is Eq 12 saying that sequences labeled normal (no IOH events within them at all) are upweighted?\n* Or is it something else? Maybe Eq 12 intends that the predicted start time of IOH matches the truth well?\n\nAlso, is the intended value of $\\rho$ smaller or larger than one? It is not quite clear as written.\n\n### M5: Diffusion module description in Sec 4.2 needs work to be understandable to broad audience and reproducible\n\nCurrently I am not confident another capable researcher with solid background could reproduce the diffusion module based on its provided description.\n\nUsually, I'd expect to see both forward and reverse processes described to define a diffusion approach. I just see one way here. It's unclear how \"reconstruction\" happens as intended, if you are just adding noise as in Eq 7.\n\nEq 8 has several issues:\n* what is the distribution the expectation is with respect to? This is not defined clearly to me.\n* why use the subscript \"ELBO\"? This looks quite different from the ELBO (evidence lower bound) of variational inference, for example. \n* Unclear what symbol $x_{i,residual,k}$ with k in subscript means... k was denoted differently elsewhere.\n\nI'm also confused by the text that says after sampling a residual, it\n\n> combines it with the trend component $x_{i,trend}$ to generate the output and compute the training loss\n\nIs this loss the same as the loss in Eq 8? If so, why do you need to add the trend? Eq 8 only compares to the true residual. If the \"training loss\" is something other than Eq 8, it needs to be defined clearly.\n\n\n## Experimental issues\n\n### E1: Description of \"surgery-aware splitting\" doesn't make sense to me\n\nIn lines 164-167, the paper says\n\n> Patients are grouped according to their surgery type, and each group is assigned to only\none data partition. This stratification helps maintain a balanced distribution of surgery types across splits, thus mitigating any distributional shifts caused by surgery specific hypotension risks\n\nI don't see how the claims in this second sentence can be true. If all patients from vascular are assigned to the train set, there won't be any vascular patients in validation or testing, so there's definitely not a \"balanced distribution of surgery types across splits\", at least interpreting splits as train/validation/test. Instead of \"mitigating any distributional shifts\", this will ensure there are definitely surgery-type related distributional shifts, as there may be colorectal complications that are unseen in the split not containing colorectal patients. \n\nPerhaps what's intended is that the train/validation/test split is made by stratifying by surgery type? But this is not what's written or what's drawn in Fig 2.\n\n### E2: Description of data insufficient at top of Sec 5\n\nHere's a list of issues related to data description and reproducibility\n\n* (i) Sec 5 says the raw vital sign data is\n\n> MAP time series resampled at 6 and 10 seconds from arterial blood pressure waveforms\n\nWhat does the \"at 6 and 10 seconds\" mean here? Presumably there's a regular MAP measurement every X seconds, as depicted in Fig 1. Do you mean \"every 6 seconds\" or \"every 10 seconds\"? Presumably you have to pick one or the other.\n\n* (ii) The ClinicalIOH dataset does not have a citation. In the main paper, there's not enough information about where the data comes from (one site? multiple sites?) and what kind of patients are in the data. I guess this might be a custom dataset gathered for this paper, but it is not obvious from the main paper. The paper should be clear about whether this data is available to others, or not.\n\n* (iii) From text of Sec 5, it is not clear for VitalDB what patient attributes are available. The same as ClinicalIOH?\n\n* (iv) The text of Sec 5 mentions several prediction horizons are considered, but it is not clear in Tab 1 or Tab 2 which one horizon (of many possible) is used. \n\n### E3: Implementation architecture not fully described\n\nThe presented method is described as using a \"pretrained language model\" but it is not clear what architecture is used.... Llama? Qwen? something else in the open weight family?\n\nThis is a critical reproducibility issue.\n\n### E4: Performance metrics in Table 1 need more clarity\n\nFor MSE/MAE, how is this computed? The main paper just says \"on hypotensive timestamps\". \nDoes this mean error in the predicted vs actual timestamps where IOH occurs? Or does this mean you look only at timestamps where the true MAP signal falls below the threshold, and compute error between predicted and actual MAP values?\n\nFor recall and AUC, is the task a per-timestamp binary classification of IOH or not? How is the thresholding done to compute recall?\n\n### E5: Hyperparameters of baseline models may not be fairly adjusted\n\nIt seems from the brief description in lines 340-354, that baselines are each trained using the same fixed learning rate and batch size, which is quite small (only 8 sequences at a time!). \n\nTypically, when baselines are given full consideration with proper hyperparameter tuning, their performance often improves substantially. There still may be good reasons this approach does better, but I'm not sure these experiments give adequate training/tuning effort to the competitor methods.\n\n### E6: Use of averages over multiple runs needs clarity\n\nThe paper says around lines 340-354 that \n\n> To ensure result reliability, we report averages over three independent runs\n\nWhat needs to be clarified here is what varies over the runs, and why an average is appropriate. If you are varying the selecting of the train/valid/test sets, perhaps an average is appropriate. \n\nHowever, if you are just varying the random initialization of parameters, and then looking the results of stochastic gradient descent, it is not clear to me that an \"average\" is  the best thing to do in this situation. Reporting an average will get you the method that typically performs well across initializations. However, some methods may get stuck more often in local optima, but their best results may exceed the typical result of alternatives. Such methods would not be rewarded by this process. \n\nI'd hope a revision makes a better case for why reporting typical performance is the preferred method here, since this may not result in the best possible model in terms of ultimate generalization performance.\n\n### E7: Claims about why some methods do better than others do not seem directly supported by data\n\nSeveral claims in the \"Main results\" paragraph do not seem directly supported by the provided evidence in Table 1. All that Table 1 can tell us is which methods score best on certain metrics on certain datasets.\n\nYet the text says things like:\n\n* \"Fredformer improves performance by reducing frequency bias but struggles with the high variability of IOH events\". There is no evidence presented that it reduces frequency bias (none of the metrics in Table 1 measure this directly). It is also not clear that the \"high variability of IOH\" is the reason for any lower numbers in Table 1.\n\nJust about every sentence here (not just about Fredformer, but other methods too) makes a rather strong conjecture about why certain methods do better than others that is not obviously supported by the numbers in Table 1. These claims may be true, but I think the narrative here needs some work to acknowledge what claims are just conjectures about why one method works well and which are supported by the evidence in the Tables.\n\n### E8: Abnormal heart beat prediction task needs more justification\n\nI appreciate the effort to look at another task beyond IOH, but I wonder:\n\n* why is the HCM model, which is framed by its creators as specifically for IOH not a general purpose time series predictor, an appropriate baseline here?\n* why only compare to Time LLM and not other baselines from Table 1 that seem capable as general time series classifiers?"}, "questions": {"value": "## Questions\n\nSee my questions throughout M1-M5 and E1-E8 above.\n\nIf you need to prioritize something, I think M1, M3, and M4 as well as E1 (justification/clarification of \"surgery-aware splitting\") and E5 (baselines need to tune hyperparameters) are the most important to my decision at the moment, provided other clarity issues are resolved."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["Yes, Responsible research practice (e.g., human subjects, annotator compensation, data release)"]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "The paper uses a dataset \"ClinicalIOH\" that seems to be locally-procured measurements of intraoperative vital signs and outcomes from real surgery patients.

This process reads like adding different levels of smoothness to the trend sequence, but lacks justification / empirical evidence on why this is necessary (ablation model 3 only ablates diffusion; line 240 gives high-level intuitions). Additionally, what makes the proposed sparse MAP trend sequence empirically or theoretically better than traditional 1D convolutional neural networks, or existing frequency-based time series methods such as the short-time Fourier transform?\n    * Equation 9 confuses me. According to the visualization, augmentation extends known $x_{i, 1:l}$  to $x_{i, 1: l+t} $, where $x_{i, l: l+t} $ is predicted.

Additionally, the necessity of this pretraind LLM is not clear. Readers may guess that it utilizes the text information in the fused representation better than other approaches, but the claim needs to be clearly stated and justified in the main paper.\n * Inadequate empirical result:\n     * There is no quantitative evaluation for the first stage besides Appendix F.2.
