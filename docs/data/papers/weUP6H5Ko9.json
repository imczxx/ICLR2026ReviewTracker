A key hypothesis is that LLMs, leveraging common sense and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, can effectively explore and efficiently solve complex domains.  However, LLM agents have been found to suffer from sub-optimal exploration and the knowing-doing gap, the inability to effectively act on knowledge present in the model. In this work, we systematically study why LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios. In particular, we closely examine three prevalent failure modes: greediness, frequency bias, and the knowing-doing gap. We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by fine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales. Our experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Tic-tac-toe demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decision-making abilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing gap. Finally, we study both classic exploration mechanisms, such as $\\epsilon$-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and self-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning of LLMs for decision-making.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Fine-tuning", "Agents", "Decision-Making", "Exploration", "Analysis"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e32be3a4554967f49eafc33ee12cf6e179960c13.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates the decision-making capabilities of LLMs under uncertainty using multi-armed and contextual bandit settings.

The setting is somewhat narrow (also, SOTA/commercial models were not evaluated), making it hard to generalize the findings to more complex agentic situations. The knowing-doing gap analysis is a particularly interesting topic, but the analysis is tied to the UCB structure in bandits; it would be interesting to explore a more generic analysis that can characterize the knowing-doing gap across a variety of decision-making tasks (possibly with some form of optimal algorithm as part of the LLM’s internal knowledge) and provide deeper insights (e.g., could this be a value alignment problem where the LLM’s default option is not using an optimal algorithm?).\n\nMethod Performance and Novelty: While the proposed PPO fine-tuning method improves LLM performance over the ICL baseline, it doesn't match the results of SFT using expert UCB data. Given that SFT data is relatively easy to synthesize for MAB tasks, the proposed method is less useful in this context. The PPO solution itself, while possibly the first published work on MAB/CB, is a well-established method, making it less novel.

LLMs have been studied as agents in decision-making environment in numerous works (see for example [1] for a recent review). As the authors themselves note in the introduction, previous works have observed failure modes such as lack of exploration (cf l.41) and the knowing-doing gap (cf l.43-44). The main results of the paper (Section 4.2) illustrate these failure modes on a multi-armed bandit setting but do not provide further insight beyond observing these failure modes in a controlled environment. \n    2. The benefits of RL finetuning with verifiable rewards have been established in previous works, for example [2-5]. The authors mention [4-5] saying that in contrast their approach is “specialized for decision-making scenarios” (l.163), even though I’d argue that [5] is precisely focused on decision-making scenarios already.  \n    3. Results in the Section 4.5 merely illustrate well-studied methods like RL finetuning, behavior cloning/distillation, and test-time scaling. \n- W2: The related works do not cover previous works on RL finetuning and LLM-as-an-agent, which makes the novelty compared to previous works unclear.\n- W3: In method l.175, “If no valid action is found, a random action is executed”. Weak LLMs might run into invalid actions often, which introduces an unwanted form of epsilon-greedy exploration where epsilon is the rate at which the LLM doesn’t output a valid action. Given the amount of exploration done by the LLM is precisely what is being studied here, it would be preferable to filter out these invalid actions instances instead.\n- W4: In Figure 6, results for 20 arms show that RLFT leads to higher regret for the 9B model, but this is not discussed in the text. Also the plots with lower noise in appendix C.2 are missing the 9B-RLFT model.\n- W5: In Section 4.2, the conclusion that “this suggest that frequency bias is an artifact of supervised pre-training” (l.326) is misleading: results for the 27B model shows (as the authors note l.324) that a strong model can escape the frequency bias, even though it is trained with supervised pre-training.\n- W6: In Section 4.2, the illustration provided Figure 24 suggests that the reason the LLM doesn’t pick previously unseen actions might be due to an imprecision in the prompt phrasing. Does the effect remain when specifying that the model should strictly according to the UCB algorithm? Does the result depend on most actions not having been seen previously like in Figure 24?\n\nMinor:\n\n- l.246: “LLMs model” is redundant\n- Why is the result on Tictactoe in the ablation section?
