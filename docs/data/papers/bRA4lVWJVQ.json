In this paper, we undertake a pioneering exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely distributed,  where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these observations, we propose $\\textbf{V}$isually-$\\textbf{P}$erceptive $\\textbf{P}$olicy $\\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\\textbf{VPPO}$), a novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks, VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models, with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales. Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of LVLMs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multimodal Reasoning", "LVLM", "Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6e145387f3bee3b6c456aec00b013a8eca1421c9.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/dccd50788c80e5de0eed92ff0d1fb1c02851cd54.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents VPPO, a novel policy gradient algorithm for multimodal RL that improves LVLM reasoning by explicitly incorporating token-level visual perception.

For the second insight, the paper shows that the overall visual dependency is varied across rollouts. However, it lacks an empirical link between visual dependency and reasoning quality.
