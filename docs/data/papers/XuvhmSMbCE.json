These single modalities capture incomplete information; code provides semantic/functional details, while graphs offer structural insights.

This might raise concerns about the practicality of training and deploying such a model compared to simpler unimodal approaches.\n\nCDFG Generation Failures: The paper notes that CDFG generation failed for a large portion of the collected RTL designs (only ~39k out of ~132k succeeded). While the failed samples were still used for text-code alignment, this highlights a potential practical limitation: the approach relies heavily on the availability and successful generation of high-quality CDFGs. The reasons for failure (syntax errors, tool limitations?) and their impact are not fully explored.\n\nLimited Ablation on Alignment: While ablation studies show the benefit of including both code and graph (Table 1), there isn't a direct comparison between the mutual masked modeling alignment strategy and other potential alignment methods (e.g., contrastive loss between graph nodes and code tokens). This makes it slightly harder to isolate the specific contribution of the masking approach versus just having both modalities present.\n\nDependence on Base Code Model: The performance relies significantly on the underlying CodeBERT base model.

Does the model's performance correlate with the quality or completeness of the generated CDFG?\n\nComplexity vs. Performance Trade-off: Given the complexity of the multi-stage training and the specialized graph tokenizer, how does UniRTL compare to simpler baselines (e.g., just fine-tuning a large code LLM like CodeLlama/DeepSeek-Coder directly on the downstream tasks) in terms of training efficiency and inference latency versus the observed performance gains?\n\nAlternative Graph Representations: The paper argues strongly for CDFG.

For example: what is the reason of performing principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the description embedding from 768 to 32? How did the 32 was decided? Is there something particular about 32 that other researchers in this area should also consider? Similarly, in the graph isomorphism part, why 16 eigenvectors were selected for constructing the global positional encodings? Are there any specific reasons? Are there any alternative approaches? Were other alternative approaches tried and failed?\n2) Indeed, the control data flow graph (CDFG) offers a more comprehensive structural representation that preserves complete information and the CDFG has been extensively exploited in RTL analysis, high level synthesis and related problems (see examples like \"A design-for-testability technique for register-transfer level circuits using control/data flow extraction.\" IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems 17, no. 8 (2002): 706-723; \"Register binding based power management for high-level synthesis of control-flow intensive behaviors.\" In Proceedings.

The discussion of related work requires significant enhancement and especially comparisons.\n3) From Table 1 results it seems that considering or not the code did not improve the overall are and delay results by much, but the graph which I assume refers to CDFG was significant. Given the choices of various parameters like the number of PCAs and the number of eigenvectors , how did those and other parameters influenced the results?  \n4) What is the computational complexity or how do the different approaches compare in terms of runtime? Is UniRTL performing best across all tasks or is it more suitable for some?\n5) There are some small grammar issues and word repetitions like \"and and\" on the bottom of page 1"}, "questions": {"value": "1. Justification of CDFG Completeness vs. Practical Utility\nThe authors repeatedly claim that CDFGs \"preserve complete information without loss and can be faithfully converted back to code.\" However, what is the practical impact of this completeness claim? Could the authors provide empirical evidence or ablation studies demonstrating that this completeness meaningfully contributes to downstream task performance compared to the \"incomplete\" data flow representations used in GraphCodeBERT? The comparison seems unfair since GraphCodeBERT uses variable-only data flows by design for different purposes.\n\n2. Limited Novelty in Architectural Contributions\nThe core technical contributions appear to be: (1) using CDFGs instead of data flows, (2) adding a graph-aware tokenizer, and (3) hierarchical training with text-code alignment before graph incorporation. However, the mutual masked modeling alignment strategy closely follows GraphCodeBERT's approach. Could the authors clarify what fundamental methodological innovations distinguish UniRTL beyond these incremental engineering choices? How would UniRTL perform if GraphCodeBERT were provided with the same CDFG representation?\n\n3. Dataset Construction and Filtering Concerns\nThe authors mention that only 38,888 out of 132,008 RTL designs (29.4%) successfully convert to CDFGs, with the remainder containing \"syntax errors leading to compilation failures.\" This raises concerns about: (a) whether the successful conversions represent a biased subset of simpler/cleaner designs, and (b) whether the hierarchical training strategy is truly \"maximizing data utilization\" or simply accommodating a significant data quality issue. How do the authors ensure the learned representations generalize to real-world RTL code that may contain the complexities causing conversion failures?\n\n4. Comparison with CircuitFusion and Missing Baselines\nThe authors exclude CircuitFusion from experimental comparison due to \"unavailability of released model checkpoints and insufficient details to enable faithful reproduction.\" Given that CircuitFusion is the most directly related work attempting multimodal RTL representation learning, this exclusion significantly weakens the evaluation. Additionally, the authors only compare against GraphCodeBERT which uses incomplete data flows. Why did the authors not implement a stronger baseline that uses CDFGs with GraphCodeBERT's architecture? Without these comparisons, how can readers isolate the contributions of the authors' specific design choices?\n\n5. Scalability and Computational Efficiency Analysis\nThe paper lacks discussion of computational costs and scalability. The graph-aware tokenizer requires pretraining a GIN + Transformer for 2,000 epochs, followed by hierarchical training of the main model. Could the authors provide: (a) wall-clock training time comparisons with baselines, (b) inference time analysis for downstream tasks, (c) memory requirements for processing large RTL designs with complex CDFGs, and (d) analysis of how performance scales with graph size?
