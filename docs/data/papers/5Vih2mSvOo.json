In applications, the input measures are often empirical distributions formed from datasets, hence privatizing the output barycenter is desired if the input datasets contain sensitive records. We provide the first differentially private algorithms for approximate computation of Wasserstein barycenters between empirical distributions. Our algorithms essentially matches the approximation guarantees of any non-private algorithm for Wasserstein barycenters, while only incurring small additive errors.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Wasserstein barycenters", "differential privacy"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5e26f49e21117eaaeca90ff18116ddbaa175b43d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
