Catalyst introduces auxiliary variables to reshape the loss landscape, admitting a nontrivial global minimizer which aligns to the pruning-invariant set, where pruning decisions are lossless by construction. This formulation enables strong regularization without collapsing the model, and induces robust bifurcation dynamics that separate filters into prune-or-preserve groups with wide decision margins.\nWe provide theoretical analysis of the optimization geometry and bifurcation behavior, and demonstrate empirically that Catalyst achieves stable, magnitude-invariant pruning with superior performance across benchmarks.

The method is “lossless” only at the pruning step, whatever the test acc is. In Table 1, several settings still experience sizeable accuracy recovery at finetuning stage, e.g., ResNet-50 on ImageNet shows post-prune accuracy of 65.13 and finetuning acc of 76.04; DeiT-Tiny also exhibits 62.97 before recovery(71.41). This suggests the lossless guarantee is fragile in practice, the algorithm of the paper can indeed ensure that after training, pruning will not cause loss degradation, but the performance at this time cannot be guaranteed (for example, I can prune at a low performance, and lossless is relatively easy to achieve at this level). Retraining is still required to recover performance matching other algorithms. Therefore, although the theoretical part of the paper gives seemingly powerful results, its actual results not seem to require lossless, as the finetuning stage is necessary. Thus, another question arises: Is lossless pruning necessary? It is obvious that even if the loss is damaged, I can recover it through finetuning.\n\n2. I have some questions about motivation, the paper is stated to address two problems, one is that L1/Group Lasso paradigms are small but important filters are pruned and the other is that decision boundaries are fragile. Is the former a flaw specific to L1/Group Lasso? If so, can addressing this flaw do something that other algorithms can't? As far as I know, there are many algorithms for structured pruning, and L1/Group Lasso is not the only solution. I appreciate the author's efforts on the problem of fragile decision boundaries, so I would like to get more explanations from the author about motivation.\n\n3. I'm very curious about the choice of hyperparameters, the hyperparameters of common algorithms generally guarantee performance after training, the paper claims that their regularization is harmless to performance, but the experimental results prove that the performance of the trained model decreases significantly, and finetuning is needed to recover it. This indicates nontrivial sensitivity to hyperparameters and compute budget, but a systematic robustness study is missing.\n\n4. For DeiT-Tiny, the paper restricts comparisons to _neuron-level_ pruning and explicitly notes that other prunable targets (embed dimension, attention heads) are left out. This narrows applicability for transformers, where head/token/embed pruning is common. Moreover, comparisons are grouped by “similar speedups,” but FLOPs/params/latency trade-offs and hardware-aware speed are not jointly normalized or reported as alternative axes, which could bias comparisons across methods with different effects.\n\n5. No generalization/error-propagation bounds linking $\\|DW\\|_{2,1}$​ to post-prune risk, this weakness is related to weakness 1.\n\n6. The method argues that decisions are independent of initial filter magnitudes. I'm wondering that is this effect robust under reparameterization? A notable problem with magnitude pruning is that magnitude can be changed significantly by reparameterization while without changing its importance, which is the core reason for the shortcomings of the L1/Group Lasso, did the paper's algorithm solve this problem? Clarifying issues like this in the text would be a significant improvement in quality.\n\n7. The algorithms compared in the paper are still not comprehensive enough, as far as I know there are many powerful algorithms, such as HRank, CHIP, FPAC, HBFP, SPSRC, HALP, MDP, IPPRO, etc. Since there are many algorithms, I have not made a complete list, I would like to ask the authors to choose the algorithms according to the actual to supplement, and give a comprehensive description of the related work, in addition, I would like to respectfully ask the authors to provide the performance without finetuning, many algorithms for structured pruning, as far as I know, the comparison has always been the performance before finetuning because finetuning significantly changes the performance of the model after pruning, at least in their claims, it is not fair to compare the performance after finetuning."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "8HHrecvQqs", "forum": "3O8TAbrMKW", "replyto": "3O8TAbrMKW", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24710/Reviewer_mLQT"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24710/Reviewer_mLQT"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24710/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761633226013, "cdate": 1761633226013, "tmdate": 1762943170489, "mdate": 1762943170489, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Catalyst, a new regularization framework for structured pruning of neural networks.
