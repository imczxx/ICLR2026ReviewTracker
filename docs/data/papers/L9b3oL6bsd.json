On standard regression tasks, we benchmark against strong Bayesian, ensemble, dropout, and hypernetwork baselines under matched parameter and update budgets, and assess accuracy, calibration, and shift-awareness with standard diagnostics.

The explicit evaluation protocol that separates interpolation from extrapolation and uses $\\Delta$ Var, MSE-variance slope/intercept, and Spearman correlation provides interpretable diagnostics for uncertainty quality. This makes it clear what \"good\" OOD behavior should look like (widening uncertainty, positive $\\Delta$ Var,, near-unity slope).\n* The controlled comparison is commendable, matching parameter budgets (~1000 parameters) and update budgets across all baselines (BNN, Deep Ensembles, Dropout, Hypernetworks). This eliminates common confounders in uncertainty quantification studies where methods differ dramatically in capacity or training cost, making the empirical findings more trustworthy and the conclusions more actionable.\n* FDN is positioned as a drop-in replacement for standard MLP layers, making it easy to retrofit into existing architectures without redesigning the predictive head or training pipeline. The use of lightweight hypernetworks to generate layer-wise weight distributions keeps the approach computationally tractable, and the β-ELBO training objective integrates naturally with standard gradient-based optimization."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* The evaluation is restricted to three synthetic 1D regression tasks, and FDN's calibration breaks down significantly on the sine task (highly oscillatory OOD).  The lack of experiments on higher-dimensional, realistic datasets limits our understanding of how FDN scales beyond toy problems.\n\n* The decision to fix observation variance σ² to a constant is justified as isolating epistemic uncertainty, but it fundamentally limits the model's expressiveness. Real-world regression often exhibits heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty that varies with input regions, and forcing homoscedasticity may cause the epistemic component (weight uncertainty) to compensate inappropriately. \n\n* The authors fail to discuss post-hoc calibration techniques for regression models [1,2,3].
