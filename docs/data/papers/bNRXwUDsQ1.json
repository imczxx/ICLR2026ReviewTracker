Despite recent progress with 3D CNNs and graph-based approaches, existing methods often overlook the geometric-topological regularities and symmetry principles intrinsic to CAD boundary representations (B-reps). To address this challenge, we introduce EquiCAD, a symmetry-aware learning framework that integrates equivariant representations with graph-based reasoning. By leveraging group-theoretic decomposition of curve and surface descriptors, EquiCAD enforces consistent $SO(3)/O(3)$-equivariance while preserving rich geometric details. The model further exploits hierarchical message passing to capture interactions between local features and global structure. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including SolidLetters, Parts, and a newly constructed benchmark, demonstrate substantial improvements over prior state-of-the-art approaches, particularly on industrially relevant shapes with fine-grained attributes. These findings highlight the value of symmetry-aware modeling for robust and generalizable 3D shape analysis.", "tldr": "EquiCAD introduces a symmetry-aware framework combining  SO(3)/O(3)-equivariant neural networks and graph-based reasoning for robust 3D CAD shape classification.", "keywords": ["Equivariant Neural Networks", "O(3)/SO(3) Rotational Symmetry", "CAD B-rep Shape Classification", "Geometric Deep Learning", "Graph Neural Networks", "UV-Parameterized Surface Features", "Industrial Feature Recognition", "3D Solid Modeling"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/641e074efa6a5c709c1dfb1ab2c3b2093ef8ba85.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/362971e358463ffacff1d50aa0309d8f52fe8e90.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This submission presents a framework for 3D solid classification that combines equivariant geometric learning with conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from patches of CAD models.

The paper should explain why the remaining 8 were excluded. Also, for the SolidLetters and Parts datasets, evaluating with a single seed may raise concerns about fairness. In the UV-Net paper, the authors reported results averaged over multiple runs and included standard deviations. Even if the data split must remain fixed, it would still be possible to vary the random seeds for parameter initialization and mini-batch sampling. Since this paper does not use multiple seeds, the reported performance cannot be considered reliable. Lastly, the authors are encouraged to include results on additional benchmarks such as FabWave and Machining Feature.\n\n- **Evaluation:** Several points are unclear and should be elaborated. First, the authors of the UV-Net paper used 96K 3D shapes in SolidLetters. But this paper uses only 25K. The authors should clarify the reason for this difference. Second, in the ablation study, it would be informative to include results using only the EquiNN branch to understand its individual contribution. Finally, the parameter size, inference speed, and memory usage of the proposed method should be compared with those of other methods.\n\n- **Equivariance:** In Lines 149–151, the authors claim that the entire framework maintains complete equivariance (as also stated in another section). However, the CNN branch does not have any explicit symmetry constraint. Since CNNs can produce different outputs for even slightly rotated inputs within a grid, this branch violates equivariance. Because the proposed framework simply combines the two branches, claiming overall equivariance is incorrect. To rigorously ensure equivariance, the CNN branch itself must be designed to preserve this property under various transformations. The authors have already acknowledged in the paper that CNNs lack equivariance, which further contradicts the current claim.\n\n- **Related work:** In the introduction (Lines 46–47), the paper mentions point-based and voxelized representations. However it would be valuable to include a comparison or discussion with methods that directly utilize mesh data (e.g., MeshNet, MeshCNN, ExMeshCNN). These approaches exploit both topological structure and geometric information. While B-rep data can provide more detailed and systematic information, discussing these mesh-based approaches would better contextualize the scope and contribution of the paper."}, "questions": {"value": "Please address the above weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Jc2zRRzLaF", "forum": "bNRXwUDsQ1", "replyto": "bNRXwUDsQ1", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18827/Reviewer_P5gN"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18827/Reviewer_P5gN"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18827/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762151588353, "cdate": 1762151588353, "tmdate": 1762930797730, "mdate": 1762930797730, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes EquiCAD, a neural network for B-rep CAD models that explicitly consider B-rep surfaces and their adjacency (using a GNN).
