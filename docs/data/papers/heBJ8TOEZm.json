In this work, we draw attention to the broad class of \\textit{complex materials}, which combine order and disorder and fall outside the above categories, yet have shown superior properties throughout the materials science literature. We present a Complex Materials Benchmark (ComMat), including three graph datasets of complex materials from experimental and computational research studies, unifying distinctly developed data-to-graph pipelines under a standardized graph-based representation. We then quantitatively show that these graphs are fundamentally different from existing materials datasets. We design various predictive tasks to advance machine learning (ML) methods, including experimentally measured properties, simulated mechanical response, and structural awareness. Extensive benchmark experiments are conducted over popular graph learning models, revealing their limitations and the need for further development in handling complex material networks.

Overall, all introduced tasks are on networks on a coarse-grained level (no atom resolution). It is not fully clear if this is only a special case of what the authors mean by complex materials, and what the ordered aspects of this are, if the atom or even monomer resolution is given up. It makes sense that atoms in polymer networks have some aspects of order (along the backbone) and disorder (in between chains) in their local environment and radial distribution function. But on the CG level, this is unclear. Also, if only networks are studied here, this benchmark does not seem applicable to a broader definition of complex materials.\n\nThe meaning of the related work section seems unclear; see questions.\n\nGeneration time: The authors suggest the introduced data sets to be used as benchmark tasks. However, there seems to be a mismatch between the (rather small) amount of work that goes into generating the datasets and the expected amount of work (months to years of work plus tens of thousands of GPU hours) that might go into ML method development (assuming complex materials are relevant and interesting enough for the community to focus more on method development in this direction). Would it not make more sense to have larger datasets, more datasets, more complex in-distribution and out-of-distribution splits, more diverse complex materials classes (beyond networks), or just different types of polymers and nanowires/fibers if this should serve as a benchmark?"}, "questions": {"value": "\"When materials are neither ordered nor disordered, but instead complex, ...\". This seems not sufficient as a definition. Would a doped material or a material with point defects (structural order, occupational disorder) be complex according to this definition? Would a material with structural (1D/2D) defects be complex? \"betweenness centrality\" is also not clearly defined, even if it might be contained in Smart et al., but this definition seems highly important here so it should be well-defined and self-contained.\n\nRelated work: \"we review existing datasets and benchmarks on materials science that do not fall into the complex material category, yet provides useful insight in our development of this contribution\". It seems like you reviewed those datasets, but you did not discuss the useful insight they provide, nor the relation to your work.\n\nNanowire networks: \"This dataset comprises 33 graphs\": How are the graphs defined here? Why do you call those networks? Are they not just independent 1D wires? The same question applies to the aramid nanofibres. If those are not cross-linked like the polymer networks (?) then it sounds like the system consists of independent 1D fibers, and the graph definition remains unclear.\n\nLink prediction: As the materials are (by definition) partially disordered and thus contain some degree of randomness: What is the upper limit that can be reached in a link prediction task, and what is the fundamental noise level? In the polymer dataset (but also the others), all models seem to reach rather similar performance, which might indicate that they are already close to the noise limit, and thus it cannot be expected that further model development will increase the AUC values. Learning curves (training/test AUC vs. training set size) would help to see potential effects of saturation. \n\nTable 3: What are the units here? How is RE defined? What are the r2 values? What is the label distribution? How can a graph regression problem be solved with only 33 graphs and thus 33 labels? \n\nTable 4: What is the definition of mMAE? mean over all links? Or graphs? What does \"100 links for each label\"? mean What are the labels (as you write this is a link regression problem)? What is the unit here, and what is the distribution of labels and errors?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "lWTAnaMSZZ", "forum": "heBJ8TOEZm", "replyto": "heBJ8TOEZm", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21554/Reviewer_jmek"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21554/Reviewer_jmek"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21554/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761411707256, "cdate": 1761411707256, "tmdate": 1762941834043, "mdate": 1762941834043, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The present paper proposes a new benchmark called a complex materials benchmark (ComMat).
