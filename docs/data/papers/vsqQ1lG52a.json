To facilitate this transition we introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across 24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which---unlike GRPO---is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn rewards and arbitrary discount factors. We further conduct apple-to-apple benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. GEM also functions as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment.

Code availability**: It was amiss of us not to anonymize and release the code. We have now uploaded it: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/anonymous_gem-142F/README.md. Thank you for prompting us to do this. We are committed to continually improving GEM and so welcome any feedback.\n\n**2. Novelty and contribution**: Reviewer 5brH questions novelty. We would like to emphasize that the primary contribution of GEM is as a standardized, diverse set of environments with robust, easy-to-use infrastructure, not the invention of new tasks or algorithms. The reason we feel this is needed is that currently even environments with the same name vary widely between codebases. For example, in the table below we show the “performance” of the same model on the same task (MATH) when evaluated using reward functions from different codebases.\n\n\n\n**Table 1**: *We find that evaluating the same responses in different codebase’s implementations of the same environment gives results for the same set of responses. Here we take the MATH training set/environment and generate 8 responses per question for 2000 randomly sampled questions using the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B with 8K token budget. We then grade the same responses using the reward function from different open-source codebases. The differences in performance are similar in size to the differences often presented between different algorithms, thus environment implementation is currently a significant confounder when comparing the performance of algorithms.*\n\n| [math\\_verify](https://github.com/huggingface/Math-Verify) | [prime\\_math](https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/verl/utils/reward_score/prime_math/__init__.py) | [mathruler](https://github.com/hiyouga/MathRuler) | [oat\\_eval](https://github.com/sail-sg/understand-r1-zero/blob/main/understand_r1_zero/math_grader.py) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 46.71 | 52.95 | 54.19 | 53.06 |\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for the difference shown in the table is the differences in the string parsing and grading logic of the reward functions. Similar hidden discrepancies exist across many different tasks, which makes it extremely difficult to fairly evaluate and compare algorithms and models. Our hope is that, by building infrastructure with a standardized set of environments, hopefully future works will use GEM for apple-to-apple fair comparison. To support this we designed GEM’s decoupled structure so that it is easy to integrate with different codebases (which we demonstrate in Figure 7a where we demonstrate single-file integration with 5 different training frameworks). \nWe thank the reviewers for raising this. We will use this feedback to help us improve the paper by adding a case study with these results to explain our initial motivations and to make GEM’s purpose in the community clearer.\n\n\n\n\n**3. The Role of ReBN**: A secondary motivation for GEM is to facilitate and accelerate the move from single-step environments to complex multi-step environments. As part of this we wanted to include a baseline that maintains GRPO’s critic-free simplicity, but, unlike GRPO, is compatible with the full multi-turn problem (turn-level rewards and discount factors $\\gamma < 1$). We therefore arrived at ReBN, which we present, not as a breakthrough novel algorithm, but as a sensible and surprisingly strong baseline which future works can easily be built on. We will make the purpose of presenting ReBN clearer in the revision.\n\n—\n\nWe thank all the reviewers for their invaluable feedback, and we answer their individual questions below."}}, "id": "dsWRJ9ukNR", "forum": "vsqQ1lG52a", "replyto": "vsqQ1lG52a", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20292/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20292/Authors"], "number": 6, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission20292/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763731843321, "cdate": 1763731843321, "tmdate": 1763731843321, "mdate": 1763731843321, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
