Generic deep networks lack physical priors and often yield poorly calibrated uncertainties.\nWe introduce a physics-aligned \\emph{coherent-basis front end} for exoplanet transmission spectroscopy that differs from conventional end-to-end CNN/Transformer pipelines in two key ways. First, instead of learning arbitrary features, each time step is projected onto instrument- and systematics-aware Hermite/Radial/Angular bases to form complex coherent states that explicitly encode PSF/jitter and common-mode structure. Second, channel interactions are performed by a near-unitary mixing layer parameterized via a Cayley transform, preserving geometric energy while remaining fully vectorizable; states are propagated as a stable two-channel real representation $[\\Re\\psi,\\Im\\psi]$ to avoid brittle phase differentiation. This front end plugs into a lightweight temporal head (e.g., TCN/SSM) and a heteroscedastic output layer to produce per-wavelength predictions with calibrated uncertainties. The resulting architecture offers (i) sample-efficient inductive bias aligned with the optics and pointing physics, (ii) robustness to slowly varying systematics through conservative (near-unitary) mixing, and (iii) interpretability via basis responses and mixing spectra. Compared with generic deep models, the approach targets where physics matters—feature construction and mixing—yielding a compact, uncertainty-aware pipeline for high-noise spectral inversion.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["near-unitary mixing", "coherent basis expansion", "uncertainty calibration", "systematics-robust inference"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
