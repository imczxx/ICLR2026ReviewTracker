An intuitive idea is to convert single-lead into multiple-lead ECG for classification by pre-trained models, but generative methods optimized at the signal level in most cases leave a large latent space gap, ultimately degrading diagnostic performance. This naturally raises the question of whether latent space alignment could help. However, most prior ECG alignment methods focus on learning transformation invariance, which mismatches the goal of single-lead detection. To address this issue, we propose SelfMIS, a simple yet effective alignment learning framework to improve myocardial infarction detection from single-lead ECG. Discarding manual data augmentations, SelfMIS employs a self-cutting strategy to pair multiple-lead ECG with their corresponding single-lead segments and directly align them in the latent space. This design shifts the learning objective from pursuing transformation invariance to enriching the single-lead representation, explicitly driving the single-lead ECG encoder to learn a representation capable of inferring global cardiac context from the local signal. Experimentally, SelfMIS achieves superior performance over baseline models across nine myocardial infarction types while maintaining a simpler architecture and lower computational overhead, thereby substantiating the efficacy of direct latent space alignment.

By proposing SelfMIS, a novel latent space alignment framework to tackle these challenges, the authors highlight the value of their research. The shift in learning objective to \"infer global cardiac context from local signals\" is particularly innovative.\n\n2. **Simple and Efficient Design**: A significant advantage of SelfMIS is its ability to achieve superior performance with a minimalist design, avoiding complex architectures or manual data augmentations. Its reliance on a \"self-cutting\" strategy and direct latent space alignment makes it practical and computationally efficient (refer to Table 4)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Lack of Clarity and Independence in Figures and Tables:**\n\n* Figure 1: The accompanying description is incomplete, and the left and right panels lack independent explanations, making it difficult for a reader to understand the intended message solely from the figure. \n* Figure 2: Symbols such as $F_e$, $F_s$, and $F_m$ are not clearly defined in the caption, forcing the reader to search the main text. It is also not immediately clear from the figure alone that the red arrow in panel (c) signifies a stop gradient operation.\n* Tables 1, 2, 3: The abbreviations for myocardial infarction types (e.g., ALMI, AMI) are not sufficiently explained within the table captions or the main body, requiring readers to consult the appendix. This diminishes the independence of the tables.\n* In its current form, the paper’s readability and figure self-containment fall well below conference standards—captions are incomplete, key symbols undefined, and several figures cannot be interpreted without the main text, substantially limiting accessibility.\n\n2. **Inadequate Consideration of the Target Audience in the Introduction:** The Introduction section dives into clinical details too quickly, potentially making it challenging for readers from machine learning/AI backgrounds to follow from the outset. Tailoring the introduction to the conference's audience is crucial.\n\n3. **Questionable Motivation:**\n\n* I'm not sure that generating other leads for training is the most intuitive idea. While converting a single-lead ECG into a multiple-lead ECG might seem intuitive to address the limited spatial information of a single-lead ECG, presenting it as \"the most intuitive idea\" might not resonate with all readers. Perhaps, it could be framed by contrasting it with other intuitive approaches like multi-task learning or different self-supervised representation learning methods. \n* The paper's proposed method is distinctly different from generative models, yet the rationale for extensive comparison with generative methods in experiments is not clearly articulated. The paper mentions generative models' latent space gap and SelfMIS's latent space alignment to bridge this, but a more explicit connection between the motivation and the experimental design is needed to be truly convincing.\n\n4. **Narrow Disease Scope and Justification:** The paper specifically targets Myocardial Infarction. While critical, the inherent challenge of single-lead ECG lies in its limited spatial information, which applies to various cardiac pathologies that might manifest differently across leads. If the goal was to highlight diseases specifically problematic for single-lead detection due to their localization, other conditions not well-captured by Lead I could have been considered, or the rationale for exclusively focusing on MI should be better justified.\n\n5. **Potential Lack of Novelty Perception:** The approach might be perceived as an application of existing contrastive learning-based alignment methods like CLOCS. The authors claim SelfMIS focuses on \"representation enrichment\" rather than \"transformation invariance.\" However, a more explicit explanation of how this differs fundamentally from CLOCS's cross-spatial alignment (learning similarities across different leads) is required to establish stronger novelty.\n\n6. **Empirical rigor**  \n- Patient-level splits & leakage control:\n  Given that the PTB-XL dataset already provides predefined folds split at the patient level, using these official folds is the appropriate choice to ensure patient-level independence and prevent data leakage.\n\n- Multi-downstream evaluation:\n  The study evaluates the proposed framework on a single downstream dataset. Demonstrating performance consistency across multiple downstream ECG tasks or datasets would strengthen generalizability and the claim of representation transferability.\n\n- Statistical significance and reproducibility:\n  The reported results appear to be based on single-run experiments without confidence intervals or measures of variability. Including confidence intervals (e.g., via bootstrapping or repeated runs with different seeds) would help quantify statistical reliability.\n\n- Reproducibility:\n  Clear disclosure of code, data usage, random seeds, hyperparameters, and compute budget would further improve empirical transparency."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **Inclusion of Lead I in Multiple-lead ECG $\\tilde{M}$:**\n\n* In Methodology Section 2.2, $\\tilde{M}$ is defined as having c leads, and  $\\tilde{S}$ (Lead I) is extracted from  $\\tilde{M}$ using self-cutting. However, Figure 2 (c) visually suggests that M input to f_m might be the remaining 11 leads, excluding Lead I. \n\n* **Question:** Does the Multiple-lead ECG $\\tilde{M}$  include Lead I, or is it composed of the remaining 11 leads? If it includes Lead I (implying $\\tilde{M}$  is a 12-lead ECG and f_m processes the entire 12-lead ECG), then the representation of f_m's input in Figure 2 (c) without Lead I could be misleading. Clarification is needed. (Refer to Line 186-189 and Figure 2(c) in the paper).\n\n2. **Negative Pair Construction in the Loss Function:**\n\n* Equation (3) states that negative pairs are formed by combining single-lead ECGs with non-matching multiple-lead ECGs within the same batch. This aligns with instance-wise contrastive learning where $z_{ij}$ = -1 if $S_i$ and $M_j$ originate from different records.\n\n* **Question:** In Figure 3, the Loss Function box's illustration of Negative Pairs might be misinterpreted as distances between representations of S and another S, or M and another M, rather than S and non-matching M. Could the authors clarify if the Figure 3 illustration of negative pairs is consistent with the definition in Equation (3)? Since SigLIP loss performs binary classification over all possible ($S_i$, $M_j$) combinations, intra-batch negative sampling is implied, and this should be explicitly clearer in the figure.\n\n3. **Rationale for Performance Breakdown by MI Type:**\n* **Question:** The paper presents performance results separately for each MI type (e.g., ALMI, AMI). What is the clinical or technical significance of this detailed breakdown? Beyond merely demonstrating performance across various types, a deeper analysis explaining why SelfMIS excels (or struggles) with specific types would significantly enhance understanding for readers. For example, what latent feature learning mechanism contributes to the remarkably high AUC for PMI (Tables 1, 2)?\n\n4. **Improved Abbreviation Practice:**\n* **Question:** For clarity, it would be beneficial to spell out abbreviations like AUC (e.g., Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC)) or ALMI the first time they appear in the main text. While Appendix A.3 provides a table of MI type abbreviations, explicitly defining them upon first use in the main body would improve readability and prevent readers from having to constantly refer to the appendix."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "trOVn2y67f", "forum": "XyD1Fw6Q71", "replyto": "XyD1Fw6Q71", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9068/Reviewer_ZmRx"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9068/Reviewer_ZmRx"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9068/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761987930338, "cdate": 1761987930338, "tmdate": 1762920778554, "mdate": 1762920778554, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
