While prior work has evaluated smoothness indirectly—most commonly by running microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or calculating phonon modes—such tests capture only near-equilibrium smoothness and are computationally expensive. We introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT), a simple and inexpensive benchmark that directly quantifies PES smoothness both near- and far-from-equilibrium by probing controlled bond deformations. Since BSCT measures the PES itself, it can detect a wide range of instabilities, such as discontinuities, artificial minima, or spuriously large forces. To investigate how BSCT can guide the design of scalable, physically reliable MLIPs, we start from an unconstrained Swin-Transformer-inspired backbone and conduct a controlled study on the SPICE (molecules) and MPTrj (materials) datasets. Beginning with this baseline, we introduce targeted design changes—differentiable k-nearest neighbor graphs, temperature-controlled attention, and broadened radial smearing widths. At each step, we measure the energy and forces accuracy, energy conservation in microcanonical simulations, and the BSCT metric. Our results show that BSCT improvements consistently predict reductions in MD instabilities and enable early-stage filtering of problematic models. The final BSCT-guided models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on SPICE and MPTrj while maintaining excellent smoothness, demonstrating that optimizing for physical soundness via BSCT naturally yields high performance.

However, I believe they are lacking in some areas at the moment.\n\n**Presentation**\n- [Minor] The paper proposes two distinct novelties: the BSCT test on one side, and the MinDScAIP architecture on the other. While the sections are well-organized, the abstract does not mention the name of the new architecture, the introduction does not either, and the glue text between the different sections is often vague. For example, it would be helpful, in some points, to clearly state something along the lines of \"our contribution is two-fold:...\", and/or \"After having established the BSCT test as a reliable method for the estimation of PES smoothness, we now proceed to...\".\n- [Minor] In Figure 5, it seems that the simulations have not equilibrated yet by the time the MD trajectory begins (it takes about another 20 ps for the simulation to reach the target temperature).\n- [Minor] Typos: citations in lines 147-148 should be enclosed in paretheses, \"adapts\" -> \"adopts\" (line 215), double period in line 392, \"bond breaks\" is likely a typo in line 347, Table 5 probably contains numbers in *million* time steps per day.\n- [Minor] The authors should definitely acknowledge Pozdnyakov 2023 (NeurIPS), who proposes a similar attention-based and unconstrained architecture and whose mechanism for reference frame smoothness resembles the Diff-kNN the authors propose here.\n\n**Rigor**\n- At many points the authors claim that MD is expensive (e.g., line 53: \"requires costly MD to evaluate\", lines 112-113: \"which typically requires costly microcanonical MD to evaluate\"), then they provide a test and a metric that requires first-principles evaluations. These claims should definitely be softened. See also \"methods\" and \"questions\".\n- In lines 134-135, the authors claim \"we focus on bonds because their ground truth PES is intrinsically smooth\". This is incorrect (according to the current widespread definition of PES smoothness as \"infinite-order differentiability\"), as changes in the electronic ground-state along the dissociation curve can make the PES non-differentiable, just like any other cut or section of any ground-state PES. The authors should clarify what they meant here.\n- Line 392: \"confirming non-conservative force field\". The forces are conservative in this case since they are calculated by backpropagation. It is the discontinuities in the PES caused by the standard kNN search, **combined with the finite step sizes of MD**, which cause the energy drift here. In other words, a hypothetical (and impossible in practice) MD performed with infinitely small steps would conserve energy in this case.\n\n**Methods**\n- After claiming that MD is slow, the authors propose the BSCT test, which requires first-principle evaluations. Unfortunately, I do not believe the BSCT test is very practical in its current state. If the structures the authors used are made public, it can be turned into a molecular benchmark for smoothness. However, such a benchmark would not be transferable to models created for purposes other than organic molecules, while MD can be performed on arbitrary systems. Most importantly, even if published, the new benchmark would not easily transfer to other levels of quantum chemical theory. Hence, at the moment, I do not see how it could become widely adopted by model developers without asking them to perform new (and expensive) DFT evaluations on their data (even then, that's assuming they work with molecules; no alternative is provided for materials)."}, "questions": {"value": "I thank the authors for this important contibution to the field. I have three questions for them:\n- How would an architecture developer or a model creator use their BSCT in practice if their DFT settings are not consistent with those used in this work and/or if they are interested in applications other than molecules (materials, catalysis, etc.)?\n- On lines 390-391, the authors mention that \"models with proper normalization never output large forces\". Is this not worrying, considering that forces can be unbounded in practice? The same concern goes for the energy head of these models.\n- The results in Table 4 seem to indicate a trade-off between smoothness, which is beneficial especially when predicting phonons, and accuracy on all other properties.

Figure 5 is compelling, but a quantitative measure of correlation would make the claim stronger.\n- Table 1 highlights that GemNet-T achieves low FSD but still exhibits large energy drift, and similarly the prediction head with the lowest FSD has the worst energy conservation.
