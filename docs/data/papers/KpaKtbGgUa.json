This often leads to instability and semantic fragmentation in multi-turn dialogues and long-range reasoning tasks. Existing memory mechanisms struggle with structural reorganization, dynamic semantic retrieval, and the modeling of cognitive phenomena such as memory consolidation and forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose MemoryField, a novel dynamic spatial cognitive memory architecture driven by an attention-based gravitational field model. MemoryField represents memory items as nodes in a high-dimensional semantic space, where semantic attraction, repulsion, attention-driven forces, and decay mechanisms enable self-organized evolution and adaptive restructuring. By integrating node dynamics with fusion and forgetting processes, our approach ensures semantic coherence and cognitive stability. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on multi-turn dialogue and multi-type reasoning tasks. In dialogue tasks, MemoryField outperforms baseline models, achieving improvements of up to 4.9 points in Mauve and 3.3 points in ROUGE-L. In long-context reasoning tasks, the F1 score is improved by up to 14.7 points on adversarial and temporal reasoning benchmarks. These results demonstrate that the proposed method offers significant advantages in memory modeling and can serve as a general solution for long-term memory management in LLM agents.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "Long-term Memory", "Cognitive Memory Architecture"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/535a0d68c81260da8f3d30a0bf735785fe8f311d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MemoryField, an innovative memory architecture for large language models (LLMs) based on an attention-driven gravitational field model.

As a study addressing the challenge of long-term memory in large language models, it is concerning that the authors did not evaluate their approach on well-established memory benchmarks such as LongMemEval [1] or LoCoMo [2], raising doubts about the model's memory capabilities.\n\n2. Is the memory forgetting module necessary? For humans, forgetting is essential due to limited brain capacity. However, in scenarios where storage space is sufficient, forgetting may become redundant or even detrimental, especially if critical information is forgotten, potentially impacting performance negatively. Additionally, even if certain information is not queried immediately, there is no guarantee it will not be required in future contexts.\n\n3. The proposed method involves multiple components, including attraction, repulsion, forgetting, and fusion modules. However, the paper lacks the necessary ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of these individual components.\n\n4.

Such a design would better capture the temporal and structural continuity of cognition, and make the framework fundamentally different from standard RAG systems. The current formulation, which stores each paragraph or text chunk as an independent node, remains conceptually close to conventional retrieval-based architectures.\n\n- If the goal is to show superiority in text organization and retrieval, the comparisons should include RAG baselines such as BM25, Dense Passage Indexing (DPI)[2], HippoRAG[1], or HippoRAG-v2[3]. At present, the baselines are mostly non-RAG methods (e.g., ReAct), making it unclear whether the proposed method truly outperforms simpler yet competitive retrieval pipelines.\n\n- Despite being named MemoryField, the system primarily operates as a structured RAG rather than a true memory system. It lacks properties associated with long-term memory, such as global understanding, skill accumulation, or adaptive reuse of prior knowledge (as discussed in MemoryAgentBench[4]).

In Section 4.1 (“Experimental Setup”), the ‘Datasets’ paragraph lists categories (single-hop, multi-hop, temporal, open-domain, adversarial) and mentions only illustrative datasets in Appendix A.5 (e.g., NQ, MuSiQue, HotPotQA, 2WikiHop), but there is no clear mapping between these datasets and the listed categories. Table 2 summarizes results by the five reasoning categories rather than listing the exact datasets, and for the Single-hop Reasoning, Temporal Reasoning, and Adversarial Reasoning categories no concrete benchmarks are specified. For HotPotQA/FEVER, the SR (success rate) metric is reported, but SR is not clearly defined (is it EM? EM@1? the fraction of successful agent episodes?), and the evaluation protocol is not described (e.g., whether HotPotQA distractor passages were used, how hops were constructed, number of steps, etc.).\n\n2. What exactly is stored in a memory node, and how memory is initialized and grows, is described too generally.\nIn particular, it is unclear what precise textual payload constitutes the semantic content vector $𝐶_𝑖$. Is it the raw answer, the question+answer pair, retrieved passages, an extractive span set, a summary, or a prompt-formatted bundle (with instructions/system text)? The paper states that retrieved nodes plus the current question are fed to the LLM, after which “the answer and its context” are saved as a new node, but there is no benchmark-specific recipe: no concrete templates or examples, no accumulation depth, allowable top-k sizes, update frequency, merge triggers, or forgetting thresholds in the evaluation setup.\n\n3. $𝐶_𝑖$ is defined as a “semantic content vector,” but the specific embedding model is not specified, nor is it clear how it was chosen or fine-tuned, or whether it is the same across tasks and LLMs. For $𝑃_𝑖$, the dimensionality 𝑛 is not fixed in the method. In the training “example log,” a position matrix with shape (1,128) (and later (2,128), (3,128)) appears, which suggests that the implementation likely uses $n=128$, but this is not stated in the main text. The ablation visualizations (Figure 4) appear two-dimensional, yet the projection or reduction method (t-SNE, UMAP, PCA, or force-directed) is not described.\n\n4. Ablations are shown only visually, without metrics. Section 4.3 presents visual configurations with “forces turned off,” but there is no table quantifying the impact of each force on key metrics (Mauve, ROUGE-L, F1, SR). This weakens the evidence for the necessity of all components.\n\n5. Unclear/inconsistent descriptions and captions in the tables.\nTable 1 is titled “F1… across context lengths,” but the table itself reports BLEU-4/ROUGE-L/Mauve/BERTScore for MSC/CC, with no context lengths and no F1. This is a clear mismatch between caption and content. Table 3 uses “automatic scoring, higher is better,” but the metric is neither named nor defined (no scale, source, or validity).  In Table 2, there is an “Overall” column, but it is not explained how it is computed; judging by the numbers, it is not the simple average of the five categories (and this needs to be clarified)."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
