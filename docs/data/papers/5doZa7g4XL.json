Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1.

The core problem is that RL improvement requires learning from high-quality samples, but the LLMs' inherent limitations restrict their ability to explore and find new, high-quality samples, leading to an undesirable cycle where what cannot be explored cannot be learned.\n\nRuscaRL leverages **checklist-style rubrics** in two complementary ways:\n\n1.  **Explicit Scaffolding for Exploration:** During the rollout generation phase, rubrics are incorporated as external guidance within task instructions to steer the model towards diverse and high-quality responses. This scaffolding is managed through a two-dimensional control mechanism:\n    *   **Intra-Group Scaffolding Differentiation:** Assigns varying levels of rubric criteria to responses within the same sampling group (e.g., using the linear differentiation pattern $\\lambda_i = \\frac{G-i}{G-1}$) to encourage diversity and guided exploration.\n    *   **Inter-Step Scaffolding Decay:** Gradually withdraws the guidance over training steps using a Sigmoid function ($\\lambda_{step}(t)$) to encourage the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns and minimize reliance on external cues.\n2.  **Verifiable Rewards for Exploitation:** Rubrics serve as references for robust LLM-as-a-Judge reward calculation. A Grader LLM performs a binary evaluation ($b_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$) on each specific criterion $c_i$. The final scalar reward $r_i$ is derived by aggregating these scores and normalizing by the total possible score.\n\n**Key Contributions and Results:** RuscaRL demonstrates superior performance across various benchmarks spanning medical, writing, instruction following, and STEM domains. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts the performance of **Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on HealthBench-500 from 23.6 to 50.3**, surpassing GPT-4.1 (47.9). The fine-tuned Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct model achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs like OpenAI-o3 (59.8). Analysis shows RuscaRL improves sampling efficiency, expands the reasoning boundary (at large Best-of-N settings), and generates highly **novel responses** that the initial model could barely generate."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "**Originality:** The paper pioneers the introduction of **instructional scaffolding theory** (derived from educational psychology, like Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development) into the RLVR paradigm for LLMs. The dual mechanisms of Intra-Group Scaffolding Differentiation and Inter-Step Scaffolding Decay are a highly creative combination designed explicitly to promote high-quality diversity during exploration while ensuring eventual internalization and convergence.\n\n**Quality:** The robustness of the method is confirmed through extensive experimentation across a wide range of tasks and model scales (Qwen, Llama, Instruct, and Base models). The ablation studies rigorously validate the core design choices, showing the **linear differentiation strategy** and the **Sigmoid decay function** are empirically optimal for intra-group and inter-step control, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis of policy entropy demonstrates that RuscaRL achieves a better **exploration-exploitation balance** compared to baselines, avoiding premature entropy collapse or uncontrolled instability.\n\n**Clarity:** The methodology is sharply defined, detailing how rubrics are used both for explicit prompting (scaffolding ratio $\\lambda_S$) and for robust reward computation (binary grading and aggregation). The training configuration, hyperparameter settings, and prompt templates (Grader, Scaffolding, Data Generation) are provided in the Appendix, which significantly enhances the study's **reproducibility**.\n\n**Significance:** RuscaRL successfully tackles a fundamental challenge in applying RL to general LLM reasoning: the exploration bottleneck. By enabling smaller, open-source models (like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) to match or exceed the performance of much larger or closed-source models (like GPT-4.1 and OpenAI-o3) on difficult benchmarks, the framework demonstrates substantial practical significance for advancing open-source LLM capabilities."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  **Critical Dependency on Rubric Quality and Scarcity:** The authors acknowledge that RuscaRL **critically relies on high-quality, well-structured rubric datasets**, which are currently scarce in the community. The framework is highly sensitive to rubric design quality; poorly designed rubrics (e.g., those with unreasonable point allocations or conflicting criteria) may fail to provide robust reward signals, and narrow rubrics can restrict the generation of diverse, high-quality responses. This dependency poses a practical limitation for applying RuscaRL widely to new domains without substantial prior effort in rubric creation.\n\n2.  **Sensitivity to Decay Hyperparameters:** The crucial Inter-Step Scaffolding Decay mechanism using the Sigmoid function is highly sensitive to the hyperparameters $\\alpha$ (steepness) and $t_0$ (midpoint). The ablation study shows that small variations in these parameters can lead to significantly degraded performance (e.g., preventing model adaptation, causing training instability, or inducing overfitting due to over-reliance on external guidance). This suggests that RuscaRL requires meticulous tuning when applied to new tasks or different model architectures to find the optimal decay curve.\n\n3.  **Efficiency and Cost of Reward Calculation:** The reward computation phase necessitates the use of a Grader LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B or GPT-4.1) for binary evaluation of $N$ criteria per response, across $G$ responses per step. The reported average Reward time of 20 seconds per step, based on external API usage, highlights a potentially significant computational and monetary overhead compared to the Rollout (40 seconds) and Actor Update (15 seconds) stages. The work does not provide a clear estimate of the internal computational cost (e.g., GPU hours, latency) if the Grader LLM were deployed self-hosted, making the framework's overall efficiency profile unclear for self-contained, large-scale training.\n\n4.  **Incomplete Explanation for SFT Superiority in Specific Domains:** While RuscaRL generally outperforms baselines, for the **WritingBench** task (using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) achieved a larger gain (+17.5) than RuscaRL (+11.0) in the direct setting. Although the authors provide reasoning for the narrowing gap in the SFT-then-RL scenario (overlap in exploration facilitation), a deeper analysis is needed to explain why SFT, based on static GPT-4.1 demonstrations, provided a stronger initial structural foundation for this specific creative task than the dynamic, rubric-based scaffolding provided by RuscaRL."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  **Quantifying Rubric Noise Robustness:** The paper identifies the critical dependence on high-quality rubrics as a limitation. To inform practical application, could the authors conduct an additional analysis quantifying RuscaRL's resilience? Specifically, how does performance change if the rubrics are deliberately perturbed—for example, by inverting points for a fraction of criteria, or by including criteria that are ambiguous or contradictory? This would establish the framework's robustness against real-world \"rubric noise.\"\n\n2.  **Direct Measurement of Scaffolding Internalization:** The inter-step decay mechanism is designed to encourage the model to internalize reasoning patterns. A direct measure of internalization would be to check if the final policy $\\pi_{\\theta}$ can generate high-quality responses without the explicit rubric cues. Could the authors compare the statistical similarity (e.g., KL divergence or semantic distance) between generations sampled using the final policy *with* scaffolding ($\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|q, R_S)$) versus *without* scaffolding ($\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|q)$)? If internalization is complete, these distributions should be highly similar for high-scoring responses.\n\n3.  **Grader LLM Efficiency and Alternatives for Deployment:** The Reward computation phase adds 20 seconds per step when using external APIs, which is substantial. If the authors used the Qwen3-32B model as the Grader, what is the internal, self-hosted operational cost (e.g., GPU memory usage and latency per evaluation for a typical rubric size)? Furthermore, have the authors explored cost-saving alternatives, such as distilling the knowledge of the Grader LLM into a smaller, faster verifier model, or using a self-training loop to create a low-cost, domain-specific Grader?\n\n4.  **Impact of Maximal Scaffolding on Novelty:** The linear differentiation strategy provides maximal scaffolding ($\\lambda_i=1$) to the first sample in each group. While this promotes exploration guided by criteria, does maximum scaffolding ever suppress the emergence of truly novel solutions that do not strictly adhere to the checklist structure? Could the authors analyze whether the highest novelty responses (those with extremely high importance ratios, $\\rho_{seq} > 100$) tend to be generated by samples with maximal scaffolding, or instead by those with lower, more moderate scaffolding ratios?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "gNhbA0IvWH", "forum": "5doZa7g4XL", "replyto": "5doZa7g4XL", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1040/Reviewer_nBsg"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1040/Reviewer_nBsg"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1040/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761572970307, "cdate": 1761572970307, "tmdate": 1762915660369, "mdate": 1762915660369, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), aiming to address the exploration bottleneck in open-ended domains for RLVR.

Since RuscaRL’s main gains only emerge after 200 steps (with no obvious improvements before that point in Fig. 5b), a substantial portion of the reported improvement might be due to baseline failure rather than method superiority.\n\n    Given that Rubric-based RL is the most crucial baseline, there should be at least one comparison run where the baseline does not collapse to demonstrate that the improvement is robust to make the main claim convincing. Alternatively, the authors should provide a thorough explanation for the baseline collapse. \n\n2. Novelty concerns: The idea of adding external guidance or scaffolding in RL is not entirely new—e.g., similar concepts appear in prior work such as [1].
