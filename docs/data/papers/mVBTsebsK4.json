In this problem, a learner has access to ground truth and coarse measurements of outcomes and would like to use them for decision-making. The learner has constrained access to ground truth measurements for only a given fraction of decision outcomes and would like to leverage the cheaper coarse measurements of decision outcomes. We introduce a model where the randomness of the ground and coarse measurements is coupled, and our approach learns their correlation to optimally combine coarse measurements with ground truth and achieve improved performance. This framework unifies several settings, like learning from multi-fidelity data sources and delegating decision-making to AI agents. We provide an upper confidence bounds based algorithm $\\mathrm{CUUCB}$ for leveraging coupled uncertainties in a multi-armed bandit task, where the covariance structure between coarse measurements and ground truth is unknown. We show theoretically how $\\mathrm{CUUCB}$ adapts to the underlying covariance structure by deriving instance-dependent and instance-independent regret bounds. We validate our algorithm in two experiments: a task with synthetically generated data, and an LLM benchmarking task. We compare our algorithm to existing $\\mathrm{UCB}$ variants with access to only ground truth measurements on the constrained fraction of outcomes. In both cases, our algorithm is able to achieve lower regret.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["coupled uncertainty", "decision-making"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bfa6314c61af164ed9bd399527b8b89a26db7d53.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c77afd4d2208567f39fa0709b07cb2469bca07d5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies a multi-fidelity K-armed bandit problem where, at each pull, the learner may obtain a cheap coarse measurement and, on a controlled fraction of pulls, an expensive ground-truth measurement.

Reading the first three sections first gives the reader (wrong) the sense that this paper is addressing a very general problem in the contextual bandit setting. The motivating examples are indeed contextual in nature. Section 4 then suddenly jumps to the K-armed stochastic bandit, which is not aligned with the expectations that the first three sections build. The motivation is strong and broad, but the contribution of the paper does not correctly align with its motivation. The scope of the solution is narrow. It is also not clear how the findings (estimators and algorithm) can be extended to contextual setups and setups with a large number of arms.\n\n2. A known upper bound on the variance ratio is a strong assumption. Discussion of robustness to misspecification would strengthen the work.\n\n3. The regret bound improves over UCB-V by exploiting coupled uncertainties in the upper confidence bound, but there is no accompanying lower bound. Without a lower bound, it is not clear if what is done optimally utilizes the correlations between ground truth and coarse measurements. \n\n4. The simple thresholding rule decouples when to sample ground-truth from when to choose a particular arm. While it simplifies the algorithm design, it is not clear what is lost in terms of optimality with such a choice. It also aims for an anytime guarantee on the ratio of ground truths obtained. Since the time horizon is known (input to Algorithm 1), why should one enforce an anytime guarantee on the ground truth ratio? For instance, in the LLM example, having a ground truth budget is more realistic (and less stringent) than requiring an anytime guarantee on the ground truth ratio.\n\n5.
