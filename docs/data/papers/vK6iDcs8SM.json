In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen \"bullet-time\" step. The generated frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model. Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.", "tldr": "We improve 4D reconstruction from monocular videos by augmenting with bullet-time reconstructions from a generative model.", "keywords": ["4D reconstruction", "bullet-time", "generative models"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cf4558e0a60d06b22e637a3abf6ba86f5c9a241a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/363b8ba07fbc4656c8a369d1223b18550ce7c589.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes BulletGen, a method for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from monocular videos that leverages a generative diffusion model to enhance 4D reconstruction.

This raises several concerns. Firstly, the reproducibility of the method will be largely limited unless the model is released. Any further comparison with this method will highly likely not be feasible. While it is fair to use an internal model to achieve a good performance, in my opinion, it should be accompanied by a detailed comparison of the same pipeline but with a publicly available diffusion model. This is particularly important given the fact that authors use ViewCrafter in their experiments. There is nothing in the paper suggesting that using ViewCrafter would not be feasible in this setup. In the current state, it is not clear how much of the performance improvement comes from the diffusion model.\n- The novelty of the paper is more limited than the authors mention; several papers with a rather similar approach are not mentioned, and the evaluation is missing important comparisons.\n\t- Regarding novelty - I believe two important references are missing. Firstly, Difix3D+ [1] is an important work that proposed an iterative refinement process of the 3D scene with the use of a generalisable enhancement diffusion model. Not only does this work propose a significant method in part similar to this paper's contributions, but the diffusion model is available and could be used in an ablation study. Further, ViDAR [2] proposes a reconstruction method in which the novel views are generated and further enhanced with personalised diffusion to serve as the reconstruction supervision. This work uses a similar idea of generating an additional supervision signal in novel views and seems highly relevant as a related work. \n\t- Regarding evaluation - the authors cite MoSca in line 133; the evaluation should include MoSca as the compared method. It looks like MoSca would outperform BulletGen in some metrics (PSNR, SSIM). Further, the aforementioned ViDAR could be included as well (performing better in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS). Whilst the work recently got accepted to NeurIPS, and it seems not to have released the code yet, the arXiv release includes the numerical results on DyCheck in the same setup as in this paper, which makes it the same comparison as the Vivid4D used here.\n- In terms of ablation, it would be good to see isolation of contributions, i.e., add contributions to Shape-of-Motion one by one to show the reader the importance of each. This would help with the previously raised point of not being able to isolate the impact of the internal model.  \n- To strengthen the claim on the new synthesised plausible parts of the scene, one could show that both quantitatively and qualitatively. Namely, given that DyCheck provides covisibility masks, presenting results outside of such masks would effectively measure the performance of the approach in unseen parts of the scene.\n- CAT4D is currently way past the date of being a concurrent work; it was published at CVPR 2025 and released on arXiv even earlier. \n- It would be good to see examples of the captions and whether they differ between times and views.\n\t\n[1] Jay Zhangjie Wu, Yuxuan Zhang, Haithem Turki, Xuanchi Ren, Jun Gao, Mike Zheng Shou, Sanja Fidler, Zan Gojcic, Huan Ling, *Difix3D+: Improving 3D Reconstructions with Single-Step Diffusion Models*, CVPR 2025\n\n[2] Michal Nazarczuk, Sibi Catley-Chandar, Thomas Tanay, Zhensong Zhang, Gregory Slabaugh, Eduardo Pérez-Pellitero, *ViDAR: Video Diffusion-Aware 4D Reconstruction From Monocular Inputs*, NeurIPS 2025"}, "questions": {"value": "- Could you generate all your novel views with the diffusion model from the input video?

The qualitative results for extreme novel views (e.g., Fig. 1 and Fig. 3) are particularly strong.\n\t2. Simple but effective strategy. A significant strength is the method's practicality.

Limited Novelty of the Core Concept: The central idea of using diffusion models to generate novel views as supervision for a 3D/4D neural representation is not new. This concept has been substantially explored in the 3D reconstruction domain, particularly for sparse-view inputs (e.g., ReconFusion [1], Difix+[2], and others ). The paper's primary contribution is the application of this idea to the monocular 4D setting. While effective, this can be seen as an incremental, though logical, extension of existing work\n\t2. Unconvincing \"Bullet-Time\" Strategy and Temporal Consistency: My main concern lies with the \"bullet-time\" generation. The generative model is static and, more importantly, generates novel views for each time stamp independently. The paper's claim is that optimizing the global 4DGS representation (which uses shared motion bases ) is sufficient to enforce temporal consistency across these independently generated views.\n\tOther works in 4D object generation (e.g., EG4D [3], SV4D [4]) have proposed more principled solutions, such as attention-based mixing or latent-space temporal models, to explicitly enforce consistency during the generation phase. The paper lacks a discussion or comparison against such temporally-aware generative methods. The provided temporal slice (Fig. 5) only compares against the SoM baseline, which is insufficient to prove the temporal coherence of the generated content.\n\t\n\t[1] Wu et al.
