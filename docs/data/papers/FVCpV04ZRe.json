Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning, overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition, metacognitive prompting, and visualization design.

EduVisBench: A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the pedagogical visualization capabilities of FMs. It consists of 1,154 STEM problems across Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, organized by difficulty. Crucially, it introduces a fine-grained, five-dimensional evaluation rubric  grounded in pedagogical principles.\n\n2.

Inspired by expert instructional design, the framework coordinates five specialized agents to systematically decompose a problem, structure the reasoning process, and generate a coherent, interactive, and visually grounded solution.\n\nThrough extensive experiments on EduVisBench, the authors demonstrate that existing state-of-the-art FMs and LVLMs perform poorly.
