However, they struggle to perform well without sufficient labelled data, limiting their effectiveness in label-scarce scenarios. Furthermore, the absence of effective augmentation methods for time series data that can enhance generalisation whilst preserving essential temporal structures poses a significant challenge. As a result, despite the success of semi-supervised learning in other domains, these limitations have left its integration with deep learning-based MTSC largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose ShapeMatch, a novel flexible semi-supervised framework designed to enhance MTSC in label-constrained environments. ShapeMatch introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid training approach that leverages the classic Shapelet Model to guide the deep learning model in the early stages, capitalising on Shapelets' robustness for low-label regimes, and (2) ShapeAug, a tailored augmentation strategy for multivariate time series that preserves critical structural patterns whilst introducing meaningful variations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ShapeMatch surpasses existing SOTA methods for scenarios with limited labelled data, making it a powerful solution for real-world MTSC applications.

Figure 1, intended as the motivation figure, is unconvincing. The comparison between ShapeMatch (using both labeled and unlabeled data) and models (Transformer and a shapelet-only model) trained solely on limited labeled data is unfair. The paper should instead compare ShapeMatch with existing semi-supervised classification methods to demonstrate its true advantage. Moreover, at a 100% labeling rate, ShapeMatch performs similarly to the Transformer, suggesting that shapelets offer limited benefit without unlabeled data.\n2. The paper’s novelty is incremental. ShapeMatch adopts the ShapeletDistance strategy from Le et al. (2022) for shapelet search. While the proposed shapelet-guided masking (Eq. 3) is commendable, the augmentation methods (jittering, masking, cropping, shifting) are well-established and do not warrant detailed discussion.\n3. The shapelet discovery process is time-consuming. As shown in Table 8, searching with all training samples requires 10.5 hours, compared to only 0.72 hours for supervised training (Table 6), limiting real-world applicability. Although the authors acknowledge this in the appendix, prior works have already proposed learnable shapelet methods [1,2] to significantly reduce search time.\n4. The paper lacks a review of shapelet-based methods, particularly those employing learnable shapelet approaches [1,2], which substantially reduce the computational burden compared to the search-based approach described in Equation 1.\n5. The experimental baselines include only four semi-supervised methods, none of which are time-series–specific. Moreover, related works [3,4] have explored shapelet-based semi-supervised time series classification but are not discussed.\n6.
