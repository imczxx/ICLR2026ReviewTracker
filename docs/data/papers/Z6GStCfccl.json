Reinforcement learning (RL), by contrast, offers efficient execution and has shown strong results in diverse domains. Yet its progress is often bottlenecked by the challenge of designing effective reward functions, which are typically sparse and require heavy manual effort to engineer. Recent work has explored LLM-based reward generation, reducing manual effort yet remaining unstable, unstructured, and opaque. Building on the enhanced reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs, we advance this line of research toward full automation by introducing structured reward initialization, evolutionary refinement, and explicit complexity modeling. These innovations reduce reliance on manual trial-and-error while enabling more stable, interpretable, and scalable reward design. We unify them into FORGE (Feedback-Optimized Reward Generation and Evolution), a multi-agent framework that automatically forges increasingly effective reward functions.

Eureka is greedy (keeps only the best reward per generation), not population-based. Plotting average population scores for FORGE and REvolve, but not the best-per-generation for Eureka, makes the figure incomparable. A fair comparison would show the maximum score for each generation across all methods.\n\n2.2 The REvolve baseline results are incorrect. The authors state that they use the environment's extrinsic rewards as the fitness score. However, in Fig. 2, the population average for REvolve decreases over generations, contradicting REvolve’s framework, which adds individuals only if their fitness score exceeds the current population average. This guarantees that the average will never decrease (section 3.4 of the REvolve Paper). \n\n2.3 The table results for the Humanoid task do not match the video output. The task is to move as fast as possible on the x-axis without falling. REvolve’s humanoid performs this correctly and visibly better, while FORGE’s agent moves much worse, although achieving high reward results. The results and videos are thereby inconsistent.\n\n2.4 The claimed “stability”, “interpretability”, and “token efficiency” are not supported. Figure 2 shows dips even for FORGE, so it is not stable. “Interpretability” is only a depth-vs-score correlation and does not explain why rewards work. “Token efficiency” is argued but not tested. \n\n2.5 The authors claim that passing only the reward function and best score is sufficient and that raw metrics are not beneficial. Metrics can indicate which reward components failed and guide improvement in the next generation. REvolve showed that better quality feedback leads to better performance. No results are showed to support that claim.\n\n2.6 Line 217-219: the authors say “to address these limitations we generalize the evolutionary process by incorporating LLM inference…”.
