However, the derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion and manipulation tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Differentiable Simulation", "Policy Search", "Motion Planning"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/256be081f5e5ec20f1dd3139b67aa8135797a720.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b7e3013446c2170cc85076f72275c99303d80257.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, the authors formulate four properties a contact model must possess in order to have well-behaved gradients.

The authors then propose a contact formulation based on potential functions for tedrahedal meshes that satisfies these properties. To increase the computational efficiency of their model, the authors propose to blend between different potentials, i.e., between the exact potential and an approximation based on bounding spheres.

In the beginning, the authors acknowledge that there is a trade off between physical accuracy and well-behaved gradient information. However, they never investigate this trade off and solely focus on gradient quality in the experiments. In my opinion, very simple, smooth contact models can provide the same gradient quality achieved here with much less computation. The advantage of the proposed model could be increased physical realism but without experiments this is hard to judge.

In **Section 4**, the authors extend the contact potential to fulfill several desirable properties for gradient-based optimization of differentiable simulators. In particular, the authors modify the contact potential function of (Liang et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024) to have global support. However, computing the proposed potential function\nP is not efficient as it requires computing the contact potential between each pair of\ndisjoint triangles **increasing computation quadratically with the number of triangles**. Therefore, the authors suggest in **Section 5**  to interpolate between two potential function as a function of signed distance. If the objects are close the previously derived potential function is used while if the objects are far apart then a faster to compute potential is evaluated that uses a bounding sphere hierarchy to make  the algorithm computational tractable.
