We analyze the scalability limitations of existing discretization-based approaches for generating hybrid discrete-continuous sequences, particularly in high-precision domains such as semiconductor circuit layout designs, where precision loss can lead to functional failure. To address the challenge, we propose **AGDC**, a novel unified framework that *jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences*. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present **ContLayNet**, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance.
