This fragmentation limits their development to true foundation models that empower medical AI agents to learn from and predict across the full spectrum of biomedical knowledge. To address the challenges, we propose **MeDiM**, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across different medical modalities without requiring modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: it flexibly translates between images and text or jointly produces image–report pairs across domains in response to user prompts. It builds on a discrete diffusion framework that unifies vision and language modeling by modeling their shared probabilistic distribution. To empower the diffusion process to support unified and versatile medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its rich prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning abilities. Because MLLMs are trained with causal (autoregressive) masking while diffusion denoising benefits from bidirectional context, MeDiM introduces two key designs: 1) _removing the causal attention mask_ to enable a fully bidirectional information flow essential for mutual alignment, and 2) _injecting continuous timestep embeddings_ to make the MLLM aware of the diffusion steps. Extensive experiments validate MeDiM as a unified foundation model capable of high-fidelity medical generation across various domains. It achieves high-quality generation on various tasks, including medical image generation (16.60 FID on MIMIC-CXR; 24.19 FID on PathGen) and report generation (0.2650 METEOR on MIMIC-CXR; 0.2580 METEOR on PathGen). In addition, the jointly generated medical pairs improve downstream performance (+6.43% BLEU-1, +18.57% BLEU-2, +31.58% BLEU-3, and +4.80% METEOR in PathGen), which achieves access to multimodal inputs and generate coherent, clinically grounded multimodal outputs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Medical Report Generation", "Medical Image Analysis", "Multimodal Generation", "diffusion models"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/52156a6480c4aa4efb7ab7a39a768737c793dc3e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a41323ab48d4b74dd038905fbce0f95e2205cc7c.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes MeDiM, the first medical discrete diffusion model that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for unified medical generation.

Therefore, the overall contribution of the paper is limited to showing that a pre-trained MLLM can serve as the backbone for the generative model.\n\n- In line 124, the authors say that \"*Our experiments demonstrate that MeDiM can function as a versatile foundation model*\". However, the model is trained on ~1M samples from just two sources, which does not support the claim of having trained a foundation model.

I would suggest scaling back the foundation model claim.\n\n- The models used for measuring image quality on the pathology image generation task are significantly worse than the state-of-the-art. All baselines reported in the paper have FID scores >50, with the proposed model achieving a score of 24.

The model achieves SOTA results by a very large margin, not an incremental one. In Table 1, MeDiM's 16.60 FID on MIMIC-CXR is dramatically better than the next-best baseline (Med-Art's 78.97). This represents a step-change in quality for this task.\n2. The central idea of adapting an off-the-shelf autoregressive MLLM (Liquid) into a bidirectional diffusion denoiser is highly novel. The solution is simple (remove mask, add time embeddings), but its effectiveness is the key scientific finding, proving the power of MLLM priors for diffusion.\n3. Table 4 in the appendix is a model for a good ablation. It provides definitive proof that the model's success is not just from using a big model, but from the specific combination of all three proposed components. The \"w/ causal mask\" ablation, which sees performance completely collapse (mFID 20.40 $\\rightarrow$ 143.72), is a critical result that validates the entire premise.\n4. The model is not just multi-task; it's a truly unified framework. The ability to jointly generate image-report pairs (Task 3) and then use that synthetic data to improve downstream models (Fig 5c) is a powerful demonstration of a generative foundation model for medicine.\n5.

It remains an open question if an SSM-based MLLM would be an even better or more efficient backbone for this diffusion task.\n2. The entire method operates in a discrete token space, which fully depends on a high-quality VQ-VAE tokenizer. The paper uses one from \"Chameleon\". The quality of this tokenizer is a critical \"hidden variable\" that is not ablated. A poor VQ-VAE would likely cripple the model, and it's unclear how much of the visual fidelity is owed to this powerful VQGAN versus the diffusion model itself.\n3. The “downstream” validation (Fig 5b/c) is limited to one task (report generation) and one baseline (R2Gen) .

The performance jump from all other baselines is massive (e.g., 16.60 FID vs. 78.97 in Table 1). Is this gain solely from the model architecture, or is there a significant difference in training data or compute? Specifically, were the MLLM baselines (Liquid, MMaDA) fine-tuned on the medical datasets for a comparable number of steps (1M) as MeDiM?\n2. Given the extraordinary FID score of 16.60, which far surpasses all baselines, could the authors provide a much larger, uncurated set of generated images in their supplementary material? This would help reviewers validate that these strong quantitative results correspond to consistent, high-fidelity, and semantically-aligned image generation, which standard metrics cannot fully capture.\n3. The choice of a Transformer-based MLLM backbone (Liquid) is well-justified against DiT. However, have you considered alternative sequence model architectures, such as State-Space Models (Mamba), which are showing great promise for long-sequence modeling and efficiency, as potential backbones?\n4. The framework's success depends on a high-fidelity image tokenizer. How sensitive is MeDiM's performance to the quality of the VQGAN? Have you experimented with other tokenizers, and how much of the SOTA image quality is attributable to the VQGAN from Chameleon versus the diffusion process itself?\n\t5.\tFor the downstream task evaluation, the generated pairs significantly boost R2Gen (a 2020/2021-era model) .
