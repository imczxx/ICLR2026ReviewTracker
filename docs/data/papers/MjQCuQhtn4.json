As agent populations grow, this limitation leads to brittle collective behavior, where individually “smart” agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the \\emph{Ripple Effect Protocol (REP)}, a coordination protocol in which agents share not only their decisions but also lightweight \\emph{sensitivities}—signals that express how their choices would change if key environment variables shifted. These sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster and more stably than with decision-only communication. We formalize REP's protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional aggregation rules, and evaluate it across three domains: supply chain information cascades (Beer Game), preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling), and sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks). Across these experiments, REP consistently improves coordination accuracy and communication efficiency, while flexibly handling both numerical and textual signals from LLM-based agents. By making coordination a protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the emerging Internet of Agents.

The abstract and introduction blur the line between simply appending a “coordination” field to existing structured messages (e.g., in ACP-like protocols) and introducing a new protocol layer with its own state, broadcast/aggregation primitive, and action-update rule. Although section 3 makes the contributions clear but as written, a reader could reasonably conclude that coordination is just another message type rather than a distinct mechanism. Adding a diagram which shows differentiation from existing protcols/how REP complements existing protocols would be helpful and I also suggest updating the abstract and introduction more clearly, clarifying the architectural level difference from existing protocols early on.\n\nThe empirical scope also feels narrow. Beyond the two solid takeaways (failure modes of existing protocols and practical scaling benefits), several broader claims are not well supported and appear tightly coupled to the three chosen scenarios. To demonstrate that the layer itself—not merely richer text or longer messages—drives the gains, add targeted ablations: (i) an A2A control that embeds the same coordination content directly in model responses with matched token budgets but no aggregation/update; (ii) removal of the update step (broadcast-only); (iii) variants that drop or swap the aggregation/consensus component; and (iv) limited stress tests across tasks/topologies.

The model has to compute and communicate the uncertainty for (k*j) different values of the exogenous variable!\nIn other words, unless the model’s output is discrete and monotonic w.r.t. the dynamics of the network (a *very strong* assumption), computing the uncertainty becomes easily intractable for LLMs, the context length grows very quickly, and the communication overhead dwarfs that of the baseline.\n\nI understand that this computation is not done in practice but “guessed and reported” by an agent, and that is a problem as we cannot rely on that estimation as the real action the model would commit to in case the exogenous conditions change.\n\nFurther, suppose one wants to estimate the *real* uncertainty of a model w.r.t. some exogenous parameters. That should be done by either querying the model for many variations of the exogenous variables or, equivalently, computing the Lipschitz constant of the model w.r.t. the exogenous variables, which is intractable and, in most cases (e.g., Transformers), not possible at all.\n\nThis, on top of the agents that the authors assumed to be cooperative, non-malicious and synchronous, all characteristics that are non-standard in any multi-agent system.\n\nLast, the technique mimics in spirit but does not cite or mention React. If I look at Section 3, I see a similar framework to reasoning (in your case, about uncertainty and its consequences), then acting (propagating the uncertainty). Consider adding that and the related literature in the revised version of the paper.\n\n\nAnother minor issue is that, if we look at the simplified version of the problem the authors propose, and we assume agents are not malicious and veracious, it seems evident to me that the additional information provides some benefit to the system. The agents have more observability on the state of the other agents, thus they can better coordinate.\n\nTo conclude, while I appreciate the effort, I believe the work requires an extension to capture cases where this information is not necessarily veracious, there is no some anti-monotonicity in the agents behaviour (e.g., “agent A will bet 10 if variable X is 1, will bet 15 if it is it is 2, wille bet 0 if it is 3, …”), etc."}, "questions": {"value": "Q1. How would you compute the real uncertainty, in practice, for models like LLMs and under non-monotonic assumptions?\n\nQ2. In complex scenarios where models can lie or just be wrong about their uncertainty estimation (if done via prompting, as in your case), how do we trust that we will have an advantage by propagating potentially wrong information and beliefs?\n\nQ3. How do you think your framework would compare to the baseline (say, A2A), when the exogenous variables are non-monotonic? Would you discretise the interval of potential values they can assume and assume monotonicity?\n\nQ4.

Secondary aggregation step. The proposed solution seeks to enforce coordination through an external mechanism that aggregates sensitivities from neighboring agents and further enforces consensus via a secondary median-based aggregation step. To my understanding, this second aggregation step is optionally applied through human intervention in tasks requiring stronger coordination. However, this enforced alignment appears to be a workaround; a framework that genuinely incentivizes coordination should enable agents to reach consensus autonomously when appropriate, rather than relying on additional human-controlled mechanisms to impose it. The authors do not provide an ablation study in their experiments to understand the impact of this step.\n\n2. RepClient interface description. The main practical contribution of this work is the RepClient, which the authors plan to release publicly in the future. However, its current description is minimal, limited to only two brief examples of function calls. I strongly encourage the authors to provide a more detailed explanation of the client’s structure and internal processes, including a clear template or guideline for the LLM prompts required to effectively use the client and reproduce the intended results in scenarios beyond the three experiments presented in the paper. Furthermore, a step-by-step visualization of the client’s workflow would greatly enhance clarity and help readers form a comprehensive understanding of the contribution. Without these additions, it is difficult to assess the true value of the work, which currently appears rather limited.\n \n3. Experimental setup. While the authors employ three distinct settings to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method, they only compare it against a single baseline: the A2A protocol. This severely limited comparison makes it difficult to assess the realistic benefits of the proposed approach, particularly since the API calls for the two methods appear to differ significantly. Specifically, the REPL’s calls include sentences that explicitly encourage coordination (e.g., “Identify alliance patterns” and “Balance individual optimization with collective sustainability”), which are absent from the baseline’s prompts. This discrepancy raises concerns about the fairness of the comparison, as one method is inherently more biased toward cooperative behavior. I encourage the authors to conduct a more rigorous evaluation, including comparisons with additional baselines, to truly gauge the performance benefits. Moreover, the proposed communication protocol involves multiple sequential steps, yet the relative contribution of each step remains unclear. I recommend performing an ablation study to better quantify the importance of individual components and to clarify which aspects of the framework are most critical to its performance.\n\n4. Repetitions. While reading the paper, I noticed a number of identical or semantically equivalent repetitions throughout the text. For instance, the textual example in lines 173–174 is almost identically repeated in lines 306–307. This is just one example; similar repetitions appear in the descriptions of the domains. I encourage the authors to remove such redundancies, which significantly impact the readability of the manuscript.
