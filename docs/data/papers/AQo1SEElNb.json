In softmax transformers, Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) encode positions through *fixed-angle* rotations, while in linear transformers, order is handled via input-dependent (selective) gating that decays historical information. Selectivity has generally been shown to improve language related tasks. Inspired by this, we introduce **Selective RoPE**, an *input-dependent* rotary embedding mechanism, that generalizes *RoPE*, and enables rotation in all angels for linear transformers. We show that softmax attention already performs a hidden form of these rotations on query-key pairs, uncovering an implicit positional structure. We further show that in state-space models and gated linear transformers, the real part manages forgetting while the imaginary part encodes positions through rotations. We validate our method by equipping gated linear attention (GLA) with **Selective RoPE**, demonstrating that its input-dependent rotations improve performance in language modeling and on difficult sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval.", "tldr": "We introduce Selective RoPE, an input-dependent rotary embedding that enhances gated linear transformers.", "keywords": ["RoPE", "Linear Transformer", "Attention", "State Space Models", "Forget Gate"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/33b8dea155c0dbc80c2fce3f33402d7c5168c6d8.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d5138e376c0a05c9bf5c8959fd9d6919c66d9754.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors generalise RoPE to a mechanism allowing it to choose angles in a way that is input dependent.

So you can view the softmax kernel as applying RoPE but where the angles are sampled IID from a Gaussian. This however would really only be true if your angle samples tend to infinity of course. Is this how you are connecting RoPE with a \"NoPE\" softmax?\n\nI found the notation slightly hard to follow especially as someone not coming from SMMs. I mainly found confusing that RoPE is really a method used in Transformers, but the paper seems to only implemented the selective mechanism for linear attention and was not implemented for normal quadratic Transformers?
