However, two fundamental challenges remain to be addressed: (1) Model bias caused by the inherent diversity of anomaly patterns; (2) Detection inflexibility caused by the scarcity of anomaly labels. We propose MSFlow (Multi-view Score Fusion via Coupling Flows), which constructs a coupling flow-based ensemble capable of modeling complex joint distributions of multi-dimensional scores through invertible transformations. Leveraging this flexible fusion framework, we strategically select four detection perspectives (clustering and reconstruction in both temporal and frequency domains). The coupling flows learn inter-view dependencies while preserving each perspective's unique detection capabilities, achieving effective integration that simple aggregation fails to accomplish. When labels are available, an uncertainty-guided enhancement mechanism identifies high-disagreement regions in ensemble predictions and selectively refines them through a learned soft router, enabling seamless adaptation from unsupervised to semi-supervised operation. Extensive experiments on 10 univariate and 8 multivariate benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse anomaly types and label availability scenarios.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Time series anomaly detection", "ensemble learning", "Coupling flows", "Progressive supervision", "Semi-supervised learning"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e67a62932dc87c5683e8ada8434e855977dc8e6a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f958b7b467af3d2f57ce55ab5537046b4514caac.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a novel time-series anomaly detection framework that aggregates anomaly scores from multiple perspectives, including clustering-based and reconstruction-based views across both temporal and frequency domains.

Since one of the core components of the proposed model is explicitly semi-supervised (the uncertainty-guided enhancement), it is essential to compare against established semi-supervised methods such as Deep-SAD [1] and its variants. Without these comparisons, it is difficult to judge whether the improvement comes from the proposed design or simply from leveraging supervision unavailable to unsupervised baselines.\n\nAdditionally, the paper does not include comparisons with methods that also perform aggregation of multiple anomaly scores, such as W2AD [2] or related approaches. \n\nFinally, the paper could benefit from a deeper discussion on the feasibility and practicality of its selective sample-labeling mechanism in real-world anomaly detection. The motivation for how samples are selected and labeled is not entirely clear, especially considering that anomaly detection typically involves very limited and noisy labeling. Clarifying how this labeling process fits operationally into the anomaly detection pipeline would help make the contribution more convincing.\n\n[1] Ruff, Lukas, et al. \"Deep semi-supervised anomaly detection.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.02694 (2019).\n\n[2] Alnegheimish, Sarah, et al. \"M $^ 2$ AD: Multi-Sensor Multi-System Anomaly Detection through Global Scoring and Calibrated Thresholding.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.15225 (2025)."}, "questions": {"value": "Have the authors tried benchmarking against semi-supervised models such as Deep-SAD?\n\nHow does the aggregation weighting adapt when the component detectors (e.g., clustering and reconstruction) disagree?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "mWYJDe9hMQ", "forum": "nPWlYPJkJS", "replyto": "nPWlYPJkJS", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13134/Reviewer_dJd5"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13134/Reviewer_dJd5"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13134/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760576437659, "cdate": 1760576437659, "tmdate": 1762923854473, "mdate": 1762923854473, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes an anomaly detection scheme that leverages coupling flows to model the joint distribution of multiple anomaly scores, resulting in improved anomaly detection.
