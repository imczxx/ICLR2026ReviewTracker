When human annotators provide graded preferences on a Likert scale (e.g., significantly better, better, slightly better, negligibly better), existing methods typically apply ad-hoc heuristics—such as margin terms or scaling factors—to loss functions derived from binary preference models like Bradley-Terry. These approaches lack an underlying mathematical model for how ordinal preference data is generated. We present a theoretically grounded framework that formulates reward modeling with Likert scale preferences as a discrete ordinal regression problem. We derive two loss functions from this formulation: a negative log-likelihood loss and an all-threshold loss, both of which learn threshold parameters that naturally capture the ordinal structure of preferences. Unlike existing heuristic methods that manually specify fixed margins or scaling weights, our approach learns these parameters directly from data within a coherent probabilistic framework. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our ordinal regression approach consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing heuristic methods across diverse evaluation categories including chat, reasoning, and safety tasks. Our work provides the first principled mathematical framework for incorporating Likert scale preferences into reward model training, moving beyond ad-hoc modifications of binary preference models to enable more effective utilization of fine-grained human feedback.", "tldr": "We replace ad-hoc heuristics in reward modeling with a principled ordinal regression framework that properly models Likert scale preference data.", "keywords": ["reward modeling", "ordinal regression", "Likert scale", "preference learning", "human feedback", "RLHF", "discrete ordinal regression", "Bradley-Terry model", "ordinal preferences", "large language models", "alignment", "preference data"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/76d7bf3d7fb4f8f76db1c2a397e841a278b9564e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/0a65f7e54af7935642f18f3f96699409c83bb288.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a principled mathematical framework for training reward models from ordinal preference data, such as 7-point Likert scales.

This makes the method more general and removes a key hyperparameter tuning burden from practitioners.\n3.  **Generalizability:** The provided extension to DPO in Appendix A also demonstrates the generalizability of the framework."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  **Notational Inconsistency in Formulation:** There is a critical notational contradiction in the paper's core formulation. Section 3.3 explicitly states that the threshold $\\zeta_0$ is *excluded*. However, the probabilistic model in Equation (14) implicitly requires $\\zeta_0$ to compute the probabilities for $z=-1$ (which uses $\\zeta_{z+1} = \\zeta_0$). As written, this makes the central NLL loss function ill-defined.\n2.  **Missing Ordinal Evaluation of Baselines:** The paper's entire motivation is that its method *better leverages ordinal information*. However, the main experimental results (Tables 1 & 2) only report binary preference accuracy, which fails to measure this. The paper introduces excellent ordinal metrics (MAE and Accuracy-within-k) in Appendix H, but reports them only for its own method. To substantiate the paper's core claim, it is essential to compare these ordinal metrics against the baselines.\n3.  **Potentially Unfair Baseline Comparison:** The baseline methods (Margin BT, Scaled BT) are highly sensitive to their specific hyperparameters (the margin values $m(z)$ or scaling/probability values $p(z)$). While Appendix F details the hyperparameter search for the proposed methods (e.g., learning rates, regularization $\\lambda$), it is not stated that the crucial $m(z)$ or $p(z)$ hyperparameters for the baselines were also tuned. If the authors used fixed, non-optimized values from prior work for the baselines while carefully tuning their own model, the comparison is not a fair one.\n4.  **Lack of Experimental Robustness:** All results in Tables 1 and 2 are reported from a single experimental run (using \"fixed random seed 0\"). Given the known high variance in LLM fine-tuning, single-seed results are insufficient to make strong claims of superiority, especially when many of the reported gains are small (1-3%). Reporting the mean and standard deviation over multiple seeds is necessary to demonstrate robust and statistically significant improvements."}, "questions": {"value": "See the weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "NE7i5LH8Ho", "forum": "mteZOi0xyu", "replyto": "mteZOi0xyu", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23744/Reviewer_oAHx"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23744/Reviewer_oAHx"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23744/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761089947368, "cdate": 1761089947368, "tmdate": 1762942788238, "mdate": 1762942788238, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper makes the case that human preferences are inherently ordinal and current reward modeling approaches do not incorporate this in a principled manner (these rely on naive margins or scaling terms).

For example, do the ordinal methods make fewer 'large-margin' errors (option was strongly preferred but scored wrongly) than the Bradley-Terry models?
