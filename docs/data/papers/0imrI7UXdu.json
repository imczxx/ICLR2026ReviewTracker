Unlike projection-based splatting, UltraGauss renders by $\\textit{probe-plane intersection}$ with in-plane aggregation, aligning with plane-based echo sampling while remaining fast and memory-efficient. A stable parameterisation and compute-aware GPU rasterisation make this method practical at scale. On clinical datasets, UltraGauss delivers state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D reconstructions in minutes on a single GPU (reaching 0.99 SSIM within $\\sim$20 minutes), and a clinical expert survey rates its reconstructions the most realistic among competing methods.

This represents a well-motivated and technically elegant reformulation of Gaussian splatting aligned with acoustic image formation.\n\nSecond, the performance is solid and the experiments are very comprehensive. The authors conduct extensive evaluations on both clinical fetal ultrasound volumes and freehand cine sweeps, achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstructions (SSIM≈0.99) within minutes on a single GPU.

In particular, its Beer–Lambert–based attenuation formulation is conceptually similar to the radiative attenuation modeling in R2Gaussian, yet this connection is not explicitly acknowledged. The writing style and overall pipeline design also bear strong resemblance to these two prior works. Without a detailed discussion or quantitative comparison against them, the novelty claim of UltraGauss becomes weaker, as it appears to build upon established ideas without clearly articulating its distinct contributions.\n\n\n(2) The code and pre-trained models are not submitted, making it impossible to verify the reported performance or reproduce the results. Given that the paper claims substantial efficiency gains and clinical realism, open-sourcing the implementation would be crucial for reproducibility and community adoption.\n\n\n(3) Ablation interpretation and runtime trade-offs. While the ablation studies are extensive, the analysis remains mostly quantitative. A deeper discussion of why specific design choices (e.g., triangular precision vs. quaternion covariance) improve stability or speed would enhance the reader’s understanding.\n\n(4) Dependence on probe pose estimation.

The Beer–Lambert shadow term is extremely lightweight; while speed is compelling, the paper concedes deficits in speckle and multiple-scattering effects, where physics-informed baselines sometimes produce more realistic artifacts. The method’s robustness when probe geometry is imperfect is discussed qualitatively but not deeply quantified.\n2.  Core quantitative results hinge on 12 fetal brain volumes (Dataset A) and 3 freehand videos (Dataset B). That is narrow in anatomy, vendor, and probe diversity; generalization to abdomen/heart/musculoskeletal, different curvilinear geometries, and pathology is not demonstrated. Claims of broad clinical benefit feel premature without wider coverage.\n3. UltraNeRF assumes straight rays/known poses; here, curvilinear inputs are converted and poses are predicted for cinesweeps. It is unclear whether each baseline is given the same pose treatment, regularization, and time/capacity budgets across settings (e.g., RapidVol capacity vs. UltraGauss-300K/2M).\n4. The cinesweep evaluation conflates pose and reconstruction error. While that is realistic, the paper does not separate pose noise vs. reconstruction error (e.g., by repeating with GT poses on a subset, or sweeping pose perturbations). Consequently, it is hard to attribute gains to UltraGauss vs. better tolerance to pose jitter."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to weaknesses part, especially points 1&3."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "W3Xcnqq6pi", "forum": "0imrI7UXdu", "replyto": "0imrI7UXdu", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9408/Reviewer_oeeh"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9408/Reviewer_oeeh"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9408/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761957578358, "cdate": 1761957578358, "tmdate": 1762921012898, "mdate": 1762921012898, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes UltraGaussian, the first Gaussian Splatting method tailored for ultrasound reconstruction.

Additionally, an ablation study for different $\\beta$ should be added to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n- The lower triangular matrix ${L}$ lacks clear interpretability.

When the probe pose varies significantly or the viewing angle becomes complex, the projected 3D bounding box may become imprecise or inefficient. The effectiveness of the method should be further validated on datasets with more diverse and challenging probe poses.\n- The effect of the different threshold $p\\%$ for Gaussian;s probability density utilized in Eq. 12 on time efficiency should be discussed.\n\n3. **Engineering implementation and open-sourcing**: Engineering implementation is an important contribution of this work.
