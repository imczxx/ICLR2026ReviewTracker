However, they often produce inaccurate or unreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly limits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing need for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this work, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for hallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and thermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM’s response to a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood token paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By analyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under changes in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic stability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying unstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is computationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the model’s output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural networks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical interpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics. Remarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and datasets.", "tldr": "We introduce a field-theoretic framework and HalluField, an algorithm that detects hallucinations by tracking the energy–entropy dynamics of an LLM’s response under temperature perturbations.", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "hallucination detection", "variational principle", "post-hoc/model-agnostic method"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d96af3fd3bd937d871288223457eb0bc0daca4de.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a method to detect hallucinations in LLM responses by using semantic instability to determine the likelihood of hallucinations.

Introducing the first law of thermodynamics as an analogy does not necessarily make the story more compelling, especially when there is no theoretical grounding; instead, it adds unnecessary conceptual and notational complexity. The notation is rather dense and sometimes unconventional, making a relatively simple idea appear overly complicated. Readers need to spend substantial effort cross-referencing earlier equations to fully understand the computation process. For instance, Algorithm 1, which references seven equations from previous sections, is difficult to follow and fails to serve its intended role as a step-by-step illustration of the method.\n2. The experimental evaluation relies on a relatively narrow selection of benchmarks. It would be good to see how the method performs across more diverse or realistic application domains. Besides, what kind of prompt do you use for the experiments? Is it naive short-form QA, or does it also include COT reasoning? \n4. Only 1 single-sample-based method P(true) is considered.\n3.

The authors model the generation process of large language models (LLMs) as an analogue to a thermodynamic system, introducing quantities such as free energy and temperature–entropy to describe token-level behaviors.

Empirically, HalluField is significantly faster because it does not require auxiliary LLM queries. Its variant, HalluFieldSE, achieves modest but consistent AUC gains over prior entropy-based detectors (e.g., Semantic Entropy and Kernel Language Entropy) across multiple benchmarks. \n\nWhile the proposed approach successfully identifies temperature-dependent stability patterns that correlate with hallucination likelihood, the paper’s extensive thermodynamic analogy is largely explanatory in nature.
