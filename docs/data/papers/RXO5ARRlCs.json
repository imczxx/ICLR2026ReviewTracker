Current state-of-the-art FIQA approaches that integrate with face recognition (FR) training often suffer from unstable quality targets due to the evolving feature space during training. We introduce CARPM-FIQA, a novel approach that addresses this limitation by learning to predict accumulated relative point margin scores across training epochs rather than relying on single-epoch estimates. Our method quantifies image quality by tracking and accumulating the ratio between intra-class compactness and inter-class separation for each sample throughout training, providing a temporally-stable measure of sample utility. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that this cumulative averaging approach significantly reduces variance in quality estimates and improves reliability in sample ranking compared to non-cumulative alternatives. To enable quality assessment for unseen images, we extend standard FR architectures with a regression layer that predicts these accumulated values. Through extensive evaluation on eight challenging benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, CFP-FP, CALFW, Adience, CPLFW, XQLFW, and IJB-C) and across four state-of-the-art FR models, we show that CARPM-FIQA consistently ranks among the top-performing methods, with particular strength on datasets with quality variations.

I believe more focus should be placed on developing FR methods that are more broadly applicable, rather than on facial image quality assessment methods. While the methods for assessing facial image quality may assist FR models in filtering out certain extreme facial image samples, integrating them into the training of FR models seems somewhat misguided to me.\n2.\tFacial recognition or facial verification involves comparing the feature similarity of pairs of facial samples to determine whether they exceed a certain threshold; if they do, the paired facial samples/images are considered to come from the same person, otherwise not. In other words, FR checks the absolute value of the feature similarities of pairs of facial samples. The \"silhouette score\" defined by the author in Equations 1 and 5 is based on the difference in feature similarities between a sample and its within-class samples and between-class samples, making it a relative value. Therefore, I am doubtful that one can accurately assess whether a facial image is suitable for FR based on the silhouette score.\n3.\tI believe that \"intra-class compactness\" and \"inter-class separability\" express the global properties of sample features, at least the attributes of features for all samples within a class. Therefore, I don’t think that the author's assertion that a(i) indicates intra-class compactness and b(i) reflects inter-class separation is accurate.\n4.\tIn a sufficiently large feature space, even if s(i) is close to 0, the features of the sample may be far from the decision boundary.\n5.\tAfter redefining the silhouette score using feature cosine similarity in Eq. 5, some of its fundamental properties have changed.

While effective for stabilization, the proposed method suffers from significant conceptual drawbacks that are not addressed:\n\n- **Slow Adaptation/Inertia**: Cumulative averaging gives equal weight to all past epochs (1/n), meaning the current quality signal is heavily diluted by outdated information. This introduces significant lag and may prevent the model from rapidly adapting to crucial, recent breakthroughs in the feature space.\n\n- **Design Rationale vs. Alternatives**: The paper does not discuss or justify the choice of simple cumulative averaging over well-established alternatives for time-series smoothing in dynamic optimization. For instance, methods like the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) or techniques that apply decaying weights to older data are standard solutions that achieve stabilization while allowing for faster adaptation to recent, high-quality information. A discussion and analysis of these alternatives is essential to fully understand the limitations and optimal design space of the proposed stabilization method.\n\n## Minor: Presentation and Clarity\n\n- **Presentation Quality**: Several tables and figures are overly compressed and difficult to interpret at a normal viewing scale, requiring significant zooming. Improving the visual presentation and readability of the main results is necessary.\n\n- **Section Structure/Pacing**: Section 2 dedicates an unusually large portion of space to background explanations and the derivation of the proposed approach, which, given the simplicity of the CARPM formula, feels compressed and unbalanced relative to the empirical results and analysis. The authors should consider streamlining the background to dedicate more space to the experimental analysis or discussion of limitations."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **Comparison to Traditional IQA**: Please clarify the motivation for comparing the proposed integrated approach against traditional, non-FR-integrated IQA methods. Since your method's target is derived directly from the FR training process (relative point margin), it is fundamentally different from general-purpose IQA metrics. Are the standard IQA comparisons purely for completeness, or is there a specific, actionable insight derived from these comparisons?\n\n2. **Alternative Smoothing Techniques** (EMA): Could the authors discuss and ideally experimentally evaluate the use of an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) instead of simple cumulative averaging? EMA is a common technique that achieves stabilization while allowing for faster adaptation by exponentially prioritizing more recent quality scores. This analysis would directly address the slow adaptation limitation of CARPM.\n\n3. **Illustrative Samples** (Initial Epochs): Regarding the illustrated samples of quality ranking stability (Figures 5-10), it would significantly improve the clarity of the initial effect if the authors could show the ranking at Epoch 1 for both the cumulative and non-cumulative approaches. For a truly fair comparison of the stabilization effect, the initial rankings should be similar before the averaging process takes place.
