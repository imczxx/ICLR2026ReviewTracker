This paper establishes the first unified convergence framework for all four HFL topologies (Star-Star, Star-Ring, Ring-Star, and Ring-Ring) under non-convex objectives and different intra/inter-group data heterogeneity. Our theoretical analysis reveals three fundamental principles for topology selection: (1) The top-tier aggregation topology exerts greater influence on convergence than the intra-group topology, with ring-based top-tier configurations generally outperforming star-based alternatives; (2) Optimal topology strongly depends on client grouping characteristics, where Ring-Star excels with numerous small groups while Star-Ring is superior for large, client-dense clusters; and (3) Inter-group heterogeneity dominates convergence dynamics across all topologies, necessitating clustering strategies that minimize inter-group divergence.

In traditional HFL practice, topology selection often relies on intuition and experience, which the authors vividly describe as a “topology lottery.” To address this problem, the paper conducts rigorous convergence analysis under a non-convex setting for four HFL topologies composed of star-shaped (parallel) and ring-shaped (serial) aggregations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results jointly reveal three key design principles: \n(1) the top-layer aggregation topology has a greater impact on convergence than the bottom-layer topology, and a ring-shaped top layer performs better under data heterogeneity; \n(2) inter-group data heterogeneity is the main performance bottleneck; and \n(3) the optimal topology depends on the client grouping structure (e.g., Ring-Star is suitable for many small groups, while Star-Ring is suitable for a few large groups)."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. Important and Practical Problem: This paper focuses on a problem that is crucial for the design of large-scale federated learning systems. As HFL is increasingly applied in fields such as IoT and edge computing, providing theoretical guidance for its architectural design has become an urgent need.\n\n2. Novel Unified Theoretical Framework: This is the core contribution of the paper. To the best of my knowledge, no prior work has systematically compared all four mainstream HFL topologies within a single unified mathematical framework. This work fills that theoretical gap and integrates previously fragmented studies into a coherent whole.\n\n3.

That would yield more general conclusions than those in this paper — for instance, one could compute the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{W}$ corresponding to Ring–Star. Therefore, can the authors re-derive the convergence theory from a matrix perspective to obtain more general results?\n\n2.

The paper claims a \"first\" unified comparison of all four topologies, but related work already analyzes subsets and topology variants. The author is suggested to clarify more clearly what is new in the math or convergence bounds beyond those existing researches.\n2. The analysis completely ignores communication costs and latency. The convergence rate is presented in terms of global rounds. This is misleading as the wall-clock time of a round differs vastly between topologies. A star topology is parallel (O(1) latency), while a ring topology is sequential (O(G) or O(M) latency), making it extremely sensitive to stragglers. The author is suggested to provide a formal analysis of the communication complexity for each topology. The final convergence guarantee should be presented in total wall-clock time or communication cost, not just rounds.\n3. The analysis and algorithms assumes full participation from all clients in all groups in every global round, while partial participation is mentioned in the existing researches. Full participation is a highly unrealistic assumption in federated learning. The author is suggested to redesign the scenario where a subset of groups, and a subset of clients within those groups, are sampled for updates.\n4. All experiments are image classification tasks, while no speech/NLP/time-series or cross-silo medical/IoT workloads where HFL is popular. The author is suggested to include at least one non-vision dataset.\n5. Different ~𝜂 definitions per topology in the convergence analysis make it tricky for fair lr tuning. The experiments tune learning rates but lack in details. The author is suggested to report a transparent learning rate tuning strategy to ensure the results match the analysis.\n6. The paper claims HFL is for scalability, not convergence acceleration and that \"carefully selected single-tier FL configurations may actually converge faster.\" This is a strong claim, but the paper provides no theoretical or experimental comparison to single-tier FL.

The analysis and experiments are presented in global rounds, which ignores the fact that a ring topology's round is slower than a star topology's.

Can you provide experimental results comparing your best HFL topology to a well-tuned single-tier FedAvg with N=100 clients?\n5. How did you tune learning rate for the main results in Figure 2?
