Pharmacophore modeling presents an alternative for capturing the key features required for molecular bioactivity against a biological target. In this work, we present PharmaDiff, a pharmacophore-conditioned diffusion model for 3D molecular generation. PharmaDiff employs a transformer-based architecture to integrate an atom-based representation of the 3D pharmacophore into the generative process, enabling the precise generation of 3D molecular graphs that align with predefined pharmacophore hypotheses. Through comprehensive testing, PharmaDiff demonstrates superior performance in matching 3D pharmacophore constraints compared to ligand-based drug design methods. Additionally,  it achieves higher docking scores across a range of proteins in structure-based drug design, without the need for target protein structures. By integrating pharmacophore modeling with 3D generative techniques, PharmaDiff offers a powerful and flexible framework for rational drug design.", "tldr": "PharmaDiff is a pharmacophore-conditioned diffusion model that generates bioactive 3D molecules without target structures, outperforming state-of-the-art models in pharmacophore matching accuracy providing a robust tool for rational drug design.", "keywords": ["3D molecular generation", "pharmacophore conditioning", "diffusion models", "graph transformer architecture", "de novo drug design", "structure-based design", "ligand-based design", "PharmaDiff"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/fe478b540ae84d56dc575066e8daf3d87319d708.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work presents PharmaDiff, a pharmacophore-conditioned diffusion model for 3D molecular generation that enables ligand-based de novo drug design without the need for target protein structures.

Pharmacophore contains information like hydrogen bond donor (HBD), hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), etc., which are important parts when forming H-bonds between ligands and targets. However, this paper claims a setting where target protein is not needed. In such a setting, the pharmacophore becomes an abstract spatial pattern inferred solely from ligand conformations rather than a true interaction map. This raises questions about whether the conditioning genuinely captures biologically meaningful interaction constraints or merely enforces geometric regularities observed among similar ligands.\n* The experimental section appears relatively weak and does not convincingly demonstrate the claimed advantages of PharmaDiff. First, the reported improvement in pharmacophore matching is modest and does not clearly surpass strong ligand-based baselines by a significant margin, raising questions about the practical impact of the proposed conditioning strategy. Second, in the structure-based drug design (SBDD) experiments, the comparison is incomplete—many relevant baselines are omitted[1-3], and the evaluation covers only four protein targets, which limits the generality of the conclusions. Finally, an important recent baseline, Shepherd[4], which explicitly incorporates pharmacophore-based molecular design, is not included or discussed. This omission makes it difficult to assess whether PharmaDiff provides meaningful advances over state-of-the-art pharmacophore-conditioned generative models. A discussion or comparison with Shepherd would be necessary to fairly position the contribution of this work.\n* While the pharmacophore-conditioning is interesting, the generative backbone (E(3)-GT + diffusion) largely extends MiDi with additional conditioning terms. The conceptual leap might be seen as incremental rather than foundational. \n\n\n[1] Guan J, Qian W W, Peng X, et al. 3d equivariant diffusion for target-aware molecule generation and affinity prediction[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.03543, 2023.\n\n[2] Pinheiro P O, Jamasb A, Mahmood O, et al.
