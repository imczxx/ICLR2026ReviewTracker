However, our experimental observations reveal a striking vulnerability when SNNs are trained using the mainstream method—direct encoding combined with backpropagation through time (BPTT): even a single backward pass on data drawn from a slightly different distribution can lead to catastrophic network collapse. We refer to this phenomenon as the heterogeneous training vulnerability of SNNs. Our theoretical analysis attributes this vulnerability to the repeated inputs inherent in direct encoding and the gradient accumulation characteristic of BPTT, which together produce an exceptional large Hessian spectral radius. To address this challenge, we develop a hyperparameter-free method called Dominant Singular Deflation (DSD). By orthogonally projecting the dominant singular components of gradients, DSD effectively reduces the Hessian spectral radius, thereby preventing SNNs from settling into sharp minima. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSD not only mitigates the vulnerability of SNNs under heterogeneous training, but also significantly enhances overall robustness compared to key baselines, providing strong support for safer SNNs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Neuromophic computing", "Spiking neural networks", "robustness"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bd0a075b8fd0cf46e49ef7b806274797e59e4005.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/525185c005f96a571d8c095b29e046066357730f.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "1. Research Question\n- The paper addresses the instability and vulnerability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) under heterogeneous training conditions and adversarial perturbations. \n- Key problem: Why do SNNs collapse under small distribution shifts, and can this be mitigated by stabilizing their spectral dynamics during training?\n\n2. Method Proposed: Dominant Singular Deflation (DSD)\n- DSD is a spectral regularization technique applied during backpropagation. \n- Instead of modifying weights or data, DSD removes the dominant singular component from the gradient matrix (Δ W) at each update step. \n- DSD suppresses the gradient’s most unstable direction, aiming to reduce spectral explosion and improve training stability and robustness without introducing new hyperparameters or architectural changes.\n\n3. Theoretical Part\n- The authors conduct theoretical analysis based on the spectral properties of the Jacobian and Hessian during BPTT.\n- The paper formalizes *heterogeneous training vulnerability* as a consequence of the exponential growth of the Hessian’s spectral radius over time steps.\n- It shows (under simplifying assumptions) that the dominant singular direction of (Δ W) aligns across time, amplifying instability.\n- Removing the dominant singular direction theoretically reduces the Hessian’s largest eigenvalue, ensuring descent and smoother loss curvature.\n\n4. Experimental Part\n- Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and event-based datasets show: DSD stabilizes training (smoother loss, bounded gradient norms).\n- DSD Improves robustness under FGSM, PGD without adversarial training, maintains or slightly improves clean accuracy.\n- Spectral diagnostics (Hessian radius, singular value histograms) support the theoretical mechanism."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "This work reminds me of a relevant paper: SNN-RAT (https://openreview.net/forum?id=xwBdjfKt7_W). The two works do have very similar views—both aim to improve robustness by controlling the spectral properties of SNNs (singular values/Lipschitz constants). However, they have subtle but important differences in their conceptual approach, theoretical approach, and technical implementation. Therefore, I will use SNN-RAT as a comparison to discuss this paper.\n\n\n1. Theoretical Part\n\n- Presents a novel *optimization-space* spectral stabilization method, contrasting prior *parameter-space* approaches such as SNN-RAT, which constrain the largest singular value of (W). DSD instead regularizes the gradient matrix Δ W, introducing a fresh angle on robustness grounded in training dynamics.\n- Provides a clear and mathematically coherent link between Hessian spectral growth, gradient alignment, and heterogeneous training instability — a valuable conceptual contribution to understanding SNN optimization behavior.\n- Demonstrates theoretical descent guarantees via spectral deflation, suggesting that DSD maintains convergence while suppressing dominant curvature directions.\n- DSO is elegant, minimal, and free of additional hyperparameters, making it an analytically interpretable robustness mechanism.\n\n2. Experimental Part\n\n- Empirical results show that DSD improves both training stability and adversarial robustness without adversarial training, which is a notable distinction from previous works relying on adversarial data augmentation like SNN-RAT/HoSNN.\n- Consistent improvements across CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and DVS datasets, while preserving or slightly improving clean accuracy.\n- Spectral diagnostics (gradient singular spectra, Hessian radius) align closely with the theory, strengthening internal validity.\n- The evaluation includes white-box, black-box scenarios, reducing concerns about gradient obfuscation.\n\n3. Method Scalability\n\n- The DSD operation is simple and parameter-free, requiring only rank-1 spectral deflation per layer, theoretically lightweight compared to full spectral regularization in SNN-RAT.\n- The method integrates seamlessly into standard backpropagation and does not alter network architecture, making it easy to adopt in existing SNN frameworks.\n- DSO can reduce the reliance on adversarial samples in SNN adversarial training, which greatly reduces the amount of computation while providing adversarial robustness."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Theoretical Part\nOverall, the paper's proof follows the path of \"spectral analysis of the Jacobian product → increasing the radius of the Hessian spectrum → shrinking the Deflation spectrum → improving stability.\" This is intuitively reasonable.\n\n- It would be helpful for the rigor and clarity of the paper if the author could clearly state the key assumptions in each theorem. In particular, it would deepen our understanding of the problem by indicating when the core theorems proposed fail.\n\n2. Experimental Part\nOverall, I think the experimental part is clear, comprehensive, and rigorous.\n- More attack methods like Gaussion noise, APGD (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01690) could be tested. Only FGSM and PGD are tested in the current paper. \n\n\n3. Method Scalability\n- The proposed DSD step requires layer-wise SVD or power iteration, which is computationally demanding for large-scale or convolutional SNNs; the paper should quantify this cost in the main paper.\n- DSD depends on full gradient access and is thus incompatible with neuromorphic or local learning implementations, limiting its deployability on real spiking hardware.\n- The direct modification of the principal components of the gradient is a concern.
