However, channel redundancy and pronounced inter-subject variability remain key obstacles to scalable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework termed PRioritized channel Importance with Semi-supervised doMain adaptation (PRISM), enabling label-efficient cross-subject emotion decoding. On the channel side, PRISM assigns differentiable, data-dependent channel weights via a lightweight expert ensemble, amplifying reliable electrodes while suppressing distractors. On the domain side, PRISM leverages unlabeled data through confidence-filtered pseudo-labels to drive consistency regularization and domain alignment, mitigating subject-specific heterogeneity. Extensive experiments show that PRISM surpasses state-of-the-art time-series baselines on DEAP,\nDREAMER, and SEED datasets, achieving robust cross-subject generalization given limited annotations.

The core components of the proposed method are direct applications of established concepts from other domains: State Space Models (SSM) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) are borrowed from NLP, while the semi-supervised domain adaptation strategy is a well-explored concept from computer vision.

Lack of Quantitative Evidence for Channel Informativeness\nIn the introduction, the paper raises two critical challenges: identifying which EEG channels are most informative under different emotion elicitation conditions, and how to enhance emotion-related electrodes while suppressing redundant interference. However, the experimental analysis does not include any objective or quantifiable evaluation of electrode contributions. The absence of channel-level visualization or statistical analysis weakens the empirical support for the related conclusions.\n2.Limited Validation under Extreme Label-Scarce Scenarios\nThe PRISM semi-supervised strategy relies on “95% high-confidence pseudo-labeling + source–target alignment.” However, experiments only evaluate a scenario with 30% labeled target samples. In practical applications, EEG data labeling is costly and requires expert intervention,making extremely label-scarce scenarios (e.g., 5% or 10%) more realistic. It is recommended to explore model robustness and adaptation performance under such conditions.\n3.Unclear Theoretical Basis of Seasonality Mining\nThe paper mentions periodicity and seasonality in EEG signals. Yet, EEG is inherently a non\u0002stationary signal, and the theoretical rationale for seasonality mining remains unclear. The authors should clarify:\n（1）What “seasonality” specifically represents in EEG (e.g., neural oscillation rhythms, temporal\ndynamics of emotion-related regions);\n（2）What physiological or psychological interpretations these mined seasonal patterns correspond to.\n4.Outdated and Non-Specific Baselines\nThe baselines listed in Table 1 and Table 2 are relatively outdated and focus mainly on generic spatiotemporal modeling of time series, lacking relevance to EEG emotion decoding. The authors are encouraged to include recent representative methods in supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised EEG-based emotion recognition to strengthen the comparison and experimental validity.\n5.Unclear Definition and Potential Leakage in Generalization Evaluation\nThe paper claims that the INTER-SUBJECT setup verifies generalization capability, yet the definition of “generalization” is ambiguous—whether it refers to unseen subjects or unseen samples. Moreover, if the inter-subject data split allows partial subject overlap, it may introduce data leakage, thus compromising the credibility of the reported results.\n6.Ambiguity in Participant Split Proportions\nThe statement “In the cross-subject setting for semi-supervised adaptation, we construct a disjoint target-domain subset comprising 30%, 20%, and 10% of participants on DEAP, DREAMER, and SEED, respectively.” lacks detail. For instance, in SEED (15 participants), does 10% mean 1 or 2 participants? Clear clarification of participant-level partitioning is essential for reproducibility"}, "questions": {"value": "1. Quantitative Evidence of Channel Informativeness\nCould the authors provide quantitative or visual analyses (e.g., channel attention weights, electrode importance ranking, or statistical significance tests) to support the claim that certain EEG channels are more informative under different emotional conditions?\nHow does the model explicitly differentiate or enhance emotion-related channels compared to redundant ones?\n2. Validation under Low-Label Scenarios\nHave the authors evaluated PRISM’s robustness under more extreme label-scarce conditions (e.g., 5% or 10% labeled target data)?\nWould the proposed pseudo-labeling and alignment strategy still perform effectively when labeled samples are very limited?\n3. Theoretical Clarity of “Seasonality Mining\nWhat does “seasonality” specifically represent in EEG signals? Does it refer to periodic neural oscillations, or some form of temporal emotional rhythm?\nHow do the mined seasonal patterns relate to physiological or psychological interpretations in emotion processing?\nCould the authors provide theoretical or empirical evidence justifying the assumption that EEG signals exhibit such seasonality?\n4. Choice of Baselines\nWhy were mainly older or general-purpose spatiotemporal baselines chosen for comparison?\nCould the authors include more recent and domain-specific EEG emotion recognition models (particularly in semi-supervised or domain adaptation settings) to strengthen the experimental evaluation?\n4. Definition and Integrity of Generalization Setup\nHow is “generalization” defined in the inter-subject setup — does it refer to unseen subjects\nor unseen samples?\nCan the authors confirm that there is no overlap between source and target subjects to avoid potential data leakage?\n6. Clarification of Participant Split Proportions\nCould the authors clarify how the target-domain subsets (30%, 20%, 10%) were selected for DEAP, DREAMER, and SEED datasets?\nFor instance, in SEED with 15 participants, does “10%” correspond to one or two subjects?\nPlease provide explicit details on participant-level partitioning to ensure experimental reproducibility."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "hLW522xuNJ", "forum": "gdtmK6JEzB", "replyto": "gdtmK6JEzB", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7849/Reviewer_Yrsx"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7849/Reviewer_Yrsx"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7849/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761890048382, "cdate": 1761890048382, "tmdate": 1762919891276, "mdate": 1762919891276, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces PRioritized channel Importance with Semi-supervised doMain adaptation (PRISM), a novel approach that tackles two major challenges in EEG-based emotion recognition: redundant electrode information and inter-subject variability.

The proposed PRISM model is compared with general-purpose time-series models. None of the selected baselines are specifically designed for EEG representation learning and emotion detection. There are recent EEG foundation models including [1], [2], [3] and EEG-based emotion detection models such as [4], [5], which could be added as baselines. Prior works on channel selection for EEG-based emotion recognition (e.g., [6], [7]) could also be included as baselines.\n\n2. The first research question in this paper is about identifying the most informative EEG channels for emotion recognition so that it gives more weight to the important channels and less weights to the irrelevant channels. However, the paper does not explicitly present the dominant channels/electrodes. This limits interpretability of this work and does not sufficiently answer the first research question.\nPrior studies reported frontal regions [8] and hippocampus, superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus areas as primary emotion-related contributors [6]. It is unclear whether the findings from this work align with prior works.\n\n3. The paper does not include ablations isolating the contribution of each loss component for the semi-supervised domain adaptation approach. It remains unclear how performance changes when individual loss terms are removed.\n\n4. In the inter-subject setting, the authors state that pooled data are shuffled and split 3:1 into train and test sets. However, the absolute number of samples per class in the train/validation/test sets is not reported. It is unclear if there are class imbalances in the datasets.\n\n5. In the cross-subject semi-supervised setting, the authors choose different proportions of target-domain subjects across datasets (30% for DEAP, 20% for DREAMER, 10% for SEED). This choice is not justified (e.g. why 30% for DEAP and 10% for SEED).\n\n6. The study only reports classification accuracy. More comprehensive performance metrics such as, balanced accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, Cohen’s Kappa, AUROC, and confusion matrices should be included to conduct a thorough evaluation.\n\n7. No sensitivity analysis is reported for the loss weights and confidence threshold for the semi-supervised domain adaptation method, leaving unclear how robust performance is to these design choices.\n\n8. The authors argue that prior methods rely on a single weighting configuration, whereas their model introduces multiple configurations via mixture-of-experts. However, no direct comparison is provided to show the benefit of multiple weighting configurations over a single configuration baseline.\n\n9. The rationale for incorporating Mamba in the PRISM architecture is not sufficiently explained, given that many alternative temporal-spatial EEG models exist.\n\n10.
