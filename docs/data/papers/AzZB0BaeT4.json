Observing 3D live cells requires scanning through the cell volume while minimizing lethal phototoxicity. That limits acquisition time and results in sparsely sampled volumes with anisotropic resolution and high noise. Existing image restoration methods, primarily based on inverse problem modeling, assume known and stable degradation processes and struggle under such conditions, especially in the absence of high-quality reference volumes. In this paper, from a new perspective, we propose a novel tensor completion framework tailored to the nature of FM imaging, which inherently involves nonlinear signal degradation and incomplete observations. Specifically, FM imaging with equidistant Z-axis sampling is essentially a tensor completion task under a uniformly random sampling condition. On one hand, we derive the theoretical lower bound for exact cell tensor completion, validating the feasibility of accurately recovering 3D cell tensor. On the other hand, we reformulate the tensor completion problem as a mathematically equivalent score-based generative model. By incorporating structural consistency priors, the generative trajectory is effectively guided toward denoised and geometrically coherent reconstructions. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on SR-CACO-2 and four real \\textit{in vivo} cellular datasets, showing substantial improvements in both signal-to-noise ratio and structural fidelity.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Fluorescence microscopy", "Cell recovery", "Tensor completion", "Conditional diffusion"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/08755af2baca9bc6a1d57b3b188df5473896977c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper focuses on a particular imaging inverse problem in fluorescence microscopy, which is formulated as a tensor completion problem.

Diffusion models utilize an implicit prior learned from datasets. In contrast, low-rankness serves as an explicit structural prior. These two types of priors have their own distinct advantages. Therefore, the paper requires a discussion on why simply swapping these priors is a reasonable approach, and why the chosen explicit prior is more suitable for this specific problem than an implicit diffusion-based one.\n\n[1].Yuan, L., Li, C., Mandic, D., Cao, J., & Zhao, Q.
