We introduce an edge-preserving diffusion process that generalizes isotropic models through a hybrid noise scheme. At its core is an edge-aware scheduler that transitions smoothly from edge-preserving to isotropic noise, allowing the model to capture fine structural details while generally maintaining global performance. To measure the impact of structure-aware noise on the generative process, we analyze and evaluate our edge-preserving process against isotropic models in both diffusion and flow-matching frameworks. Importantly, we show that existing isotropic models can be efficiently fine-tuned with edge-preserving noise, making our approach practical for adapting pre-trained systems. Beyond improvements in unconditional generation, it offers significant benefits in structure-guided tasks such as stroke-to-image synthesis, improving robustness, fidelity, and perceptual quality. Extensive evaluations (FID, KID, CLIP-score) show consistent improvements of up to 30%, highlighting edge-preserving noise as a simple yet powerful advance for generative diffusion, particularly in structure-guided settings.", "tldr": "We introduce a novel structure-aware noise scheduler that generalizes isotropic diffusion models and allows models to explicitly learn geometric structures in the training data.", "keywords": ["generative modeling", "diffusion models", "anisotropic noise"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d600b9cf6685f13fefe6529c9e22a3d62214864e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6b8922b7174a56cca51136c471794f9940cd4af5.zip"}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
