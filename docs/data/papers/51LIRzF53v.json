However, existing evaluations mostly rely on close-ended benchmarks, while open-ended deep research benchmarks remain scarce and typically neglect personalized scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Personalized Deep Research Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating personalization in DRAs. It pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user profiles that combine structured persona attributes with dynamic real-world contexts, yielding 250 realistic user-task queries. To assess system performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures (P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research.

Deep research is a popular mode of AI agents, where an agent utilizes several tools like iterative search, to answer complex question. Personalization in the context of deep research is underexplored. This paper presents a new benchmark to evaluate the personalization capabilities of LLMs in the context of deep research.

I'm concerned about the privacy implications of the benchmark release. According to Table 5 in Appendix E, the persona collection process includes identity characteristics like name, age, gender, etc. These information along with others could often be enough to reveal the identity of an individual. \n\n2. The proposed evaluation process seems to be weak. Along the personalization dimension in Section 4.1, the authors ask the LLM to generate both the criteria and the weight of each criteria. Were these information reviewed by experts? Also, it seems unclear which LLM was used for this specific task. \n\n3. The paper misses out on key details in some sections like 4.2. Why did the paper choose not to use well-established factuality metrics like FActScore [1]? How are the verifiable claims extracted from the answers?\n\n4. How is $\\lambda_a$ in Equation 6 chosen?\n\n5. Most of the results presented in the paper are scores generated by LLM. In Section 5.5, the paper evaluates the correctness of these scores by comparing it human annotators. However, this task was simplified to a great degree where the annotator had to choose between a couple of responses. The paper compares LLM score agreement in this setting. This is not an accurate measure of correlation of the actual score (which are between 1-10). Even in this simplified setting, the correlation seems to be poor raising questions about the quality of LLM ratings. \n\n6. In Table 1, 3, and left figure of Figure 3, we observe that incorporating additional personal context doesn't change the performance too much, even the P-Score. Does this mean current LLMs aren't able to personalize based on the provided context? If not, how can the P-score be so high without any context?\n\n\n[1] FActScore: Fine-grained Atomic Evaluation of Factual Precision in Long Form Text Generation"}, "questions": {"value": "Please respond to the questions in the above sections."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["Yes, Privacy, security and safety"]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "I have concerns that releasing this dataset might compromise the privacy of the study participants."}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "lDinRk5bzI", "forum": "51LIRzF53v", "replyto": "51LIRzF53v", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5646/Reviewer_vdTb"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5646/Reviewer_vdTb"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5646/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761794902040, "cdate": 1761794902040, "tmdate": 1762918173704, "mdate": 1762918173704, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a benchmark for personalized deep research agents with 25 real human participants created persona profiles.

These two aspects are largely orthogonal to me as they measure different things. The authors did not explain why a fused benchmark is necessary. One can imagine that combining the scores of existing personalization and deep-research benchmarks are already a good metric for measuring personalized deep research agent. There is no correlation analysis showing that performance on this benchmark differs from performance on either personalization benchmarks. For example, I want to see that a model performs well on both personalization and deep research agent benchmark, but performs poorly on your benchmark. Without such evidence, the benchmark’s purpose and contribution remain weak.\n\n2. LLM as judge bias. For personalization benchmark, it's important to show that llm as judge are unbiased, potentially by comparing with the real participants' and users' feedback on some models, so you can show that llm evaluation are aligned with actual user behaviors. The section 5.5 has a alignment with some human rating, this does not address the problem, since it's a personalization benchmark rather than a rlhf benchmark. It would be great to see the actual alignment with the actual user who generated the persona.\n\n3. Scale is somewhat limited.

In response to the concerns and questions raised, we have mainly conducted the following revisions (A revised draft has been uploaded, with added content marked in blue).\n\n- Clarified theoretical grounding from prior research of the personalization metric (Section 4.1)\n- Clarified factuality evaluation methodology and rationale for metric design (Section 4.3)\n- Corrected and refined Equation 6, clarified final score computation(Section 4.4)\n- Updated evaluation cost details (Section 5.5)\n- Add experiment details and cost of report generation across different systems (Section 5.1 and Appendix J)\n- Correct the typos \n\n**We will continue to further enhance the quality of this paper according to the discussion with all the reviewers.**\n\n### **Our motivation and contributions**\n\nLast but not least, we wish to **reiterate the motivation and main contributions** of our paper.\n\n#### Motivation\nRecent Deep Research Agents (DRAs) show strong potential for complex real-world investigative tasks, yet existing evaluations focus primarily on factual accuracy and report quality, largely overlooking user-specific personalization. In real applications—such as education planning, healthcare decisions, or investment analysis—personalization is essential for actionable value. This gap motivates the need for a benchmark that evaluates DRAs’ ability to adapt reasoning and reporting to diverse user profiles.\n\n#### Contributions\n\n- We formally define the task of personalized deep research, requiring agents to integrate user persona information into retrieval, reasoning, and reporting.\n- A benchmark of 250 realistic personalized queries, combining 50 deep research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user profiles.\n- A novel evaluation framework jointly measuring:\n  - (P) Personalization Alignment\n  - (Q) Content Quality\n  - (R) Factual Reliability\n- Experiments across commercial DRAs, open-source agents, and LLMs with search tools reveal strengths, weaknesses, and open challenges for personalization.\n\nOur dataset is built from authentic user data collection complemented by dynamic contextual interactions, ensuring high realism, diversity, and annotation quality. All tasks and persona pairings undergo committee review to guarantee clarity, complexity, and alignment, providing a rigorous, trustworthy foundation for personalized research evaluation.\n\n### **Thank you!**\n\nWe sincerely hope our responses and revisions address all reviewers’ concerns.\n\nWe sincerely believe that these updates may help us better deliver the benefits of the proposed work to the ICLR community.
