Understanding the neural encoding of regret and its underlying mechanisms is crucial for advancing our knowledge of artificial metacognition and improving model reliability. To understand how regret is encoded, we must first identify regret expressions in model outputs and subsequently analyze their internal representations. This analysis necessitates an examination of the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuronal level. However, this endeavor faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics for identifying optimal layers for regret representation, and (3) the absence of methods for identifying and analyzing regret-related neurons. To address these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset via strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) for identifying optimal layers for regret representation, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) for identifying regret-related neurons, along with the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) for analyzing their activation patterns. Leveraging these metrics, we uncover a cross-layer S-CDI oscillatory decoupling pattern curve and a combinatorial encoding mechanism involving regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual-function neurons. Building on these findings, we develop an intervention framework to validate our understanding of regret coding. Guided by the S-CDI curve, we select compositionally encoded regret neurons located at optimal layers as anchors, apply gradient-based attribution to identify related cross-layer neurons, and perform controlled interventions to verify our mechanistic understanding. This work provides neuron-level insights into artificial metacognition and offers methodological tools for analyzing complex cognitive states in LLMs, thereby advancing our understanding of how such mechanisms emerge in large language models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["probing", "misinformation", "neurons"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b2ffd2992c666755526ef9ce276e7ee94ea3f89a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, the authors examine \"regret\" behavior in large language models from a mechanistic interpretability perspective.

Within the identified layers, a Regret Dominance Score (RDS) is calculated for individual neurons based on their activation patterns when the keyword \"regret\" appears in model outputs. Additionally, the authors define a Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to measure relationships between different neuron groups.

While it is commendable that the paper documents substantial details in the appendix, key steps and rationale critical for understanding the mechanistic interpretability approach—particularly the probing methodology—should be included in the main text, as how the method is applied is essential to interpret the results.  Moreover, the main text should primarily focus on providing complete high-level intuition rather than presenting dense technical details and cross-referencing essential information relegated to the appendix.\n\n- The methodology and post-intervention evaluation rely heavily on explicit keyword matching. Specifically, regret is identified by probing hidden states at \"regret\" token positions, and the intervention effectiveness is assessed primarily through keyword presence. This approach risks capturing neurons that encode the semantics of the word \"regret\" rather than neurons that genuinely represent the metacognitive state of regret itself.\n  - This keyword-centric design also raises concerns about the RDS metric's validity. Since RDS normalizes activations at \"regret\" tokens against activations at tokens from other words, the resulting scores may be disproportionately influenced by the activation magnitudes of these comparison tokens rather than capturing true functional specialization for regret processing.\n  - As the neurons are often found to be highly polysementic, it is essential to show that the intervention effect is tightly manifest in \"regret\" behavior and not highly correlated to other behaviors.\n\n- In the \"Neuron Intervention: Single v.s. Compositional\" experiment, the performance difference could also be explained by the number of neurons intervened. More experiments should be conducted to show that the performance difference is not (or weakly) related to the number of neurons involved.\n\n- The method is subject to the choice of a different threshold (τ) as the values are different for each model scale.\n\n- The analysis is restricted to the LLaMA-2 family, which undermines the finding's generalizability."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the above section."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "UuHG4EplmN", "forum": "0pw5Qmfynp", "replyto": "0pw5Qmfynp", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4062/Reviewer_Woey"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4062/Reviewer_Woey"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4062/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761816551445, "cdate": 1761816551445, "tmdate": 1762917160092, "mdate": 1762917160092, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "gVHHj7QAfb", "forum": "0pw5Qmfynp", "replyto": "0pw5Qmfynp", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4062/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4062/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763105334860, "cdate": 1763105334860, "tmdate": 1763105334860, "mdate": 1763105334860, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper explores the neural and representational basis of regret in large language models (LLMs).

The authors frame this as a form of artificial metacognition, where the model evaluates and revises its own outputs. To understand how regret is encoded, the authors look at which transformer layers most clearly encode regret signals, and how those signals are structured. They introduce three new metrics for understanding regret signals and build a novel dataset by prompting models with fake evidence -> hints -> true evidence, eliciting gradual regret responses.

Lines 146-148 say, “While these existing approaches have advanced our understanding of how LLMs encode various linguistic features, there has been no quantitative analysis on which layers are the most important”. Actually, I think there were some quantitative analyses from existing probing research, such as [1, 2]. Paper [1] chose the layer where the probing vector is most effective. Paper [2] chose the layer where the two groups have the largest separation.\n\n[1] Andy Arditi, Oscar Obeso, Aaquib Syed, Daniel Paleka, Nina Panickssery, Wes Gurnee, and Neel Nanda. Refusal in language models is mediated by a single direction, 2024.\n\n[2] Lennart Burger, Fred A. Hamprecht, and Boaz Nadler. Truth is universal: Robust detection of lies in llms, 2024.\n\n(2) The design of S-CDI seems a little ad hoc. I think it needs more justification. I am wondering why the compression efficiency is important. If we want to extract the layer that contributes the most to inducing the regretful behavior, then maybe compression efficiency is not important here. Besides, I didn’t fully understand why a lower S-CDI is better. A lower S-CDI indicates lower I_c(Z) and higher I_e(Z). It indicates that instances within the same class are less similar, and there is less separation between different classes, which means that the regret instances are less separated from the non-regret instances. I think in the optimal layer, the regret instances should be highly separable from non-regret instances. I am a little confusing here, and I am not sure whether my understanding is correct. Please let me know if my understanding is wrong.\n\n(3) Lines 338-339 say, “Acc(Z − S) represents the classification accuracy after deactivating neurons in set S by setting their activation values to −1.” Maybe this deactivation method is not a standard approach. I think a more standard way is to set it to 0. If we set the activation values to -1, it might be out of the original representation distribution, which might lead to the model’s unexpected behaviors.\n\n(4) Figure 4 (a) shows the probing accuracy and S-CDI. Except for the first layer, it seems that accuracy and S-CDI do not have a strong correlation. For layers after the first layer, when S-CDI changes, the accuracy almost stays the same. So I wonder whether S-CDI is a good metric to indicate the regret-related layer.\n\n(5) Lines 395-396 say, “We will focus on the layer with the lowest S-CDI values (Last layer).” The last layer is directly connected to the output layer, so it is natural that the last layer contains the most related information to regret. It is more meaningful to study other layers.\n\n(6) In the neuron intervention experiments, this paper finds that single-group intervention is not very effective, but combining RegretD with Non-RegretD or DualD is much more effective. Since Non-RegretD and DualD are marked as neurons less related to regret, these results make me wonder whether RDS is a good metric for identifying regret-related neurons.\n\n(7) A minor issue: The presentation needs some improvement. There are many details in the appendix, but the main content lacks enough information to understand the high-level ideas of some experiments. For a paper with many designs and many experiments, it is natural to put details into the appendix, but the main content should at least include brief high-level ideas of the experiments.\n\n(8) A minor clarity issue: Line 309 or 310 says, “To identify functionally distinct neuron subsets within Z”.
