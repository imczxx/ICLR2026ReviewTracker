However, learning such skills with dexterous, multi-fingered hands remains largely unexplored, leaving their potential for stable and efficient manipulation underutilized. Progress has been limited by the lack of large-scale, contact-aware non-prehensile datasets for dexterous hands and the absence of wrist–finger control policies. To bridge these gaps, we present DexMove, a tactile-guided non-prehensile manipulation framework for dexterous hands. DexMove combines a scalable simulation pipeline that generates physically plausible wrist–finger trajectories with a wearable device, which captures multi-finger contact data from human demonstrations using vision-based tactile sensors. Using these data, we train a flow-based policy that enables real-time, synergistic wrist–finger control for robust non-prehensile manipulation of diverse tabletop objects. In real-world experiments, DexMove successfully manipulated six objects of varying shapes and materials, achieving a 77.8\\% success rate. Our method outperforms ablated baselines by 36.6\\% and improves efficiency by nearly 300\\%. Furthermore, the learned policy generalizes to language-conditioned, long-horizon tasks such as object sorting and desktop tidying.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["tactile", "robotics", "dexterous hand", "manipulation"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2d2664e0900998aba3f257e428d2ea26529a7f43.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/83792aa1860af2aa9b9134910d256c7c4a3b8569.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce DexMove, a framework for tactile-guided, non-prehensile dexterous manipulation.

This data is used to train a flow-matching model to establish initial contact, a network called TaFo-Net to predict future contact forces, and the main DexMove-Policy, which generates goal-conditioned wrist-finger motions.

There are a few consistency and clarity issues throughout Sections 3 and 4. For example, $d^{\\mathrm{tip}}$ in Eq. 2 is undefined. In Sec. 3.2, the author defines $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{v \\times 4}$, but in Sec. 4.3, the historical tactile data is denoted as $V_{-T_p : 0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T_p F \\times vC}$. This reuse of the same symbol with different dimensions could be confusing. $P^{\\mathrm{hand}}$ and $A^{\\mathrm{hand}}$ seem to be redundant as one can always derive $P^{\\mathrm{hand}}$ with FK.\n- The overall framework is composed of three separate neural networks (Figure 4). Although it is validated through system-level evaluation, the authors do not provide a clear justification for this modular decomposition over a more integrated architecture. Moreover, the DexMove-Policy is conditioned on a planned force schedule $G_{1:T_f}$ predicted by TaFo-Net. This could lead to compounding errors, yet no evaluation of the system's sensitivity is reported. The choice of flow matching is also presented without justification over the cited diffusion policy. A brief discussion on why flow matching is preferred would be greatly appreciated.\n- A disentanglement of the data contributions would further enhance the paper's quality. An experiment showing performance when training only on simulation data (e.g., with heuristic forces) is a critical missing baseline to validate this hypothesis. The claim that the isomorphic sensor design \"minimizes the domain gap\" is also not validated."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "KVPOwvFCsv", "forum": "dT3ZciXvNX", "replyto": "dT3ZciXvNX", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission829/Reviewer_Y6vV"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission829/Reviewer_Y6vV"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission829/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761602482063, "cdate": 1761602482063, "tmdate": 1762915621637, "mdate": 1762915621637, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents DexMove, a novel data-driven framework for learning tactile-guided non-prehensile manipulation using dexterous hands.

Limited Evaluation Scope and Generalization Evidence – Although real-world experiments demonstrate promising success rates, the object set remains small and relatively homogeneous (rigid, medium-sized items). The absence of tests on soft, slippery, or deformable objects limits claims of generalization.\n2. The experimental evaluation mainly covers lateral pushing, sliding, and simple rotational tasks, but lacks richer contact interaction types such as pressing, squeezing, or compliant surface exploration, which are essential to demonstrate the full potential of tactile-guided dexterous control. Expanding the benchmark to include pressing or deformable-object manipulation would provide stronger evidence of versatility.\n3. Several parts of the paper, especially the method section, are densely written without clear intuitive explanation. The logical flow among the three modules (ContactFlow, DexMove-Policy, and TaFo-Net) could be clearer. A cleaner, layered schematic emphasizing data flow and module dependency would make the overall system architecture much easier to understand.
