Traditional approaches rely on probabilistic models to account for the uncertainty, but often require explicit noise assumptions, in turn limiting generalization. In this work, we propose a novel method to learn a structured latent representation, in which distances between states directly correlate with the minimum number of actions required to transition between them. The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions. We empirically validate the approach on a range of RL tasks, demonstrating improved robustness to sensor noise and superior state estimation compared to baseline methods. Our experiments show enhanced performance of an RL agent via the learned representation, eliminating the need of explicit noise augmentation. The presented results suggest that leveraging transition-aware metric spaces provides a principled and scalable solution for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making.", "tldr": "Learns a dynamics-aligned latent metric where distance reflects minimal action steps, fuses multimodal observations via inverse-distance weighting (no noise model), and achieves robust state estimation with better RL performance.", "keywords": ["Multimodal", "RL"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4be1c27eac221f0e3199f5c7fe2ea383e0a2b531.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d791c823b7057f6970b6c60444754e3ec68a6823.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Authors propose a new latent metric (MetricMM) for sensor fusion and state estimation.

Please discuss and include this citation in your work. \n\n- The paper should make more clear to the reader that this approach assume deterministic dynamics. Is not clear to me how this approach will behave in the case of stochastic dynamics where the distance between states becomes an expectation and the minimum action distance will provide just a lower bound on that. And a broader discussion of this limitation is needed. The authors should explicitly state this assumption and dedicate a discussion to this limitation, outlining how the framework will behave in this scenario.\n\n- The paper uses a symmetric metric (Euclidean distance) to approximate the Minimum Action Distance, which is inherently asymmetric in most realistic environments. For instance, in environments with irreversible or asymmetric dynamics. By enforcing a symmetric metric, the model is forced to learn an inaccurate representation that cannot capture such crucial, directional aspects of the environment's dynamics. As noted in prior work (Steccanella et al., 2022), this forces only to learn a symmetric approximation of the true Minimum Action Distance.
