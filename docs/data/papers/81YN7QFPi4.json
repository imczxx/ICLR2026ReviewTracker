(2017).\n- The consistent alignment between training and test loss or accuracy observed throughout training is presented as strong evidence for the existence of label leakage.\n- The high classification accuracy obtained, nearly perfect without filtering and substantially exceeding chance levels even after filtering, suggests that the classifiers examined, namely LSTM and EEGChannelNet, primarily exploit temporal confounds rather than encoding stimulus-related neural activity."}, "questions": {"value": "- Q1. Since the data from all participants were combined before being divided into training and test sets, has any analysis been conducted, or is supporting evidence available, that demonstrates the presence of temporal correlation when subject pooling is avoided?

This study provides clear evidence that applying a 14–71 Hz bandpass filter does not effectively mitigate the issue. In light of the electrical engineering principle concerning filtering and modulation cited in the paper, were alternative high-pass or band-stop filter thresholds tested to determine the precise conditions under which temporal correlation remains and cannot be eliminated after processing?\n- Q3. The findings indicate that after filtering, EEGChannelNet achieves substantially higher classification accuracy than LSTM, leading to the interpretation that EEGChannelNet is even more sensitive to the confound.
