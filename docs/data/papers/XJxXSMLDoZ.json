However, these methods remain constrained by the limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["autonomous driving", "VLA", "discrete diffusion"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/aeaf2a5acbeaafe94af3418781fbb2740f6a4c87.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes ReflectDrive, a VLA-based end-to-end planner that (1) discretizes 2D waypoints into a token codebook; (2) uses a discrete diffusion (masked-LM–style) model to inpaint trajectories; and (3) adds a reflection loop at inference: detect unsafe tokens via a safety scorer, do local discrete search to find a “safety anchor,” then re-inpaint around it—no gradients needed.

Nicely matches the structure of discrete diffusion (mask/remask/inpaint) and makes constraint injection tractable at inference. \n2. **Practical safety loop**: the local Manhattan search over tokens + re-inpainting is simple and fast, with most cases finishing in 1–3 reflection iterations. With five diffusion steps, remask-low-confidence decoding, K=3 goals, NMS=0.9 m, max 10 refinement steps. Concrete enough to re-implement.\n3. **Ablations and attribution**: Tables in the experiments section isolate contributions of goal-conditioning vs safety-guided regeneration;"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Cons: (There are no obviously novel concerns, but some questions)\n1. A core theme of the paper is safety and rules. From the ablation in Table 2, Goal-Conditioned Generation (GCG) and Safety-Guided Regeneration (SGR) have the larger impact. So I infer that the “safety” you highlight mainly comes from this reflective module. If so, on the one hand, where does Discrete Diffusion deliver unique value? On the other hand, did you try other trajectory parameterizations combined with goal and safety-anchor guidance?\n2. There is a lack of description of the training data for multi-modal behavioral modes. I’m curious how the training data influences behavioral multi-modality: if the data is concentrated on a small set of behaviors (i.e., collected from only a few drivers’ styles), how do you train a top-k set of diverse behaviors? How do you avoid trajectory mode collapse?\n3. There is a lack of description of the training data for multi-modal behavioral modes.

In the Introduction, the paper emphasizes that guidance needs gradients, leading to slow sampling, hyper-parameter sensitivity, and potential instability. It repeatedly claims one benefit of discrete diffusion is eliminating gradient computation to reduce cost, and around line 60 states that other deployment schemes suffer slow sampling due to gradients. However, generation-based planning also depends on the number of sampling steps and the stochastic process; you use step-skipping with only 5 steps, yet the paper appears to lack experimental analysis on computational cost and speed, while stressing that “discretization enables efficient search.” The Limitations section explicitly notes that no algorithmic/engineering acceleration was applied and there is still room for efficiency improvement. Additionally, around line 203 the paper says accuracy is affected by discretization resolution; as resolution increases to meet accuracy/quality, inference speed will inevitably be impacted, and that speed is tightly coupled with the large model’s forward pass. I hope the authors can provide analysis and results validating the significance of discrete diffusion, the inference speed, and the effect of resolution.\n5.  The paper calls NAVSIM a “real-world autonomous driving benchmark,” but NAVSIM is a data-driven simulator; that nuance matters for claims of real-world safety. Please clarify wording and discuss implications (non-reactive agents, sim-to-real).\n 6. Some baselines use Camera+LiDAR (e.g., Transfuser, Hydra-MDP, DiffusionDrive/GoalFlow) whereas ReflectDrive is camera-only in the main line. Mixed-modality comparisons are informative but not apples-to-apples; add camera-only versions of diffusion/flow baselines or provide a C&L variant of ReflectDrive.\n7. Safety oracle realism. The reflection loop’s default scorer assumes constant-velocity surrounding agents, which the authors themselves link to sub-par TTC/NC vs the oracle variant; this can bias safety judgments during reflection. Please add a learned (or stronger rule-based) predictor to close the realism gap.\n8. Reward/metric shaping risks. The Global/Local scorers combine hard safety gates with weighted PDMS-like terms; optimizing a test-metric proxy at inference risks over-fitting to evaluator quirks (e.g., binary TTC thresholding). Provide robustness checks or alternative scorers.\n9. Missing discretization specifics. The core idea hinges on codebook resolution (Δg), grid size |A|, and search radius δ. The paper states spatial range  [−100,100 ], but not Δg nor the token vocabulary size actually used at inference; please report these and study sensitivity.\n10. Latency and systems profile.  The method is “designed for real-time,” yet no ms/frame or hardware stats are given (diffusion steps + reflection iterations + scorer costs). Please provide latency/throughput/memory on a target GPU/SoC and discuss worst-case bounds."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Codebook & search: What Δg and codebook size |A| do you use? How is δ chosen (and its runtime impact)? Any adaptive δ strategy during reflection?\n2. Noise schedule: You mention cosine-like masking, S=5 inference steps. What is the exact masking schedule during training/inference (token-wise remask policy, “remask low-confidence” threshold)?\n3. Please formalize how “at-fault” collisions are computed and how TTC is thresholded; include ablations of scorer weights, W_ep, W_ttc, W_c.\n4. Goal proposal: Why K=3 and d_NMS=0.9 m? Show sensitivity (K=1/3/5/10 already partly given—add per-metric trends and qualitative examples).\n5. Variance & failures: In the oscillation failures (boundary vs collision), did larger δ or more iterations fix them, or is it a structural issue of discrete grids?
