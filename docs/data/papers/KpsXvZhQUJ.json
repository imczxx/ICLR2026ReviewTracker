We recognize that the review period is short and the workload is overwhelming, and therefore, some misunderstandings of our paper are to be expected. We will answer some common misconceptions in this post.\n\n**Diffusion Models or Flow Matching**\n\nWe thank Reviewers 7Hz1 and YuPo for the suggestion to change our paper title. Flow matching is considered part of the broader family of diffusion models in the literature (see the blog post [diffusionflow.github.io](diffusionflow.github.io)). Indeed, the exact derivations of the training objective differ along DDPM, score matching, flow matching, etc. But all classes of diffusion models are consistent in the sense that a model observes a forward process where data degrades to noise (either via a stochastic differential equation or an interpolation) and learns to reverse the process to generate realistic data.\n\nOur method is based on asynchronous flow matching, which extends flow matching and aligns with this characterization of diffusion models, so we believe changing the title is unnecessary. We will clarify this connection between flow matching and diffusion in Section 2.2. Our motivation for using flow-matching is that it is conceptually the simplest model to enforce asynchronous noise schedules since the noise schedule of every component of the data is linear.\n\n**Motivation for using Diffusion Models**\n\nWe thank the reviewers for questioning our motivation for using DMs, and we agree that the introduction can benefit from more explanation.  The motivation for applying DMs to TPPs stems from their core strength: *learning complex distributions that characterize a dataset without relying on strong parametric assumptions* (i.e., Poisson/intensity or IFTPP - mixture of Gaussians), allowing greater model flexibility. This aligns naturally with the TPP objective of modeling the conditional distribution $p(\\tau_i, k_i | H_i)$.  In the flow matching and diffusion literature, it is established that learning a distribution is equivalent to learning a *vector field that transports a simple base distribution* (e.g. Gaussian distribution) to a more complicated target distribution. In our paper, this corresponds to the distribution of entire event sequences. Samples are drawn by initializing Gaussian noise $\\epsilon$ and solving the proposed ODE (Equation 6) in latent space. DMs also achieve state-of-the-art results in image/video/audio generation tasks, showing their effectiveness in learning complex distributions. Furthermore, unlike prior TPP models that adopt an autoregressive formulation, our model enables *joint generation of multiple events while flexibly conditioning on arbitrary past windows*. This is enabled by our asynchronous noise schedule, which generalizes beyond synchronous or autoregressive conditioning and allows arbitrary observation/prediction splits. To the best of our knowledge, ADiff4TPP is the first method to have this property in the TPP literature.\n\n**Motivation for Modelling in Continuous Latent Space**\n\nWe thank Reviewer mdrw for correctly identifying our motivation behind mapping events (which consists of a numerical time and categorical mark) into a continuous latent vector where diffusion models operate most effectively. However, we acknowledge that this design choice can benefit from more justifications.\n\nWe adopt a latent diffusion approach to cleanly separate event representation (via VAE) and sequence modeling (via DiT). Defering temporal dependencies to the DiT allows for better control and flexibility over arbitrary observation/prediction windows.\n\nThe following papers (particularly the first paper) explain the benefits of performing diffusion in latent space, namely synthetic speed, expressivity, and tailoring in the presence of discrete data.\n\n* Arash Vahdat et al. Score-based generative modeling in latent space. NeurIPS, 2021.\n* Zhang, H. et al. Mixed-type tabular data synthesis with score-based diffusion in latent space. ICLR, 2024.\n* Rombach, R. et al. High-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models. CVPR, 2022\n\nWhile prior works (Austin et al., 2021; Inoue et al., 2023) have explored discrete diffusion, models for mixed data types like event sequences remain underexplored. Our method balances efficiency and interpretability, as the VAE ensures structured encoding of heterogeneous data, while the decoder faithfully reconstructs categorical event types. \n\nThat said, to the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to use DMs to predict event time and category rather than only event time as in EventFlow and Add-Thin.\n\nThank you once again for your careful consideration and helpful feedback. If any questions remain, or if any clarification would be useful, we would be very grateful to hear from you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAuthors of Paper ID 18848"}}, "id": "oyAgybjLJF", "forum": "KpsXvZhQUJ", "replyto": "KpsXvZhQUJ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18848/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18848/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18848/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763488868884, "cdate": 1763488868884, "tmdate": 1763488868884, "mdate": 1763488868884, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a new diffusion-based model for TPPs.

There is no theoretic reason why even when presented with noisier (teacher forced) past, the model should be limited.\n- Shorter solving of ode for forecasting does not incorporate that later events also get less update steps, i.e. same trade-off between number of steps and expressivity. Furthermore, it could be that one actually needs more steps overall, since events are not updated at each step.\n\n\nMethod:\n- TPPs are generative models, but this method only learns to forecast the next fixed number of points. \n- Usage of VAE compared to other common encodings is unmotivated and not properly showed beyond limited ablation. Why would we want to model in the latent space?\n\nExperiments:\n- Limited evaluation: It proposes a new noise schedule, but only presents limited ablation of the schedule. \n- Claiming efficiency, but do not provide wall clock comparisons.\n- Limited number of benchmark datasets.\n- Do not evaluate against AddThin, EventFlow, Ludke et al. 2024 for long-lange forecasting, even though they have shown Sota results. I know that none of them model marks, but could still be compared against, especially within their evaluation metrics.\n\nMinor:\n- Lacking command of related work, e.g., AddThin does not model the intensity, but instead directly the joint distribution; Ludke et al. (2024) does not allow direct likelihood evaluation; EventFlow is not a diffusion model and a lot of related work on TPPs is missing.\n- Flow matching is claimed to be a variant of DMs, which is not true. \n\n\n\n\nOverall, proposing an asynchronous noise schedule is interesting but is improperly motivated and supported. Furthermore, to me the contribution of an asynchronous noise schedule is limited and in my honest opinion only warrants a workshop paper, i.e., is not a main track contribution.
