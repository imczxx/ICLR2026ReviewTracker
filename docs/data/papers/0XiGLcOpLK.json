This is because the ``trial-and-error'' training style makes RL agents extremely dependent on the specific traffic environment, which also requires a long convergence time. To address these issues, we propose a novel Federated Imitation Learning (FIL)-based framework for multi-intersection TSC, named FitLight, which allows RL agents to plug-and-play for any traffic environment without additional pre-training cost. Unlike existing imitation learning approaches that rely on pre-training RL agents with demonstrations, FitLight allows real-time imitation learning and seamless transition to reinforcement learning. Due to our proposed knowledge-sharing mechanism and novel hybrid pressure-based agent design, RL agents can quickly find a best control policy with only a few episodes. Moreover, for resource-constrained TSC scenarios, FitLight supports model pruning and heterogeneous model aggregation, such that RL agents can work on a micro-controller with merely 16{\\it KB} RAM and 32{\\it KB} ROM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, FitLight not only provides a superior starting point but also converges to a better final solution on both real-world and synthetic datasets, even under extreme resource limitations.", "tldr": "FitLight: Federated Imitation Learning for Plug-and-Play Autonomous Traffic Signal Control", "keywords": ["Autonomous System", "Traffic Signal Control", "Federated Imitation Learning"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e54778accdf8710dde8320638984bc9dac8a1012.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f7547186b62a83d1e5c0827c97c881de2b0b02a4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a federated learning method to improve the generalizability and convergence speed of traffic signal control.
