Existing data-driven methods often suffer from lack of equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable objects and their collisions. We propose an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features, enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental results on 2D and 3D scenarios show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations across diverse object configurations. It achieves 24.34% to 57.62% lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model. Furthermore, EqCollide could generalize to more colliding objects and extended temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.", "tldr": "EqCollide: an end-to-end equivariant neural field simulator for deformable object collisions, achieving accurate, stable, and scalable predictions via collision-aware message passing", "keywords": ["Equivariant Neural Fields", "Deformable Object Simulation", "Graph Neural Networks", "Collision Detection"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b7805a40a77f7acfcf86562a8210c5b3b486ab2b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces EqCollide, a novel simulator for deformable object collisions.

The authors should clarify whether SGNN's high error is due to the discreteness of its spatio-temporal representation, its lack of end-to-end equivariant design, or its mechanism of rebuilding the graph at each frame.
