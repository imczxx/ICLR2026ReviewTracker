In this work, we present a programmable model for the discovery of molecules within synthesizable space. The model can generate synthesizable molecules subject to complex logical queries of molecular properties. By leveraging this querying capability, molecular optimization with respect to black-box oracle functions can be performed through iterative refinement of the queries, which achieves high optimization efficiency while preserving synthesizability. We demonstrate the model's high coverage of the synthesizable chemical space, achieving a record-high 92\\% reconstruction rate on a chemical space projection test set curated from the Enamine REAL database. We then evaluate its capability for complex query-based molecular design through a series of multi-objective molecular discovery benchmarks. Finally, we show that the query-based molecular optimization technique achieves substantially higher sampling efficiency than both synthesis-based and synthesis-agnostic methods.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["synthesizable chemical space", "molecular design"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8212d0e68e9491e35351ae21a1ab2835f571f6f7.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes PrexSyn, a programmable generative model designed to directly explore the synthesizable chemical space.\nAs input features, it uses descriptors such as ECFP4 fingerprints, molecular weight, ClogP, and TPSA.\nIn addition, the authors applied a method inspired by logic gates, adopting a product-of-experts formulation.\nThe model was tested on various benchmarks, including Enamine REAL, ChEMBL, Guacamol, and sEH binding (docking).\nThey employed an iterative black-box oracle-guided refinement process."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

It looks like a neat and novel trick to me, although it is possible that it has already appeared in prior work that I am not aware of.\n\n**(S3)**: The paper is well-written and mostly clear (apart from things mentioned in **(W1)** below)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**(W1)**: A few aspects of the work are so far not fully clear to me:\n\n- **(W1a)**: The authors mention the ECFP4 fingerprint is a supported molecular property, which would make it a vector-valued property (with the exact length depending on how it's folded). The example in Figure 1c shows a function `ECFP` with a binary string argument, while examples in Table 2 a function `ECFP4` with a SMILES as argument (both suggesting a scalar-valued property of fingerprint _similarity_ rather than fingerprint itself). Am I correct to assume the fingerprint is always a scalar-valued property of fingerprint similarity to some vector, and that vector can be derived as a fingerprint of some given seed molecule, although that can also change later during mutation?\n\n- **(W1b)**: When generating the postfix notation of synthesis, can the model pick any forward reaction template, as long as it matches the reactants (i.e. masking out inapplicable reactions), or is there any validation of applicability, e.g. through a forward reaction model? Template match alone doesn't guarantee the reaction would actually make sense (and in fact it's a somewhat weak signal, because in the forward direction, given reactants, one could say usually a single reaction can only happen, so if two templates match, one of them likely does not occur in real life). Also, what happens if template application produces more than one result (stemming from the template matching in multiple places due to symmetries, e.g. see Figure 2 in [1])? These questions would largely also apply to SynFlowNet, but I'm equally unsure if they are addressed there (please correct me if they are).\n\n- **(W1c)**: Is there any explanation behind the optimization results in Figure 3 being the same up to ~1k steps, and then the conditioned approach rapidly outperforming? It's a minor point, but some intuition behind this would be great.\n\n**(W2)**: The scaffold-based tasks use soft scaffold presence scoring, which is a practical approach to make the optimization tractable, but in real-world drug discovery one would often prefer an exact match of the scaffold (and optimize properties under that constraint). It's fine to optimize the soft constraint, but it would be great to see the results then evaluated under the strict match requirement; I wonder if PrexSyn's optimization is flexible enough to find solutions which match the scaffold exactly. One point of comparison would be the scaffold-based Guacamol-style tasks from the MoLeR paper [2].\n\n---\n\n**Nitpicks**\n\n- \"oracle function is defined as the negative docking score predicted by a proxy models\" - shouldn't this be \"proxy model\" (singular)?\n\n**References**\n\n[1] \"Chemist-aligned retrosynthesis by ensembling diverse inductive bias models\"\n\n[2] \"Learning to Extend Molecular Scaffolds with Structural Motifs\""}, "questions": {"value": "See **(W1)** above for questions."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "18ngMS7Nry", "forum": "SlVkjuq5Ig", "replyto": "SlVkjuq5Ig", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission622/Reviewer_MAr7"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission622/Reviewer_MAr7"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission622/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761938790295, "cdate": 1761938790295, "tmdate": 1762915567692, "mdate": 1762915567692, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a decoder only transformer model (PrexSyn) for generating products from a combinatorial search space according to a postfix notation of synthetic pathways based on user specified molecular property queries.

So the ability to handle such user specified requirements without retraining is certainly a strength of this paper. While there exists recent prior work on utilizing decoder only transformer models with molecular properties as prompts towards building programmable generative models, the authors focus on using a postfix notation for constructing products out of combinatorial chemical spaces is original and has practical utility.

Although I found the exposition interesting, the proposed logical query composition relies on strong (and not realistic) independence assumptions. The synthesizability guarantees are also limited to syntactic feasibility with respect to the postfix notation (which induces a valid SMILES), not necessarily practical synthesis, so the claims around synthesizability are perhaps a bit overzealous. I also found the claims relating to functional generalization to not be convincingly demonstrated, since all the downstream tasks in question are related to docking (i.e., structural, not functional). The experimental evaluations invite questions around the design and key experiments such as those summarized in Table 2 are lacking a baseline for comparison, so the quality of the reported performance is unclear."}, "questions": {"value": "Can you expand on the training setup? How are prompts sampled / constructed during training? It isn't clear to me whether all of the properties are being passed as input to the prompt or a subset of them, how the threshold values are chosen (since prompts like \"MOL_WT < 500\" can be supplied, that suggests that inequalities were used in the prompts during training), etc. How are the more complex prompts like ECFP, FeatureSim, and ScaffoldSim utilized in training vs. inference? I.e., can a user specify a prompt on ECFP based similarity to a query SMILES that was not utilized during training (or to a scaffold), or do these need to be pre-selected at training time? \n\nTable 1 reports results of different recent algorithms on the chemical space projection task, along with the proposed PrexSyn. However it would be helpful to compare against traditional ECFP-based analog retrieval, which are established in the industry for identifying structurally similar compounds to a query molecule out of a large library of compounds. It would be instructive to know, as a baseline, how would traditional analog retrieval perform on these reconstruction tasks relative to PrexSyn? I ask because the reconstruction rates for the baselines considered in the paper are very low on Enamine REAL in contrast to what would be expected from an analog retrieval.\n\nIn Table 2, the results are reported in terms of the average of the percentage of constraints satisfied correctly. In many contexts, violation of even a single constraint can be unsatisfactory. It would be helpful to also report on the percent of compounds that satisfy all constraints (i.e., where even a single constraint violation deems a compound as negative)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "noRQE40dRS", "forum": "SlVkjuq5Ig", "replyto": "SlVkjuq5Ig", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission622/Reviewer_aCNv"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission622/Reviewer_aCNv"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission622/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761955525111, "cdate": 1761955525111, "tmdate": 1762915567489, "mdate": 1762915567489, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
