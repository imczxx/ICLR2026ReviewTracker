(2017) introduced a block-designed dataset\n(\"Perceive\") and methods that claim to achieve extremely high accuracy\ndecoding stimulus image class from EEG recordings. This was amplified\nby follow on papers (Kavasidis et al. 2017, Palazzo et al. 2018,\n2020a, 2020b, 2021), many of which claim to do things like reconstruct\nstimulus images from EEG recordings. Further, Tirupattur (2018) does\nthis with a fresh dataset (Kumar 2018) that has the same block design.\n\nLi et al. (2021) debunked all of the above, demonstrating that the\nPerceive dataset suffers from a block confound. EEG exhibits drift,\nencoding a clock in the signal. Since Perceive was collected with all\nand only stimuli of the same class being temporally adjacent, the\nclassifier can mistakenly classify the clock/drift instead of the\nstimulus-related EEG response. Follow on papers (Ahmed et al. 2021,\n2022, Bharadwaj et al. 2023) added novel independent confirmation of\nthe results of Li et al. (2021).\n\nDespite this, Palazzo et al. (2020b, 2021, 2024) continue to argue\nthat their dataset is valid. At this point, there are over one hundred\npapers that use the Perceive dataset, the Kumar (2018) dataset, or\nother datasets that suffer from the same block confound. Many new\ndatasets have been collected with this same block confound, some of\nwhich are becoming widely used. The vast majority of these were\npublished after the confound became known (Li et al. 2021). Some of\nthese are unaware of the confound. Others are aware, but dismiss it,\noften based on the argument of Palazzo et al. (2020b, 2021, 2024).\n\nThat argument is what this manuscript refutes.\n\nThis confound has been extensively debated on blogs like reddit, yet\nthat too has not stopped the extensive publication of flawed work.\n\nThere are three distinct levels of severity of this issue, which\nprogressively support greater need for continued publication:\n\n 1. Many authors are unaware of the confound, despite the fact that it\n    was published in prominent venues (e.g., TPAMI, CVPR, NeurIPS) and\n    continue to publish flawed work\n\n 2. While many authors are aware of the confound, they nonetheless\n    ignore the warning and continue to publish flawed work.\n\n 3. Some authors dismiss the confound and actively argue for the\n    community to continue to employ flawed methods."}}, "id": "JPova6EiDU", "forum": "1CR1MTIgmq", "replyto": "1CR1MTIgmq", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4804/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4804/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4804/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763748383640, "cdate": 1763748383640, "tmdate": 1763748383640, "mdate": 1763748383640, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "In 2021, the following paper was published in TPAMI: Palazzo et al., \"Decoding Brain Representations by Multimodal Learning of Neural Activity and Visual Features,\" TPAMI, 43(11): 3833–3849 (2021).
