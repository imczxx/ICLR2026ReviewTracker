While numerous evaluation studies have emerged, assessing LVLMs both holistically and on specialized tasks, fine-grained image tasks—fundamental to computer vision—remain largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce a comprehensive fine-grained evaluation benchmark, i.e., FG-BMK, comprising 1.01 million questions and 0.28 million images. Our evaluation systematically examines LVLMs from both human-oriented and machine-oriented perspectives, focusing on their semantic recognition and fine-grained feature representation capabilities. Through extensive experiments on twelve representative LVLMs/VLMs, we uncover key findings regarding the influence of training paradigms, modality alignment, perturbation susceptibility, and fine-grained category reasoning on task performance. This work provides critical insights into the limitations of current LVLMs and offers guidance for future data construction and model design in the development of more advanced LVLMs. Our code is open-source and available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FG-BMK-7B51.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Empirical Study", "Large Vision-Language Model", "Benchmark", "Evaluation"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2edbdf675325fc7bedc4d3263ab325ecd567144a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces FG-BMK, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on fine-grained image tasks, which remain underexplored compared to generic visual reasoning or captioning tasks. FG-BMK comprises 0.28 million images and 1.01 million automatically generated questions sourced from 12 established fine-grained datasets such as CUB, Stanford Cars, and FGVC Aircraft. The benchmark features two complementary paradigms:\n\n1. Human-oriented evaluation: measures LVLMs’ ability to answer fine-grained visual questions in conversational form (attribute recognition, hierarchical granularity reasoning, and knowledge bias estimation).  \n2. Machine-oriented evaluation: measures the discriminability and robustness of visual representations via retrieval and classification tasks.\n\nThe study evaluates 12 representative models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3, LLaVA, DINOv2, etc.) and provides systematic analyses. Main findings include:  \n- Contrastive training (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) yields better fine-grained discriminability than generative or reconstruction paradigms.  \n- Text-image alignment can harm fine-grained distinctions, especially when text granularity mismatches image detail.  \n- LVLMs are more vulnerable to perturbations in fine-grained domains than generic vision tasks.  \n- Scaling model size or data volume brings limited gain compared to data quality and alignment design.  \n- LVLMs perform well on appearance description but lag behind domain-specific fine-grained models."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- Proposes a large, reproducible benchmark that systematically covers multiple aspects of fine-grained vision-language understanding.  \n- Provides clear empirical findings with actionable insights, notably about alignment granularity and contrastive pretraining.  \n- Includes both human-style and feature-based evaluations.\n- Reveals interesting findings for LVLM's behaviour in fine-grained tasks.\n- Gives insights for how to design and train vision representation encoders in the context of improving fine-grained perception of LVLM"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Primarily an evaluation paper; lacks methodological novelty or a new model proposal. I agree that a benchmarking and analysis paper can bring valuable insights to the field. However, since this paper already proposes several small fixes (fine-tuning on balanced fine-grained datasets, improved alignment strategies), could these be integrated into a more systematic approach that contributes to improving MLLMs?\n\n- Another concern is that automatic question generation may limit linguistic diversity and realism compared to human-written prompts. There are only a few chat templates shown in Appendix A.2. Could the use of more natural prompts affect performance?\n\n- Lack of a systematic comparison. Although this paper evaluates many mainstream models, it lacks a clear comparison of their results on FG-BMK (for example, an average of all sub-benchmarks on FG-BMK). A clear comparison would be important for readers to understand the performance and relative ranking of different LVLMs.\n\n- The benchmark is sourced from existing public datasets, which raises concerns that different LVLMs may have been trained on overlapping portions of these datasets. This could make fair performance comparison difficult.

A model may therefore be penalized for a prediction that is in fact consistent with expert knowledge, undermining the statistical reliability of the reported accuracy rankings.
