The SWC algorithm is innovative, using sliced Wasserstein distance to bound dictionary size $(O(1/\\kappa)^p)$ while preserving posterior fidelity—extending batch private BO to dynamic, untrusted settings without historical data storage.\n\n- Theoretical Rigor: Provides non-asymptotic convergence rates (Theorems 4.4–4.5) under decaying stepsizes, achieving SGD-optimal $O(t^{-\\alpha})$ error in strongly convex cases and $O(t^{-(1-\\alpha)})$ gradient norms in smooth non-convex settings. Bounds explicitly capture privacy $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$, compression $\\kappa$, and BO approximation errors, with corollaries for RDP/GDP—stronger than heuristic privacy in prior online BO. Assumptions (e.g., smoothness, RKHS) are standard and justified.\n\n- Practical Efficiency: $O(1)$ per-iteration time/space via SWC avoids $O(t^3)$ kernel inversions in standard BO. Algorithm 1 is clean and implementable; privacy via Gaussian mechanism is flexible (extendable to Laplace).\n\n- Empirical Validation: Thorough experiments across parametric (linear/logistic/ReLU) and nonparametric (Sine/Friedman) synthetic tasks, plus real Uber fares data. LDP-BO outperforms LDP-SGD in MSE/prediction error, especially nonlinearly, with stable convergence under varying $\\epsilon / \\kappa$. Function fitting plots visually confirm better generalization vs. non-private DNN. Reproducibility statement and code promise are excellent.\n\n- Clarity and Structure: Well-written with intuitive flowchart (Fig. 1), detailed appendices (e.g., DP preliminaries, proofs), and ethical/reproducibility statements. Related work comprehensively covers BO, online learning, and private estimation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Assumption Strength: Bounded sensitivity (Ass. 4.1) and RKHS membership (Ass. 4.2) are common but may limit applicability to heavy-tailed or non-stationary streams (e.g., real-world sensor data). Strong convexity (Ass. 4.3) yields optimal rates, but non-convex analysis (Thm. 4.5) only guarantees stationarity—discuss implications for multimodal BO objectives more. Assumption 3.2 (non-expansive compression) is mild but relies on prior consistency (Lemma C.1); empirical verification would help.\n2. Experimental Scope: Baselines are appropriate (LDP-SGD, non-private BO/SGD/DNN), but missing comparisons to other scalable GPs (e.g., inducing points in Balandat et al., 2020) or private online methods (e.g., DP contextual bandits from Ding et al., 2021). Real-data ablation on $\\kappa$ sensitivity or varying $\\delta$ is absent; Uber fares is compelling but single-domain—add multi-domain (e.g., finance, healthcare) for broader impact. No runtime/memory plots to quantify $O(1)$ claims vs baselines.\n3. Privacy-Utility Trade-off: While theory bounds noise (e.g., $O(B^2 \\log(1/\\delta)/(\\lambda \\epsilon^2))$), experiments use fixed/varying $\\epsilon$ but not composition over $t$ (e.g., total $\\epsilon_t$ sum). Discuss practical budget allocation (e.g., decaying $\\epsilon_t$) or advanced mechanisms (e.g., RDP for tighter composition). SWC privacy amplification isn't analyzed—does compression interact with LDP?\n4. Minor Technical/ Presentation Issues: Acquisition function (GI in Eq. 3) optimization isn't detailed (e.g., how to solve argmin GI efficiently online?). Theorem 3.1 claims per-iteration LDP but composes to $\\max{\\epsilon_1,...,\\epsilon_t}$-LDP—clarify if adaptive $\\epsilon_t$ allows better total budget. Appendix E details are good but could include hyper parameter tuning (e.g., $\\eta_t$ choice)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. SWC Mechanism (Sec. 3.2, Alg. 2): The use of sliced Wasserstein for compression is elegant and avoids density estimation pitfalls. However, computing $SW_2(\\rho_{D_{-j}}, \\rho_{\\tilde{D}_t})$ for each $j$ in $I$ seems $O(M_t^2)$ per iteration (with $m=100$ projections)—how does this achieve true $O(1)$ amortized? Suggest approximating via subsampling directions or low-rank updates. Besides, if line 8 is not satisfied in the first iteration of the loop, does that mean it cannot obtain a compressed dictionary $D_t$, and is it necessary to dynamically adjust the size of $\\kappa$? Also, Thm. 3.3 bounds $M_t ≤ O((1/\\kappa)^p)$, but $p=5$ in expts: discuss curse-of-dimensionality for high-$p$ (e.g., $>10$).\n2. Privacy Integration (Sec. 3.1, Thm. 3.1): Clipping to $B$ before Gaussian noise is standard, but sensitivity $| g_t - \\tilde{g}_t | ≤ 2B$ assumes $| \\mu |$ bounded—link to Ass. 4.1 more explicitly. Why Gaussian over Laplace (better for $l_1$-sens)? Corollaries B.1–B.2 are nice extensions; consider empirical comparison of RDP/GDP noise levels. Question: In streaming, how to handle adaptive adversaries querying outputs?\n3. Theoretical Analysis (Sec. 4): Proofs are solid (e.g., leveraging projection non-expansiveness in Lem. C.3), but the BO error term $(L + p\\kappa)$ assumes GI minimization over $p+1$ points (Wu et al., 2023)—is this feasible online? For non-convex (Thm. 4.5), the $O(1/T^{1-\\alpha})$ rate is good, but compare quantitatively to non-private BO rates (e.g., Müller et al., 2021). Minor: $t_0$ definition in Thm. 4.4 could be explicit.\n4. Experiments (Sec. 5): Strong results, but add ablation: (i) MSE vs $\\kappa$ (e.g., $0.05–0.5$) on Uber data; (ii) total privacy budget $(\\Sigma, \\epsilon_t)$ impact; (iii) dictionary size evolution over $t$ to verify bounded $M_t$. Runtime: LDP-BO vs. LDP-SGD on $t=20k$? Fig. 2/5: Why focus on first coeff? Average over all or report full $| \\theta |_2$ error.\n\n5. Broader Impact/Ethics: Privacy in streaming BO enables sensitive apps (e.g., personalized medicine), but discuss failure modes (e.g., utility collapse at $\\epsilon<<1$) or biases in SWC (e.g., projection directions).
