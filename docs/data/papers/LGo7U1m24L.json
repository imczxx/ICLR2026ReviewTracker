A major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we investigate whether *sparse parameter updates* can enable learning without catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks.\nWe find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89\\% after full finetuning on new facts and 71\\% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields only an 11\\% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual learning in large language models.", "tldr": "Finetuning a sparse set of parameters in memory layer models enables learning with significantly less forgetting.", "keywords": ["memory layer", "memory", "catastrophic forgetting", "continual learning"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/19f5e7bb3489523ab2b68573d0f320a368e058fd.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper aims to address the catastrophic forgetting problem faced by LLM in continuous learning. The authors propose a sparse memory finetuning method based on a special LLM architecture with a \"memory layer.\" The core idea is that when fine-tuning with new knowledge, instead of updating all activated parameters, the TF-IDF algorithm is used to identify and update only a small subset (top-t) of memory slots most specific to the current knowledge. This sparse update strategy aims to write new knowledge into dedicated parameters, thereby minimizing interference with the model's original capabilities.\n\nThe authors conducted experiments on fact learning and document question answering tasks, comparing their method with full fine-tuning and LoRA.

The novelty of this paper is relatively limited. The Memory Layer Model itself is not original; it is from existing work. The authors mainly adapt it to the specific task of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, the core contribution of the paper is concentrated in Chapter 4, but the TF-IDF algorithm used therein is also a mature technique. Overall, this work seems more like a combined application of existing methods, lacking significant original breakthroughs.\n\n2. The paper mentions experiments on a 1.3B-scale model, but does not specify which type of model architecture was used. More importantly, all experiments were conducted on a relatively small-scale model, making it difficult to fully verify the scalability and generalization ability of the proposed method on larger models. In addition, the memory layer model requires replacing the FFN in the original model with a memory layer structure, which may bring additional optimization challenges in large-scale models—the authors do not discuss whether the performance of downstream tasks can still be maintained on larger models.\n\n3. The experiments were only conducted on two general QA datasets, resulting in a relatively limited evaluation scenario. To fully validate the method's generality, the authors should supplement it with more domain-specific fine-tuning experiments (such as in medical and legal fields) and adopt more diverse evaluation benchmarks to more comprehensively measure the method's effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.\n\n4. The paper only reports the absolute performance of the proposed method but does not provide a systematic comparison with current mainstream catastrophic forgetting mitigation methods.

The flip side is the reduced learning capacity. While some of this is tested in the paper (Fig 4), the experiments don't seem comprehensive enough to show that the learning capacity of the memory layer is as good as LoRA or Full FT only base on the TriviaQA learning result. One experiment to test is multi-stage fine-tuning and see if sparse update actually has less forgetting throughout.\n\n**Analyses that i think would strengthen the argument of the paper**\n- Along the line of memory layer capacity, it would be great to see the a sweep top $k$ indices in the memory layer is fine-tuned. \n- The background corpus analyses in the paper are valuable, but I would love to see a different corpus tested beyond DCLM. Especially, if one wants to preserve the capability of a particular domain, does choosing a corresponding background corpus help this?\n- \"We note that ranking based on batches makes no assumption about task boundaries; consecutive batches can be from the same or totally different data distributions.\" It would be really nice to see this tested, which can be done with the aforementioned sequential training setting.\n\n**Minor**\n- L40: a citation is missing\n\n\nWhile I appreciate the idea, my general sense is that the experiments and analyses are a bit limited or might be over-indexing on the specific datasets.
