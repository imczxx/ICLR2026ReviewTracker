This often results in vast graph models that can be computationally intractable. Current approaches tend to either break the sequences into fixed-length segments or trim edges to stay within budget constraints, often at the cost of fidelity.  \n\nWe introduce EAMC–C2SG, a novel framework that dynamically compresses temporal streams into segments tailored to events and creates a sparse graph model that respects temporal ordering. By curbing the proliferation of nodes and edges, our design achieves strict budget control while reducing complexity from a quadratic to a near-linear scale with respect to sequence length.  \n\nOur framework preserves valuable information in multimodal temporal data and, when tested on extensive clinical datasets (MIMIC-IV + CXR) and diverse cross-domain benchmarks (TimeMMD), achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy with markedly lower latency and memory usage. Beyond raw performance, EAMC–C2SG also offers interpretable segmentations and insightful graph diagnostics, making it a scalable and transparent solution for multimodal temporal learning.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Multimodal Learning", "Temporal Graphs", "Graph Neural Network", "Representation Learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/111590ba4ab129e77abbf1481c99f4704125973b.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/75af755cf381a042c2f58c1d9509661cedcbedde.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces EAMC-C2SG, a framework for scalable multimodal temporal graph learning that addresses the \"node explosion\" problem by dynamically compressing time-series data into event-adaptive segments and enforcing strict node and edge budgets.

Limited Analysis of Multimodal Fusion and Cross-Modal Leakage: While the paper strongly emphasizes and validates temporal causality with its C2SG module, the handling of cross-modal causality is less rigorous. The method allows edges between temporal nodes and auxiliary image/text nodes based on cosine similarity, without any explicit causal constraints (e.g., ensuring an image is only connected to past temporal events). In a clinical setting, a chest X-ray taken at time t should not inform the model's understanding of a physiological state at time t-1. The paper does not discuss this potential for cross-modal temporal leakage or provide an ablation studying the effect of applying causal masks to cross-modal edges. This is a significant oversight for a method claiming \"leakage-free message passing.\"\n\n2. Sensitivity and Justification of Key Heuristics: The event-adaptive segmentation relies on a predefined threshold (θ) for boundary detection and a fixed lag window (ε) for the causal graph. The paper does not present a sensitivity analysis for these critical hyperparameters. How does performance degrade if θ is set too high or low? Is the optimal ε consistent across the clinical (MIMIC) and diverse (TimeMMD) domains, or is it highly dataset-dependent? The choice of these parameters feels somewhat arbitrary, and their impact on the final model's fidelity and efficiency should be quantified. A robustness analysis or a discussion on how to set these in a domain-agnostic way would significantly strengthen the method."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "qx129SfX8Z", "forum": "X4w1dJ2FUo", "replyto": "X4w1dJ2FUo", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3247/Reviewer_ZCb9"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3247/Reviewer_ZCb9"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3247/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761745996924, "cdate": 1761745996924, "tmdate": 1762916625801, "mdate": 1762916625801, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a framework that dynamically compresses temporal streams into segments tailored to events and creates a sparse graph model that respects temporal ordering.

Key symbols are never defined. For example, in the EAMC module, the merging weights γis\\gamma_{is}γis​ depend on csc_scs​ and cic_ici​, but these aren’t defined anywhere (not in the text or Table 4). This makes it unnecessarily difficult to follow the math.\n\nW2. The paper refers to several loss terms (task loss, contrastive loss, missingness loss) but doesn’t provide their explicit forms. It also introduces two different “total loss” equations — one in Section 3.4 and another in the appendix — which don’t match. The second version adds extra penalty terms that aren’t explained in the main text. It’s unclear which version was actually used during training.\n\nW3. Some hyperparameters and design choices are missing. For instance, the “short moving average” used for smoothing isn’t specified (no window size), and key parameters like the causal lag window or the per-node edge budget are never mentioned. Table 5 lists only the standard ones. A short discussion or sensitivity analysis would help a lot.\n\nW4. The section titled “Mathematical Proofs and Derivations” is misleading—it doesn’t contain any proofs, just restates previous equations.\n\nW5. The experiments are limited to two datasets (MIMIC-IV + CXR and TimeMMD) and a small set of baselines. Given the lack of theoretical justification, a broader empirical validation would strengthen the paper. Also, the claim that the code will be released is fine, but at review time there’s no code or sufficient hyperparameter info to reproduce the results.\n\nOverall, while the idea is solid and timely, the paper feels incomplete.
