The central thesis is the application of ergodic theory to the generative diffusion process. Specifically, the authors propose a formal connection between the convergence rate of the forward diffusion process and the principal eigenvalue ($\\lambda_1$) of its corresponding L-generator. The framework's core mechanism involves modulating this principal eigenvalue by adjusting the coefficients $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ of the L-generator. The authors provide a theoretical argument (Theorem 2) and empirical results (on CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ-64) to support their main claim: a larger principal eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ leads to an exponentially faster convergence to the stationary distribution. This, in turn, allows the model to reach convergence in fewer forward steps, significantly reducing the computational overhead for both training and sampling.

However, diffusion models for image generation operate in extremely high-dimensional spaces. The paper makes no serious attempt to bridge this enormous theoretical gap. Spectral gap analysis in high dimensions is notoriously more complex than in 1D and often requires additional structural assumptions. The authors do not discuss how, or even if, their 1D-derived insights generalize to high-dimensional, non-reversible, or anisotropic processes common in diffusion modeling.\n- The proofs for the main theorems, such as Theorem 2, are relegated to the appendix and are overly brief. They lack the rigor and detail necessary for a reader to verify the claims or, more importantly, to understand the precise preconditions and scope under which these convergence bounds hold. This ambiguity undermines the paper's theoretical foundation.\n- The paper claims to provide an \"explainable\" framework. However, \"Guiding Principle II\" (which states that higher polynomial orders for $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ lead to a larger $\\lambda_1$) is presented as a purely empirical observation from numerical experiments. This is a heuristic, not an explanation. The paper fails to provide any theoretical justification for why this relationship holds, which runs counter to its own stated objective of improving interpretability.\n\nCollectively, these issues suggest that the theoretical contribution of the paper is largely limited to restating classical diffusion results in a simplified 1D setting, without sufficient rigor or justification to claim novel theoretical insight."}, "questions": {"value": "The proposed method introduces an extra, non-trivial computational step: the iterative numerical estimation of $\\lambda_1$.

The theory lives in 1D but the experiments are in high dimensions\n\nThis is the paper's fundamental problem. All theoretical guarantees (Theorems 1-2, convergence rates, eigenvalue analysis) assume one-dimensional processes where components evolve independently. But image generation requires modeling high-dimensional joint distributions with complex spatial dependencies.\n\nThe paper claims \"without loss of generality\" we can focus on 1D (line 59), but this is incorrect. For a 256-dimensional vector (e.g., 16×16 grayscale image), the spectral gap of 256 independent 1D processes tells you nothing about the mixing time of the joint distribution. The covariance structure, spatial correlations, and coupling between dimensions fundamentally change the convergence behavior.\n\nThere's no analysis of how the 1D eigenvalue relates to the high-dimensional process actually being run. This makes the entire theoretical framework disconnected from the experimental validation.\n\n### 2. The practical recipe doesn't follow from the theory\n\nSection 3.3's \"guiding principles\" for choosing L-generators feel ad-hoc:\n- Principle I just says \"satisfy the ergodicity conditions\" (obvious)\n- Principle II says \"higher degree polynomials give bigger eigenvalues\" (empirical observation, not a principle)\n\nThe paper never explains *why* polynomial forms are the right parameterization, or how to choose between the infinitely many (a,b) pairs that satisfy the convergence conditions. Table 4 shows that nonlinear generators behave unpredictably. Even with similar eigenvalues, you get wildly different Ddisc values (Appendix C.3, Table 7).\n\nThe guidance provided amounts to \"try different polynomials and see what happens,\" which undermines the claim of interpretability and principled control.\n\n### 3. Computational cost story is incomplete\n\nThe paper emphasizes training acceleration but glosses over the eigenvalue estimation overhead. In Appendix C.2, the authors mention \"about two hours\" for computing eigenvalues, but:\n- This is for 1D. What about estimating properties of the high-dimensional process?\n- How does this scale with dataset complexity or resolution?\n- What's the total wall-clock time (estimation + training + sampling) compared to just training a baseline DDPM longer?\n\nTable 1 shows training drops from 52h to 26h, but if I need 2+ hours of eigenvalue computation for every new (a,b) configuration I try, plus the overhead of determining the \"optimal\" range, the net savings become unclear. There's no end-to-end timing comparison.\n\n### 4. Experiments are too limited\n\n**Baselines:** The paper primarily compares against vanilla DDPM from 2020. For a paper submitted in 2025, missing comparisons include:\n- DDIM (deterministic sampling, 2021)\n- EDM, EDM2 (2022,2024)\n- Modern flow matching methods (2023-2025)\n\n**Datasets:** Only 32×32 CIFAR-10 and 64×64 CelebA. No experiments at 256×256 or higher resolutions where diffusion models are most impactful. No text-to-image, video, or other modalities.\n\n### 5. Changing (a,b) changes the target distribution\n\nThis is subtle but important. When you modify a(x) and b(x), you don't just change the convergence speed—you change the stationary distribution π (Theorem 1). So comparing FID scores across different eigenvalue configurations isn't purely measuring the speed/quality tradeoff; you're potentially converging to different distributions.\n\nThe paper doesn't discuss this. Are the quality changes due to insufficient sampling steps, or because you've fundamentally altered what you're sampling from?\n\n\n## Minor Issues\n\n- **Writing quality:** Several grammatical errors (\"egodic theory\" in abstract, \"beolw Theorem 1\" line 168). Notation switches between $X_t$ and $Y_t$ confusingly.\n\n- **$D_{disc}$ metric:** The convergence discrepancy metric behaves irregularly for nonlinear cases (Table 7) and seems unreliable as a stopping criterion. Its relationship to actual generation quality is unclear.\n\n- **Figure 5:** Referenced as justification for polynomial choices but relegated to the appendix. The 3D surface plot is hard to interpret and doesn't provide clear design guidance.\n\n- **Table 5:** Shows that very different (a,b) with similar eigenvalues give similar results. This contradicts the claim that eigenvalue is the dominant factor. if other properties of (a,b) matter equally, what's the advantage of the eigenvalue-centric view?"}, "questions": {"value": "1. Can you provide a rigorous treatment of how 1D eigenvalues relate to high-dimensional convergence, or alternatively, show how to compute/estimate the spectral gap of the actual high-dimensional process?\n\n2.

How do you explain Table 5, where eigenvalue seems less important than other properties of the generator?\n\n4.
