Prior work often unnaturally disentangles these elements, overlooking their essential interdependence. We introduce Dynamic Frame Synthesis (DFS), a novel approach that preserves this critical coupling. DFS begins with a minimal set of key frames and dynamically synthesizes new ones by identifying moments of high motion complexity, where simple interpolation fails, through gradient misalignments. This adaptive process allocates new frames only where such complexity exists, creating highly efficient and temporally coherent synthetic datasets. Extensive experiments show DFS outperforms prior methods on standard action recognition benchmarks, creating powerful representations with significantly less storage.", "tldr": "Video Dataset Condensation", "keywords": ["Video Dataset Condensation"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3bfa80a8c11f55a9550d4d5cbdc0dc2900dddca4.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/99ed84ec016ad3e3c680674932793dea25380710.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper deals with the topic of video condensation and specifically the interdependence of content and motion.

Following last question, previous work [1][2] show that  HMDB and UCF are biased dataset on objects and backgrounds (i.e., semantics), while SSv2 is more motion heavy dataset. I wonder if DFS truly capture the motions in videos? The update rule seems to assume smooth transition between frames, yet frames with more motion might not be included as key frame? A quantitative analysis of whether synthesized videos really capture motions would be helpful to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
