In this paper, we leverage ideas from generative modeling of image data to push the boundary of time series generation. \nFor this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes, inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of the time series of interest. \nSpecifically, we can handle discontinuities of the underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled\nGaussians that allow for\nclosed form formulas and hence rapid evaluation of the corresponding\nKullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. \nUnlike most other approaches, we are able to handle irregularly sampled time series. We underline our theoretical results by numerical experiments involving combinations of jumps and SDE dynamics.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["generative modelling", "irregular time series", "jump processes", "stochastic differential equations"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2bd289325b3932fd61ed768236a974981432334c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d72ca2b1ccdf2790029ff98d9b71988920b4bf55.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "A paper proposing a diffusion model for irregularly sampled time series.

It is somewhat difficult to assess exactly what was already done in the very recent papers by Holderrieth and Zheng, and what was innovation in this paper.\n- Sometimes there is some sloppiness in the use of the word \"process\", for example Alg. 1 is a procedure to sample trajectories (approximately), which in most literature is distinct from the process (infinite dimensional object).\n- The memory aspect is another place where greater clarity would be needed, it's even unclear what it's meant (my impression was that the statistics of the project were obtained by some moving average over the trajectory but  as the topic is important its relegation to a short paragraph was definitely too little) \n- The empirical section was very schematic, which might be fine for a strongly theoretical paper but perhaps something that would showcase better the advantages of including jumps would have helped, as the performance is often close to the diffusion method."}, "questions": {"value": "- It seems to me that the trajectories might be irregularly sampled, but all trajectories must be sampled at the same times, is that so?\n- Could you clarify a bit more how memory is introduced?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "QIFeOCLHxy", "forum": "CZydMj0vBc", "replyto": "CZydMj0vBc", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11082/Reviewer_7wcJ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11082/Reviewer_7wcJ"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11082/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760972282174, "cdate": 1760972282174, "tmdate": 1762922263999, "mdate": 1762922263999, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors apply a generator learning technique to the task of irregular time series generation.

Related to the previous points, it will be more convincing that the work is empirically solid by repeating some numerical experiment in TFM.
