In many applications, such as large-scale gene perturbation experiments, only stationary “snapshot” measurements are available, making standard stochastic differential equation estimation methods that rely on time-series trajectories inapplicable.\nWe first establish an identifiability result: one intervention per strongly connected component (SCC) of the drift graph suffices to recover all OU process parameters generically up to a global scaling factor. This holds provided that the SCC condensation graph is connected with a single root and certain spectral nondegeneracy assumptions hold. We propose a recursive learning algorithm that orders SCCs topologically and, for each component, isolates its marginal dynamics and solves a linear system derived from the steady-state moment equations, leveraging parameters recovered for upstream components.\nBuilding on this theoretical foundation, we propose a regularized least-squares estimator that jointly minimizes residuals of the steady-state mean and covariance equations across observational and interventional data. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in recovering parameters and predicting unseen interventions.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Causal Inference", "Stochastic Differential Equation", "Interventions", "Causal Discovery", "Ornstein–Uhlenbeck Process", "Identifiability"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2be7f20506277880e26d42c9b08ed935d481cb14.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper analyzes identifiability of linear stochastic dynamics (Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes) from steady-state observational and interventional data.\nIt proves that one intervention per strongly connected component (SCC) suffices to identify the system up to a global scale under a “row-zeroing” intervention model and diagonal diffusion.\nA regularized least-squares estimator is proposed, with synthetic and Perturb-seq experiments illustrating the approach."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "•\tClear theoretical framing and well-presented identifiability proofs.\n\t•\tThe “one intervention per SCC” condition is simple and interpretable.\n\t•\tEmpirical evaluation includes both synthetic and real (Perturb-seq) datasets."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "•\tThe intervention model (zeroing off-diagonals of one row while keeping the diagonal) is restrictive (independent dynamics) and not biologically realistic.\n\t•\tThe estimator is a straightforward least-squares fit; no methodological innovation beyond the theoretical analysis.\n\t•\tNo comparison to existing system-identification or Optimal Experimental Design (OED) approaches\n\t•\tFocused entirely on linear OU dynamics, limiting relevance to broader ML audiences.\n\t•\tOverall contribution is more aligned with causal inference and system identification than with core machine-learning or representation-learning research, not as relevant to the ICLR community."}, "questions": {"value": "1.\tHow sensitive is the identifiability result to imperfect or partial interventions?\n\t2.\tHow can extensions be handled for non-diagonal diffusion or nonlinear dynamics?\n\t3.\tHave you compared against classical gradient-based or Bayesian OED estimators using the same steady-state moments?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "0Kd6083FWP", "forum": "vjI9tsebtP", "replyto": "vjI9tsebtP", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7947/Reviewer_MWjF"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7947/Reviewer_MWjF"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7947/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760713202148, "cdate": 1760713202148, "tmdate": 1762919966936, "mdate": 1762919966936, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies identifiability of linear multivariate OU dynamics from steady-state observational + interventional snapshots.

The drift matrix \\Lambda is the key parameter of the OU process that differentiates observational and interventional data.

Interventional data of $i$th RV is obtained from a modified OU process driven by $\\tilde \\Lambda^{(i)}$, which isolates $i$ from its regulators ($j\\neq i$).

The proposed regularized least-squares estimator jointly fits the steady-state mean and covariance equations under observational and interventional data, incorporating sparsity priors on the drift matrix. This bridges the gap between abstract identifiability proofs and practical parameter recovery.

The authors reference a number of relevant works. However, both experiments compare only against a single baseline, which is “similar” to prior work. Hence, it is difficult to evaluate the relative performance. In my opinion, it would be helpful to compare against traditional and non-interventional estimators.\n- Lack of empirical support. The main claim is that we only need a single intervention per SCC. However, in the experiment on the synthetic dataset, the authors only analyze whether the drift graph meets conditions from Thm. 3. What about generating a graph with $N$ SCCs and showing that, on average, $N$ interventions (one per SCC) are needed for a good estimate? For the number of SCCs smaller than $N$, the error is expected to increase, while for larger numbers, it would marginally decrease. One could also add directed two-cycles to confirm that the gain w.r.t. the work of Dettling’23 is even more significant in this case.\n- Minor clarity comments.
