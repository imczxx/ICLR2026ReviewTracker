Therefore, a lightweight alternative, generating complex 3D scenes from a single top-down image, plays an essential role in real-world applications. While recent 3D generative models have achieved remarkable results at the object level, their extension to full-scene generation often leads to inconsistent geometry, layout hallucinations, and low-quality meshes.\nIn this work, we introduce SceneFuse-3D, a training-free framework designed to synthesize coherent 3D scenes from a single top-down view. Our method is grounded in two principles: region-based generation to improve image-to-3D alignment and resolution, and spatial-aware 3D inpainting to ensure global scene coherence and high-quality geometry generation. Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions and generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked rectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while maintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome resolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D supervision or fine-tuning.\nExtensive experiments across diverse scenes show that SceneFuse-3D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including Trellis, Hunyuan3D-2, TripoSG, and LGM, in terms of geometry quality, spatial coherence, and texture fidelity. Our results demonstrate that high-quality unstructured 3D scene-level asset generation is achievable from a single top-down image using a principled, training-free pipeline.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Image-to-3D Generation", "3D Scene Generation"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/240179a81531deb5d9aa80f6e7eff7a389dc081c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/d4c757c098e00189689a600c000a6d28c53a7371.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper tackles the problem of scene-level 3D generation from (bird-eye-view) images.

This also helps the reader clarify which part of the algorithm is novel in this paper.\n2. As far as I read, the main problem at hand is to gain consistency while allowing partial generations, and the immediate desired consequence is infilling of holes within the final generated output. We may either quantitatively (maybe by calculating the size/number of holes created around the reference shot) or qualitatively (if the quantitative analysis is hard; by visually highlighting the holes created by the different types of methods within the same camera view) compare this geometric quality.\n3. By changing the size of region being generation, the generation time may vary. It would be better reporting this generating time of different methods, as well as for the ablation studies.\n4.
