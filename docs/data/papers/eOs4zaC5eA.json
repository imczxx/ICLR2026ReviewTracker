In this paper, we propose a causal representation learning framework to uncover a hierarchy of LLM capabilities purely from publicly available observational data. Drawing insights from recent factor analysis \\citep{ruan2024observational}, we model the observed benchmark performance as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors. Crucially, we model these latent factors as causally interrelated after appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed performance variations. The hierarchy that we discover --- from general problem-solving to instruction-following, and finally to mathematical reasoning --- is more than an interpretation; it provides a causal roadmap for post-training. We demonstrate through targeted fine-tuning experiments that interventions on parent capabilities propagate to child capabilities as predicted by our model, offering validated, actionable guidance for practitioners.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["LLM evaluation", "causal representation learning", "observational studies"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/57462cddd6e37638784feaf88c5b63f1cb42201a.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce an $\\alpha$-inexact structural causal model (SCM) for LLM benchmark scores.
