We trace this sim-to-real gap to three sources: object assets, physical realism and visual fidelity. We emphasize accuracy along all three axes—precise meshes and collisions, calibrated friction and hinge resistance, and visually realistic observations—and present Real-IKEA, a dataset and simulation framework designed with accuracy as a first-class goal. At scale, Real-IKEA provides 1,079 articulated asset configurations, created by combining real IKEA furniture bases with a curated library of 83 authentic IKEA handles and knobs. For contact-geometry accuracy, we introduce a bidirectional surface-deviation metric ($E_{Q\\to P}$, $E_{P\\to Q}$) that quantifies collision meshes against the visual mesh. For dynamics accuracy, we establish resistance-calibrated benchmarks that vary damping and friction. To narrow the vision gap, we pair real-time teleoperation with offline high-fidelity re-rendering and quantify alignment via FID/EMD across multiple encoders. Extensive comparisons show that Real-IKEA yields more realistic asset structure, more accurate physical interactions, and visuals more closely aligned with real data, enabling policies to exploit geometry and torque rather than rely on friction-only pulling. This accuracy-centric design, coupled with large scale, enables the scalable collection of reliable manipulation data and more robust sim-to-real transfer.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Contact-rich Robotic Manipulation", "Articulated Object", "Simulation Fidelity", "Sim-to-Real Gap"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/945dca769f8513b25e2f599a6dc19cc5e1f708ee.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/dfb4d6807e33acc32ae3dc84e4596ba338ffd10d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces Real-IKEA, a benchmark and simulation platform for robot manipulation.
