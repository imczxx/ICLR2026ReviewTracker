Our method yields an interpretable anomaly score directly interpretable as a false alarm rate (p-value), facilitating transparent and actionable decision-making. It employs weighted quantile conformal prediction bounds and adaptively learns optimal weighting parameters from past predictions, enabling calibration under distribution shifts and stable false alarm control, while preserving out-of-sample guarantees. As a model-agnostic solution, it integrates seamlessly with foundation models and supports rapid deployment in resource-constrained environments. This approach addresses key industrial challenges such as limited data availability, lack of training expertise, and the need for immediate inference, while taking advantage of the growing accessibility of time series foundation models. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed approach delivers strong performance, combining simplicity, interpretability, robustness, and adaptivity.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["time series anomaly detection; conformal prediction; anomaly detection; monitoring sequential signals"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/410c3f5f2d47d9ec9f535ecb7de3881c8ef3cfb6.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/97f05a88ec597533192f5fa92394253c30c246ee.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a post-hoc, model-agnostic adaptive conformal anomaly detection framework that leverages pre-trained Time Series Foundation Models without additional fine-tuning.
