This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such optimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We show that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be viewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with specific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, we propose two design recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving the careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and efficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general structures through a novel low-rank extension framework. We demonstrate how to use each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and Column Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation (Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the effectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing memory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead.

This work leverages an insightful lens of Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) preconditioning (Natural Gradient Descent view) to study successful optimizers such as Adam, Shampoo, Muon, and Soap, and unifies them all under this lens by studying the specific structure of FIM approximation (different variants of Kronecker product and block diagonal structure) that each of these optimizers is made of. Interestingly, the update rule of the one-sided Soap algorithm is also derived and analyzed by leveraging block-diagonal structure, and together the one-sided Soap update rule plus the derived structure is referred to as Generalized Adam (GAdam).\n\nInspired by FIM unification, this work hence argues that exploration of novel structures for FIM approximations is the key design principle for systematically developing new optimizers to further balance the optimizers' performance metrics, especially memory vs sample efficiency. Building on this design principle, the paper proposes two novel optimization algorithms. The first proposed algorithm is called RACS, where the preconditioner is structured as a Kronecker product of two diagonal matrices, and by minimizing the FIM approximation error (measured in Frobenius norm), the two diagonal matrices are derived subsequently. This optimizer hence reduces the second moment memory significantly and matches the memory complexity of AdaFactor (for instance, Adam's second moment needs O(mn) while RACS needs O(m+n)).\n\nMoreover, this work also proposes another novel low-rank optimizer called ALICE, achieving GaLore-like memory while significantly improving both sample efficiency and throughput. ALICE extends the GAdam algorithm (one-sided Soap update rule) to low-rank subspace optimizer settings by maintaining only the top r eigenvectors of the full-rank projection in GAdam, and then the projected gradients are accumulated in the subspace akin to GaLore. Subspace switching and compensation methods are also proposed to account for the residual update term that remains orthogonal to the projection matrix and is wiped out during projection.\n\nThe two proposed algorithms are validated on LLaMA pre-training and GLUE benchmarks compared to AdamW, GaLore, Fira, Apollo, and Muon. The reported results indicate that these memory-efficient optimizers (ALICE and RACS) not only match the final validation perplexity of the best baseline but both improve the wall-clock time by a factor of 2 compared to Adam."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper is well-presented and clear. The proposed algorithms are derived based on rigorous theoretical principles, and experiments are comprehensive and profile all key performance metrics (throughput, memory, and perplexity) across the LLaMA model family (from 60M to 1.3B). Comprehensive ablations verify the effectiveness of the key algorithmic components introduced for the two proposed optimizers.\n\n2. This paper makes it clear that the most adopted and successful optimizers in deep learning indeed are different choices of FIM approximation. Principled design of optimizers based on exploring the space of FIM approximation structures is a very clever and strong idea. Finding principles for one-sided Soap based on this framework is an interesting contribution.\n\n3. Both proposed optimizers, ALICE and RACS, achieve consistent speedup by a factor of 2 (measured in wall-clock time) and significant memory savings compared to AdamW. These gains represent very strong results, and upon reproduction of these results, the ALICE and RACS algorithms have the potential to be adopted as mainstream optimizers for LLM training based on reported results. Especially considering the benchmark of current state-of-the-art optimizers in similar pre-training settings [1], the speedup of the best SOTA optimizer compared to Adam is around 1.1-1.4, and Muon is among the best-performing optimizers. Interestingly, the paper reports both ALICE and RACS outperform Muon significantly while using less memory."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "### Critiques on the FIM Framework (Section 3)\n\nApplying the Shampoo preconditioner directly on gradients can recover spectral normalization (whitening) as well, and hence whitening can be understood without leveraging Proposition 3.3. Moreover, [3] already finds the optimal solution to Equation 2 (line 147), where the optimal R and L are computed as principal singular vectors of reshaped F. Then [3] leverages power iteration for approximating the optimal solution of Equation 2, and hence minimizing the proposed upper bound in Theorem 3.2 does not provide significant additional insight when compared to established results in [3]. For Theorem 3.4, if we assume all D_i are equal, then the structure would be equal to the whitening structure that is used to derive Equation 3, and hence the derivation of Equation 6 appears redundant. Moreover, since GAdam appears to be equivalent to one-sided Soap, and this algorithm is actually discussed in the original Soap paper, the justification for not referring to GAdam as one-sided Soap is unclear. While the derived principle has novelty, the update rule remains the same.\n\n### Novelty of RACS Compared to AdaFactor\n\nIf we let the initial S and Q be identity matrices with proper scaling, then one iteration of the fixed point procedure in Equation 11 would indeed recover the AdaFactor update. Moreover, when applying the structure in Equation 10 to gradients as in Equation 1, we can write:\n$\\text{Vec}(\\Delta W) = -\\lambda (S \\otimes Q)^{-1/2} \\text{Vec}(G)$. Since both S and Q are diagonal, $S \\otimes Q$ would be diagonal as well, and hence we can write $\\Delta W = -\\lambda \\frac{G}{\\sqrt{V}}$, where $V = qs^\\top$. Since Proposition 4.1 shows that q and s converge to the left and right singular vectors of $G^2$ up to scaling factors, this shows that V would be a rank-one SVD approximation of $G^2$, and the iterative fixed point procedure of RACS is essentially a power iteration that approximates those principal vectors. Moreover, the original AdaFactor (Algorithm 4 in [4]) similarly maintains momentum on q and s. Hence, RACS appears to be very similar to AdaFactor. RACS performs 5 iterations of Equation 11, while AdaFactor performs one iteration. Therefore, the novelty of the RACS update rule could be considered limited, as RACS appears to be another rank-one approximation method of the second moment, which AdaFactor has already explored and studied in detail.\n\n### Reproducibility\n\nThe code has not been made available, and considering the significant speedup reported in this work and the potential for improving upon the best existing optimizers in the field, making the source code and implementation public would greatly benefit the research community and enable better evaluation of this paper. Even sharing the source code for the 130M setup would be highly valuable."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could the authors please address my critique regarding RACS, and particularly explain the key algorithmic differences between RACS and AdaFactor beyond performing more steps of power iterations? This is indeed a very important concern to address, as AdaFactor does not achieve anywhere close to the RACS speedup compared to AdamW, and having more power iterations as the only key algorithmic component does not seem sufficient to explain these gains.\n\n2. Could the authors please provide a detailed comparison of the compensation step in ALICE to LDAdam? Line 467 mentions Fira as the closest work for compensation, but LDAdam has also made significant contributions regarding this compensation mechanism, which merits discussion and comparison.\n\n3. Proposition 4.1 in this work appears to be a diagonal version of Proposition 1 (Section 3.1 in [3]). It would be interesting to see what additional challenges the proof of Proposition 4.1 introduces compared to Proposition 1 in [3], and how these relate to power iteration convergence.\n\n\n\n[1] Wen, Kaiyue, et al. \"Fantastic pretraining optimizers and where to find them.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2509.02046 (2025).\n\n[2] Robert, Thomas, et al. \"Ldadam: Adaptive optimization from low-dimensional gradient statistics.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.16103 (2024).\n\n[3] Morwani, Depen, et al. \"A New Perspective on Shampoo's Preconditioner.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.17748 (2024).\n\n[4] Shazeer, Noam, and Mitchell Stern. \"Adafactor: Adaptive learning rates with sublinear memory cost.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
