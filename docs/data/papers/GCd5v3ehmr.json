While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn, multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that incentivizes **M**ulti-**A**gent **R**easoning of LLMs through **S**elf-play in both cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to $28.7$\\% performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of $10.0$\\% on AIME and $12.5$\\% on GPQA-Diamond.

The experimental results, particularly the transfer of these skills to downstream multi-agent systems like AutoGen and MAD 1, are quite strong and genuinely interesting.\n\nHowever, I have some *very significant* concerns about the paper's framing, its engagement with closely related prior work, and the experimental design, all of which muddy the central claims of methodological novelty."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "This is a solid piece of work, and I want to start by highlighting what I think is really excellent here.\n\n1. **Originality & Significance (The Core Idea):** The most significant contribution here, in my view, is the demonstration of *skill transfer from a simple game curriculum to complex, downstream multi-agent systems*. This is a really big deal. Prior work like SPAG or SPIRAL showed self-play can boost *single-agent* reasoning benchmarks, but this paper is the first I've seen to convincingly argue that these skills transfer to *cooperative and competitive software systems* like AutoGen and MAD. The 10.0% gain on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond are non-trivial and suggest this is a very promising research direction.\n2. **Quality (Experimental Rigor):** The experimental setup is high-quality and, in one specific area, exceptionally well-designed.\n   - The evaluation is comprehensive: held-out games (Table 1) , single-agent benchmarks (Table 2) , and downstream MAS (Table 2).\n   - **Skill-System Mapping:** This is, frankly, the strongest part of the paper. The analysis showing that the agent trained on adversarial games (Tic-Tac-Toe) excels in the *competitive* MAD framework, while the agent trained on the *cooperative* game (Hanabi) excels in the *collaborative* AutoGen framework, is fantastic. This provides powerful evidence for the central thesis that MARS is teaching distinct, transferable skills, not just generically \"making the model smarter.\"\n   - **Ablations (at first glance):** The ablation studies in Table 4 (showing self-play beats a fixed opponent) and Table 5  (showing the method components are necessary) seem to validate the design choices. (I have major questions about these, see Weaknesses, but they are presented as being thorough).\n3. **Clarity:** The paper is very well-written and easy to follow. The central ideas are communicated effectively.\n   - **Figure 2** does an excellent job of visually explaining the flaw in the naive GRPO and how the proposed \"sum-then-normalize\" method is different.\n   - **Table 3** is a superb piece of qualitative evidence. Showing the \"Intent Recognition\" thought-trace from Hanabi (\"Maybe they want me to play this card?\") mapping to AutoGen (\"Maybe the assistant is not sure?\") makes the quantitative results in Table 2 so much more believable.\n4. **Significance (Broader Impact):** If these results hold, this work provides a scalable, data-efficient paradigm for \"social alignment.\" The idea of autonomously training agents in a \"social sandbox\" to develop complex, generalizable skills like \"theory of mind\" is highly significant for both the MARL and LLM-agent communities."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "Despite the strong results, I have major problems with the paper's claims to *methodological* novelty. The authors have either missed or ignored extremely relevant, contemporaneous work, and the experimental design fails to decouple the most important variables.\n\n1. **Major Novelty Issue: \"Agent-Specific Normalization\" vs. SPIRAL's RAE.**\n   - **The Problem:** The authors claim \"agent-specific advantage normalization\" is a *novel technique* to solve the problem of \"heterogeneous roles\" in multi-agent training.\n   - **The Criticism:** The paper's *own primary baseline*, **SPIRAL (Liu et al., 2025)** , explicitly identifies and solves *the exact same problem*. SPIRAL calls its solution **\"Role-conditioned Advantage Estimation (RAE)\"**. Based on its description, RAE *also* computes separate advantages, $A_0(s, a)$ and $A_1(s, a)$, for each role\".\n   - **The Evidence:** From all available information, MARS's \"agent-specific normalization\" and SPIRAL's \"RAE\" appear to be functionally identical. Yet, the authors *never once mention RAE* in the entire paper, even when citing SPIRAL. The ablation study (\"w/o agent-specific\" in Table 5) only proves that *some* kind of role-based normalization is needed, it does *not* prove that the MARS version is new or superior to RAE. This is a major, major oversight and frankly misrepresents the methodological contribution.\n2. **Confounding Variables: The Method vs. The Curriculum.**\n   - **The Problem:** The authors present MARS as a complete package (Method A + Curriculum X) and show it beats SPIRAL (Method B + Curriculum Y).\n   - **The Criticism:** This is a classic confounding variable problem. The MARS \"package\" differs from SPIRAL in *two* key ways: (1) the advantage estimation algorithm and (2) the training curriculum (MARS adds cooperative games like Hanabi 1, while SPIRAL is purely zero-sum).\n   - **The Evidence:** The paper provides *no evidence* to decouple these factors. How do we know the impressive gains on AutoGen, AIME, and GPQA aren't *entirely* due to the superior *curriculum* (i.e., adding Hanabi was the only thing that mattered) and have *nothing* to do with the paper's proposed \"sum-then-normalize\" or \"agent-specific\" algorithms? The paper is just completely silent on this.\n   - **What's Missing:** The critical missing experiment is: **SPIRAL's algorithm (with RAE) trained on MARS's mixed curriculum.** If that setup achieves the same results as MARS, then this paper's methodological claims are largely invalidated. This is a huge hole in the experimental design.\n3. **Concurrent Novelty: \"Turn-Level\" Credit Assignment.**\n   - **The Problem:** The authors correctly identify a \"critical flaw\" in the original GRPO \"Process Supervision\" setting, which uses a \"normalize-then-sum\" approach, and propose a \"sum-then-normalize\" fix.\n   - **The Criticism:** They weren't the only ones to spot this. A paper on OpenReview (**`h83vIG5Hre`**, pub. **June 8, 2025**) *also* identified that trajectory-level estimation is \"inadequate\" and proposed a \"fine-grained turn-level advantage estimation\" strategy.\n   - **The Evidence:** This concurrent paper proposed **\"MT-GRPO\"**, which uses a *different* fix (a weighted sum of independently normalized turn-level and outcome-level advantages, e.g., $\\hat{A}_{i,1} = \\hat{A}^{T}_{i} + \\lambda\\hat{A}^{O}_{i}$). This means the \"best way to fix GRPO\" was an open question at the time of submission. MARS presents its solution as *the* solution, without acknowledging or comparing it to other concurrent proposals. This again weakens the claim of methodological novelty.\n4. **Misleading Framing: The \"Novelty\" of Mixed-Motive Games.**\n   - **The Problem:** The paper repeatedly frames its contribution as \"The inclusion of cooperative games is a key differentiator\" and contrasts this with the \"narrow, adversarial-only mindset of prior work\".\n   - **The Criticism:** This is an oversimplification and a bit of a strawman. The *concept* of using mixed-motive games is not new.\n   - **The Evidence:** The authors *themselves* cite **Xu et al. (2023)** , which used the \"Werewolf\" game. The \"Werewolf\" paper *explicitly* states the game \"involves both cooperation and competition\".The *real* novelty of MARS isn't the *idea* of using a non-adversarial game; it's the demonstration that a *simple, modular curriculum* of prototype games (pure-coop, pure-comp) can *generalize to downstream MAS*. This is a much stronger and more accurate claim, and I'd urge the authors to reframe their contribution this way."}, "questions": {"value": "My overall rating is \"Borderline Accept\" because the *results* (the generalization to AutoGen/MAD) are genuinely exciting and significant. However, my final decision is entirely contingent on the authors' ability to provide satisfactory answers to the following questions, which directly address the weaknesses I've outlined.\n\n1. **\"Agent-Specific Normalization\" vs. SPIRAL's RAE:** I'm going to be very direct here. Your \"agent-specific advantage normalization\" appears to be functionally identical to the \"Role-conditioned Advantage Estimation (RAE)\" proposed in **SPIRAL (Liu et al., 2025)** 5, which is your main baseline.\n   - Can you please provide a clear, algorithmic explanation of how your method *differs* from RAE?\n   - If it is not different, this must be acknowledged. If it *is* different, why did you not compare against RAE in your ablations? This really needs to be addressed, as it undermines a core methodological claim.\n2. **Decoupling Method vs. Curriculum:** Your key comparison against SPIRAL is confounded. You changed both the algorithm *and* the game curriculum. How can you be sure that your performance gains are not *entirely* due to your superior curriculum (i.e., just adding Hanabi)? To support your methodological claims, you *must* provide evidence that decouples these factors. Can you provide results for either:\n   - **(a)** The SPIRAL algorithm (with RAE) trained on *your* mixed (Tic/Kuhn/Hanabi) curriculum?\n   - **(b)** Your MARS algorithm trained on SPIRAL's *adversarial-only* curriculum?\n3. **Regarding Concurrent Work on GRPO:** Your \"sum-then-normalize\" fix for GRPO's process supervision flaw is one solution. However, concurrent work from June 2025 (OpenReview `h83vIG5Hre`) 8 proposed an alternative, **\"MT-GRPO\"**. Could you please comment on why your solution is preferable to theirs (a weighted, multi-signal advantage)?\n4. **Regarding Novelty Framing:** You claim the \"inclusion of cooperative games is a key differentiator\". Given that you cite **Xu et al. (2023)** , which used the \"Werewolf\" game (a mixed cooperation/competition game), would you be willing to reframe your novelty? It seems to me the real, and more impressive, contribution is demonstrating *generalization from a simple, modular curriculum of game prototypes to complex, downstream MAS*.\n5. **Ablation Result in Table 5:** In Table 5, you ablate the \"agent-specific\" component. The performance drop for the Hanabi specialist is described as \"mild\" (55.55 -> 52.50). This seems counter-intuitive. Hanabi is an asymmetric, imperfect-information *cooperative* game where player roles and perspectives are fundamentally different and critical to success. Why is the effect so much smaller here than in the adversarial games? Does this suggest your component is less crucial for cooperative scenarios?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "1RTHUjuXqV", "forum": "GCd5v3ehmr", "replyto": "GCd5v3ehmr", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4715/Reviewer_dt93"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4715/Reviewer_dt93"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission4715/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761961955763, "cdate": 1761961955763, "tmdate": 1762917529337, "mdate": 1762917529337, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "MARS is an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enhances multi-agent reasoning capabilities of large language models through self-play in strategic games, achieving 28.7% performance improvement in games and 10.0% and 12.5% gains on multi-agent reasoning benchmarks AIME and GPQA-Diamond, respectively."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.
