FAuNO adopts an actor–critic architecture in which local actors learn node-specific dynamics and peer interactions, while a federated critic aggregates experience across agents to encourage efficient cooperation and improve overall system performance.

Mathematical inconsistencies and unclear formulations.\n   Several of the paper's core equations need revision or clarification:\n   * The communication delay formula (Eq. 1) mixes logarithms with dB values, which gives units of bits/Hz rather than seconds. This should be fixed using $T = \\frac{\\alpha}{B \\log_2(1+\\text{SNR}_{\\text{linear}})}$. Using natural log gives wrong capacity units.\n   * The reward function (Eq. 9) adds delay as a *positive* term, which reverses the expected reward logic.\n   * The global objective (Eq. 10) minimizes over critic weights $w$ even though $l_k(w, \\theta_k)$ depends on both local and global parameters. The text should explain the alternating optimization scheme more clearly.\n   * The advantage estimation (Eq. 20) is labeled as GAE, but it's actually an n-step formulation without λ. This is minor but worth correcting.\n2. Narrow set of baselines.\n   The comparisons include only LQ and SCOF. These are decent but relatively weak. Adding comparisons with more modern federated or asynchronous RL baselines (e.g., FedAsync, FedProx, MAPPO) would give a clearer sense of where FAuNO stands.\n3. Reward shaping limits generalizability (though authors acknowledge this).\n    The authors transparently admit that their reward function is \"tailored to mitigate congestion in star-like Ether topologies\" and \"biases FAuNO toward local processing\" in random networks. While this honesty is appreciated, it reveals a practical limitation: FAuNO's performance is sensitive to topology-specific reward tuning. In random topologies, LQ outperforms FAuNO on task completion (Table 5) precisely because the reward discourages offloading even when the network structure supports it. This suggests FAuNO may require manual reward retuning for each deployment scenario, limiting its plug-and-play applicability. Testing alternative reward formulations or learning adaptive reward weights would strengthen the generalizability claims.\n4. Constraint vs. RL mismatch.\n   The paper begins by framing the task offloading problem as a constrained optimization (Eqs. 6–8) but never enforces these constraints. In practice, FAuNO turns them into soft penalties in the reward. This is fine, but it should be clearly stated that the hard-constraint formulation is relaxed.\n5. Observation normalization.\n   Using −1 to represent missing neighbors while normalizing other inputs to [0, 1] is questionable. It's not serious, but a masking or zero-padding strategy would be better i think.\n6. Reproducibility problem – repository link is empty.\n   The paper provides an anonymous code link (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FAuNO-C976) but the repository is empty and contains no runnable scripts. While the appendix includes detailed hyperparameters, the lack of working code prevents independent verification of results."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Concerning Eq. 9, was the delay term negated during implementation (making a longer delay lead to less reward)?\n \n2. In Eq. 10, when minimizing over the critic weights w, do you hold the actor parameters $\\theta_k$ fixed?\n \n3. How does FAuNO's performance change as the buffer threshold $K$ increases beyond 0.5?\n \n4. Could the global critic aggregation be made hierarchical or fully decentralized?\n \n5.
