Conventional latent variable methods typically model continuous brain dynamics through discretizing time with recurrent architecture, which necessarily results in compounded cumulative prediction errors and failure of capturing instantaneous, nonlinear characteristics of EEGs. We propose ODEBrain, a Neural ODE latent dynamic forecasting framework to overcome these challenges by integrating spatio-temporal-frequency features into spectral graph nodes, followed by a Neural ODE modeling the continuous latent dynamics. Our design ensures that the latent representations can capture stochastic variations of complex brain state at any given time point. Extensive experiments verifies that ODEBrain can improve significantly over existing methods in forecasting EEG dynamics with enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["EEG", "ODE", "Brain network", "continuous dynamics"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/282d28a273525ad26fdd07fe73a2ee150c1778da.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes ODEBRAIN, a neural ODE latent dynamic forecasting framework with integrating spatio-temporal features into spectral graph nodes.
