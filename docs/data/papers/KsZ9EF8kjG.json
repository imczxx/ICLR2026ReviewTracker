As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our social lives, understanding, evaluating, and developing their social intelligence are becoming important. While multiple works have investigated the social intelligence of LLMs: (1) most focus on a single pillar, while a comprehensive framework for organizing and studying the social intelligence of LLMs remains underdeveloped; (2) position LLMs as passive observers from a third-person perspective. Compared to the third-person perspective, ego-centric first-person perspective evaluation can align well with actual LLM-based Agent use scenarios; (3) a lack of comprehensive evaluation of behavioral intelligence, with specific emphasis on a more intuitive comparison of behavioral differences between humans and LLMs. In light of these, we introduce the EgoSocialArena framework, built upon the three foundational pillars of social intelligence - cognitive, situational, and behavioral intelligence, with each pillar supported by novel and systematic evaluation design. Using EgoSocialArena, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of fourteen foundation models and investigate several important questions, including the social intelligence performance of Large Reasoning Models, limitations of existing social intelligence evaluation frameworks in interactive dialogue settings, and whether perspective shift can elicit social capabilities similar to Chain-of-Thought elicit math capabilities.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["First-Person Perspective", "Social Intelligence", "Data Framework", "Human-Machine Interactive Dialogue"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7836153c5e0324b8bc273b013692270348d99644.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/5e8a098621e3a557450ad248701dc87e0eaa178e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses three major limitations in current evaluations of social intelligence in large language models (LLMs): (1) the reliance on single-dimensional assessment, (2) the dominance of a third-person “observer” perspective, and (3) the lack of intuitive comparison with human behavior. To tackle these issues, the authors propose a new framework called EgoSocialArena, which adopts a first-person (ego-centric) perspective and conducts systematic evaluations along three dimensions — cognitive, situational, and behavioral intelligence.\nFor cognitive intelligence, the paper converts classic Theory of Mind (ToM) datasets based on the Sally-Anne test into a first-person format to assess static cognition, and employs two multi-round games — Number Guessing (G0.8A) and  LIMIT TEXAS HOLD’EM — to evaluate dynamic cognitive evolution during interactions.\nFor situational intelligence, the authors transform datasets such as SocialIQA, EmoBench, and ToMBench into first-person narratives to test real-world contextual understanding. They also manually construct Counterfactual Situations and Parallel World Situations to evaluate adaptability to non-standard social rules.\nFor behavioral intelligence, the framework builds upon the SOTOPIA dataset to assess goal achievement in human–machine interaction scenarios.\nThe evaluation based on EgoSocialArena yields several key findings:\n1. In cognitive intelligence, OpenAI-O3 performs almost achieve comparable with humans, while in behavioral intelligence, GPT-5 and Claude-sonnet-4 even surpass human participants in task completion.\n2. The first-person perspective serves as a “performance catalyst” for most models, yet paradoxically causes performance drops in top-tier models such as GPT-5 and OpenAI-03, suggesting that existing third-person ToM benchmarks may overestimate model capabilities.\n3. Strong reasoning ability contributes to cognitive intelligence but remains insufficient for situational intelligence without rich social knowledge and contextual grounding.\n4. Advanced models exhibit distinct behaviors. For example, GPT-5’s conversational expressions are somewhat rigid and repetitive, giving humans the distinct impression of conversing with a machine, whereas Claude-sonnet-4 frequently produces emotionally-laden expressions."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- This paper identifies key limitations in current evaluations of social intelligence in LLMs, such as the narrow focus on single-dimensional metrics and the lack of assessment settings involving human–machine interaction.\n- It introduces novel evaluation setups, including human–machine interaction dialogues for assessing behavioral intelligence and Parallel World and Counterfactual tasks for evaluating situational intelligence, which have strong potential to become an important contribution to the field."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The paper does not provide sufficient evidence showing what distinct model behaviors or findings the proposed framework reveals compared with prior social intelligence benchmarks (e.g., the agent–agent interaction patterns in SOTOPIA). The evaluation results lack an in-depth comparative analysis with previous studies, which to some extent weakens the justification for the necessity and uniqueness of the new framework.\n- While the paper divides social intelligence into three pillars — cognitive, situational, and behavioral intelligence — it does not thoroughly discuss the theoretical relationships among these dimensions. For instance, are these three dimensions complete and orthogonal? Do they exhibit potential overlap (e.g., does behavioral intelligence inherently encompass cognitive and situational intelligence)? Moreover, when assigning certain datasets (such as ToMBench) to a specific dimension, the paper provides insufficient justification for why a given task is treated as assessing only that single dimension, rather than reflecting a composite of multiple abilities.\n- The evaluation tasks within the framework are primarily adaptations or integrations of existing benchmarks, showing relatively limited originality or methodological innovation in task design itself.\n- The study recruits 50 graduate students as baselines for multiple-choice evaluation and selects 10 participants for interactive dialogue assessment. This small sample size — especially the 10-person subset for interactive testing — may lack statistical representativeness, potentially limiting the reliability and generalizability of the human–model comparison."}, "questions": {"value": "- Given that the datasets used to evaluate “static cognition” and “real-world situational understanding” are adapted from earlier publicly available static benchmarks, have the authors considered the potential risk of data leakage or training set contamination when assessing the latest LLMs? Since many modern models may have been trained on these benchmarks or their variants, it would be important to clarify what measures were taken to ensure the validity and fairness of the evaluation results.\n- The paper mentions that the “Parallel World Situation” and “Counterfactual Situation” datasets were manually constructed, yet it provides no detailed description of their construction process. Could the authors share more information about how these datasets were developed? For example, who created the data (e.g., domain experts, research assistants, or crowdworkers)?

Below are my main concerns for each dimension:\n- Cognitive intelligence: despite interesting findings in LLM's asymmetric ability between first and third person view point, the paper's claim that such first person view would benefit real world agent use cases is a bit unsupported. I would suggest adding a specific case or experiment to support this claim.\n- Situational intelligence: the definition of situational intelligence is unclearly motivated. In my perception such intelligence, especially from Social IQA, is testing model's ability to perform common sense reasoning under different social situations, while the counterfactual and parallel world modifications seem a bit irrelevant. It would be more sound to modify social rules instead of rock-paper-siccor's rule. And it would be more sound to modify social characters, such as demographic information, than modifying things to be moon coloney. \n- Behavioral intelligence: the way of measuring behavioral intelligence is kind of contradicting with the scalability design principle that the author positions this work at first. It is also quite short of novelty by crowd sourcing human-AI interactions. Moreover, I saw that GPT5 is outperforming human on Sotopia, which is not discussed.\n\nOverall, the paper lacks definitions and supporting literature for each type of intelligence they categorize on.

The discussion of the improvements from switching third person to first person view is quite interesting and is probably worth to dive a little deeper by analyzing reasoning chain, etc.\n2.

It looks like the rock-paper-scissor example are rather irrelevant to social intelligence but more relevant to general reasoning and common sense. Can you provide some more relevant ones?\n4. Why do you think using parallel worlds such as underwater city would affect social intelligence? I find certain adversity but the reasoning remains unclear to me.\n5. I suggest apply counterfactual modifications and environment diversifications with a focus on social situations.\n6. I highly recommend discussing the result that a few close source models like GPT5 outperform human on Sotopia, either through semantic analysis on GPT5's strategies, or the LLM judges' imperfection. \n7.

For instance, if the expected choice (e.g., option A) assumes that an underwater robot lacks the concept of flying creatures, then the very mention of “bird wings” in the question itself introduces a world-consistency error, as it relies on real-world ecological knowledge absent from that world.

The three-pillar structure (cognitive, situational, behavioral) provides a holistic and systematic approach to a complex construct.\nMethodological Rigor and Innovation: The proposed methods are inventive. The perspective conversion workflow is a practical contribution. The design of the dynamic cognition scenarios (G0.8A with multi-level rule-based agents and Texas Hold'em with RL agents) is sophisticated and provides a more authentic test of an LLM's ability to model an opponent's strategy over time.\nComprehensive and Scalable Evaluation: The evaluation is extensive, covering 14 models, including the most recent frontier models (GPT-5, Claude-sonnet-4, o3). The inclusion of a carefully collected human performance baseline is a significant strength, allowing for a meaningful interpretation of model scores. The authors correctly emphasize the framework's extensibility.\nValuable and Actionable Insights: The results go beyond mere leaderboards and offer insightful analysis.

Were the 50 graduate students compensated? Were they screened for specific backgrounds? A more detailed protocol would bolster the credibility of this crucial benchmark.\nRule-based Agents: The rationale for the specific cognitive levels (e.g., why an arithmetic sequence for Level 2?) is somewhat under-explained in the main text. A stronger justification for why these specific rule sets effectively represent increasing cognitive complexity would strengthen the dynamic cognition evaluation.\nWriting and Statistical Minor Issues:\nFigure Referencing: The text frequently references figures (e.g., Figure 1(A-C), Figure 3, Figure 4) that are not included in the provided excerpt.

A brief sentence or citation on how these scores are determined by the GPT-4 evaluator would be helpful.\nStatistical Testing: The paper reports score differences but does not appear to employ statistical significance tests. Stating whether the observed gaps (e.g., the 2.3 point difference between o3 and humans) are statistically significant would add weight to the conclusions.\nRepetition: The main findings are repeated in the abstract, introduction, and experiment sections.
