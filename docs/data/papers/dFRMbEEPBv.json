Reward-based post-training has emerged as a promising direction to improve the quality and semantic alignment of generated videos. However, recent methods either rely on large-scale human preference annotations or operate on misaligned embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models, both leading to limited scalability or suboptimal supervision. We present $\\texttt{PISCES}$, an annotation-free post-training algorithm that addresses these limitations via a novel Bi-objective Optimal Transport (OT)-aligned Rewards module. To align reward signals with human judgment, $\\texttt{PISCES}$ uses OT to bridge text and video embeddings at both the distribution and discrete token levels, enabling reward supervision to fulfill two objectives: (i) a Distributional OT-aligned Quality Reward that captures overall visual quality and temporal coherence; and (ii) a Discrete Token-level OT-aligned Semantic Reward that enforces semantic, spatio-temporal correspondence between text and video tokens. To our knowledge, $\\texttt{PISCES}$ is the first to improve annotation-free reward supervision in generative post-training through the lens of OT. Experiments on both short-video and long-video generation show that $\\texttt{PISCES}$ outperforms both annotation-free and annotation-based methods on VBench across Quality and Semantic scores, with human preference studies further validating its effectiveness. We also show that the Bi-objective OT-aligned Rewards module is compatible with multiple optimization paradigms, including direct backpropagation and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.", "tldr": "PIESCES is the first annotation-free T2V post-training algorithm with a novel rewards module that outperforms both annotation-based and annotation-free T2V post-training methods.", "keywords": ["video generative models"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d4b2cb7966bc38d5ba16d47d8e31a41eca5bae85.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "PISCES is an annotation-free post-training method that aligns reward signals with human judgment via a Bi-objective OT-aligned Rewards module.

The paper's core claim seems inconsistent between the main results (Table 1) and the ablation studies (Table 3, 5). According to Table 5, the main results in Table 1 show that the results of PISCES are obtained by GRPO. Since the baseline T2V-Turbo-v2, which also post-trains a video model using CD loss with external rewards via Direct Backpropagation optimization, shows 83.93 in Quality score, outperforming the proposed method's result in Table 3 (83.73). This suggests the performance gains seen in Table 1 might stem more from the GRPO optimization strategy than from the proposed OT-rewards.\n\n2. In Algorithm 1, it states 'perform ODE solver from $t_{n+k}$ to 0,' which implies a multi-step denoising process for generating the clean video. This would be computationally prohibitive for backpropagation. Also, this notation contradicts Appendix A, which claims single-step denoising is used for efficient backpropagation. This ambiguity obscures the exact gradient flow mechanism.\n\n3. The proposed method requires (1) pre-training a Neural OT map and (2) solving a discrete, spatio-temporal OT problem within the training loop. This likely introduces additional computational overhead. The paper provides no analysis of this extra cost, making it difficult to assess the practical trade-offs. In addition, the paper provides insufficient detail on the training setup for NOT training."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
