The probability of returning a wrong answer should not exceed a maximum risk parameter $\\delta$ and good algorithms make as few queries to the environment as possible. The Track-and-Stop algorithm is a pioneering method to solve these problems. Specifically, it is well-known that it enjoys asymptotic optimality sample complexity guarantees for $\\delta \\to 0$ whenever the map from the environment to its correct answers is single-valued (e.g., best-arm identification with a unique optimal arm). The Sticky Track-and-Stop algorithm extends these results to settings where, for each environment, there might exist multiple correct answers (e.g., $\\epsilon$-optimal arm identification). Although both methods are optimal in the asymptotic regime, their non-asymptotic guarantees remain unknown. In this work, we fill this gap and provide non-asymptotic guarantees for both algorithms.", "tldr": "We derive non-asymptotic guarantees for the Track-and-Stop and Sticky Track-and-Stop algorithms.", "keywords": ["Multi-Armed Bandit Theory", "Pure Exploration", "Fixed-Confidence"], "primary_area": "learning theory", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/522b42bdafdc1d8a6a063181dac8b746db24e591.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper presents a non-asymptotic analysis of the performance of the track-and-stop and sticky track-and-stop algorithms for pure exploration tasks under fixed confidence.
