To the best of my knowledge, generating audio with separated concepts using audio-based negative guidance is novel in this field. The proposed NAG method is well-justified and, based on the audio separability metrics in Table 2, appears to offer significant improvement. Further, Figure 4 visually demonstrates that the model is capable of the incremental refinement that was challenging for previous V2A models. \n\n2. To overcome the data scarcity problem for this new task, the authors utilized audio pairs from adjacent segments of the same video. This allows the framework to be trained using standard, widely accessible single-reference datasets (e.g., VGGSound).\n\n3. The authors compare their results against strong baselines, showing that step-by-step generation with NAG demonstrates better or comparable results across diverse key metrics, as well as in the user study.

The authors explicitly state this limitation in Appendix G; the overall quality and the ability to generate specific sounds are heavily dependent on the underlying V2A model (MMAudio).

This creates a hard ceiling on the final audio fidelity.\n\n2. The ablation study in Appendix F (Table A3) reveals that the method's performance is sensitive to the order of generation.

However, this is functionally an application of negative prompting or classifier-free guidance, techniques that are well-established in the broader field of conditional diffusion models, particularly in the image domain. The paper's novelty lies in applying this to a sequential audio generation framework, but it would be stronger if it were positioned as an application and adaptation of existing principles rather than the invention of a fundamentally new guidance method. The contribution is more in the \"how\" (the sequential process) than the \"what\" (the negative guidance itself).\n\n4. The paper's stated goal is to mimic the Foley process to create a complete, realistic audio track. However, the evaluation primarily measures the separability and individual quality of the generated sounds (stems), not the coherence and realism of the final composite audio. The simple summation used for mixing is a critical point of failure for realism. A realistic soundscape is not just a sum of its parts; it involves complex interactions, occlusion, and environmental acoustics.
