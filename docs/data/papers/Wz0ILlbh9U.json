In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters (parameter interpolation) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex hull of past parameters (parameter extrapolation). We benchmark several methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios.

The authors point out that many recent papers implicitly assume that, given a sequence of checkpoints, one can interpolate or extrapolate those weights to obtain parameters that work better on future data, even when the future distribution is unknown. The central claim of the paper is negative but important: under a realistic, “no access to the future” setting with streaming / continual updates, none of the evaluated interpolation (uniform / EMA merging, recent model, norm-downscaling) or extrapolation (first-order Taylor on parameter trajectory) methods consistently beats the trivial baseline of “just use the latest model. The only method that consistently avoids hurting performance is a simple downscaling of the latest model (interpolating toward the origin), which the authors motivate via parameter-norm growth and sharper minima over time."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The paper is very explicit about the setting: streaming / continual fine-tuning, no access to future unlabeled or labeled data, and hyperparameters must be chosen from the past. This closes an often-overlooked loophole in earlier temporal/DG works that quietly validated on future data.\n2. The experiments span: (i) monthly news language modeling and summarization with T5 (showing clear temporal decay and the salience of downscaling), and (ii) WILDS-Time datasets (Yearbook, HuffPost, arXiv, FMoW), where no single method dominates. This makes the main negative result much more convincing than if it were shown on one dataset.\n3. The paper separates parameter interpolation (merging, recent, downscaling) from parameter extrapolation (Taylor step using the most recent difference).\n4. The observation that the optimal extrapolation factor 𝛼 often drifts below 1 or even becomes negative (meaning “don’t extrapolate; sometimes go backward”) is a strong piece of evidence that parameter trajectories of large models are not sufficiently smooth or aligned over time to support simple Taylor-based prediction.\n5. The finding that downscaling the latest model is the only option that does not reliably hurt, and that this correlates with steadily growing parameter norms under continual learning, is a small but real contribution that practitioners can immediately try."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The paper explains why interpolation/extrapolation is hard via non-identifiability, non-convexity, and noisy parameter trajectories, but these are largely qualitative or synthetic-illustration arguments; there is no general impossibility statement of the form “under assumptions X, any future-agnostic checkpoint-only method cannot beat the latest model by more than 𝜖”. A lightweight formalization, even under a stylized model, would sharpen the negative result.\n2. The paper itself shows that if you don’t do sequential fine-tuning (i.e. if you reinit from a pretrain every time), all methods degrade much more (Fig. 6). That means the key negative result is partly conditional on the positive result that CL keeps consecutive checkpoints close. This is important, but it also means the conclusions are strongest for CL-like pipelines, weaker for other update regimes.\n3. The paper does the right thing — tune 𝛼 only on past data — but for some methods (esp. extrapolation) the chosen 𝛼 fluctuates sharply over time (Fig. 5). In practice, this means users would have to re-tune at every step, which undercuts the appeal of “cheap temporal generalization.” A small ablation on “fixed  𝛼 over long horizons” vs “retuned 𝛼 ” would have made this clearer."}, "questions": {"value": "1. You show that parameter norms steadily increase under CL and that downscaling helps. Did you try layerwise or modulewise downscaling (e.g. scale only attention / only FFN / only classifier) and, if so, was the benefit still present? Intuitively, temporal brittleness might concentrate in the last layers that overfit to very recent tokens / labels.\n2. Can you tell whether the sign flip correlates with which dataset was seen last (e.g. news vs scientific vs vision)? In other words, is the problem that parameter trajectories are globally noisy, or that mixing modalities / tasks breaks linearity?\n3. Fig. 6 clearly shows CL helps. But you fine-tune from θt−1 on all datasets. What happens if the per-step compute is reduced (e.g. 10% of the usual steps, or LoRA-style adapters only)? Do interpolation/extrapolation fail immediately because checkpoints become less aligned, or do they degrade more gracefully?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "S9rBto3IYi", "forum": "Wz0ILlbh9U", "replyto": "Wz0ILlbh9U", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13966/Reviewer_KbVf"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13966/Reviewer_KbVf"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13966/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761989848124, "cdate": 1761989848124, "tmdate": 1762924465390, "mdate": 1762924465390, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "Due to inaccurate prediction on unseen future data by Machine Learning (ML) models, the authors investigate under what conditions models can achieve such a generalization when depending on past data.
