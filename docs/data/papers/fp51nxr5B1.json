Existing work, however, only optimizes translation quality without explicitly verifying the output against safety constraints. We present AutoSafeLTL, a self‑supervised, cloud–edge–collaborative framework that automates the generation of safety‑compliant LTL specifications while preserving logical consistency and semantic fidelity. A lightweight edge‑side three-stage-fine-tuned LLM offers real‑time conversion from natural language to LTL specifications (NL2LTL) and guarantees safety‑critical latency and data locality. Two larger‑capacity cloud‑side agents then iteratively refine the alignment: 1) LLM‑as‑an‑Aligner matches atomic propositions to safety constraints, and 2) LLM‑as‑a‑Critic interprets counterexamples from Inclusion Check to guide corrective regeneration. This collaborative architecture provides a safety-guaranteed alignment mechanism between high-level user intent and formally verifiable system behavior, demonstrating the potential of our framework to advance AI Alignment in safety-critical domains. Our approach achieves 0% violation rates on multiple benchmarks, enabling trustworthy specification generation and verification for both AI and critical CPS applications.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Linear Temporal Logic", "Large Language Model", "Language Inclusion Check", "Automated Verification"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/209b789296423c0259c0338e1a71cd105c0da2b7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/aaf0e97b038a15f1ae6dbe3e1caed9413db9e295.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces AutoSafeLTL, a self-supervised framework for automatically generating safety-compliant Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications from natural language task descriptions.\nUnlike prior NL2LTL systems that only translate text into logical formulas, AutoSafeLTL ensures that generated formulas formally satisfy predefined safety constraints.

The move beyond just measuring translation accuracy to ensuring formal safety properties is a significant step forward for the application of LLMs in critical systems.\n\nThe framework strives for a fully automated pipeline from natural language to a verified LTL formula, which is an ambitious and worthwhile goal. The proposed improvement to the counterexample path extraction algorithm to enable this automation is a good contribution.\n\nThe idea of using a formal counterexample from the inclusion check not as a mere failure signal, but as a structured feedback mechanism to guide an LLM creates a meaningful dialogue between formal methods and LLMs."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Lack of temporal efficiency: lack of time performance metrics. The proposed framework involves multiple, iterative loops of LLM inference, LTL-to-automata conversion, and language inclusion checking. Given that the primary application domain is safety-critical CPS (exemplified by a traffic navigation scenario), where decision-making must occur in milliseconds or seconds, the latency measurements are important. The average of 4.3 semantic correction iterations (Table 7) suggests a potentially prohibitive computational and communication overhead. Without data on execution time, it is impossible to evaluate the framework's practicality for any real system.\n\n- Over-reliance on pre-defined, exhaustive Safety Constraints: the entire safety guarantee hinges on the assumption that the set of safety constraints Ψ is complete and correct. The paper does not address the \"open-world\" problem:\n\nWhat happens when a user introduces a novel Atomic Proposition (AP) not present in the safety library? The LLM-as-an-Aligner might map it incorrectly or drop it, leading to semantically incorrect or unsafe specifications.\n\nAn AP generated as go_straight_200m might need to match a safety library AP like straight_200m. This is a simple case. However, more complex divergences are likely. For example, the user's instruction \"Navigate to the emergency bay\" might generate an AP reach_emergency_bay, while the safety constraints use a more technical term like at_service_area. The LLM may fail to link these conceptually similar but lexically different terms.\n\nHow does the system handle unforeseen scenarios or edge cases not covered by Ψ? The guarantee of 0% violations is only valid with respect to the known constraints, which provides a false sense of security if the constraint set is incomplete.\n\n- Computational scalability: the paper ignores the well-known state explosion problem in automata-based verification. The complexity of BA construction and inclusion checking is exponential in the number of APs. The evaluation uses a small, manageable set of APs (4-8). The framework's behavior and feasibility with a realistic number of APs (e.g., 30+ for a real autonomous driving system), are not discussed. This raises serious doubts about its scalability.\n\n- Benchmark: the evaluation is conducted on a custom benchmark. There is no demonstration of generalization, raising concerns about overfitting to the authors' specific data style (Chen et al., 2023).\n\n- Missing baselines: the paper fails to compare against established NL2LTL methods, such as grammar-based approaches (e.g., Fuggitti & Chakraborti, 2023), other LLM-based fine-tuning methods (e.g., Chen et al., 2023). Consequently, it is impossible to determine if the significant complexity of AutoSafeLTL provides any tangible benefit over existing, potentially simpler and more efficient methods.\n\n- Data privacy: the paper emphasizes \"data locality for privacy\" as a key advantage of the edge-side User LLM. However, the generated LTL formula, which is a direct formalization of the user's intent and the environmental context, is sent to the cloud for the verification and alignment steps. While the raw natural language may stay on the device, the formalized semantic content does not. This nuanced privacy trade-off is not adequately discussed.\n\nFuggitti, F., & Chakraborti, T. (2023).

Please provide a concrete example and explain the process. What happens in the case of an AP that is not just new, but semantically incompatible with the safety rules encoded in the constraints?

Currently, these details are missing, the statistics in Table 8 is insufficient.\n\nThere are some minor issues for clarity as well. For example, it is unclear why LLM-as-a-critic is useful, the only statement is they discoverd this and this not validated in ablation study.
