Traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches are often ineffective for static representations of agent interactions, which don't correlate to the fluid nature of real world software development teams. The proposed method combines dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) with role-aware attention mechanisms to model time-varying collaboration patterns in which agents (i.e., developers, corresponding to nodes in a graph) are represented as nodes of a graph with an adaptively changing topology reflecting changing teams. A transformer-based gnn encoder uses the SK severing information across the graph, and a collaboration complexity divider estimates coordination complexity to serve as a decision-making leader. The framework uses a centralized critic with decentralized actors (CCDA) to encourage a maximized team level rewards (e.g., reduced merge conflicts or test coverage) and individual autonomy. Moreover, the system is interfaced with traditional development tools, such as version control systems, IDEs, and conflict resolvers to simplify the integration of learned policies into traditional workflows. The key novelty lies in the \\textbf{role-graph duality}, where roles are both learned from data and emergent from graph dynamics, enabling hierarchical coordination strategies. For instance, high collaboration complexity could lead to the distribution of the mediator roles to stabilize such a system. Experiments on man-made and real-world coding data sets show that simulations using the proposed method show significant gains in the efficiency of teamwork and code-quality over baseline methods for MARL. The Framework's flexibility with Dynamic Teams and the general nature of the collaboration scenario, the Framework can be a potential contender to solve the challenges that modern software engineering face.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Role-Graph Reinforcement Learning"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7f50fa552d0ac5cb13742fdbd4d1549c8cfef46b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a MARL framework to address the challenges of coordination and role adaptation in collaborative software development teams.

The paper doesn't provide a precise formulation for Dec-POMDP and CTDE. The distinction between observations and critic inputs remains unclear, which gives rise to two issues, the risk of information leakage and unfair comparisons with baseline models.\n\n3. The metrics TCR, MCF, CQS, and TEI are only defined verbally, with no accompanying mathematical equations to formalize their computation logic. The paper fails to specify the measurement units for these metrics, provide relevant references to support their design or prior use, and release the code for metric calculation. This lack of essential technical details makes the proposed metrics entirely non-auditable.\n\n4. There are some issues in the experiments. The datasets are merely referenced in the paper, with their coverage scope and splitting methods left unspecified. The baselines are either outdated or misaligned with the research objectives, and the paper lacks both high-performance graph-Transformer multi-agent reinforcement learning (graph-Transformer MARL) models and tuned non-reinforcement learning (non-RL) schedulers. The ablation studies are inadequately designed, as they do not include confidence interval (CIs) analysis with multiple random seeds or sensitivity validation. The churn study lacks sufficient depth and fails to fully explore core influencing factors. The qualitative analysis in Section 5.5 only stays at the level of phenomenon description, without forming conclusions with diagnostic value.\n\n5. The writing needs to be improved. Figures 1–2 are overly simplistic in content. References to these figures within the text are not hyperlinkable, as the \"ref\" command was not used. Proper punctuation is missing from the equations.
