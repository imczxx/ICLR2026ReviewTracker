Compared to modeling the conditional intensity of a TPP, modeling its conditional cumulative intensity function (CCIF) improves efficiency and eliminates approximation error. However, currently, the parametrization of CCIF remains limited and scarce. This paper proposes a novel method called the Monotone Alternating Spline (MAS). By leveraging two distinct interpolation and extrapolation components, MAS provides a broad framework for modeling CCIF, offering greater flexibility and efficiency. Theoretically, MAS's interpolation grants a strong fitting ability, while its extrapolation guarantees robust generalization. Extensive experiments illuminate that MAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Temporal Point Process", "Cumulative Conditional Intensity Function", "Monotone Splines"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e2380a04a5897e50c717e30d6eaa65d6d0450c55.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/2f1d82c9d1aaa8ff1dcfe7d3f1ddd18d14caaf62.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes **Monotone Alternating Splines**, a framework for parametrizing conditional cumulative intensity function of temporal point processes.

The proposed MAS framework appears to be an intuitive solution that tackles the limitations of CIF-based models and (cumulative) neural network models. The validation on nine datasets, including four real-world datasets, shows consistently competitive performance with all baselines. Standard deviations are reported for experimental results, adding some quantification of uncertainty to the claims.\n\nThe generalization analysis in Section 4 provides a clear, interpretable theoretical bound that decomposes the error into interpolation, extrapolation and complexity terms. This is nice to have for a practical method. The argument and evidence for MAS efficiency, thanks to its analytical derivatives, is convincing. The ablation study directly validates theoretical tradeoffs. The conceptual figures are quite clear and efficiently use the available space (assuming ICLR guidelines allow `wrapfig`)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "The main criticism is in the presentation of some of the results. Figure 4(e) shows training time for what appears to be a single run, which is surely highly variable. The mean and standard deviation/error over multiple runs would be more convincing. Similarly, Figures 4(a-d) could benefit from some uncertainty quantification.\n\nFurthermore, the scaling of timestamps by constant factors appears a bit _ad-hoc_. Is MAS sensitive to this scaling hyperparameter?\n\nThe paper's primary empirical evidence is presented in Tables 1 and 2, which are dense, difficult-to-read \"leaderboard\" tables. The use of bolding and underlining to highlight the top two models is a clear sign that the table format itself is failing to make the results accessible. The raw scores are not something that any reader is likely to need to look up directly, at least not in the main section of the paper. More rigorous and modern methods for comparing multiple models across multiple datasets are available, including the use of statistical tests (rather than reporting raw scores) and visual presentation, using small multiples or a critical difference diagram.

In the introduction it is written _\"asynchronous timestamps in continuous time, which sets them apart from conventional synchronized time series data...\"_ This seems to be an odd use of the term \"asynchronous\" and \"synchronous\" when it would appear the authors mean really \"irregular\" and \"regular\", here.\n\n2. The abbreviation \"(TPPs)\" is introduced in the abstract but never re-used.\n\n3.

The idea of modeling the cumulative intensity function with a monotone spline itself is not particularly novel [1]. While separating the modeling of interpolation and extrapolation is practically useful, it remains a minor methodological refinement. Also, representing the cumulative intensity function with a monotone spline is mathematically equivalent to representing the intensity function with a nonnegativity-constrained spline. Since the latter approach has already been explored (e.g., [2]), it is unclear what additional significance the proposed idea of modeling the cumulative intensity function using a monotone spline truly provides.\n- If the paper’s main contribution lies in its empirical accuracy (Tables 1 and 2), the experimental setup requires further improvement. For example, in fitting a Hawkes process with a simple triggering kernel and limited data, simpler models naturally achieve higher accuracy. Neural network–based models tend to underperform when the dataset is small unless their architecture (layer depth, unit size, and especially the smoothness of activation functions) is carefully tuned to the dataset. To fairly demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods in terms of both flexibility and generality, the baseline monotone NN architectures should be determined via cross-validation, and the comparison should be conducted across multiple data sizes.\n\n[1] Bantis et al., \"Survival estimation through the cumulative hazard function with monotone natural cubic splines\", Lifetime data analysis, 2012.\n\n[2] Loaiza-Ganem et al. \"Deep random splines for point process intensity estimation of neural population data\", NeurIPS, 2019."}, "questions": {"value": "- The explanation of the synthetic data is insufficient. For the Hawkes process datasets, over what time span was the data generated? What was the scale of the dataset used for training?\n- The experimental results only report accuracy. Since the paper claims efficiency as a key advantage of the proposed model, the training time should also be provided.\n- Why is the second condition in Theorem 3.1 necessary? The explanation refers to the Hawkes process, but by adopting a jump-type triggering kernel, one can construct a Hawkes process that does not satisfy this condition. Therefore, this second condition may not be a general requirement for cumulative intensity functions.\n- Theorem 3.1 is presented as self-evident, but references should be provided for its proof.\n- The paper states that MNNs lack expressive power (lines 180-181), but the reason or evidence for this claim should be explained."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "k1fjeO9xpE", "forum": "Xekof9okBD", "replyto": "Xekof9okBD", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8352/Reviewer_mUbi"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8352/Reviewer_mUbi"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8352/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761946020454, "cdate": 1761946020454, "tmdate": 1762920267308, "mdate": 1762920267308, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The work proposed to use monotone alternating splines (MAS) to parameterize the cumulative conditional intensity function for modelling temporal point process.

Despite the solid motivations, the innovation of the work can be summarized as a new approach toward parameterize the cumulative intensity function. This innovation itself is incremental.\n2. Even improved efficiency is a central contribution of the work, good quantitative performance on TPP benchmarks are also critical for a TPP model. Many recent works on temporal point process evaluate TPP models on multiple-events long-horizon predictions [1]. Lacking such experiment results makes the empirical study of the work relatively weaker.\n3. There are some recent SOTA TPP models not compared against in the model, including C-Diff [2], Hypro [3], Decomposable TPP [4]. The work should include these models in the comparison.\n4. The ablation study results shows that the model performance is easily impacted by the selection of hyper-parameters including, interpolation length, number of knots, and interpolation function. However, the selection of these hyper-parameters are purely empirical without principled guidance. The existence of these hyper-parameters also makes the contributions of the work less significant.\n5. The work claims that one of the limitations of existing intensity-based TPP approaches is the approximation error due to Monte-Carlo integration. This claim is not fully substantiated. In other words, can the performance of CIF-based models be improved and close the gap with the proposed approach with more accurate numerical integration?\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Xue, S.
