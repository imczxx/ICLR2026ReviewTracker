However, as the demand for longer prediction horizons increases, existing endpoint-completion or iterative-refine methods increasingly struggle with weak guidance and compounding errors. To tackle the long-horizon prediction challenge, we propose Pivot-Centric Trajectory Prediction (PCTP). By introducing \"pivots\" and focusing on predicting pivot points along extended trajectories, we divide the long-term prediction task into short-term sub-tasks at various scales. Specifically, PCTP decouples the long-term trajectory predicting process into two processes: pivot prediction and pivot-based trajectory refinement. The pivot prediction process aims to utilize global map context and agent-to-agent interactions to identify these \"pivot points\", while the pivot-based trajectory refinement process focuses on local map details and refines the short-term trajectory based on predicted \"pivot points\". Compared with existing methods, PCTP provides more intermediate guidance while reducing compounding errors. Moreover, PCTP is a flexible approach that can be integrated into most state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models. Experimental results show that PCTP improves the prediction accuracy of leading models on both Argoverse I and Argoverse II datasets with minimal impact on model size.  Specifically, PCTP combined with QCNet outperforms all published ensemble-free methods on the Argoverse II leaderboard at submission.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Deep Learning; Autonomous Driving; Trajectory Planning"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1cd11a988c80a7f631d2c669ee85438d475b1afa.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "To address the long-horizon trajectory prediction problem, this work proposes Pivot-centric Trajectory Prediction (PCTP), which decomposes long-horizon trajectory prediction into two subtasks: pivot prediction and pivot-based trajectory refinement.

The framework operates in two stages: first, it hierarchically predicts these pivots at multiple time scales, starting from a coarse endpoint and progressively adding intermediate points.

The paper acknowledges that ideal pivots would also consider map geometry and agent interactions but justifies the temporal-only approach as \"sufficient\" without a deeper analysis of its potential failure modes.\n*   While the paper effectively contrasts PCTP with endpoint-completion and full-trajectory-refinement paradigms, its positioning relative to other hierarchical or coarse-to-fine methods that also use intermediate waypoints could be strengthened. The concept of using intermediate goals is not entirely new (see DESTINE: Dynamic Goal Queries with Temporal Transductive Alignment for Trajectory Prediction), and the paper's primary novelty lies in the iterative, multi-scale learning mechanism for these pivots. Emphasizing this distinction more clearly would better highlight the specific contribution.\n*   The ablation study on the pivot sampling interval (Table 5) only analyzes the effect of the final interval at the most granular level.

The paper argues that predicting sparse pivots is an easier learning task than predicting a full trajectory proposal. This is an intuitive claim.

Could the authors elaborate on the specific advantages of this iterative process compared to other coarse-to-fine methods (e.g., DESTINE) that predict a set of intermediate waypoints in a single forward pass?\n3.
