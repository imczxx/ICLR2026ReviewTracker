Traditional approaches to studying dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. \nIn particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits without a significant change in orthographic processing.\nTaken together, our modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a computational framework for investigating reading disorders.", "tldr": "We model dyslexia in vision-language models by selectively perturbing word processing units, reproducing core reading deficits while preserving general language and visual abilities.", "keywords": ["VLMs", "Dyslexia", "Reading", "Cognition", "Causal hypothesis testing", "NeuroAI"], "primary_area": "applications to neuroscience & cognitive science", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5ba878d485b1581954a194786126abbc26d144ba.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This papers studies dyslexia and the supposed role of a specific brain area, VWFA, in this disorder, corresponding to impairments in language decoding but not in normal intelligence.

I know that there is really less data on brain activity or assessment scores recorded longitudinally from dyslexic individuals, but a subsequent missing quantitative comparison between the models and that data feels like a test whose absence quite strongly undermines my ability to validate the framework. (2) Additionally, could the authors point out how different their work is from the work by AlKhamissi and colleagues (2025)? Is it simply the case that their approach of functional localization is being applied to the visual word form area here? (3) Both vision and language models have been validated, to a large extent, as decent models of the corresponding sensory systems they model due to being able to use model units to explain a large amount of variance in sensory neural responses under different transform classes. A discussion on the same for vision language models which are being used here seems like a pre-requisite before even considering them to analyze brain behavior under some form of dysfunction. For example, do the representation similarity matrices from the brain and these models using some stimulus set show a large degree of convergence? (4) I appreciate the fact that the authors try a variety of different ablation strategies. However, I am curious to know why the authors think that completely ablating model units (effectively, instant cell death) is the computational principle that matches how, say, focal lesions occur in the brain. In the conclusion, the authors state their simulation is \"biologically inspired\",  but the ablation strategy does not seem to reveal that. (5) The framework, as it is currently set up, misses some nuance associated with modeling brain dysfunction. Dysfunction such as from focal lesions spark a cascade of ischemic processes such as the expansion of the ischemic insult into the surrounding penumbra, plasticity mechanisms, behavioral attention changes, take into account the topographic layout on a systems level, etc. While I don't consider it necessary for the paper to have recapitulated observations around all of these, at least an attempt to think about these as they pertain to dysfunction modeling seems important, and is missing."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the weaknesses section above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "djqmurw6Bp", "forum": "AQhpxQ1xfa", "replyto": "AQhpxQ1xfa", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9475/Reviewer_qoES"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9475/Reviewer_qoES"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9475/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761710196920, "cdate": 1761710196920, "tmdate": 1762921062052, "mdate": 1762921062052, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a framework for simulating dyslexia in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) by identifying and ablating visual-word-form-selective (VWF) units, inspired by the functional role of the human visual word form area (VWFA) in reading.

Without direct mapping between artificial and biological VWFA units, the correspondence remains functional rather than structural or neural, potentially limiting claims about mechanisms and transferability.​\n\n- The clinical profiles of dyslexia captured by the ablated models are more purely phonological than in human subjects, who often display mixed phonological and orthographic impairments. The model’s orthographic capacities are notably resistant to ablation, and the observed deficit distribution is less nuanced than seen in patients, raising questions as to whether this reflects architectural constraints or a misalignment in the simulated lesion procedure. The authors acknowledge this, but propose no practical avenues for resolving it within the current model scope?\n\n- The experimental controls, while thorough, operate entirely within model space. There is no demonstration that the artificial VWFA units share structural, developmental, or topological features with their biological counterpart. For example, are the localized units spatially clustered within the transformer, and do their connectivity patterns resemble cortical circuits?\n\n- Evaluation benchmarks are based on image-word discrimination, general nonverbal reasoning, and sentence comprehension tasks, all adapted from clinical settings. Although valid for cross-domain comparison, the complexity of the clinical phenotype is reduced by focusing only on limited aspects (speed of reading is omitted; real-life reading comprehension and development trajectory are not simulated).

This would strengthen claims of biological realism.\n\n- The phonological deficit induced by ablation is robust, but the orthographic deficit is comparatively minor. Can the lesioning approach be modified to target orthographic processing more effectively, and what does this suggest about the separability of these mechanisms in transformer architectures?\n\n- Are the identified VWF-selective units spatially or functionally clustered within the model, and do they possess unique connectivity profiles? Are there architectural analogues to known properties of the VWFA (position, connectivity) in the cortex that can be drawn from transformer weights or activation maps?\n\n- The current approach is limited to the ablation (silencing) of units. Have the authors considered developmentally inspired interventions, such as training models under restricted input, gradual lesioning, or biased gradient propagation, to better capture the emergence and remediation of dyslexia-like deficits?\n\n- Benchmark choices are justified, but the absence of processing speed (a key diagnostic marker in dyslexia) is notable. Can future work incorporate time-dependent metrics?\n\n- Minor: Visualizations (activation maps via GradCAM, ablated unit distributions) could benefit from more direct comparison to human neuroimaging data or developmental profiles."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "yVOURiOead", "forum": "AQhpxQ1xfa", "replyto": "AQhpxQ1xfa", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9475/Reviewer_63KZ"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9475/Reviewer_63KZ"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9475/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761869022771, "cdate": 1761869022771, "tmdate": 1762921061381, "mdate": 1762921061381, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
