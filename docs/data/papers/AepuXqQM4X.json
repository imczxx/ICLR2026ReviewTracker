The core challenge lies in optimally assigning rich general attributes to 3D primitives while addressing the inconsistency issues from multi-view images. We present a unified, kernel- and feature-agnostic formulation of the feature lifting problem as a sparse linear inverse problem, which can be solved efficiently in closed form. Our approach admits a provable upper bound on the global optimal error under convex losses for delivering high quality lifted features. To address inconsistencies and noise in multi-view observations, we introduce two complementary regularization strategies to stabilize the solution and enhance semantic fidelity. Tikhonov Guidance enforces numerical stability through soft diagonal dominance, while Post-Lifting Aggregation filters noisy inputs via feature clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-vocabulary 3D segmentation benchmarks, outperforming training-based, grouping-based, and heuristic-forward baselines while producing the lifted features in minutes.
