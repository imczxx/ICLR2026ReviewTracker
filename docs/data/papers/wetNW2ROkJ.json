However, those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors (e.g., normal vector), and they might also be unreliably estimated by noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.", "tldr": "We introduce a general geometry-constrained optimization framework for Gaussian splatting, with noise-robust methods presented for geometric estimations.", "keywords": ["Gaussian Splatting", "Geometry", "Novel View Synthesis"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6bdb3ac76a5f113ae483cc2e469675e3d88fb883.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper extends the 3D Gaussian splatting to constraints Gaussian primitives to reside on smooth manifolds (or varifold), leveraging tangent and curvature priors estimated directly from the Gaussian field.

The major concerns includes followings: \n\n**W1.** The method seems to have a possibility that bias the reconstruction toward overly smooth surfaces, which could suppress fine geometric details or high-curvature regions.  \nThis concern is raised from the fact that the paper doesn’t include explicit geometry reconstruction metrics and only photometric ones like PSNR or SSIM are reported. It would be really helpful to convince benefits by showing geometry reconstruction performance on more diverse benchmarks such as **DTU** or **Mip-NeRF 360**, with quantitative metrics like Chamfer Distance or at least some visual ablations that show how the curvature priors affect geometry quality. Also, the experiments are limited to relatively clean indoor scenes (e.g., Replica, ICL-Office), which don’t stress the method’s generality.\n\n**W2**. I'm concerned about the methods vulnerability to SfM initialization. If the initial SfM point cloud is sparse or noisy, the estimated geometric priors (especially the second-order curvatures which are notoriously sensitive to noise) might be unreliable. This could negatively impact all subsequent geometry-constrained steps, from initialization to densification, potentially leading to artifacts or incorrect surface regularization. The paper claims the estimation methods are noise-robust, but their effectiveness on poorly initialized SfM data is not demonstrated."}, "questions": {"value": "I believe this paper raises important questions about geometric regularization in 3DGS and has significant potential. To better understand the method's contributions and limitations, I would like the authors to clearly address the following points:\n\n**Q1.** Have you observed any cases where the curvature-guided regularization oversmooths fine geometric details or sharp edges? What is your perspective on this potential trade-off between smoothness and detail preservation, especially since the quantitative evaluation (W1) focuses on photometric metrics rather than geometric accuracy?\n\n**Q2.** Following W1, have you evaluated GeoSplat on benchmarks with available ground-truth geometry (like DTU, ScanNet) or more complex, unbounded 360-degree scenes (like Mip-NeRF 360)? Providing quantitative geometric metrics (e.g., Chamfer Distance) on such datasets would be highly valuable to substantiate the claims of improved geometry beyond the indoor scenes presented.\n\n**Q3.** Could you provide a more detailed breakdown of the computational overhead? Specifically, what is the additional training time or memory cost incurred by the dynamic geometric estimations and the geometry-constrained optimization steps compared to the vanilla 3DGS baseline?\n\n**Q4.** How sensitive is GeoSplat to the quality of the initial SfM point cloud? Since the framework relies heavily on geometric priors (normals, curvatures) estimated from these points, how does performance degrade if the initial SfM data is sparse or noisy? This seems particularly critical for higher-order curvature estimates, which are often sensitive to noise."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "p0uZAV6kX6", "forum": "wetNW2ROkJ", "replyto": "wetNW2ROkJ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2420/Reviewer_kXse"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2420/Reviewer_kXse"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission2420/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761650695225, "cdate": 1761650695225, "tmdate": 1762916231427, "mdate": 1762916231427, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work improves 3DGS optimization from the prior of geometric theory.
