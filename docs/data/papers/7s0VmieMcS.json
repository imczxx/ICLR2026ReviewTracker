While the main paper introduces $q\\mathcal{L}$ as an extension of $\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\text{quantGNN}}$ from [Sälzer et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16244) to add global aggregation, I personally like the additional connection to $K_♯$ [Nunn et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00205).\n\n- **(S3) Self-Contained**: The paper provides ample explanation and background to follow the dense theoretical setting."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "## W1: Presentation\n\nThe write-up of the paper is poor in grammar and clarity of language, with a few questionable slips, the most apparent being: “**NEXPTIME** is the class of problems decidable by a non-deterministic algorithm running in **polynomial time** in the size of its input,” where the authors clearly meant **exponential**.\n\nThe notation quietly changes after Section 3, where $\\mathrm{agg}\\_{g}$ suddenly becomes $\\mathrm{agg}\\_{\\forall}$ henceforth.\n\nTypesetting is strange, e.g., in lines 210–214, where the definition of the box operators is centered and the diamond operators are defined in line. After these definitions, the next sentence starts with a lower-case “and.”\n\nIn general, Section 3: *Simulating modal logic in $q\\mathcal{L}$* is written in a confusing manner. The authors aim to show that they can re-express any formula with modal operators and connectives as an atomic formula by simulating these operators arithmetically. It is initially unclear why this is done (e.g., to simplify further proofs?).\n\nThe manuscript also uses up a lot of space on examples, but the central aspects---i.e., the ACR-GNN verification task definitions vt1, vt2, vt3, and the reason why these tasks are important in particular---are mentioned only in passing. As they are the central objects of investigation in the manuscript, this priority in levels of detail seems strange.\n\nWhile the examples are helpful to follow the manuscript, they are used a lot, take up a lot of space, are partially a bit more complex than necessary (e.g., the example in lines 190–200), and sometimes replace proper definitions or explanations of concepts---for example, the definition of subexpressions $E(\\phi)$ in Section 4.1.\n\n## W2: Motivation and Experiments\n\nI understand the motivation of the theoretical contribution, as global aggregation is commonly used in GNNs, and the authors do state that all ML models are quantized. \n\nThe experimental evaluation then goes on to demonstrate that quantization does not impact the performance of GNNs a lot. This setup seems largely irrelevant to the theoretical results and seems to undermine the motivation of the authors rather than support it. The experiments act as proof of concept of using quantized ACR GNNs in practice. \nIf the practicality of these models needs to be established, then it is questionable why they should be investigated from a theoretical point of view.\n\nI think the authors could make a much stronger experimental statement by taking (pretrained) state-of-the-art models from existing literature on tasks that the community cares about, and stressing that **because** of similar performance, their quantized surrogates can be verified as a proxy. A study of how much speedup in terms of *verification time* versus the *loss in performance* would then provide more support for the theoretical setup, and could act as a guideline for future research by pointing out the value of verifying strongly compressed surrogate models.\n\n\n## W3: Novelty\n\nWhile the contribution seems to address a gap in existing research, the manuscript (including the structure) seems heavily inspired by [Sälzer et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16244), with adaptations to support global readout. As such, a lot of the submitted manuscript feels like it repeats information and does not focus enough on the novel contribution and motivation of the investigated verification settings.\n\n## W4: Gap in Theoretical Results\n\nThe authors introduce $q\\mathcal{L}$ to formalize the computations of ACR-GNNs, and show by example that any computation of the GNN can be expressed in the logic. However, it seems that a formal statement is missing that proves that the logic and the class of GNNs are, in fact, **equally** expressive."}, "questions": {"value": "Of my listed weaknesses, I would appreciate a brief discussion of the authors to address my concerns in W2 and W4.\n\nIn addition, I have the following question to possibly expand on the contribution in the paper.\n\n- **Q1 Simulation of global readout**: One unexplored aspect of ACR verification is a result of [Jogl et al., 2023](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/ebf95a6f3c575322da15d4fd0fc2b3c8-Paper-Conference.pdf), which proposes simulating, e.g., an ACR-GNN with an AC-GNN without global readout by using a graph transformation on input graphs. As ACR-GNNs can then apparently be simulated from simpler-to-verify GNNs (“only” PSPACE-complete), the question arises why the difference arises, and whether a theoretical connection can be made. Does the translation of the formulas lead to a blowup of size?\n\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- **Sälzer, M., Schwarzentruber, F., & Troquard, N.
