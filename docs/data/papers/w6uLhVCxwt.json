It offers minimal (to no) practical utility for image registration until, possibly, appropriate hardware becomes available in the future. While arguments of theoretical value *can* be useful, the work offers little to suggest QHD for rigid alignment actually has realistic future promise, even in a simulated context.\n\nThe authors' core argument is that by evaluating the loss function at all superpositions at once, the quantum implementation could converge better to global minima than current sensitive optimization approaches, but they provide no experiments to show this. This study requires baseline comparisons of registration accuracy, e.g. to classical gradient descent at the *absolute minimum*. The metrics in Table 1 have no standalone value without comparative statistics. Substantial experimental rigor is necessary to make the work at all convincing.\n\nImage registration is a mature field, with many optimization baseline techniques (beyond simple gradient descent) that offer robust and fast solutions to best-navigate the non-convex loss landscape. Also, it's important to consider that in many cases, global minima do not always correspond to ground truth alignment parameters, especially in complex multimodal scenarios (e.g. that are very common in medical imaging). A major advantage of learning-based registration techniques is that they don't need to rely on possibly misleading evaluation functions at inference. QHD does not offer a solution to this problem.\n\nThe bulk of the paper text reviews quantum computing background and derives the previously established QHD method.

My field is classical optimization and computer vision. Given this, my understanding of the paper is as follows.\n\nThe authors consider the problem of image registration, where we want to find a 2d-to-2d transformation that takes a given template image as close (in some metric) to a given reference image. The set of possible transformations is restricted, e.g., by giving this set explicitly or by a regularizer (i.e., a prior). This in general leads to a non-convex optimization problem. The authors aim to demonstrate that/how this problem can be solved by a method called Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), recently proposed by Lang et al 2023.\n\nQHD is a quantum method for unconstrained continuous optimization, intended to be a quantum counterpart of classical gradient descent (in fact, a whole family of its accelerations, as proposed by Wibisono et al 2016). For a given objective function $f: \\mathbb R^n\\to\\mathbb R$, QHD is instantiated by a time-varying Hamiltonian that is a weighted average of the laplacian (ie, kinetic energy) and potential field (the objective function). The weights change in time so that the kinetic energy gradually diminishes relative to the objective, so that the probability distribution given by the squared wave function gradually concentrates around global optimum.\n\nTo make this aim feasible, the authors consider only rigid transformations, parameterized by 3 real numbers (angle and translation). The challenge is now to instantiate QHD for this task. The Hamitonian is discretized in space, by encoding each of the 3 parameters $x$ (angle, translation) by 8 qubits. This turns the laplacian into a symmetric matrix and the potential into a diagonal matrix (with all the values $f(x)$ on its diagonal). By discretization in time, a recurrent formula is given, approximating the solution of the Schrodinger eqn.\n\nThis is simulated on a classical computer for experimental image pairs, taken form public datasets (outdoor scenes taken by a camera from two different places, medical image pairs). The results reported show that the method always ended up very near the global minimum. The experiments aim only to demonstrate that the method works - using only a few image pairs and not comparing with other registration methods.\n\nBesides this, in section 5 the authors focus on actual possible implementation on a quantum computer. Here, the potential term of the hamiltonian (the objective function) is represented by a phase oracle, whose instantiation is challenging and problem specific. The authors show how thiis can be done (on a gate quantum computer) for images of size 2-by-2 pixels with periodic boundaries. This very small example needs 13 qubits (for any larger images we'd get beyond abilitis of current quantum HW). This curcuit is simulated on a classical computer, showing correct result for the 2-by-2 image pair."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "It shows in detail how a relatively complex computer vision optimization problem can be solved by a quantum computer, though not yet nowadays for realistic image sizes.\nThe technical part and math seems correct to me."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "I do not fully understand what exactly was done and what parts of the paper are novel.\n\nSection 3 is clearly not novel, it is a recap of Schroedinger eqn.\n\nSection 4 is mostly a general recap of a part of the QHD paper (Leng et al 2023), only a small part of the section is specific to the problem at hand.\n\nSection 5 seems to contain most novelty: it proposes an actual implementation of QHD on a quantum computer (though this is not tested on a quantum computer but only simulated classically). However I am confused here: Leng et al 2023 propose to implement QHD on a D-Wave hardware, discretizing the Hamiltonian using a quantum Ising model. But here a universal gate quantum computer is assumed, to my understanding. The reason for this decision is not discussed in the paper.\n\nTo my understanding, to obtain the experimental results on realistic image pairs in Section 6, the (discretized) Schrodinger eqn is solved by simulation on a classical computer. Here, the matrix $\\hat F$, which has on its diagonal all the objective values $f(x)$, is explicitly formed, right?\n\nTo summarize this part, it may be helpful if the authors were more explicit about contributions and novelty. Note, the first of the three contributions stated on lines 88+ is clearly not novel. The second contribution (how to integrate Schroedinger eqn) is also not novel, I believe, as this was already discussed in the QHD paper. So only the third item remains.\n\nNext, I would appreciate some discussion about scalability of the method, on possible quantum hardware in near future. Is there a chance that in a near enough future it will be possible to run the method on quantum HW for realistic image size and wider classes of image transformations (non-rigid ones)? Perhaps, a table with the required numbers of qubits for various cases would be helpful. Currently, the approach may look too far from anything realistic.\n\nMinor remark: if the images have high-frequency texture, the global minimum of the used objective function may not best correspond to ground truth transformation. Then it might be a good idea to smooth the images slightly before comparison, use a coarse-to-fine approach, etc. But this is not critical for this paper, which only aims to prove the concept."}, "questions": {"value": "1) What is the motivation to assume circuit-base quantum computer, as opposed to the quantum Ising model assumed by Leng et al 2023?\nMore generally, compare the approach proposed in Leng et al with your approach.\n\n2) What do you consider the most novel/valuable part of the paper?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 2}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "UCLXGiPkxy", "forum": "w6uLhVCxwt", "replyto": "w6uLhVCxwt", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9315/Reviewer_EDQs"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9315/Reviewer_EDQs"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9315/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762178503139, "cdate": 1762178503139, "tmdate": 1762920948845, "mdate": 1762920948845, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This article proposes to use recently formulated Quantum Hamiltonian Descent to solve the rigid image registration problem.
