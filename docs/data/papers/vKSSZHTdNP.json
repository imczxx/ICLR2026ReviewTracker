We investigate four strategies and their combinations, for linear models, the de facto choice in the small-sample regime: (1) feature selection, (2) coefficient sign constraints, (3) inequality constraints on coefficient magnitudes, and (4) equality constraints across related features. Each restricts the hypothesis class, improving generalization in small sample settings, and corresponds to a natural query for an expert or Large Language Model (LLM) that draws on prior knowledge. We evaluate these approaches on four clinical prediction tasks involving high-dimensional molecular measurements, where labeled datasets are typically limited to small patient cohorts. We find models trained with as few as five patients outperform baselines requiring ten times more patients, with improvements upwards of 20\\% AUC, exceeding human expert–designed models.

Generalization to other domains, assay types, or multi-site settings isn’t established.

What about unlabelled samples? If it is cfRNA, we could have hundreds of thousands of cfRNA profiles without clinical labels. The proposed framework would be significantly more useful and practical if it can use unlabelled data + few labelled samples. \n- The “batch-iness” of omics data is a real challenge and problem for developing any diagnostics model. There are many features (large d) and few samples (small n), so models can easily overfit, even on held-out data from the same set. How would the authors prevent that? I think It would be helpful to see the PCA plots of the data used in training and testing. Moreover, training linear models on the top 10 PCs can be a good baseline.\n- Considering what was discussed in the previous point, I find the lack of meaningful performance improvement from n=5 to 50 in three out of four datasets (all except “Labor”) concerning. What is the reason?\n- What are the top 10 features (by weight magnitude) for the n=5 case across the four datasets? I believe the authors could unpack the features a bit more. How can a model trained with only 5 points predict COVID severity with an AUC of 0.78? How do these top features compare to baseline models?\n- Why are the baseline models outperforming the proposed framework in cfRNA dataset for larger training sizes? I think apart from the need for batch effect correction, another step of feature conditioning/pre-processing needs to be performed, to remove low-variance, low-expression, low-frequency features. \n- Why is correlation used in Figure 3? If $x_i$ is continuous and $y$ is binary, why not report AUC or KS-test p-value? Also, why is `ylim =[0, 5]` for correlation?\n- Why is the “Random Selection” performance (Table 2)  so high (76.1 vs 78.1 for LLM) for COVID?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "xTV1CCPHkU", "forum": "vKSSZHTdNP", "replyto": "vKSSZHTdNP", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23049/Reviewer_vLhj"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23049/Reviewer_vLhj"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission23049/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761878089334, "cdate": 1761878089334, "tmdate": 1762942490780, "mdate": 1762942490780, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors investigate the effectiveness of several LLM-informed regularization strategies for linear models on small-sample, high-dimensional datasets from clinical settings.

In other words, they combine simple rules for constraining the weights with LLM-generated notions of feature importance and relevance.

It combines existing LLM-based feature selection approaches (e.g., LLM-Select) with relatively simple convex constraints (e.g., sign constraints, group-wise regularization) on the model parameters. In that sense, the proposed work reads as a straightforward and incremental extension of prior works in this space.\n- Evaluations are limited to a relatively small number of datasets, with all of them being from the clinical domain. While the small-sample, high-dimensional setting is well-motivated in clinical settings, evaluations on a larger collection of datasets with coverage over other domains would improve the generalizability of findings.\n- In comparisons to human-provided constraints, I think the results should be taken with a grain of salt. I would expect these performances to vary across different experts, due to factors including but not limited to differences in levels of experience, possible subjectivity in determining what feature should be deemed \"important\", etc. While it is an interesting result that LLM-driven constraints can perform on par with when humans are delegated to design the constraints, without additional validation with a greater number of human subjects, I would not go as far as saying \"an LLM can surpass the ability of a domain expert in designing constrained model\".\n- The paper lacks any discussion of possible failure cases for the proposed methods. While I would expect the most capable (often proprietary) LLMs to generally output reasonable constraints, they can always hallucinate and lead to suboptimal performance, especially in domains where the models do not have sufficient parametric knowledge. It would be good to explicitly discuss some of these issues as limitations.\n- The authors mention that the proposed method is robust to prompt variation (in last paragraph of Section 3), but there is no explicit demonstration and/or discussion of how this was tested and how variable the downstream performance was in response to different choices of the prompt. As LLMs are generally highly sensitive to the prompting decisions, this also seems to be an important aspect to touch upon.\n- All of the tables in the main text are quite dense and hard to visually parse; the presentation of results can be improved for better readability."}, "questions": {"value": "- In Table 1, in the \"zero constraint (Z)\" setting, why is it that this approach often performs much better than other LLM-based methods like LLM-Select?
