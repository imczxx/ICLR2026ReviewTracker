Although there is increasing effort in automating the design of routing solvers, existing research has explored only a limited array of VRP variants and fails to adequately address the complex and prevalent constraints encountered in real-world situations. To fill this gap, we propose the Automatic Routing Solver (ARS), which leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents to enhance a backbone metaheuristic framework. ARS automatically generates constraint-aware heuristic code from natural language problem descriptions, enabling the framework to handle a wider range of VRP variants without relying on cumbersome modeling rules. Alongside ARS, we introduce RoutBench, a benchmark comprising 1,000 VRP variants derived from 24 attributes, designed to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of automatic routing solvers in handling VRPs with diverse practical constraints. In our experiments, ARS achieves a success rate of over 90\\% on common VRPs and over 60\\% on RoutBench, outperforming the other seven LLM-based methods by at least 30\\% in success rate. Compared to three general-purpose solvers, the ARS framework not only makes it easier for an LLM to generate correct code, with approximately 25\\% higher correctness, but also achieves superior solving efficiency across many VRP variants.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Vehicle Routing Problem", "Large Language Model", "Automatic Heuristic Design", "Benchmark."], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/117f8eadd7aad6803399241860cca81925782a33.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/8c0f0ca4f51661e426942d2a9656b9c00ae967b5.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents ARS (Automatic Routing Solver), a framework that leverages LLMs to solve real-world VRPs with complex and diverse constraints.

ARS uses Large Language Models to automatically create heuristics and constraint handlers for many real-world routing problems. This makes solver setup fast and easy, helping users adapt to changing or complex requirements without needing expert coding or modeling.​\n2. The RoutBench benchmark covers 1,000 problem variants built from 24 real-world constraints. ARS demonstrates strong generalization and robust performance across this diverse set, including highly constrained and previously untested scenarios.​\n3. On standard VRPs and complex RoutBench problems, ARS achieves much higher success rates and code correctness (over 90% on common tasks, above 60% on tough cases), outperforming both 7 alternative LLM-based approaches and 3 established solvers in efficiency and reliability.​\n4. By generating only the parts of code needed for constraint handling, ARS significantly lowers the amount of generated code required and reduces errors compared to general-purpose modeling frameworks.​\n5. The framework works with various state-of-the-art language models (GPT-4, DeepSeek, LLaMA), showing improved results as model quality increases and supporting scalability for different environments.​"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. While ARS claims to automate solver design with LLMs, the underlying routing backbone relies heavily on conventional metaheuristics (destroy/repair, 2-OPT, SWAP, SHIFT), offering little methodological advancement over established VRP solvers. The core innovation is largely in combining existing components rather than proposing fundamentally new search or optimization strategies.​\n\n2. The framework delegates constraint handling and validation almost entirely to LLM agents, making solution accuracy and feasibility highly dependent on the ability of language models to interpret and synthesize correct code from often ambiguous or poorly-specified natural language descriptions. This introduces significant risk in reliability, especially as constraints grow complex or nuanced beyond the LLM’s training distribution.​\n\n3. The paper fails to seriously investigate the risk of hallucination, syntax errors, and subtle bugs common in LLM-generated code. Runtime error rates are measured, but no robust fail-safe is proposed for erroneous validation or constraint logic. This potentially impacting real-world deployment.​\n\n4. The backbone search algorithm is fixed and non-adaptive, restricting ARS to a single solution-generation paradigm. This limits potential improvements from modern neural combinatorial optimization, hybrid strategies, or domain-specific deep learning advances that could outperform classic heuristics, especially for harder VRP variants and scalability.​\n\n5. RoutBench is much richer than previous benchmarks but is entirely built from synthetic combinations of constraint types with fixed datasets and rules. Real-world VRPs often include messy, dynamic, multi-modal data, and less formalized or evolving constraints. These are not examined, and thus claims about real-world generalization are partly unproven.​\n\n6. The approach shows success up to 200-node problems, but does not evaluate extreme scalability to industrial-size problems (thousands of locations, live routing updates), nor does it rigorously compare wall-time performance to state-of-the-art solvers like HGS or commercial systems in diverse operational contexts.​\n\n7. ARS focuses on constraints expressible in the current framework and retrievable from its database. Constraints that require joint probabilistic modeling, dynamic uncertainties, learning-based preference handling, or integration with external platforms are out of scope.​\n\n8. Automated code generation for optimization raises serious issues in operational safety, security, and fairness that are only mentioned briefly. There is no systematic audit or mitigation for risks of unintended or adversarial LLM outputs, data leakage, or regulatory compliance.​\n\n9. While the paper claims extensibility to other domains (e.g., bin packing), there is no empirical evidence or adaptation strategies for handling fundamentally different combinatorial problems, which limits generality."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Considering that the proposed framework relies on LLMs to generate constraint-checking code from natural language problem descriptions, how the authors guarantee correctness, robustness, and safety of the generated code? This is more important in the presence of ambiguous, under-specified, or adversarial input. What evidence can the authors provide that ARS would not silently accept incorrect solutions or propagate bugs to mission-critical logistics environments?​\n\n2. The proposed benchmark (RoutBench) is well-constructed but fully synthetic. How does ARS handle the noisy, unstructured, and evolving constraint types found in real operational datasets, such as time-varying networks, legal constraints, or incomplete business rules? Can authors demonstrate successful generalization or present negative results for deployment in high-stakes, dynamic, real-world logistics problems?​\n\n3. While the authors claim that ARS can be extended to other combinatorial domains (bin packing, job-shop scheduling, etc.), the experiments are strictly for VRPs.

The introduction of RoutBench is a major contribution in its own right. It provides a large-scale, diverse, and well-structured testbed for evaluating the generalization capabilities of VRP solvers, which has been lacking in the field.\n\n3.

While the paper proposes the ARS framework, its originality is limited. The framework's RAG component utilizes existing technology, the \"checker\" and \"scorer\" steps are based on established ideas from heuristic VRP solvers, and the subsequent heuristic algorithm is also a pre-existing method. Overall, the lack of substantial novel content is the paper's most significant weakness.\n\n2. The paper relies on a single-point-based search framework. It is unclear how the LLM-generated Constraint-Aware Heuristic (CAH) would perform when integrated with other powerful metaheuristic backbones, such as population-based genetic algorithms or ant colony optimization.\n\n3.
