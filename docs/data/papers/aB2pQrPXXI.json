In this paper, we explore the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile, weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-v1.5 achieves comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular vision-language benchmarks with only 25% vision tokens of baseline.

Experiments on the LLaVA-1.5-7B backbone across eight popular vision-language benchmarks validate the approach, showing that with only 25% of the original vision tokens, the proposed method achieves comparable or improved performance versus the full-token baseline and several state-of-the-art efficient LMMs."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Principled Dual-Stage Compression: The architecture integrates MBTF for multi-granularity feature fusion, followed by STF for spatially adaptive reduction, as clearly illustrated in Figure 2 and specified in detail with Table 1. This strategy is logical and well-justified by the observed redundancy in vision tokens."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "## **1. Missing Coverage of Directly Related Recent Work**\nA substantial body of recent, directly relevant work on token compression, adaptive visual tokenization, and information steering in multimodal models is omitted from both the related work (Section 2) and experimental comparisons:\nNotable works missing include [Cheng et al., 2024] (survey), [Zhang et al., 2024] (MMTok, SEED, Multi-Stage Vision Token Dropping, ElasticTok), [Zhang et al., 2024] (VoCo-LLaMA), [Li et al., 2025] (Hidden Life of Tokens), etc.\nThe discussion focuses primarily on token pruning and merging from existing efficient LLaVA variants, but does not adequately position this method with respect to the broader, very recent multimodal token compression literature (see Potentially Missing Related Work section below for specific papers and integration suggestions). This oversight undermines both the novelty claims and the work's perceived significance and must be addressed for publication.\n\n## **2. Limited Theoretical Justification for \"Lossless\" Claim**\nThe paper repeatedly claims \"lossless\" token reduction when $k=2$, based on token/channel dimension matching (Section 3.4). However, the rationale lacks rigorous theoretical support or formal information-theoretic analysis. The claim is based on the matching of hidden sizes, rather than provable metrics regarding preserved semantic content. For instance, Eqn (in Section 3.4) specifies the process, but does not analyze information bottleneck, nor the risk of over-/underfitting due to arbitrarily increasing channels. This may mislead readers regarding the true trade-off between compactness and fidelity.\n\n## **3. Empirical Evidence not Comprehensive Enough**\nWhile Table 2 presents an extensive comparison on eight benchmarks, direct experimental contrasts with many distinct token reduction strategies (e.g., methods selected from the missing related work above) are absent. The ablations (Tables 3–5) primarily compare in-house baselines (MBTF, STF, simple pooling), while more rigorous comparison to recent learning-free or adaptive tokenization methods would strengthen the empirical evidence. In the absence of such, it remains unclear if the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art across scenarios.\n\n## **4. Component and Parameter Clarity Limitations**\nThe mathematical specification and parameterization of the fusion kernels and projection modules are described, but details on their initialization, regularization, and design choices (e.g., GeLU activations, precise effect of kernel stride/sizes in practice) are somewhat sparse. For instance, in Table 1 and Section 3.4, a rationale for channel size progression, and potential overfitting in larger-k models (mentioned in Section 4.3.2) is offered, but more systematic analysis or regularization ablation would improve transparency.\n\n## **5. Unclear Generalization Across Modalities/Backbones**\nThe method is tested only on LLaVA-1.5-7B (with CLIP-ViT and Vicuna-1.5-7B). There is no demonstration of cross-backbone generality or performance on models using different visual architectures or non-Vicuna LLMs—limiting the generalizability of the claims. Additionally, experiments mostly cover high-level vision-language reasoning and VQA; more fine-grained domains (e.g., visual grounding or image captioning) are not evaluated, which would clarify the trade-off between compression and task specificity.\n\n## **6. Ablation Study Depth**\nThe ablations, while illuminating, would be stronger if (i) out-of-distribution robustness (e.g., to images substantially different from training data) were reported, (ii) FLOP/token reductions were systematically related to accuracy for a broader set of $k/E$ values, and (iii) an explicit analysis of failure cases under aggressive token compression was included.\n\n## **7. Ambiguity in Performance Claims for STF vs. MBTF**\nTable 3 suggests MBTF alone slightly outperforms the combined STF+MBTF approach in outright accuracy, yet this is brushed aside as a trade-off for efficiency. More nuanced discussion of why the combination does not enhance average accuracy, and scenarios where one should be prioritized over the other, would enhance scientific rigor.\n\n## **8. Minor Typographical and Expositional Issues**\nThere are instances of unclear phrasing and notation, e.g., \"stride of 2, and only $25 %$ tokens are remained\" (Page 1), or ambiguous variable definitions in some formulae—these do not prohibit comprehension, but do reduce polish.\n\n## **9. Assumption of Vision Encoder Freezing**\nThe method relies on a frozen vision encoder throughout training (Section 3.5, 4.1.3). It is unclear whether similar efficiency/performance gains would be possible if joint tuning with visual features occurred. This assumption may limit applicability in scenarios where full model finetuning is desired.\n\n## **10. Code release**\nThe authors claim that they will release the code in the future. However, I think the code is available to reviewers during this stage, and authors are suggested to upload the source code as the supplementary material."}, "questions": {"value": "Please see the weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "3Zhc7xG4HV", "forum": "aB2pQrPXXI", "replyto": "aB2pQrPXXI", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10553/Reviewer_Gjz5"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10553/Reviewer_Gjz5"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10553/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761538042529, "cdate": 1761538042529, "tmdate": 1762921829931, "mdate": 1762921829931, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a two-stage projector for large multimodal models (LMMs) that reduces the number of vision tokens fed to the large language model (LLM) while preserving task performance.
