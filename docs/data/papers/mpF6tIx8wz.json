Recently, unsupervised learning methods combined with generative models have shown promising prospects in this field, especially the application of multi-resolution technology in anomaly detection has achieved certain results. However, existing models usually ignore the correlations among different features in time series data and the rich multi-resolutional knowledge contained in the original data. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new Model, \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{G}uided \\textbf{R}econstruction \\textbf{D}iffusion Model (GGRD). GGRD is an end-to-end unsupervised anomaly detection model based on reconstruction. It adopts overlapping sliding Windows to sample multi-resolution data and integrates the similarity prior in the data into the \\textbf{G}raph-\\textbf{G}uided \\textbf{A}ttention (GGA) mechanism, thereby effectively dealing with complex characteristics such as non-stationarity and cross-variable correlations of time series. The experimental results show that GGRD significantly outperforms the existing methods on multiple real datasets.

This issue starts in the *Introduction* and permeates the whole paper. In the *Methods* section, the presentation reads like a collection of disconnected subsections rather than a logically flowing design—readers are left uncertain how components interact and why each one is required.\n\n2. **Limited novelty — component stacking.**\n   The proposed pipeline largely consists of assembling existing components (multi-resolution decomposition, timestamp/hard embeddings, and similarity-graph construction [1-3]) without introducing fundamentally new algorithmic ideas. Worse, these components are treated almost independently and run in parallel, which weakens the claim of a unified, principled method.\n\n3. **Problematic use of a “diffusion” framework.**\n   The paper claims to be diffusion-based but abandons the core iterative SDE/ODE denoising paradigm by asserting one-step reconstruction from a noised sequence to a real sample. While such a shortcut may be used during training [4], the literature and theory suggest that iterative denoising is required at test time to obtain good reconstructions—especially when starting from high-noise or near-pure-noise states. The current presentation glosses over this mismatch between training and inference, undermining the validity of calling the method a diffusion framework.\n\n4. **Scalability and computational cost of graph-guided design.**\n   The similarity-guided graph construction appears to rely on small patch sizes for good performance (see Appendix Fig. 7). Small patches imply many graph nodes as sequence length grows, causing an increase in computation and memory. Given convergence and complexity concerns, I am not convinced this design is a generally viable optimization for long-term time series.\n\n5. **Experimental issues and insufficient analysis.**\n   (a) The use of point-adjusted F1 (F1-PA) is problematic because F1-PA can be inflated by trivial strategies and is regarded by parts of the community as an overly permissive metric. Relying on F1-PA without complementary, stricter evaluation undermines the experimental claims.\n   (b) The “Visualization of Similarity-guided Graph Tensor” is not well motivated—it is unclear what this visualization is intended to demonstrate and whether the similarity tensor itself is learnable or fixed. Such analysis would be better placed in the motivation or method section, accompanied by a discussion of what the observed patterns imply for detection behavior.\n\n6. **Writing quality.**\n   The manuscript contains multiple grammatical and typographical errors throughout. The paper would benefit from a careful language and copy edit to improve clarity.\n\n**Reference:**  \n[1] Zhong, Guojin, et al. \"Multi-resolution decomposable diffusion model for non-stationary time series anomaly detection.\" The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations. 2025.  \n[2] Wang, Chengsen, et al. \"Drift doesn't matter: Dynamic decomposition with diffusion reconstruction for unstable multivariate time series anomaly detection.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 36 (2023): 10758-10774.  \n[3] Shen, Lifeng, Weiyu Chen, and James Kwok. \"Multi-resolution diffusion models for time series forecasting.\" The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations. 2024.  \n[4] Yuan, Xinyu, and Yan Qiao. \"Diffusion-TS: Interpretable Diffusion for General Time Series Generation.\" The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations."}, "questions": {"value": "See the Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "8pwuC8bUSY", "forum": "mpF6tIx8wz", "replyto": "mpF6tIx8wz", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19570/Reviewer_r8wz"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19570/Reviewer_r8wz"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19570/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1760770060915, "cdate": 1760770060915, "tmdate": 1762931448464, "mdate": 1762931448464, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a Graph-Guided Reconstruction Diffusion Model (GGRD) for multivariate time series anomaly detection.
