In exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL), this challenge is amplified because past data cannot be stored, making representation drift for old classes particularly harmful. Prototype-based EFCIL is attractive for its efficiency, yet prototypes drift as the embedding space evolves; thus, projection-based drift compensation has become a popular remedy. We show, however, that existing one-directional projections introduce systematic bias: they either retroactively distort the current feature geometry or align past classes only locally, leaving cycle inconsistencies that accumulate across tasks. We introduce bidirectional projector alignment during training: two maps, old$\\to$new and new$\\to$old, are trained during each new task with stop-gradient gating and a cycle-consistency objective so that transport and representation co-evolve. Analytically, we prove that the cycle loss contracts the singular spectrum toward unity in whitened space and that improved transport of class means/covariances yields smaller perturbations of classification log-odds, preserving old-class decisions and directly mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, across standard EFCIL benchmarks, our method achieves unprecedented reductions in forgetting while maintaining very high accuracy on new tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["continual learning", "exemplar free", "exemplar free class incremental learning", "class incremental learning", "exemplar-free"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/169d0ba84fcc058787f83362ed0b5e1d1fb00cdb.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper studies exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) and claims that one-directional projection of class prototypes from old to new embedding space introduces systematic bias that accumulates over tasks.

The selected methods in the comparative studies are a bit old. The most up-to-date methods in the comparison are published in 2024.

This version does not indicate what architecture of the adapter and distiller is used to provide the performance of the comparative studies. Also, from Table 5, it can be witnessed that a performance drop occurs when using achitecture other than MLP. However, from the Appendix A.10, for a ResNet-18 whose output dimension is 512, the parameters of the MLP itself is $512\\times 512\\times 32 \\times 2 \\approx 16.78M$, which is much more larger than the  linear $512\\times 512 \\times 2 \\approx 0.52M$ and even the backbone ResNet-18 (11.69M). As such, does the performance of this method only benefit from more parameters? Also, what will happen if a smaller MLP is used? It is not reasonable that a adapter can be larger than the backbone. \n3. The effect of different $\\lambda_{\\text{bi}}$ and $\\lambda_{\\text{cyc}}$ is not studied.\n4. Lack of results under the setting of training from half. Since another pipeline of EFCIL is training from half, it is interesting to validate the proposed method under that setting.\n5.

Appendix B.4: Intuitive view and analysis of bidirectional cycle consistency.** We provide an intuitive explanation and spectral analysis of the bidirectional maps $(A, D)$ and the stop-gradient cycle loss, clarifying how they act as near-isometries between feature spaces and why this reduces long-term transport bias and prototype distortion.\n\n**5. Appendix B.5: On AdaGauss, full-covariance prototypes, and robustness.** We clarify how AdaGauss models each class with a full-covariance Gaussian and uses a Cholesky-based anti-collapse loss, why dimensionality reduction (512→64) is necessary to make such modeling numerically feasible in exemplar-free CIL, and why this alone is still insufficient—motivating our robust variant that enforces SPD, uses shrinkage and jitter, and falls back to diagonal/eigenvalue-floored covariances when needed.\n\n**6. Appendix B.6: Parameter and computational overhead.** We detail parameter counts and computational cost for the backbone plus projector(s) in the 64-dimensional setting, demonstrating that the bidirectional variant adds only a small overhead relative to AdaGauss while keeping the backbone, training schedule, and feature dimensionality identical across methods.\n\n**7. Appendix B.7: Sensitivity to new hyperparameters.** We report a sensitivity study over the main hyperparameters $(\\lambda_{\\text{bi}}, \\lambda_{\\text{cyc}}, \\alpha)$ on CIFAR-100, showing that our method consistently outperforms one-directional baselines across a reasonably wide range of values and does not rely on aggressive hyperparameter tuning.\n\n**8.
