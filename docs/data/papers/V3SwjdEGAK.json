However, despite its power, the standard attention mechanism is plagued by well-documented issues---representational collapse and attention sink. While existing work has proposed solutions for these problems, they are typically addressed in isolation, lacking a unified analysis of the root cause or a comprehensive solution for both problems.\nIn this paper, we present a unified perspective, arguing that these seemingly disparate issues stem from a single underlying phenomenon: improper attention distribution. We identify two failure modes: 1) Attention Overload, where tokens receive comparable high weights, blurring semantic features that lead to representational collapse; 2) Attention Underload, where no token is semantically relevant, yet attention is still forced to distribute, resulting in spurious focus such as attention sink. Building on this insight, we introduce Lazy Attention, a novel mechanism designed for a more focused attention distribution. To mitigate overload, it employs positional discrimination across both heads and dimensions to sharpen token distinctions. To counteract underload, it incorporates Elastic-Softmax, a modified normalization function that relaxes the standard softmax constraint to suppress attention on irrelevant tokens. Experiments demonstrate that Lazy Attention resolves attention sink and achieves competitive performance compared to both standard attention and modern architectures, while reaching up to 59.58\\% attention sparsity.", "tldr": "We introduce Lazy Attention, which combines head/dimension-wise positional discrimination with Elastic-Softmax to reduce attention overload and underload, producing more focused attention.", "keywords": ["large language models", "self-attention", "attention sink", "representational collapse", "positional discrimination", "elastic-softmax"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c45acfd2623b940c8264df878b8929d72545e3fd.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/cfd45a0eb04e5fde4f378e3c2215a38eed2d9f1a.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper identifies two fundamental failure modes in the standard Transformer self-attention mechanism: Attention Overload (attention is spread too broadly, blurring semantic features and causing representational collapse) and Attention Underload (attention is forced onto irrelevant tokens like \"attention sinks\" due to softmax's normalization constraint).\n\nTo address both issues within a unified framework, the authors propose Lazy Attention, which consists of two key components:\n\n**Positional Discrimination**: A hybrid positional encoding combining RoPE with learnable, head-specific attention biases to sharpen token distinctions and alleviate overload.\n\n**Elastic-Softmax**: A modified normalization that subtracts a learnable, head-specific offset before applying a ReLU, allowing the model to assign zero attention to irrelevant tokens and mitigate underload."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "**Unified Perspective**: The paper proposes a unified theoretical framework that connects two seemingly disparate problems (representational collapse and attention sink) to a single root cause: improper attention allocation. \n\n**Comprehensive Evaluation**: The method is rigorously tested against a wide array of strong baselines, including Transformer variants, recurrent architectures (Mamba2, RetNet), and streaming inference methods, across multiple model scales and nine diverse benchmarks.\n\n**Compatibility**: The authors explicitly address and ensure the method's compatibility with optimized kernels like FlashAttention, a crucial point for real-world adoption."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Limited Scale of Models**: The largest model scale tested is 760M parameters.

In Line 254, the notations \"d\" and \"D\" are not explicitly defined. \n\n3. Formula 4 introduces a learnable attention bias term b^(h)_{|i-j|}, which is a head-specific bias dependent on the relative distance |i-j| between tokens. The paper does not discuss the potential memory overhead of this bias: for each attention head, a bias value needs to be stored for every possible relative distance (up to the maximum sequence length, e.g., 4096 in experiments). As the sequence length increases, the number of bias parameters grows linearly with the sequence length, which may significantly increase memory consumption, especially for long-context models. Additionally, the paper does not evaluate whether this distance-dependent learnable bias affects the model’s extrapolation ability—whether the bias learned for short sequences can generalize to longer sequences remains unaddressed.\n\n4. The results in Table 1 show an inconsistent pattern between WikiText perplexity (ppl) and LAMBADA (LMB) ppl for the proposed Lazy Attention, which raises doubts about its effectiveness. For the 340M parameter model, Lazy Attention achieves a WikiText ppl of 25.32, but its LMB ppl is 31.84, which is worse than baselines. The paper does not explain this inconsistency.\n\n5. There are inconsistencies in the notation of the Elastic-Softmax offset. In Formula 4 (Section 4.1), the paper uses the notation $\\tau_0^h$ for the offset, while in Table 2, the notation is written as $\\tau_h^0$. It is not clarified whether these are two distinct notations for the same parameter. Furthermore, Formula 4 implies that the default initial value of $\\tau_0^h$ is 0, but Table 2 shows that the variant with $\\tau_0^h$ = 1 achieves better performance.\n\n6. Figure 6 compares the perplexity of different models across varying sequence lengthsfor length extrapolation, but the superiority/inferiority of Lazy Attention relative to baselines is inconsistent between subfigure (a) and subfigure (b). \n\n7. In, Formula 5, Elastic-Softmax relaxes the softmax constraint that attention weights sum to 1. The paper does not address the potential training instability caused by non-normalized attention weights: if the sum of attention weights is too large, it may amplify the impact of noisy tokens; if the sum is too small (e.g., most weights are suppressed to 0, leading to a sum close to 0), the model may fail to capture sufficient contextual information. The paper does not report whether such sum deviations occur during training.\n\n8.
