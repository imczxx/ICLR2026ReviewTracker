Global AIS trajectories are inherently irregular and noisy, spanning intercontinental routes as well as fine-grained near-port maneuvers, and are constrained by coastlines, shipping lanes, and regulations. These characteristics not only complicate trajectory prediction but also generalize to other irregular spatio-temporal domains such as urban mobility and autonomous navigation. Moreover, maritime applications involve diverse downstream tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and route planning, where training separate task-specific models is computationally costly and undermines scalability. This motivates the development of a foundation-level generative framework that can unify irregular sequence modeling across tasks. We propose GeoDiffusion, a diffusion-based foundation model for maritime trajectory modeling. GeoDiffusion introduces three core components: a Spatio-Temporal Offset Encoding (STOE) to robustly capture irregular sampling and missing data, a Transformer-based denoising network to learn both global and local dynamics, and a training-free conditional inference strategy that enforces geo-temporal consistency and unifies multiple tasks within a single pretrained model. Experiments on large-scale global AIS datasets demonstrate that GeoDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across trajectory prediction, imputation, and planning, while generalizing robustly to unseen distributions. These results highlight GeoDiffusion as both a practical solution for maritime mobility and a blueprint for irregular spatio-temporal foundation models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["foundation model; diffusion model;irregular spatio-temporal modeling"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c02292c2ee6d290d96252e0e58d11f048dbd592c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/6c88ba7c4dc82b77d09a0ee0ab91a2333b1477f1.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a foundation model based on diffusion, named GeoDiffusion, for spatio-temporal sequence modeling in the context of maritime mobility. The model aims to unify three distinct tasks—trajectory prediction, imputation, and route planning—within a single framework. To address the challenges of irregular sampling and missing data inherent in maritime trajectories , the authors introduce a Spatio-Temporal Offset Encoding (STOE) mechanism designed to capture irregular temporal intervals and spatial distances. Furthermore, the model utilizes a Transformer-based denoising network, leveraging self-attention to model the multi-scale dynamics of vessel movements, encompassing both global coarse-grained routes and local fine-grained maneuvers. The unification of diverse tasks is achieved through a training-free conditional inference strategy. The authors conduct extensive experiments across three datasets on all three tasks, reporting that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance under various experimental settings."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- The paper is well-written and logically structured. The authors clearly articulate the primary challenges associated with modeling irregular spatio-temporal trajectories, such as data sparsity, multi-scale dynamics, and diverse downstream requirements. The proposed solutions are methodically mapped to these challenges, making the paper easy to follow and understand.\n\n- A key strength of this work lies in its conceptual novelty of framing trajectory prediction, imputation, and route planning as unified generative tasks. By leveraging a diffusion-based generative backbone, the paper successfully proposes a single foundation model that consolidates these diverse objectives , moving beyond the common paradigm of training separate task-specific models. The extensive experimental results confirm that this unified approach is not only novel but also highly effective.\n\n- The introduction of the Spatio-Temporal Offset Encoding (STOE) mechanism is a notable methodological contribution. This component is designed to explicitly address the fundamental problem of irregular sampling and missing observations in spatio-temporal data.\n\n- The paper effectively integrates a conditional diffusion framework to achieve controllable generation, which is crucial for tasks like route planning. By incorporating conditional information, such as departure and destination regions, as control tokens via cross-attention mechanisms, the model can guide the denoising process to produce trajectories that adhere to specified high-level constraints, aligning with the practical needs of maritime applications.\n\n- The development of a training-free inference strategy for trajectory prediction and imputation is a significant practical advantage of this framework. This enhances the model's efficiency and scalability as a true foundation model."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The description of the Spatio-Temporal Offset Encoding (STOE) lacks the critical implementation detail for the spatial difference term, $\\Delta g_i$ . The authors state its goal is to \"capture the true spatial structure\" but do not define the calculation method. This ambiguity makes the STOE component non-reproducible. The ablation study shows the module is beneficial, but it is impossible to know if this gain comes from the novel spatial component or just the temporal encoding.\n\n- The paper claims that a Transformer-based network solves the challenge of modeling multi-scale dynamics (global routes vs. local maneuvers) . This claim is unsubstantiated. The justification provided is merely a standard definition of self-attention, not a novel solution or a comparison against other architectures (e.g., U-Net). The evaluations also lack targeted experiments to prove the model's superior performance on this specific multi-scale challenge.\n\n- The paper's validation of geo-temporal and physical constraints is insufficient. A key \"Trajectory Constraints\" mechanism is cited in the ablation study  as critical for stability, yet this mechanism is never defined in the methodology section. Furthermore, model control is only evaluated via similarity metrics (POR, Jaccard) , not by its adherence to hard constraints (e.g., passing a specific intermediate waypoint), making the robustness of the controlled generation difficult to assess.\n\n- The manuscript contains critical ambiguities that hinder reproducibility. There is a contradiction between the described inference method for imputation (prefix-based, \"first L tokens\") and the actual experimental setup (\"randomly missing days\"). It is unclear how the described method handles a random-masking scenario. Additionally, key symbols like $N$ and $l$ have conflicting definitions between the methodology (Section 4.1) and the experimental setup (Section 5.1)."}, "questions": {"value": "- To improve clarity, it would be beneficial if the authors could more precisely define the problem setup for each of the three downstream tasks. Could the authors explicitly detail the exact inputs, outputs, and conditioning mechanisms for prediction, imputation, and route planning? For instance, please clarify what constitutes the \"condition\" and the \"clean part\" (i.e., the frozen latents) for each distinct task during the diffusion process.\n\n- There appear to be some notational inconsistencies and undefined terms that could be clarified for the reader. For example, the symbol $N$ seems to represent a variable input length in Section 4.1 but a fixed task length in Section 5.1. Could the authors resolve this ambiguity? Similarly, the paper states BART maps variable $N$ tokens to a fixed $l$ , but the mechanism for this is not detailed. A brief explanation would be helpful. Finally, the \"Grid-based Trajectory Representation\" is central to the method. Could the authors please specify the \"spatial discretization function\" used and explain how \"grid cell IDs\" are assigned to \"preserve local spatial structure\"?\n\n- In the description of the STOE module (Section 4.1), there appears to be a minor notational mismatch. The offset vector $\\Delta x$ is defined as $[\\Delta s_1; \\dots; \\Delta s_N]$ (implying $N$ elements), but its dimension is given as $\\mathbb{R}^{(N-1)\\times2}$ . Could the authors please check and correct this potential inconsistency?\n\n- A key component of the STOE module, the spatial difference term $\\Delta g_i$ , is not fully defined. To aid reproducibility, could the authors elaborate on how this term is calculated (e.g., Euclidean distance between grid centers, a learned embedding distance, etc.)? Without this detail, it is difficult to fully assess its contribution. The ablation study (Table 4) effectively shows the STOE module is beneficial, but clarifying the $\\Delta g_i$ calculation would help disentangle the specific contributions of the spatial component from the temporal offset component.\n\n- The paper highlights multi-scale modeling as a key challenge and proposes the Transformer's self-attention as the solution. While intuitive, this justification relies on the standard definition of self-attention. Could the authors elaborate on why this standard mechanism is particularly well-suited for maritime multi-scale dynamics, or perhaps discuss if any architectural modifications were made to enhance this capability, beyond just using a standard Transformer?\n\n- Following the previous point, the experimental validation for multi-scale modeling could be strengthened. The current metrics (POR, Jaccard) are generic. Would it be possible for the authors to include a more targeted analysis or experiment (perhaps a qualitative one, or on a specific subset of data) to directly demonstrate the model's superior handling of trajectories that involve both long-range travel and complex near-port maneuvers, as this is a core claim of the paper?\n\n- The concept of conditional control could be specified further. The conditional token $c$ is defined for \"departure port or destination region\", but its application to prediction and imputation tasks is less clear. Furthermore, the evaluation of control is based on similarity to a ground truth (Table 3). To make the claim of 'control' more robust, could the authors comment on, or perhaps add a simple experiment to assess, the model's ability to adhere to hard constraints (e.g., forcing a trajectory to pass through a specific intermediate region)?\n\n- The rationale for using Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) was slightly unclear, given that all evaluated downstream tasks are conditional. Could the authors elaborate on the role of the \"unconditional task\" ( $\\mu_{\\phi}(z_t, t, \\emptyset)$ )? Specifically, how is this unconditional prediction leveraged during sampling for the three conditional tasks evaluated in the paper?\n\n- There seems to be an apparent discrepancy between the methodology and experimental setup for imputation. The methodology (Section 5.1) describes a prefix-based setup (\"first L tokens are observed\"), which fits prediction, but the imputation experiments (Table 2) mention \"randomly missing days\". Could the authors please clarify how the described prefix-based inference method is adapted to this non-contiguous, random-masking scenario? Additionally, the ablation study (Table 4) mentions a \"trajectory constraint\" mechanism. Could the authors define this mechanism in the main text, as it seems crucial for ensuring the physical continuity of generated segments?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "jnUTipaDFU", "forum": "w7xpNeFIbb", "replyto": "w7xpNeFIbb", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6611/Reviewer_RiZC"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6611/Reviewer_RiZC"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6611/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761211643811, "cdate": 1761211643811, "tmdate": 1762918932191, "mdate": 1762918932191, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents GeoDiffusion, a diffusion-based foundation model for maritime trajectory modeling under irregular and noisy spatio-temporal conditions.
