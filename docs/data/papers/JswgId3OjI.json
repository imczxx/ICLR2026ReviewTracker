However, training them to succeed on **long-horizon, domain-specialized** tasks remains challenging. Current approaches either rely on dense human annotations through behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for tasks that cost days/months, or on outcome-driven sampling, which often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks.\nWe introduce ARGO, a sampling framework that integrates **asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering**. Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, ARGO allows them to intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, for example, by providing prior knowledge, or strategic advice. This lightweight, high-level oversight produces valuable trajectories at lower cost. ARGO then applies supervision control to filter out sub-optimal action, stabilizing optimization, and preventing error propagation. Together, these components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon environments.\n To demonstrate the effectiveness of ARGO, we evaluate it using InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5 model on InnovatorBench, ARGO achieves more than a 50\\% improvement over the untrained baseline and a 28\\% improvement over a variant trained without human interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop sampling and the robustness of ARGO’s design in handling long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks.", "tldr": "A agent trajectory rollout strategy to dealing with real hard and time consuming tasks", "keywords": ["code agents", "research agent", "sft", "human-agent interaction"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/35bbc0819de1c95b3f53372a9cf42dac16e8557f.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents ARGO (Asynchronous Rollout with Human Guidance for Research Agent Optimization), a framework aimed at improving long-horizon LLM agent training.
