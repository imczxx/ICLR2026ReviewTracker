Alignment methods aim to modify these models to ensure they generate only non-harmful images, even when exposed to unsafe prompts. A typical text-to-image model comprises two main components: 1) a text encoder and 2) a diffusion module. Existing alignment methods mainly focus on modifying the diffusion module to prevent harmful image generation. However, this often significantly impacts the model’s behavior for safe prompts, causing substantial quality degradation of generated images. In this work, we propose SafeText, a novel alignment method that fine-tunes the text encoder rather than the diffusion module. By adjusting the text encoder, SafeText significantly alters the embedding vectors for unsafe prompts, while minimally affecting those for safe prompts. As a result, the diffusion module generates non-harmful images for unsafe prompts while preserving the quality of images for safe prompts. We evaluate SafeText on multiple datasets of safe and unsafe prompts, including those generated through  jailbreak attacks. Our results show that SafeText effectively prevents harmful image generation with minor impact on the  images for safe prompts, and SafeText outperforms six existing alignment methods.

The approach is effective at preventing harmful image generation while preserving image quality for safe prompts. Overall, I enjoyed reading this paper. It is very well written, and the theoretical sections are clearly explained.\n\nMy main concerns are in the following.\n\n1. Unclear text encoder\n\nWhile the authors highlight optimizing the text encoder as the main distinction from prior work and a key contribution, the optimization formulation itself seems rather standard. What I find particularly confusing is that the paper never specifies which text encoders are used in the experiments. For instance, SDXL employs two distinct text encoders, and it remains unclear whether the proposed method works equally well for both, or if there are differences in their behavior and effectiveness.\n\n2. Potential vulnerability to more advanced attacks\n\nThe optimization framework assumes that unsafe and safe prompts are clearly distinguishable. This allows the optimization to increase the distance between unsafe prompts and their embeddings, thereby reducing their utility, while maintaining the utility for safe prompts. However, as jailbreak techniques evolve, adversarial prompts may become more sophisticated and semantically ambiguous. This could cause the optimization process to inadvertently penalize safe prompts, leading to degraded performance on benign inputs. I wonder how the authors think about this issue. At what point does the proposed method fail when the distinction between unsafe and safe prompts becomes blurred?\n\n3. Choice of hyperparameters\n\nThe ablation study reveals a critical trade-off between NRR and LPIPS depending on the number of training epochs. While more epochs improve safety, they degrade image quality. This raises concerns about the practicality of the proposed method, as finding the optimal balance may require careful and potentially expensive model-specific hyperparameter tuning.\n\n4. Cost analysis\n\nThe paper provides a comprehensive comparison in terms of safety and utility but omits an analysis of computational efficiency. A discussion of training time, parameter overhead, and inference costs compared to the baselines would be beneficial for assessing the practicality of SafeText for real-world deployment.\n\nMinor: In Table 3, several model abbreviations are used directly, but it is unclear what specific models they refer to. In addition, it is not specified which text encoders are used for these different models, which makes it difficult to interpret the performance differences across them.\n\nOverall, I believe it does not yet meet the standard for acceptance in its current form."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "s0yPfB4OHR", "forum": "tkwKLgCSmW", "replyto": "tkwKLgCSmW", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6286/Reviewer_1wBr"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6286/Reviewer_1wBr"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6286/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761494726617, "cdate": 1761494726617, "tmdate": 1762918593849, "mdate": 1762918593849, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "qTz2Y8fU4w", "forum": "tkwKLgCSmW", "replyto": "tkwKLgCSmW", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6286/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6286/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762972306196, "cdate": 1762972306196, "tmdate": 1762972306196, "mdate": 1762972306196, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes SafeText to address the issue where text-to-image models generate harmful images when presented with unsafe prompts.

While the paper tests against several existing jailbreak attacks, a more robust safety method should be evaluated against an adaptive attacks specifically designed to target SafeText. An adversary aware of SafeText's mechanism could develop attacks that are optimized to find adversarial prompts whose embeddings remain close to the unsafe region even after the encoder's transformation, or that exploit the specific loss function. \n\n4.

The problem of harmful content generation in text-to-image models is both timely and important, especially as these models become more accessible and integrated into consumer applications.

Most prior alignment approaches focus on modifying the diffusion module, which often degrades image quality for safe prompts.

The paper argues that modifying the diffusion module leads to degradation in image quality for safe prompts. However, this argument is not quantitatively substantiated with sufficient empirical evidence. It is suggested to provide direct comparisons of image quality degradation across methods, showing how much more the diffusion module-based methods affect safe prompts compared to SafeText. Without such comparisons, the core motivation of the method is weakened.\n\n2. The paper equates \"safety\" almost exclusively with the absence of nudity and sexually explicit content. The NRR metric is based on NudeNet, and the unsafe datasets are all focused on this domain. While the authors include a single short paragraph (lines 463-474) and a limited experiment on violence, this feels like an afterthought. Major categories of harmful content, such as extreme gore, self-harm imagery, promotion of hate ideologies, and generation of harmful misinformation, are not addressed in the evaluation. The title's broad claim of creating \"Safe Text-to-Image Models\" is not supported by the narrow scope of the experiments.\n\n3. The core technical contribution is the formulation of the optimization problem in Equation (3): min (L_u - \\lambda L_e). This approach, which aims to minimize the distance for \"positive\" pairs (safe prompts) while maximizing it for \"negative\" pairs (unsafe prompts), is conceptually similar to contrastive learning or triplet loss formulations that are well-established in machine learning. While the application to text encoder alignment is novel and effective, the underlying technical mechanism is not particularly groundbreaking, which may limit its conceptual contribution.\n\n4. The choice of Euclidean distance for utility (d\\_u) and negative cosine similarity for effectiveness (d\\_e) appears arbitrary and is justified only through empirical ablation studies. The paper lacks theoretical analysis explaining why these particular distance metrics are optimal for their respective objectives. More concerningly, there's no discussion of how these distance choices relate to the actual geometry of the embedding space or the diffusion process. The empirical justification in Figures 16c-16d, while interesting, doesn't substitute for a proper theoretical framework."}, "questions": {"value": "Refer to weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "4ALVhF3EbV", "forum": "tkwKLgCSmW", "replyto": "tkwKLgCSmW", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6286/Reviewer_vrhV"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6286/Reviewer_vrhV"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6286/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761985896487, "cdate": 1761985896487, "tmdate": 1762918592394, "mdate": 1762918592394, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
