Traditional QDA methods fail when dealing with high-dimensional data, especially when the data do not satisfy the normality assumption. Existing high-performance methods are mainly designed for Gaussian distributions and may perform poorly in the presence of heavy-tailed distributions or outliers. To address this issue, the authors propose a new classification method called SSQDA (Spatial Sign-based Sparse Quadratic Discriminant Analysis)."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "* The core innovation of the paper lies in the creative integration of the concepts of \"spatial sign\" and \"spatial median\" from robust statistics into the direct estimation framework of high-dimensional sparse QDA. This idea is quite innovative: instead of simply replacing estimators, it provides a robust solution based on convex optimization for this classic problem, effectively breaking through the reliance of traditional methods on the normality assumption.\n\n* he authors have established a comprehensive theoretical framework for the proposed SSQDA method. Notably, the paper not only presents the convergence rates of key parameter estimators but also derives the convergence bounds of misclassification error under the more general elliptically symmetric distributions. Theoretical analysis shows that the method achieves a rate comparable to mainstream approaches under normal distributions and exhibits significant robust advantages under heavy-tailed distributions, providing a solid theoretical guarantee for its effectiveness.\n\n* Through systematic simulation experiments and real data validation, the paper comprehensively evaluates the method’s performance. The experimental design covers various dimensions, covariance structures, and important non-normal distribution scenarios. Consistent results demonstrate that SSQDA performs excellently when assumptions hold and shows even more prominent advantages when assumptions are violated, making the conclusions highly persuasive."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* Rigorousness of Innovation Description: The Boundary with Existing Works Needs to Be ClearerWhen emphasizing its originality, the paper mainly compares with methods based on the normality assumption (e.g., Cai & Zhang 2021). However, the work by Lu & Feng (2025) cited in the paper (\"Robust sparse precision matrix estimation\") seems to have already applied spatial sign methods to graphical models and sparse LDA. The authors claim that SSQDA is the \"first systematic extension,\" but they have not fully clarified the essential differences and connections between their work and that of Lu & Feng (2025) in terms of sparse LDA.\n\n* Comprehensiveness of Experimental Comparisons: Lack of Key Robust Baseline MethodsThe experimental section compares SSQDA with SDAR, SLDA, LDA, and QDA, most of which are sensitive to outliers. However, to fairly demonstrate the \"robustness\" advantage, the experimental design should include other types of robust classifiers as baselines.\n\n* Details on Practical Application and Parameter SelectionThe paper mentions that the regularization parameter is selected via cross-validation, but key details are lacking. In high-dimensional settings, cross-validation incurs high computational costs and its results may be sensitive to data splitting. Additionally, for real-world data applications, readers cannot assess the method’s practical usability."}, "questions": {"value": "* The paper repeatedly cites and relies on the core lemmas (Lemma A.2, A.3) of Lu & Feng (2025) (arXiv:2503.03575). We kindly ask the authors to clarify more explicitly: What are the essential methodological differences between the robust sparse precision matrix estimator proposed in Lu & Feng (2025) and the core method in this paper? Should the contribution of this paper be more accurately positioned as innovatively applying and systematically extending the estimation framework of Lu & Feng (2025) to the high-dimensional QDA problem, along with establishing a complete misclassification theory for it—rather than presenting a completely new estimation method developed from scratch?\n\n* Did the authors perform any data preprocessing (e.g., mean centering, scaling)? SSQDA relies on the spatial sign U(X) = X/||X||₂, which means it is insensitive to the global magnitude of each sample but may be sensitive to the relative intensity distribution between pixels. Additionally, image data typically exhibit spatial local correlation, yet this method does not appear to leverage such structure.\n\n* Could the authors provide some qualitative or quantitative comparison of the practical runtime between SSQDA and SDAR? Furthermore, is the variation range of parameters c₁ and c₂ large across multiple experiments?

It employs sparse optimization to directly estimate the key parameters needed for classification. Theoretical analysis shows the method achieves a near-optimal convergence rate for its estimation error and misclassification risk. Some simulations demonstrate that SSQDA outperforms existing methods under heavy-tailed and high-dimensional settings.
