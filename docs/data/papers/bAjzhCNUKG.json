Videos often contain recurring skills (e.g., grasping, lifting) across different tasks and environments. While skill-based methods can acquire reusable behaviors, they typically rely on clean, action-labeled data, which limits their use in action-free video sources. On the other hand, existing learning-from-video methods often train monolithic models or focus on single-step dynamics, reducing their ability to extract and compose skills for efficient multitask learning and long-horizon planning. In this work, we introduce Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework for skill learning directly from action-free videos. To overcome the absence of action labels, we propose using optical flow as a surrogate for action and adapting the existing skill-learning algorithm to operate on flow-based representations. Our model learns to plan in the skill space and translates these flow-based plans into executable actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["robotics", "learning from videos", "skill abstractions"], "primary_area": "applications to robotics, autonomy, planning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4b8539419ab9e168c5871b85b89b0a9da0c2efd2.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a method called SOF, which proposes a two-stage pipeline for learning policies from action-free video data and subsequently fine-tuning on a small set of action-labeled data. In the first stage, SOF utilizes optical flow as the modality for learning \"skill tokens,\" contrary to the commonly used RGB modality. A Transformer decoder is then used to auto-regressively predict these skill tokens.

Given that AVDC is only deployable on Meta-World, LAPA stands out as the most relevant and crucial baseline for SOF. However, the results show that LAPA achieves an all-zero score on Libero-Goal and is missing entirely on Libero-Long. This is highly peculiar, as LAPA generally shows decent performance on both the SIMPLER-Bridgedata and real-world tasks, and an all-zero score on Libero seems fundamentally unlikely. Could the authors clarify the cause of this extremely poor performance? Is it potentially due to unsuitable training parameters or code bugs? Furthermore, I strongly recommend that LAPA not be omitted from the results on Libero-Long. \n\n- Clarification on Stages and Data Usage (Section 5.5): In Section 5.5, I would appreciate it if the authors could explicitly clarify what \"stage 1\" and \"stage 2\" specifically refer to. Based on Figure 2, \"stage 1\" might refer to \"Learning Skill Abstraction and Policy Learning on Skill Space,\" and \"stage 2\" might be \"Flow to Action.\" However, the Appendix suggests \"stage 1\" might only denote \"Learning Skill Abstraction.\"Additionally, how is the dataset utilized during the \"Flow to Action\" stage? Was data from only a single embodiment or both used?\n\n- Validation of Transfer Experiments: The analysis experiments regarding task and embodiment transfer in Section 5.5 are very interesting. However, Meta-World tasks are quite simple. In the standard Meta-World task suite, the action space is only 4-dimensional ($x, y, z, \\text{gripper}$), which largely avoids complex issues related to different robot embodiments/configurations. Could the authors validate these two points (task and embodiment transfer) in real-robot experiments to demonstrate the method's robustness in more complex, high-dimensional settings?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "zf1UhKhBMg", "forum": "bAjzhCNUKG", "replyto": "bAjzhCNUKG", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14397/Reviewer_F926"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14397/Reviewer_F926"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14397/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761710630886, "cdate": 1761710630886, "tmdate": 1762924808622, "mdate": 1762924808622, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces SOF, a framework that learns reusable robotic skills directly from action-free videos by leveraging optical flow as a surrogate for actions.

The paper's primary contribution appears to be the combination of these two ideas into a single framework, but it provides limited new algorithmic insight or theoretical foundation beyond this synthesis.\n2.\tThe paper positions only using a third-person view as an advantage over other methods like ATM (using a wrist camera) or QueST (using proprioception). However, this critique is misaligned with practical robotics, where wrist cameras and proprioceptive states are standard and crucial for achieving robust, fine-grained, and contact-rich manipulation. The authors' chosen setup may inherently limit their method's applicability to simpler, pick-and-place-style tasks.\n3.\tThe absence of a direct comparison with the highly relevant UniVLA baseline is a significant omission. Given that UniVLA follows a conceptually similar latent action pretraining approach (but in image space) and has demonstrated superior performance (e.g., >90% on LIBERO), the presented results for SOF (25% on LIBERO-GOAL) are underwhelming and raise questions about the relative effectiveness of the optical-flow-based approach.\n4.\tThe policy learning experiments are only conducted in simulation (MetaWorld and LIBERO) without any real-world robot experiments, making it difficult to evaluate the method's practicality and robustness. Furthermore, the decision to evaluate only 4 out of 10 tasks in the standard LIBERO-10 benchmark, without a clear justification, reduces the rigor and comparability of the long-horizon claims.\n\nTherefore, I think this paper has not achieved the acceptance threshold of ICLR.\n\n[1] Ko P C, Mao J, Du Y, et al.
