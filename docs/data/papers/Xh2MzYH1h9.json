Yet their design is difficult because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions. (i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150 000 parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their derivatives—three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core capabilities of vision–language metamaterial assistants—structure reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision–language models and deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design and understanding of structure–representation–property relationships.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["metamaterials", "architected materials", "microstructures", "domain specific language", "benchmark", "design assistant", "coding assistant"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/24ab5333744ee130fcb0b782a84e93fb59d9664a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c2628d24b01602151077d73e66760a48e671915d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work focuses on metamaterial designs, introduces a series of developments.

Unclear contribution regarding MetaAssist: This work mentions MetaAssist and regards it as one of the contributions, while there aren’t any details or definitions of it, except an unclear description, “a VLM assistant baseline and interactive CAD environment that facilitates multi-modal design interactions including language, images, geometry, and MetaDSL code.” The input, output, and training, etc. are not mentioned (including in the appendix).\n\n2. Unrobust experiments and lack of implementation details: Especially for the benchmark part, the implementation details of all included baselines are not clear. Moreover, there is a lack of any citation or description of LLaVA, NoVA, and OpenAIO3.\n\n3. Limited benchmarks: This paper only benchmarks and compares five baselines (where four of them are derived from MetaAssist), which is not enough for a benchmark. Notably, among the five benchmarks, only OpenAIO3 is an existing work, and LLaVA and NoVA / LLaVABase and NoVABase are derived from MetaAssist. This comparison significantly relies on their specific work; therefore, the conclusion is hard to be robust.\n\n4. Lack of literature review for the mentioned tasks: The authors benchmark three tasks; however, they do not compare or discuss their methods with any existing works that can address these three tasks.\n\n5. Moreover, the designed tasks are not well motivated or formally defined, except inverse design, which is generally mentioned for metamaterial design. Why reconstruction and material understanding are fundamental is not explained.\n\n6. The material properties of this dataset are generated by homogenisation without real test and simulation, are the computed properties via homogenisation robust to reflect the real property?\n\nRegarding Presentation\n\n1. Challenges: The authors propose three challenges. However, except for (i), which I guess is addressed by Figure 5, they fail to demonstrate that their methods could successfully address (ii) and (iii).\n\n2. The paper should include formal definitions of the proposed corpus, such as skeleton, tile, and pattern. In addition, they should define the whole design space of metamaterials and show why they can be represented via skeleton, tile, and pattern.\n\n3. All notations are not well defined throughout this paper.\n\n4. Make sure the format of subtitles is consistent, for example, paragraph titles in Section 5.1 and Section 6.2.\n\n5. The paper should include the full name of DSL, which I guess might denote domain-specific language.\n\n6. This MetaDSL seems based on ProcMeta; however, they are both very specific, and the authors fail to introduce and define either of them.\n\nRegarding Significance:\n\nAlthough the authors provide a large dataset with a new representation, they do not show how this dataset and representation can be used by general methods. The authors only benchmark one LLM API (OpenAIO3) and their MetaAssist, which makes it hard to demonstrate that the proposed dataset can contribute to the community."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Including such baselines would help better understand the reported improvements.\n\n2. Although MetaDSL is presented as a general, extensible representation, the appendix states that “all of our structures have a translational unit residing in a unit cube.” I am not an expert in the metamaterial domain, but does this constraint mean that certain classes of metamaterials (like non-periodic) cannot yet be represented within MetaDSL? \n\n3. For the inverse design tasks, the evaluation focuses on error and validity. It would be valuable to include novelty metrics to assess whether generated designs are genuinely new or simply replicate known patterns.\n\n4.

The motivation is not clear. The authors have not clearly explain why such a DSL is needed. Considering that they want to leverage the power of LLMs, existing textual description of metamaterial can also serve (e.g., depicting truss-based metamaterial with node positions and edges in text format). As for representation, the geometrical representation can already satisfy the need of metamaterial research, like voxel-representation.\n2. As the author mentioned, there is a hurdle like \"navigating the immense geometric diversity of candidate architectures\". I understand that every valid \"MetaDSL\" code can be readily transferred into real 3D shape. However, it's not trivial that existing structures can be transferred into MetaDSL format (e.g., those in Yang et al's work[r1]). If existing structures cannot be easily transferred into MetaDSL, it's still a doubt whether MetaDSL can allow to \"realize the full potential\" of metamaterial.\n3. It is questionable whether MetaDSL is a self-contained representation instead of the accumulation of engineering efforts. For example, the authors use \"SpatiallyVaryingBeams\" to accommodate truss-based metamaterial with non-uniform truss. I understand that MetaDSL can integrate further engineering techniques like this to be extended to more types of metamaterial, but to me it's not a natural and universal representation like voxels, but instead good enginnering efforts.\n4. The benckmark is too specifically curated, hence limited impact. The benchmark specifies three tasks, each of them related to MetaDSL. For example, inverse design is defined as \"given a target property profile, the desired output is a DSL program\". The highly curated benchmark is the reason, as I recon, why only four methods are compared in this paper. It is still unclear how well other inverse design methods which start from properties and output 3D structures can perform compared to the four baselines. If such inverse design methods work better, it is questionable why MetaDSL is needed.\n5. The authors claim to use \"MetaAssist, a VLM assistant baseline and interactive CAD environment\", but I haven't found enough description about this, especially the \"interactive CAD environment\".  \n\n[r1] Yang, Yanyan, et al. \"Guided diffusion for fast inverse design of density-based mechanical metamaterials.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.13570 (2024)."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
