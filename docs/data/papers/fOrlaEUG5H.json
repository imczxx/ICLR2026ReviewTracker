For chest radiographs, robust modeling of interval change between exams is critical, as clinical reports rely heavily on identifying whether findings have improved, worsened, or remained stable. To address this gap, we present TILA (Temporal Inversion-aware Learning and Alignment), a framework that incorporates temporal inversion as a supervisory signal. TILA enforces directional awareness between paired images when their temporal order is reversed, enabling the model to adapt predictions to temporal context while maintaining logical consistency. This inversion-aware alignment is integrated across pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference, offering a complete pipeline for paired CXRs. We also propose a new evaluation protocol to assess model sensitivity, consistency, and robustness under temporal inversion, and introduce the MS-CXR-T_retrieval benchmark for progression-aware retrieval. Experiments on public datasets and real-world hospital records demonstrate that TILA achieves state-of-the-art performance in progression classification, temporal embedding matching, and progression retrieval. These results highlight TILA’s potential to advance clinical decision-making through more reliable temporal reasoning and generalizable predictions.", "tldr": "TILA is a unified framework for chest X-ray analysis that uses temporal inversion to robustly model disease progression, achieving state-of-the-art performance in progression detection and retrieval across multiple datasets.", "keywords": ["Longitudinal Medical Imaging", "VLP", "medical vlp", "medical AI"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/dbd3ce9b7a5df178f84365fc9ebf31f1af64b331.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b695ab1450d400d90bd3bcdc187817c22f249f75.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces TILA, a framework designed to improve temporal reasoning in longitudinal chest X-ray analysis.

The lack of a) impact of weight $w$ to balance these losses and b) ablation to clarify their requirement makes it hard to justify their need. Further there is a dependency on Gemini 2 Flash but whether the model is reasonable for this task is challenging to quantify and not considered for the overall pipeline.\n* **Dependency on the inversion:** It is unclear why inversion is crucial due to various reasons. \n     * Consider the case of a patient who is in a critical condition, why is it a necessity for the model to learn the flipped label of improvement when that might not be a possibility for many labels? Why is the reversed direction important for all the labels? Was the clinical relevance of this condition validated? My concern is that this enforcement will encourage scenarios which should not be considered for training the model. \n     * How are the cases where the patient is stable/critical but only the intensity of the condition is different can be incorporated in the framework? \n* **Comparison with prior works:** The paper lacks a comparison with many recent works that have investigated not only the temporal aspect of radiographs but also reports. For instance, both papers [1,2] conducted an training and evaluation using past images, reports from MIMIC. The utility of enforcing inversion on radiographs is further unclear in cases when such information can directly be obtained from past reports. All the metrics in the paper are biased towards this requirement which makes the positioning of the work unclear. Further, Table 2 is challenging to interpret. My recommendation would be to have individual plots for different findings. \n\nReferences.  \n[1] Huang et al., HIST-AID: Leveraging Historical Patient Reports for Enhanced Multi-Modal Automatic Diagnosis. 2024.   \n[2] Soenksen et al., Integrated multimodal artificial intelligence framework for healthcare applications. 2022"}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to my comments above."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Pa9MK2yxJE", "forum": "fOrlaEUG5H", "replyto": "fOrlaEUG5H", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11749/Reviewer_cKAh"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11749/Reviewer_cKAh"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission11749/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761568162537, "cdate": 1761568162537, "tmdate": 1762922777785, "mdate": 1762922777785, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper targeted a significant topic of temporal context in CXR images; this aspect highlights the challenges in longitudinal studies on medical images.
