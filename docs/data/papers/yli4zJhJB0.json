Existing watermarking techniques for 3DGS mainly focus on protecting rendered images via pre-trained decoders, leaving the underlying 3D Gaussian primitives vulnerable to misuse. In particular, they are ineffective against **Partial Infringement**, where an adversary extracts and reuses only a subset of Gaussians. In this paper, we propose **NGS-Marker**, a novel native watermarking framework for 3DGS. It integrates a jointly trained watermark injector and message decoder, and employs a gradient-based progressive injection strategy to ensure full-scene coverage. This enables robust ownership decoding from any local region. We further extend NGS-Marker with hybrid protection (combining native and indirect watermarks) and support for multimodal personalized watermarking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NGS-Marker effectively defends against partial infringement while offering practical flexibility for real-world deployment.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["3D Gaussian Splatting", "digital asset watermarking", "copyright protection"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1d17b228b5115af32171dbacfbd12dbb3d52a2e6.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/bc6133e08b4400fd58042cad6c6b44aa60e00f8b.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes NGS-Marker, a native watermarking framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that addresses the problem of partial infringement.

While the feasibility analysis (Section 3, Figure 2) shows that HiDDeN can embed watermarks in random noise, the theoretical connection to why this should work for structured 3D Gaussian primitives is weak. The paper lacks analysis of what properties of Gaussian primitives make them suitable for watermark embedding.\n\n2. Table 4 shows embedding time increases significantly with scene complexity (4 min for 42K primitives to 35 min for 589K primitives)\n   The authors acknowledge in limitations that \"designing an efficient partitioning and traversal strategy could further improve scalability\" but don't provide solutions.\n   How does the method scale to production-level scenes with millions of primitives?\n\n3. No analysis of adversarial attacks specifically designed to remove native watermarks\n   What if an adversary fine-tunes or re-optimizes the Gaussian primitives?\n   The robustness experiments (Table 3) only test standard distortions, not adversarial removal attempts.\n\n4. Although the method achieves native embedding, the method is built on top of the PointTransformer. What parameters are used in the injection and extraction? Are all parameters used for injection and extraction? There should be an ablation study for different parameters that are selected for injection and decoding.\nFor example, if we can only use the color and position attributes, can we extend the method to become compatible with point cloud data?\n\n5.  The partial infringement simulation may not fully capture real-world misuse scenarios. More challenging infringements should be discussed such as 3D adversarial attacks, Semantic editing[1] or recoloring[2]\n\n[1] GaussianEditor: Swift and Controllable 3D Editing with Gaussian Splatting\n\n[2] GeometrySticker: GeometrySticker: Enabling Ownership Claim of Recolorized Neural Radiance Fields"}, "questions": {"value": "## Questions\n\n1.
