The performance gap between a model and a human can be interpreted very differently based on this.\n\n- Ground Truth Adjudication: For the 3.6% of cases where the primary human annotator was incorrect, how was the ground truth established? Was it through consensus among a panel of senior experts?\n\n- Inter-annotator Agreement: What was the inter-annotator agreement (e.g., Cohen's Kappa) among the human experts? This is essential for understanding the inherent difficulty and subjectivity of the tasks themselves.\n\nRobustness to Prompting : The performance of language-vision models is often highly sensitive to the prompt instruction. The paper should discuss: To what extent was the performance sensitive to variations in the prompt template? Was a systematic prompt engineering or optimization process conducted? Reporting results with different prompting strategies would strengthen the robustness of the findings.\n\nTask Selection and Dataset Representativeness:\n\nTaxonomy and Completeness: The selection of tasks is a key contribution. It would be helpful if the authors could explicitly outline the taxonomy or classification system used to select these specific tasks (as in Sec. 3). A discussion on why these tasks were chosen and whether any other important categories  were considered but omitted would justify the comprehensiveness of the benchmark.\n\nDataset Biases: The datasets for each task originate from different sources and protocols, which the review correctly notes can appear ad hoc. The authors should explicitly discuss the potential biases present in these combined datasets and how these biases might affect the generalizability of the benchmark results.\n\nModel Selection: The set of evaluated models is substantial.

The authors motivate the benchmark by arguing that clinicians will not trust a model that cannot solve simple perceptual tasks. By probing these “blink tasks”, MedBLINK assesses whether MLMs truly “see” the image or exploit superficial correlations. This focus on trustworthiness is reasonable especially as MLMs are being considered for clinical decision support.\n\n**Task design**: The eight tasks are designed simple. They can be extracted from existing labeled datasets with light processing. This makes the benchmark practical and easy to reproduce.\n\n**Comprehensive evaluation**: 20 models spanning proprietary, open‑source, and medical‑specific MLMs are evaluated under a consistent prompting protocol. The results show clear performance differences, revealing that proprietary models (e.g., GPT‑5) outperform medical models such as LLaVA‑Med. Ablation studies examine the impact of model size, prompting strategies, and models designed for spatial reasoning, providing rich insights into current limitations."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. **Ambiguity in Perception**: The core idea of the paper relies on a clean distinction between basic visual perception and complex reasoning, but some tasks go beyond simple perception. In my understanding, a basic perceptual task should be easy for any medically trained person to recognize. I agree those grounding-related tasks are simple for most people, like visual depth estimation, wave-based imaging depth estimation, histology structure, imaging orientation, and relative position. However, Task 1 (image enhancement detection) needs prior knowledge of what enhanced images and different phase of CT images look like, otherwise it is hard to judge. Task 8 (Age Estimation) needs both perception and a visual concept between pediatric and adults, as the paper notes in line 244,  *“pediatric patients exhibit a proportionally larger heart compared to the adults, and the thoracic cage in children appears more circular with horizontally oriented ribs, in contrast to the elliptical cage with oblique ribs seen in adults”*. But these concepts are not included in the pre-prompt. I assume it is one reason why MLMs perform such worse than human-experts.\n2. **Task selection is not well justified**: The paper calls the eight tasks clinically meaningful and says tasks are chosen by consulting one senior radiologist, but with little detail on the process. In other words, this makes the choice subjective. From my perspective, some tasks do not feel essential in practice. For examples, for Task 1, all CT phases have clinical value. A phase selection task would be more meaningful than only detecting enhancement. For Task 7, why use wisdom tooth counting instead of common checks like laterality (left vs right) or implant detection. Taken with (1), the tasks are not well defined and lack detailed clinical support and evidence. A broader clinician survey and clear selection criteria would make the benchmark more convincing.\n3. **Risk of data leakage**: The benchmark reuses well-known public datasets (for example VindDr, ChestX-ray8, Kvasir, EchoNet-Dynamic). Even after re-organizing, MLMs may have seen parts of these during pretraining. This raises a fairness concern. So, how do you ensure MedBLINK is a fair benchmark? A stronger approach is to collect an in-house clinical set and compare results between private data and public data. This ablation would help validate that the findings are not driven by potential data leakage.\n4. **Limited novelty**: The main idea follows BLINK. Moving this idea to medical field is useful, but it is an extension rather than a new concept. In addition, the MedBLINK also feels like a complement to existing medical benchmarks such as MediConfusion and GMAI‑MMBench (perceptual tasks)."}, "questions": {"value": "Apart from Weaknesses, I am curious about evaluation on agentic AI: The paper shows that small specialized models can outperform all MLMs on these tasks. This points to the value of tool use. From this paper, the experiments use a zero shot single model setup, but many advancing systems run MLMs in agent mode. An agent can call tools that specialize in perception. So, it would be useful to test MedBLINK in an agentic setting. For example, the agent could route to a segmentation or classification tool and then count wisdom tooth or judge the orientation more accurately. These tests would show whether the “blink tasks” remain hard once tool use is allowed."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "K31nOQsjzI", "forum": "GNnk6DlxsT", "replyto": "GNnk6DlxsT", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13328/Reviewer_gKQr"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13328/Reviewer_gKQr"], "number": 5, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission13328/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762186432688, "cdate": 1762186432688, "tmdate": 1762923986528, "mdate": 1762923986528, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
