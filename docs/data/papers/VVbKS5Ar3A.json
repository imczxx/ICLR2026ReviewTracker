By complementing the edges this is equivalent to the maximum independent set problem. The paper studies the later actually, which allows them not to have to distinguish diagonal and non-diagonal entries in the adjacency matrix. It is an NP-hard problem, which can be solved exactly by a branch and bound search. It consists of the exploration of a search tree, where every node of the tree is associated to a vertex of the graph, and there are two descendants, one where the vertex is included in the solution, and one where it is not. Deciding on an order on the vertices can influence the running time, where at level i of the tree, the i-th vertex in this order is chosen. A similar approach was proposed for the traveling salesman problem in the past.\n\nConcretely, a soft-permutation T is selected which minimizes the inner product of the resulting adjacency matrix with some weight matrix. This weight matrix consists of exponential decreasing weights depending on the Lmax coordinates norm. Ideally a solution to this problem will result in an adjacency matrix an all zero square in the top left corner of the adjacency matrix, representing an independent set.\n\nThis soft permutation matrix T is found with a graph neural network.
