In this work, we introduce a new problem of Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximum delay $\\tau_{\\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals, and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up to logarithmic factors.\nFinally, we present experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.", "tldr": "We introduce a new problem of Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback", "keywords": ["bandit", "Lipschitz bandit"], "primary_area": "reinforcement learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/14cdf9a5103102ad10b0cc98f142a2e6990bfbaa.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/8f8f6bb8c6184da2b1d62c99ee0a6fc2a1e59a08.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies Lipschitz bandits (that is, the action set is continuous defined over a metric space) with stochastic delayed feedback.
