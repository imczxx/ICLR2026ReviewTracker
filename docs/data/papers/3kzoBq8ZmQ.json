We present HyperRAG, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and hierarchical reranking using hyperbolic embeddings. Our approach is designed to improve entity linking and retrieval in settings where the label space exhibits rich hierarchical relationships. In addition, we introduce a hierarchy-aware evaluation framework that leverages ontology structure to provide a more nuanced assessment of model performance, moving beyond conventional exact-match metrics. Through comprehensive experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including a newly curated and challenging set of clinical notes for phenotype extraction in precision medicine, we demonstrate that HyperRAG substantially improves ranking accuracy and recall, especially for implicit or nuanced entity mentions. While our primary application is in the biomedical domain, the proposed framework is broadly applicable and generalizable to hierarchical entity linking and retrieval tasks in other domains.

The methodological novelty of the paper seems limited. The method is an instance of dense retrievers for entity linking, which to the best of my knowledge go back to Wu et al. (2020) and since then followed by several works; but replacing the common Euclidean embedding assumption by a hyperbolic one (which is another well-studied area of research). In this sense, the paper presents a comparison of embedding spaces for entity linking.\n2. The main claim is that HyperRAG shows \"substantial improvements, particularly in scenarios with implicit entity mentions.\" is problematic for several reasons:\n   - Fig. 4 shows that the Euclidean approach is in fact better than Hyperbolic, contradicting the motivations given in the introduction and the hyperbolic consistency results in sec. 6.1.\n   - Table 1 also shows very similar results between the Euclidean-only approach and the Hybrid reranking approach. Fig 7 in fact shows that the higher the value of $\\gamma$, i.e. a higher weight on Euclidean rather than hyperbolic scores, is in fact better (and why the authors instead chose $\\gamma$ = 0.5 -see L333-is not clear).\n   - The small differences do not really point to \"substantial improvements\", and in fact when so close they should be subject to a suitable statistical test, especially when datasets are small.\n   - I would lean towards reading this paper as a negative results paper, where a simple Euclidean space with no re-ranking proves to be better than other more complex pipelines. However, this perspective is not considered nor discussed in the paper.\n3. The motivation for alternative metrics is good, but the resulting metrics proposed by the authors where metrics are weighted by distances in the ontology are not ideal: they introduce parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ which seem to be domain-dependent (according to the appendix, they are chosen by clinicians, but how this is exactly done is not clear). This leaves the question of whether one could tune $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ to favor one method over another.\n4. The CHU50 dataset seems very small, in which case an appropriate description of how the data is split for training/validation/test is warranted. There is no mention about this in the paper, but in such cases other protocols might be more appropriate, like average k-fold cross-validation performance. An inspection of the supplementary data shows that the CHU50 dataset (`sentences_chu50_spans.csv`) contains 2,487 instances, out of which 149 instances only are labeled as containing spans linked to the HPO. Does this mean that the reported metrics are averaged over 149 instances?\n5. The question of how the results would generalize to other domains is not answered."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Results from such a dataset are not a reliable proxy for performance on real-world clinical data.\n\n3. The paper could be improved to meet the presentation standards in several ways. First, crucial technical details necessary to understand the methodology (e.g., model architectures, normalization strategies) are relegated to the appendix, making the main paper not self-contained and disrupting the review process.
