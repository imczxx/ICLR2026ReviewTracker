Most positive algorithmic and theoretical results for EFGs assume perfect recall, where players remember all past information and actions. We study the increasingly relevant setting of imperfect-recall EFGs (IREFGs), where players may forget parts of their history or previously acquired information, and where equilibrium computation is provably hard. We propose sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies for computing ex-ante optimal strategies in single-player IREFGs and Nash equilibria in multi-player IREFGs, working over behavioral strategies. Our theoretical results show that (i) these hierarchies converge asymptotically, (ii) under genericity assumptions, the convergence is finite, and (iii) in single-player non-absentminded IREFGs, convergence occurs at a finite level determined by the number of information sets. Finally, we introduce the new  classes of (SOS)-concave and (SOS)-monotone IREFGs, and show that in the single-player setting the SOS hierarchy converges at the first level, enabling equilibrium computation with a single SDP.", "tldr": "We use sum-of-squares techniques to solve extensive-form games with imperfect recall.", "keywords": ["extensive-form games", "imperfect recall", "sum-of-squares", "Moment-SOS hierarchy"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6779d46a4ca20a248d5bec002fd1b5b886b151dd.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/9c73024bf89664e492d7a31b64d05445effa5881.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a theoretical framework for solving Imperfect-Recall Extensive-Form Games (IREFGs) by leveraging the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization hierarchy.
