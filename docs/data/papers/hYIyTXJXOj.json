The paper feels more like an incremental application of an existing algorithm to a new domain rather than a fundamental breakthrough."}, "questions": {"value": "1. **Reliance on Flow-Based Decoder**: The method is presented as an \"autoregressive model,\" but it heavily relies on a large, pre-trained flow-based model (Proteina) as its decoder. This blurs the lines of novelty. It feels less like a pure AR model and more like a complex, multi-scale conditioning scheme for a flow model.\n\n2. **Questionable Benefit**: Given the relatively limited improvement over the Proteina baseline (Table 1), what is the practical benefit of introducing this complicated multi-scale AR scheme? The experiments do not convincingly demonstrate that this hybrid AR-flow approach is substantially better than the flow-based model it is built upon.\n\n3. **Weaker Designability (sc-RMSD)**: While the model excels at global fold distribution (FPSD), its fine-grained designability (sc-RMSD) is a weakness. In Table 1, the PAR (400M) model's sc-RMSD of 1.28 is comparable to Proteina (1.09). \n\n4. For evaluating diversity, the average pairwise TM-score (Table 1) is not very discriminative. A more robust metric, such as reporting the number of Foldseek clusters (as done in the Proteina paper), would be more convincing.\n\n5. The interpretation of the attention maps (Fig. 6) concludes that each scale attends to the previous scale due to \"richer contextual information.\" However, this analysis fails to de-confound this with sequence length. Later scales correspond to much longer sequences, which would naturally receive larger attention weights. This confounding factor is not excluded from the analysis.\n\n6. The paper states that downsampling and upsampling are done via \"interpolation\" (Sec 3.1). What is the exact implementation of this? This detail is crucial for reproducibility.\n\n7. Motif Scaffolding Centering: The paper mentions superimposing the ground-truth motif (Sec 4.2). This superimposition operation may change the center of the motif and the coordinate frame of the entire structure. How is this change in centering handled by the subsequent autoregressive steps and the flow decoder, which are sensitive to the absolute coordinate system?\n\n8.  Since the flow-based decoder $v_{\\theta}$ is shared across all scales, can a model trained on a 3-scale configuration be used for inference with a 5-scale configuration (or vice-versa)?

These examples effectively showcase the model's flexibility and its capacity for precise, user-guided generation."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.  **Lack of Analysis on Sampling Efficiency and Computational Cost:** A notable omission is the lack of analysis on sampling latency. While autoregressive (AR) models often present an advantage in generation speed over diffusion models in other domains, the PAR framework's architecture raises concerns. The model culminates in a diffusion decoder that appears computationally intensive (e.g., 1000 steps compared to Proteina's 400), and the preceding multi-scale AR stages introduce further computational overhead. This leads to a critical question: is PAR significantly slower than comparable end-to-end diffusion methods? Without this characterization, it is difficult to assess the practical trade-offs and viability of the proposed approach.\n\n2.  **Unclear Justification for the Autoregressive Framework's Contribution to Performance:** While the multi-scale AR framework is conceptually elegant, its empirical necessity is not fully substantiated by the results. The model introduces considerable architectural complexity, yet this does not translate into superior performance. In fact, as shown in *Table 1*, the model underperforms a strong diffusion baseline like Proteina on the key metric of Designability, while showing no significant advantages in other reported metrics. Moreover, the framework pairs a powerful diffusion decoder with a relatively low-parameter AR encoder, and the scaling experiments primarily seem to reflect the scaling properties of the diffusion component. This makes it difficult to disentangle the contributions of the novel AR framework from the strong performance of the underlying decoder. The manuscript would be substantially strengthened by an ablation study or analysis that clearly demonstrates the value added by the AR mechanism.\n\n3.  **Limited Demonstration on Longer Protein Chains:** The model's generalization capability is only demonstrated on proteins with lengths up to 256 residues, reflecting the scope of its training data. The generation of longer, multi-domain proteins is a crucial and challenging frontier for protein design. The performance of AR models, in particular, can degrade over long sequences due to error propagation. The paper would be more impactful if it included experiments on longer proteins or at least provided a thorough discussion of the potential challenges and limitations of scaling the PAR framework to these more complex and biologically relevant structures."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  Regarding the model's architecture, the current design utilizes a low-parameter autoregressive (AR) encoder with a powerful diffusion decoder that generates all tokens for a given scale simultaneously. Have the authors considered or experimented with an alternative architecture, perhaps more aligned with models like **MAR**, which employs a large-parameter AR model paired with a lightweight decoder that generates tokens sequentially (i.e., per-token) at each scale? Such a design might better leverage the known strengths of AR models in sequence modeling.\n\n2.  The proposed multi-scale framework relies on downsampling and upsampling operations that appear to be based on local windows in the 1D amino acid sequence. However, protein structures are defined by complex 3D relationships where residues that are distant in the 1D sequence can be close neighbors in 3D space. How does the current sequence-based sampling strategy ensure that these crucial non-local spatial relationships are effectively captured and preserved across different scales? Is there a risk of losing this vital information during the downsampling process?\n\n3.  The generation of protein backbones occurs directly in the continuous and high-dimensional coordinate space. In other domains, such as image generation, autoregressive modeling directly on the raw data space (e.g., pixel space) is often less effective than modeling in a compressed latent space (e.g., from a VAE or VQ-VAE), as latent spaces can be more dense and numerically stable. Could the authors comment on this choice? What is their perspective on the challenges of applying autoregressive generation directly to the sparse and numerically sensitive coordinate space of proteins, and was a latent-space generation approach considered?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "we9ImUC2pH", "forum": "hYIyTXJXOj", "replyto": "hYIyTXJXOj", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6869/Reviewer_SoNE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6869/Reviewer_SoNE"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission6869/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761497950874, "cdate": 1761497950874, "tmdate": 1762919122599, "mdate": 1762919122599, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces Protein Autoregressive Modeling (PAR), the multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation.
