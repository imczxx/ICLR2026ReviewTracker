DFT calculates these quantities from the electron density using auxiliary (and empirical) potential functions. Finding the electron density requires the solution of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, which can only be tackled using iterative algorithms (the most famous among them is called SCF). Such iterative algorithms crucially hinge on good choices of initial values, within the basis of attraction of the SCF dynamics. The paper introduces an ML-based method to obtain such initial values. \n\nContrary to previous approaches, the proposed method directly operates on expansion coefficients of the electron density with respect to a given basis. From this, the matrices which make up the nonlinear eigenvalue problem can be computed via quadrature.

However, this is not the only indicator of efficiency. In order to make a fair comparison one needs to monitor the wall time (keeping in mind that assembling the relevant matrices from the expansion coefficients requires the numerical solution of complicated quadrature problems) as well as the final accuracy.
