However, most existing readout functions are built on an atom-decomposable inductive bias, i.e. the material-level property or feature can be reasonably assigned to contributions of individual atoms. This is a strong bias and may not hold for all properties, limiting the application scenarios. In this work, we propose a region-based decomposition perspective, reformulating material properties as integrals over space and pooling contributions from spatial regions rather than atoms. Specifically, we propose a novel readout function named SpatialRead. SpatialRead introduces additional spatial nodes to represent a voxelized space, transforming the atomic isomorphic graph into a heterogeneous atom–space graph with unidirectional message flow from atoms to spatial nodes. To combine the two types of inductive bias, multimodal methods can be used to fuse the feature of atoms the spatial nodes. Such region-based readout function is especially suited for spatial properties such as gas adsorption capacity, separation ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a simple PaiNN–Transformer-based SpatialRead training from scratch outperforms state-of-the-art pre-trained foundation models on these special tasks. Our results highlight the importance of designing physically grounded readout functions tailored to the target property.

This claim is not completely unreasonable, but it is also not supported by any quantifiable evidence. An equivariant GNN can learn local geometric atom environments (also around a pore), up to a cutoff radius which is determined by cutoff-hyperparameters and model depth. Thus, in principle, there is no direct reason to claim that it is impossible to learn pore volumes as a function of mean- or sum-pooled atom embeddings. Every atom can learn from its local geometric environment if it is adjacent to a pore or not, and what pore volume is \"attributed\" to this atom, so sum pooling can yield the pore volume.\n\nThe baseline models CGCNN, GemNet, and PaiNN are more than 5 years old.

Weak Empirical Validation\n\nThe experimental evaluation is insufficient to support the claims:\n\n- **Trivial target properties**: The main benchmarks focus on predicting surface area and pore volume for MOFs. From a materials science perspective, these properties are almost directly derivable from the structure itself (via van der Waals sphere calculations), making them poor choices for demonstrating the value of a novel readout mechanism.\n\n- **Selective MatBench reporting**: The paper only reports results on a subset of MatBench properties. This selective reporting raises concerns about the method's general applicability. What happened to the other MatBench tasks?\n\n- **Inconsistent and marginal improvements**: Across benchmarks, the improvements are neither consistent nor substantial enough to justify the added complexity.\n\n### 2. Missing Ablation Studies\n\nThe paper lacks essential ablation studies to disentangle the contributions of different components:\n\n- **Effect of additional void nodes**: The method adds nodes in empty/void space, which allows the model to trivially compute the ratio between occupied and unoccupied space—essentially providing a direct signal for pore accessible volume fraction. This could be the primary driver of any improvements, independent of the readout mechanism.\n\n- **Required ablation**: Compare additional void nodes with standard pooling (max/mean) versus the proposed spatial readout. This would demonstrate whether the gains come from the readout innovation or simply from the additional structural information.\n\n### 3. Added Complexity Without Clear Justification\n\n- The method introduces an additional hyperparameter (sampling degree for void space), increasing model complexity and optimization difficulty\n- Given the weak empirical gains, it's unclear whether this added complexity is warranted\n\n### 4.
