We introduce the Evolving Locus Linkage Graph (ELLG), which embeds the linkage principle (keep strong segments intact, recombine at weak boundaries) into operator design. At each generation, ELLG updates per-locus linkage weights from observed fitness, producing a task-specific linkage map that tells the algorithm which segments to keep intact and where to cut; as generations proceed, these protected regions and preferred cut sites become increasingly well-defined. A simple monotone transformation converts the learned weights into placement probabilities for crossover and mutation, replacing uniform randomness with targeted, structure-aware operator placement. We integrate ELLG as a plug-in to a standard GA without changing the problem encoding or operator semantics. We benchmark ELLG against a large pool of state-of-the-art evolutionary methods across two domains: classical multi-objective optimization suites and Neural Architecture Search, ELLG achieves higher final solution quality in experiments.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Genetic Algorithms; Building Blocks; Linkage Disequilibrium; Neural Architecture Search; Multi-Objective Optimization"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/26c1bf7ed86ae69a02b064997bf8cc409c910d21.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces the Evolving Locus Linkage Graph (ELLG), a novel approach to address the \"operator blindness\" problem in Genetic Algorithms (GAs).

This is a critical concern, as GAs are already computationally expensive, and the lack of analysis on computational requirements undermines the practical relevance of the paper.

Could the authors provide an analysis of the overhead introduced by learning and maintaining linkage weights? How does this cost scale with problem size?\n- Why were gold-standard NAS benchmarks (e.g., NAS-101, NATS-Bench) not used in the evaluation?

Releasing the code would greatly enhance the reproducibility and credibility of the results. Could the authors commit to making the code publicly accessible?\n- ELLG’s reliance on learning linkage weights may limit its practical applicability due to computational constraints.

Could the authors elaborate on how specific biological mechanisms (e.g., genetic linkage, recombination hotspots) directly informed the design of ELLG? Are there biological processes that could further inspire future improvements?\n- How do the linkage weights evolve over generations? Could the authors provide examples or visualizations of how these weights change in response to fitness feedback, particularly in complex problems?\n- Are there theoretical guarantees (e.g., convergence properties, optimality conditions) associated with ELLG?

ELLG only learns linkage between adjacent loci on the chromosome (like a chain graph). This assumes that important building blocks correspond to contiguous segments in the representation. In many problems, especially combinatorial ones, genes that are far apart in the encoding might actually be correlated. \n2. The method’s application to multi-objective problems requires collapsing multi-dimensional performance into a scalar $\\Delta$. The paper doesn’t explain how this is done, which is a technical weakness in clarity. If the chosen scalarization is naive (e.g., using just one objective or a weighted sum), the learning signal might misrepresent true solution quality in multi-objective space. \n3. The integration of ELLG requires that crossover and mutation be implemented in a way that a specific “site” can be chosen. In the standard NSGA-II (and many MOEAs for real vectors), crossover is SBX, which does not have a single crossover point – it mixes every variable. This seems fine, but it effectively means the baseline NSGA in comparisons might not be using exactly the same operator behavior as ELLG-GA. \n4. I don't quite get why Eq. (6) can intuitively learn the linkage weight $W^{(k)}$ for each k. Since this rule/update is applied to every individual and between each \"cutting site\" (k, k+1), I do not see how the fitness gap $\\Delta = f(G) - \\bar{f}$ can reflect which genes/bits should be bound together w.h.p.
