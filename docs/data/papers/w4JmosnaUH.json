Despite their progress in facilitating rapid deployment for downstream tasks, off-the-shelf scFMs still have some overlooked concerns: (I) (\\textit{Pretraining Cost.}) Pretrain-based scFMs necessitate pretraining on a vast volume of cells, rendering it draining resources in applications. (II) (\\textit{Heterogeneous Gap.}) Large Language Models (LLM)-based scFMs ignore the tremendous heterogeneous gap between LLM textual and raw cellular spaces, leading to insufficient capability when facing downstream tasks. To this end, we introduce RAGCell, a versatile single-cell analysis framework that achieves a double-win in both \\textbf{cost-effectiveness} and \\textbf{high performance}. The success of RAGCell lies in two key aspects: 1. Leveraging LLMs to construct cell-level and feature-level knowledge databases, which serve as supervision signals for training the cell model and significantly reduce the training cost ($>$pretrain-based scFMs). 2. Aligning cell representations with text embeddings from the bi-level knowledge databases, enabling knowledge transfer from textual spaces to cellular spaces and effectively mitigating the heterogeneous gap ($>$LLM-based scFMs).\nThrough extensive experiments on six downstream single-cell analysis tasks, we demonstrate that RAGCell achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art scFMs while operating at less than $\\sim$1/10 the cost of pretrain-based scFMs.", "tldr": "We introduce GAGCell, a versatile single-cell analysis framework that achieves a double-win in both cost-effectiveness and high performance.", "keywords": ["Computational Biology", "Large Language Models"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5cad4422d732d0920af8d410ea63d0aa7f00903e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "hqu2lO1ADO", "forum": "w4JmosnaUH", "replyto": "w4JmosnaUH", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1530/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission1530/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761301219244, "cdate": 1761301219244, "tmdate": 1761301219244, "mdate": 1761301219244, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
