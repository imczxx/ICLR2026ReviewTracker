Although CoT provides opportunities for improved interpretability and facilitates the monitoring of AI safety, the consistency between generated CoT and the model's actual reasoning process is not guaranteed. Models can output seemingly reasonable CoT that fails to reflect the true computational trajectory leading to the final answer. IIn this work, we introduce a novel approach called CoT Inversion to evaluate CoT faithfulness. We cast the problem in a probabilistic framework, viewing the genuine reasoning chain as a latent variable that mediates between the input and the answer. Leveraging variational inference with a scoring function, we infer this hidden CoT by effectively reversing the model's answer generation process; under our chosen variational family, the optimization reduces to an instance of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nFurthermore, we propose an explicit alignment objective that promotes similarity between the inferred latent CoT and the model's directly generated CoT, considering the explicit CoT as an informative and possibly unfaithful signal. Our approach enables the quantitative assessment of agreement between articulated and inferred reasoning processes, offering a practical metric of CoT faithfulness and strengthening our ability to interpret and trust the reasoning of language models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["language model"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e43bd8dbb57de9cbf888d635f15263c73ec70251.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the critical problem of faithfulness in CoT. The authors argue that the explicit CoT generated by LLM may not reflect the model's actual computational process, but could instead be a post-hoc rationalization. This discrepancy undermines the use of CoT for interpretability and safety monitoring.\n\nTo solve this, the authors propose CoT Inversion, a novel probabilistic framework to infer the \"true\" underlying reasoning. The core idea is to treat the genuine reasoning chain as a latent variable that mediates between an input and the final answer. The method then uses variational inference to \"reverse\" the generative process and infer this latent chain given the input and the answer.\n\nThe authors' goal is to use this framework to create a quantitative metric for CoT faithfulness by comparing the inferred chain with the explicit one.

Unclear definition of parameters: In section 4, Overview, the author defines $p_{\\theta}$ as answer $\\rightarrow$ z and $𝑞_{\\phi}$ as z $\\rightarrow$ CoT. However, in section 4.2, the author defines the likelihood as $p_{theta} (a | z,x)$, which means the $\\theta$ maps latent z and input x $\\rightarrow$ z.\n2. Theorem 2 Bound: It can exceed 1 when $p_{\\theta}(z^*|x)$is small. Looking at the theorem 2 proof, I'm a bit confused how the step 2 transformed from step 1. If we substitute the definition from step 1 into step 2, we get: $log p_{\\psi}(a|z) = [log p_{\\theta}(z|x) + log p_{\\theta}(a|z)] + log p_{\\theta}(a|z) - log p_{\\theta}(z|x)$, so we end up: $log p_{\\psi}(a|z) = 2 \\cdot log p_{\\theta}(a|z)$.\n\nSpecifying the discrete editor:   \nAlgorithm 1 relies on an editor 𝐸 \"proposing candidates (beam k) around c\" and a coordinate-ascent loop, but details are missing.\n\nInterpretation of Experiment Results:  \n1. The authors claim that style alignment is \"essential\" and \"ensures output efficiency and clarity\". However, the data in Table 3 shows that the \"w/o style align\" ablation achieves dramatically higher accuracy than the final \"Inversion CoT (Ours)\" model (e.g., 62.4% vs. 49.1% on GSM8k). This indicates that the style alignment, while making the output more concise, acts as a regularizer that significantly harms task performance. This is a critical trade-off, not a simple \"essential\" component for success.\n2. Ablations can be enhanced: there’s \"w/o style align\", \"w/o KL\", \"pause token\", but we need: (i) no discrete inversion, (ii) no VI (score search only), (iii) swap out the entropy weighting for a plain Levenshtein prior.\n3. Baselines for \"faithfulness\" should include self-consistency, self-verification, process supervision/critic models, and recent latent-reasoning or faithfulness probes, evaluated under the same measurement. Current comparisons (e.g., ReAct, ToT) in Table 4 do not clearly measure faithfulness versus diversity/entropy."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
