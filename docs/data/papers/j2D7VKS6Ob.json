Given that the variable Z is unobserved, it is unclear to me why we would want to estimate f_0 in this setting. Additionally, given that we actually cannot identify Z but only a coordinate-wise non-linear transformation, it is even less clear why identifying the function in Eq. (7) is useful (this also shows in the experiments, I believe; see below). The extrapolation problem considered in the second half seems much more clearly defined.\n- Concerns about experimental evaluation:\n  - Recovering latent representation experiments: Why does it make sense to use mean correlation coefficients here? Since the hidden components are only identifiable up to permutations and non-linearities, it seems that one would need a very different evaluation metric.\n  - IV experiments: In these experiments, the authors consider an evaluation metric where f_0 is a function of X and not of the hidden variable Z. All baselines should therefore be misspecified in this model, and even the proposed InfoIV method is not intended for this use case. At the very least, regular least-squares regression of Y on X should be applied here (which should actually perform best on the loss if I understand it correctly).\n  - Extrapolation: For the extrapolation experiment, I do not understand why in Fig. 2(b) the representations of the MMR (Rep4Ex) approach are worse but the extrapolation of Rep4Ex performs better (aren't the methods InfoIV and Rep4Ex the same apart from how they recover the latent representation, so better representations should lead to better extrapolation?).\n- Better clarity on assumptions and conditions would be helpful:\n  - Independence between A and eps is often written as required for IV although it is too strong; instead only E[eps|A] = 0 is needed (same is true for least-squares regression with X instead of A). Please be precise about which of them you need.\n  - Direct effect from A to X is not needed for IV but is needed for the extrapolation (I think), so it should not appear in Assumption 2.1 (it is also a much stronger assumption than P(X|A) not constant).\n  - In Section 4.3, I found it hard to follow which additional assumptions are needed (and which assumptions might not be needed) in the comparison with Rep4Ex."}, "questions": {"value": "- What application do you have in mind when you want to estimate the causal effects of the latent variables on the outcome?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "0isOJfjsx6", "forum": "j2D7VKS6Ob", "replyto": "j2D7VKS6Ob", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18799/Reviewer_qKPF"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18799/Reviewer_qKPF"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission18799/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761836174868, "cdate": 1761836174868, "tmdate": 1762999985300, "mdate": 1762999985300, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper explores the application of ICA-based identifiable deep generative models, particularly Ice-beem (Khemakhem 2022b), to instrumental variable (IV) settings in causal inference.

Treatments cannot be hidden; interventions require *full observability and control* over the variable in question. For instance, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demand extensive effort to *design treatment assignment mechanisms*, which drives their high cost. While theoretically possible, the paper's latent treatment assumption lacks grounding in real-world applications. The authors should identify or propose a plausible scenario where treatments are truly unobservable—none is evident here.\n\n   - **Inconsistent Notation**: Symbol usage is erratic and confusing, likely signaling the conceptual issue above. In the Introduction and Figure 1, $Z$ denotes the treatment; in Section 2, it shifts to $X$; and in Section 3, it reverts to $Z$. This inconsistency is extremely confusing.\n   - **Experiment (Section 5.2)**: The experiment treats observed images $X$—not latent variables—as the intervention target, directly contradicting the paper's latent treatment premise. This is unsurprising given the earlier critique: hidden treatments are incompatible with standard intervention paradigms.\n\n- **Weak Connection to IV Regression**: Identification and estimation in IV rely on observed treatments. In theory, it is okay to establish that treatments are recovered from ICA, but then, the method diverges fundamentally from IV. The paper's claim of a \"connection\" via latent recovery is superficial, resembling vague analogies (e.g., a two-stage least squares procedure). \n\n- **Unreasonable Noiseless Injection Assumption**: The model assumes deterministic injection from a low-dimensional treatment to high-dimensional covariates $X$, which is mathematically permissible but practically implausible. Even if their dimensionality is the same, in real settings, treatments are rarely deterministically related to covariates. Also, consider causal directions: under what conditions does a treatment affect *all* covariates, deterministically or up to some noise? None comes to mind. Moreover, introducing additive noise (a bit more realistic) would likely invalidate the current estimation approach and still doesn't make the setting very convincing.\n\n- **Omission of Key Related Work**: The paper neglects recent advances in ICA-based causal effect methods, based exactly on Independently Modulated Component Analysis (IMCA; Khemakhem et al., 2020a,b).
