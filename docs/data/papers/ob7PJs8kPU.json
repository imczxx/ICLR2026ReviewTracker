In addition, the assumptions behind the statement \"Because every patch of a synthetic image is itself generated, each inherently contains artifacts\" need further clarification (e.g., what \"artifacts\" are and why generative models produce them across every pixel).\n- The details for the \"Experiments\" in Lines 154-157 are not specified.\n- Given that \"a single patch contains sufficient information for reliable discrimination\" (Line 157), it seems unnecessary to emphasize the utilization of all patches. This point may not support the *All Patches Matter* principle.\n2. It seems that the attention maps in Figure 3(a) can be explained by the observations in [1] that vision transformers tend to utilize patch tokens in low-informative background areas as registers for aggregating global information. Repeating the visualization experiments with vision transformers with dedicated registers proposed in [1] may eliminate this possibility. Besides, the acquisition of the attention maps needs explanation.\n4.

In the second paragraph of the introduction, the term *“patch”* appears for the first time but lacks a clear definition or motivation. Since AIGI detection includes many CNN-based detectors that do not explicitly rely on patch-level representations, introducing the patch concept without clarification may confuse readers about its relevance to this task. It is recommended that the authors explain why they adopt patch as the basic analytical unit and cite related works that have previously used patch-based approaches, which would make the motivation more convincing.\n2. In line 364, the reference of SAFE is wrong.\n3. In Tables 3 and 4, I notice that all baseline methods are trained on GAN-based datasets, while the proposed PPL is consistently trained on SDv1.4 (a diffusion-based model). Although it is reasonable to fix one generator for evaluating generalization, different training datasets may have biases toward different test distributions (e.g., a model trained on diffusion data may generalize better to diffusion-based test sets). Therefore, I suggest that the authors also report results trained on a GAN-based dataset for these two benchmarks.

This makes the proposed patch-level principles feel incremental rather than conceptually new.\n- Similarly, although the proposed PPL framework is shown to be effective, it is essentially an engineering-level refinement rather than a fundamentally new paradigm. The core idea of RPR is to move the DRCT-style diffusion reconstruction from the image level down to the patch level, while PCL is a straightforward application of supervised contrastive learning at the patch-token level.\n- The paper relies on TDE for attribution. However, TDE does not appear to be a commonly adopted attribution method in deep learning. Why not use more standard interpretability approaches, such as Grad-CAM and its variants, or LRP (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) [1], to explain what the detector is actually using?\n- The paper focuses primarily on CLIP, DINOv2, and other ViT-style backbones, while largely ignoring CNN-based detectors. This raises an important question: do the core principles proposed in this paper still hold under CNN-based architectures?\n- Going further, [2] uses Guided-GradCAM and LRP as attribution methods, extracts transferable forensic features from different layers of a CNN-based detector, and maps them back to the input image patches. The results indicate that color statistics are a key signal for CNN-based forgery detectors, rather than an extreme reliance on a few spatial patches. Different layers highlight different input regions. This behavior is not the same type of bias that the authors call “Few Patch Bias.” Therefore, the bias analysis in this paper may not generalize to CNNs, and it is not yet convincing that the claimed principles are architecture-agnostic.\n\n[1] Transformer Interpretability Beyond Attention Visualization\n\n[2] Discovering Transferable Forensic Features for CNN-generated Images Detection"}, "questions": {"value": "1.
