However, current feed-forward approaches typically predict a fixed number of pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives, leading to significant redundancy. Naively pruning these Gaussians creates severe visual artifacts, necessitating fine-tuning that compromises the feed-forward nature. We introduce GaussianTrim3R, a novel framework for controllable and feed-forward 3D Gaussian representation method which gradually prunes 3D Gaussians and simultaneously adjusts the attributes of remaining Gaussians maintaining rendering quality, thus eliminating the need for finetuning 3D Gaussians post pruning. To achieve this, we construct SuperClusters by partitioning the 3D scene based on spatial and color attributes. By leveraging Discrete Wavelet Transform, we assign and rank texture complexity to these SuperClusters, enabling selective, texture-aware pruning. Doing so enables our method to directly predict attribute-adjusted Gaussians, thereby preserving scene integrity.

As such, I think it's worthwhile to see if this work can be applied in scenarios beyond two views. \n\nThis also has ramification to comparisons. The baselines that GaussianTrim3R compare with are all designed for multi-view reconstruction, not two-view reconstruction. Particularly, if the original gaussians are not maintained and are pruned instead, it is very hard for these methods to recover the 3D scene, which is conventionally known. As such, these baselines are not very useful - more useful baselines may be e.g., InstantSplat or SPARS3R, which work on sparse view reconstruction. E.g., for InstantSplat, the setting is that existing initialization will not be pruned, and it maybe useful to see the effectiveness of these methods if the initialization can be pruned. \n\nThe ablation shows that, random pruning/no contextual mask lead to similar performance at 40% pruning, indicating that there is a lot of redundancy in feedforward GS methods, though the 0% pruning GS metric is not posted.

The gap of 8 dB seems phenomenal, but upon some reflection, it makes sense because the baselines apply pruning methods after generating Gaussians, whereas GaussianTrim3R’s GS Head directly generates hole-free scenes by leveraging a mask. I suggest a baseline that first generates pixel-wise initial Gaussians using the Mast3r backbone with some trainable Initial GS Head, then applies pruning methods to these initial Gaussians. Based on the pruning scores, a mask map can be generated and concatenated with the Mast3r features before passing into the another GS Head, similar to what GaussianTrim3R does after the Mask Generation Module. This ensures that pruning methods are applied before final Gaussian generation, making it a fairer baseline.\n* The pruning method explored in this paper is limited to scene-level pruning. I suggest considering pixel-level pruning (Liu et al., EfficientGS: Streamlining Gaussian Splatting for Large-Scale High-Resolution Scene Representation, IEEE MM 2025), which ensures at least one Gaussian per ray and avoids holes.\n* Ambiguous definition of “adaptive allocation” (line 455): where does the “adaptive” property come from? How is it related to disabling the training of the “Gaussian Head” in the “Without Gaussian Adaptation” ablation study?\n* From an efficiency perspective: please report inference latency (fps or milliseconds).
