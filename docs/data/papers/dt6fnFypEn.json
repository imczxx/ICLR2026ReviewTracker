However, training LVLMs with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is computationally expensive, posing a significant challenge to scaling model size. In this work, we propose ProxyThinker, an inference-time technique that enables large models to inherit the visual reasoning capabilities from small, slow-thinking visual reasoners without any training. By subtracting the output distributions of base models from those of RFT reasoners, ProxyThinker modifies the decoding dynamics and successfully elicits the slow-thinking reasoning demonstrated by the emerged sophisticated behaviors such as self-verification and self-correction. ProxyThinker consistently boosts performance on challenging visual benchmarks on spatial, mathematical, and multidisciplinary reasoning, enabling untuned base models to compete with the performance of their full-scale RFT counterparts. Furthermore, our implementation efficiently coordinates multiple language models with parallelism techniques and achieves faster inference compared to previous decoding-time methods, paving the way for the practical deployment of ProxyThinker.

The paper is exceptionally well-written, clearly articulated, and easy to follow. The motivation is strong and well-grounded, directly addressing the significant and timely challenge of improving the scalability of reinforcement learning for large-scale VLMs.\n\n2. The core idea is highly intuitive and logically sound. It builds upon the key insight that RFT methods like GRPO often do not introduce new external knowledge but rather reshape the model's output distribution to elicit a step-by-step reasoning process. The authors astutely hypothesize that if this capability is already latent within a large instruction-tuned model, it can be unlocked via a direct, inference-time decoding control mechanism. This work provides a feasible and effective solution that validates this hypothesis with impressive results.\n\n3. This research could pioneer a new and more scalable paradigm for building powerful reasoning systems. It suggests a practical \"division of labor,\" where intensive and costly reinforcement learning is focused on creating compact, specialized \"expert\" models. Larger, more general models could then be trained primarily with SFT and efficiently endowed with these specialized reasoning skills at inference time through interaction, paving a more sustainable path for model development."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Lack of Principled Analysis on Expert Model Selection: The paper's primary contribution relies on guidance from a small \"expert\" model, yet the criteria for selecting this expert seem somewhat ad-hoc. While the authors experiment with three public models chosen based on \"differing training paradigms and data selection strategies\" (line 259), the paper falls short of addressing a crucial question: What properties define an optimal expert for the PROXYTHINKER framework? A deeper investigation is needed into the essential characteristics an expert must possess. For instance, is it absolute accuracy, the diversity of reasoning paths, or the magnitude of the logit shift post-RFT? A more solid contribution would involve discussing these factors and perhaps even exploring how one might intentionally train a more effective, targeted expert model specifically for this guidance role. Such an analysis would significantly enhance the paper's impact and provide more concrete guidance for the community.\n\n2. Limited Generalizability of Base Models: The empirical validation exclusively uses models from the Qwen2.5-VL series as the base model. While these are strong models, this narrow selection raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method. It is plausible that the success of PROXYTHINKER is partially contingent on the specific latent reasoning capabilities inherent in the Qwen architecture and its instruction-tuning process. The paper's claims would be substantially more robust if the authors demonstrated effectiveness on other diverse and widely-used LVLM families (e.g., InternVL / LLaVA-OV). Without such experiments, it remains an open question whether this is a universally applicable decoding technique or one that works particularly well for a specific class of models."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "MA8RWyaGnM", "forum": "dt6fnFypEn", "replyto": "dt6fnFypEn", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15310/Reviewer_nfVY"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15310/Reviewer_nfVY"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission15310/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761891691830, "cdate": 1761891691830, "tmdate": 1762925607754, "mdate": 1762925607754, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes PROXYTHINKER, a training-free decoding method that transfers “slow-thinking” visual-reasoning behaviors from a small RFT-trained expert VLM to a larger base VLM by adding a logits delta at every generation step.

Empirical gains on visual reasoning tasks: ProxyThinker consistently improves accuracy on spatial and math reasoning benchmarks. In many cases the base VLM closes most of the gap to a fully RFT-trained model.

Overall, the novelty of the proposed method is under par. ProxyThinker closely mirrors existing logit-guidance techniques. The existence of current methods, like DExperts, Proxy-Tuning and DoLa, makes the ProxyThinker not novel enough.\n\n2. Weak justification for VLM-specific focus. The authors motivate the work by the expense of RFT on large VLMs, but they do not identify any modality-specific challenge that makes ProxyThinker inherently necessary for vision. The technique appears generic and could equally apply to language-only reasoning tasks.\n\n3. Although the gains are statistically significant, they are small (often only a few percentage points).

A Significant Trade-off in Reasoning Diversity (Pass@k): The paper's claim of \"striking a balance\" in reasoning exploration (Sec 4.2) is an oversimplification. The data in Figure 5 clearly shows that while Pass@1 performance (greedy decoding) is improved, the Pass@k performance for $k>4$ drops below that of the unguided base model. This suggests the guidance narrows the large model's reasoning diversity, forcing it down the single \"slow-thinking\" path favored by the small expert. This trade-off—improving the single best answer at the cost of exploratory reasoning capacity—is a major weakness that is not sufficiently discussed.\n\n2. Unexplored Mechanism of Action: The paper's central hypothesis—that the logit delta $(z_{\\text{expert}} - z_{\\text{Amateur}})$ isolates a scalable, model-agnostic \"reasoning vector\"—is demonstrated that it works but not why it works. The ablation in Figure 4 proves that subtracting the amateur model is critical, but the paper provides no deeper analysis into the nature of this delta. Is it merely up-weighting a shared vocabulary of \"reasoning tokens\" (e.g., \"Wait,\" \"let's check\"), or is it manipulating a deeper, abstract representation of the reasoning process? The simplicity of the mechanism makes this lack of explanation a significant gap.\n\n3. The method's effectiveness is strictly bounded by the small expert's capabilities.\n- As admitted in Appendix A.4, the method fails on knowledge-intensive tasks (like MMMU) where the small expert lacks the requisite knowledge. It cannot transfer knowledge, only reasoning patterns, and a correct pattern applied to incorrect knowledge still fails.\n\n- As shown in Appendix B.2, a low-quality expert results in negative transfer, actively harming the large model's performance. This implies the method is not a universal booster; it requires a small expert that is both knowledge-sufficient for the domain and has been RFT-trained to a high-quality \"floor.\""}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could you elaborate on the Pass@k trade-off? Do you view the loss of reasoning diversity (worse Pass@k performance) as an acceptable price for the gain in Pass@1 performance? Does this imply RFT-style reasoning (at least as captured by this method) inherently prunes other valid reasoning paths?\n\n2. Could you elaborate on why a simple logic delta could work so well, and what might be the premise of the success achieved from applying this logit delta? Following on Weakness #2, what is in the delta $(z_{\\text{expert}} - z_{\\text{Amateur}})$? Have you analyzed its composition? For instance, does the delta vector's direction change over a reasoning trace, perhaps pushing toward \"sub-goal\" tokens at the start and \"verification\" tokens near the end? A temporal analysis of the delta's top-k components would be fascinating.\n\n3. The knowledge bottleneck (Appendix A.4) is a key limitation. How do you see this method performing on tasks that are a tight mix of reasoning and knowledge? Is there a risk that the small, knowledge-poor expert could misguide the large, knowledge-rich base model into a factually incorrect but \"well-reasoned\" answer?\n\n4. Given that a poor expert causes \"negative transfer\" (Table 5), how should one practically determine if a small expert is \"good enough\" to be a PROXYTHINKER? Its own standalone accuracy seems unreliable (e.g., the OpenVLThinker-7B had only 25.3% on MathVision but gave a positive boost).
