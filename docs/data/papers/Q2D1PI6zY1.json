Those that do exist typically hold only in restrictive settings: either they rely on regular or higher-order tensor representations, leading to impractically high-dimensional hidden spaces, or they target specialized architectures, often confined to the invariant setting. This work develops a more general account. For invariant networks, we establish a universality theorem under separation constraints, showing that the addition of a fully connected readout layer secures approximation within the class of separation-constrained continuous functions. For equivariant networks, where results are even scarcer, we demonstrate that standard separability notions are inadequate and introduce the sharper criterion of *entry-wise separability*. We show that with sufficient depth or with the addition of appropriate readout layers, equivariant networks attain universality within the entry-wise separable regime.

Existing universality theorems often rely on highly restrictive assumptions—such as regular or higher-order tensor representations that induce prohibitively large hidden dimensions, or architectures that are restricted to the invariant case. The authors develop a more general and unified theoretical framework that encompasses both invariant and equivariant networks. For invariant architectures, they prove a universality theorem under separation constraints, showing that the inclusion of a fully connected readout layer enables universal approximation within the class of separation-constrained continuous functions. For equivariant networks, where existing results are even rarer, the paper identifies a key limitation of standard separability assumptions and introduces the concept of entry-wise separability, a stronger and more suitable criterion. The authors prove that equivariant networks achieve universality within this regime, provided they have sufficient depth or appropriate readout layers. Together with earlier results showing the failure of universality for shallow models, this work highlights depth and readout structure as fundamental mechanisms for universality.

The authors provide a unified, architecture-agnostic framework that cleanly separates the roles of separation, depth, and readout layers, resolving long-standing confusion about why models with identical separation power can differ in approximation power. The introduction of entry-wise separability is a crisp and genuinely new lens that both diagnoses the failure of standard separability to characterize equivariant universality and supplies the right notion under which strong theorems can be proved. The results are conceptually satisfying and practically meaningful: for invariants, a fully connected readout restores universality within the separation-constrained class; for equivariants, universality emerges either after finite depth stabilization or via specific output layers that act as equivariant analogues of readouts. These statements not only subsume and extend prior specialized results but also give a reassuring message for practice—maximal expressivity is reached at finite depth, avoiding the specter of unbounded “depth chasing.” The presentation is mathematically careful (clear definitions, clean statements, explicit assumptions) and the work advances the field by turning an intuitively appealing idea—that symmetry should guide learning—into a rigorous set of principles that explain when and how symmetry-respecting networks are universal."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "While the paper offers a clean and unified treatment, its contribution risks being perceived as incremental given a substantial body of prior work on universality for symmetry-aware models (invariant and equivariant networks, WL-based expressivity, PointNet/graph settings, and regular-representation proofs). The central message—that depth and readout layers restore universality under separation constraints—resonates with, and in places refines, known intuitions; however, the practical novelty over existing universality theorems may feel limited without sharper separations or new, unexpected consequences. Methodologically, the results hinge on point-wise activations and permutation representations under finite groups, leaving unclear how far the theory extends to continuous/compact Lie groups, non-pointwise nonlinearities, or mixed representation stacks that are common in modern E(3)/SO(3) models. The proposed entry-wise separability is mathematically convenient but may be difficult to verify or estimate in practice, and its relationship to measurable statistics used by practitioners (e.g., tensor orders, message-passing depth, spectral gaps) is not yet operationalized. The universality guarantees are asymptotic and do not provide approximation rates, sample complexity, or robustness to model misspecification—key levers for assessing when added depth/readouts actually help. Moreover, the theory presumes or requires stabilization of separation with depth but offers limited guidance for identifying the stabilization threshold for concrete architectures. Finally, the paper is purely theoretical: without constructive recipes, empirical probes, or optimization analysis, it remains uncertain how the results translate into trainable, parameter-efficient designs under real-world constraints."}, "questions": {"value": "Here are reviewer-style questions that incorporate your points:\n1.\tGeneralization error and sample complexity. Your results are asymptotic in function approximation. Can the framework yield generalization bounds—e.g., via Rademacher or covering-number control of the neural spaces—expressed in terms of the entry-wise separation profile, the depth at which separation stabilizes, and the size/structure of the readout? In particular, can you derive sample complexity or margin-based bounds that certify when added depth/readout improves test error rather than only representation capacity?\n2.\tFunction spaces beyond continuity. Universality is stated over continuous functions. Can you extend the results—or obtain rates—for other spaces such as L^p, Hölder/Sobolev/Besov, BV, or Barron-type spaces? Is entry-wise separability compatible with norms/seminorms in these spaces so that one can state approximation theorems with explicit error decay under smoothness or spectral assumptions?\n3.\tConnections to integral representations of shallow nets. Classical approximation theory links shallow networks to integral representations (ridgelet transform, Barron spaces, Radon-type decompositions). Is there a formal relationship between your entry-wise separability (or separation stabilization with depth) and the spectral measures that appear in ridgelet/Barron analyses? For instance, can depth plus an appropriate readout be interpreted as enforcing or approximating certain ridgelet spectra or moment constraints, and do your results recover known rate results in Barron regimes or suggest new ones for equivariant settings?\n4.\tOperational criteria. Practically, how can one estimate or test entry-wise separability (and its stabilization depth) from finite data or from an architecture’s design (e.g., filter classes, tensor orders)? Are there computable proxies (e.g., spectral norms of intertwiners, orbit counts, WL-width analogs) that permit a-priori generalization guarantees or architecture selection?\n5.\tRobustness and misspecification. Can your theory quantify how approximation/generalization degrades under model misspecification (e.g., when the true target violates the assumed separation relations slightly), or under noisy labels/inputs? Are there stability bounds for the entry-wise notion analogous to Lipschitz-type robustness?\n6.\tFrom existence to construction. Your theorems are existential. Do they imply constructive schemes (e.g., explicit readout designs or depth schedules) that achieve provable approximation rates and generalization bounds in the above function spaces, perhaps by leveraging ridgelet-inspired initialization or kernel/NTK limits adapted to entry-wise separability?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "35FCGQFNbO", "forum": "Q2D1PI6zY1", "replyto": "Q2D1PI6zY1", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22747/Reviewer_hN6i"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22747/Reviewer_hN6i"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission22747/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761199550483, "cdate": 1761199550483, "tmdate": 1762942369704, "mdate": 1762942369704, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors show a separation-constrained universality theorem for invariant networks, and they extend the result to the case of equivariant networks by introducing the notion of entry-wise separability."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "The authors theoretically investigate separation-constrained universality for invariant and equivariant settings.
