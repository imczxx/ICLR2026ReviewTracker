While recently proposed conditional diffusion models achieve high fidelity, they typically require hundreds of stochastic sampling steps at inference. We introduce a rectified-flow framework that learns a time-dependent velocity field, transporting input to output distributions along nearly straight trajectories. By casting sampling as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) along this straighter flow field, our method makes each integration step much more effective, using as few as eight steps versus (more than) 128 steps in standard score-based diffusion, without sacrificing predictive fidelity. In addition, we develop a curvature-aware integration scheme that monitors local path straightness and adaptively regularizes the velocity and step size, improving stability and accuracy at essentially no training cost. Experiments on challenging multiscale flow benchmarks show that rectified flows recover the same posterior distributions as diffusion models, preserve fine-scale features that MSE-trained baselines miss, and deliver high-resolution samples in a fraction of inference time.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["pde", "cfd", "flow", "diffusion", "rectified flow", "statistical"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/24cd4e2e044a2f4527568adcfeedee06381ada9e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/bac7303f956056157e67d186524b22e2f7815c7d.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposed a rectified flow-based algorithm to model fluid flows in an end-to-end manner.

Rectified Flows and other related transport learning methods (Diffusion, Flow Matching, Stochastic Interpolants etc.) are now considered very well known and established in ML with applications to generative models and density modeling. This paper appears to be a direct application of Rectified Flows for the purpose of learning a transport map for fluids with little technical innovation on the method itself. Perhaps, this application and it’s results would appeal more at a venue oriented towards applied methods for physical systems. This direcltiy mismatch in venue is direct source of the next weakness\n- Novelty: The paper is a straightforward application of Rectified Flows in a different domain. Albeit a potentialliy new integration scheme is proposed, it would at best best considered relatively minor contribution (more on this in the next point). Lot’s of the observed properties in this paper, resulting from Rectified Flows, are expected to result from their use, though likely not verified in this domain.\n- The integration scheme, could potentially be novel, however it’s empirical evaluation is lacking. Ideally, various integrators would be compared and their computation/accuracy tradeoff would be compared. Note that a lot of work exists in the space of faster sampling from diffusion/transport models, including learning straigher trajectories and deterministic maps(Rectified Flows, DDIM etc.), K-Rectification, Distillation etc to name a few. Further, coupled with the fact that all these transport learning methods are related, in that they learn stochastic/deterministic transport, and mostly differ in their noise schedules and training objective, a different method/noise schedule may be ideal for different applications/problems. \n- Non-uniqueness of Sampling/Integration scheme: In addition, for any of these learned models, a variety of samplers could be constructed (including deterministic/various stochastic c.f. Singh and Fisher, Stochastic Sampling from Deterministic Flow Models) and used interchangeably, though with different properties.\n\nOverall, I don’t think ICLR is the right venue for this paper. It appears to be a applied paper in physics domain of fluid flow modeling. An appropriate venue would be a better judge of the impact of this application of Rectified Flows in that field. From an ML perspective, I don’t see significant novelty.
