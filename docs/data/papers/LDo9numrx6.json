Research Problem**\n\n* Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial and noisy perturbations that destabilize their dynamics. The existing *Membrane Potential Perturbation Dynamic* (MPPD) technique empirically improves robustness but lacks solid theoretical grounding.\n* The paper tries to reveal mathematical nature of MPPD, and how can it be formalized to enhance SNN robustness in a principled way.\n\n#### **2. Proposed Method**\n\n* The authors prove that MPPD is mathematically equivalent to Total Variation (TV)\n* Based on this equivalence, they introduce the MPPD–TV–ℓ₁ framework, extending prior ℓ₂-based formulations (MPPD–TV–ℓ₂).\n\n\n#### **3. Theoretical Contributions**\n\n* Rigorous proof that MPPD is TV under measurable perturbations.\n* Establishment of a new TV–ℓ₁ regularization theory for SNNs, encompassing:\n\n  * The coarea formula specific to SNN membrane dynamics.\n  * A dominated TV property showing layer-wise boundedness of perturbations.\n  * A closed-form subgradient that enables backpropagation through non-smooth TV terms.\n\n#### **4.
