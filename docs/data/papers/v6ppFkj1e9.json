However, their performance significantly declines when generating content at resolutions higher than those used during training. Although numerous methods have been proposed to enable high-resolution generation, they all suffer from inefficiency. In this paper, we propose RectifiedHR, a straightforward and efficient solution for training-free high-resolution synthesis. Specifically, we propose a noise refresh strategy that unlocks the model’s training-free high-resolution synthesis capability and improves efficiency. Additionally, we are the first to observe the phenomenon of energy decay, which may cause image blurriness during the high-resolution synthesis process. To address this issue, we introduce average latent energy analysis and find that tuning the classifier-free guidance hyperparameter can significantly improve generation performance. Our method is entirely training-free and demonstrates efficient performance. Furthermore, we show that RectifiedHR is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as image editing, customized generation, and video synthesis. Extensive comparisons with numerous baseline methods validate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of RectifiedHR.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diffusion Model"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/55b3d939054108790d586a6ee648cbc12c0656e1.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/02dd83a7b46d4993f8e2e986ac494486fded0cad.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a train-free method for high-resolution image generation.

The core contribution centers on “energy rectification,” posited as essential for reducing image blurriness at high resolutions. However, the link between energy levels and image quality is not convincingly justified. The concept of “energy decay” as the cause of blurriness lacks a solid theoretical explanation, and the argument for why this decay specifically degrades image fidelity remains unsubstantiated.\n2. The noise refresh technique itself is not conceptually novel and resembles existing resolution-refreshing or re-noising operations seen in prior training-free diffusion approaches, for example in [4].\n3. While the paper discusses the relationship between energy decay and the loss of high-frequency components, it does not clearly establish why or how this decay directly harms high-frequency details. This ambiguity weakens the claimed novelty of the energy rectification module.\n4. The adaptive tuning of the CFG parameter across timesteps is already a well-established practice in diffusion research. Prior studies—such as Kynkäänniemi et al. [1], Malarz (2024) [2], and Castillo [3]—have explored step-wise and adaptive CFG tuning extensively. Yet, the paper provides limited discussion or comparison with these works.\n5. The effectiveness of RectifiedHR appears to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly the timing and magnitude of CFG adjustments, which raises concerns about generalizability.\n6. Although energy rectification is proposed as a novel mechanism to counter energy decay, the paper does not adequately differentiate it from related ideas such as SNR correction or existing CFG optimization techniques. A deeper comparative analysis would clarify whether the observed improvements arise from genuinely new principles or simply from parameter tuning.\n\n[1] Tuomas Kynkäänniemi, et al.
