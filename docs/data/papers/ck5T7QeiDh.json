Conformal prediction calibrates the threshold on a score function (confidence measure) of hypotheses without altering their order. The paper uses likelihood values as a measure of confidence (although it does not explicitly mention this). However, previous research on ASR has shown that likelihood values are a poor indicator of confidence [Li et al., Ravi et al.]. These likelihood values are often highly overconfident, and they are not able to correctly order the hypotheses. Simple thresholding may not yield significant performance improvements. BTW, [Li et al., Ravi et al] perform only top-label calibration, but works such as [Popordanoska et al.] can provide canonical calibration, which can be used to provide N-hypotheses.\n- Again, the title of the paper highlights conformal risk control, but the experiments do not talk about controlling the risk.

Instead of controlling for absolute error, the framework is cleverly designed to control the expected relative word error rate (WER) degradation compared to the best achievable performance (the \"post-LLM oracle\") for that specific input. This is achieved by calibrating a threshold $\\lambda$ on normalized ASR confidence scores, which in turn determines the set size $n$4.

The use of standard benchmarks (HyPoradise) , strong ASR and LLM models (Whisper and LLaMA-2-7B) , and relevant metrics  provides a strong empirical foundation. The ablation study in Appendix D (Table D.2) effectively justifies the experimental design choice of training the H2T model on fixed N=5 sets while evaluating on variable-sized inputs.\n\nHowever, there is a significant gap between the theoretical claims and the implementation. The Conformal Risk Control framework (Angelopoulos et al., 2024b) formally requires a bounded, monotone loss function to provide its distribution-free guarantees. The authors forthrightly acknowledge in Section 5.2 that their chosen loss function (Eq. 10) is not strictly monotone, with violations observed in approximately 20% of samples.\n\nThey provide an empirical justification for this deviation, noting that applying the standard monotonizing procedure actually degrades performance. This is because their method's advantage comes, in part, from exploiting these non-monotonic cases where a smaller hypothesis set genuinely outperforms a larger one (a key insight illustrated in Fig 1a and Table 2) .\n\nWhile the empirical results are strong and the risk is empirically controlled, this violation means the method does not inherit the strict theoretical guarantees of CRC. The paper is thus a work of \"empirical risk control\" inspired by CRC, rather than a direct application of it. This theoretical-practical disconnect is the primary weakness in an otherwise sound paper.\n\nThe paper introduces a novel application of CRC to a practical and important problem in ASR: the computational overhead of fixed-size N-best lists for LLM-based error correction . The results demonstrate a clear path to more efficient and robust ASR systems."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Theoretical Gap (Monotonicity Violation). This is the most significant weakness. The CRC framework's guarantees depend on a monotone loss function. The authors explicitly state their loss (Eq. 10) is non-monotone for ~20% of samples. Their justification for proceeding is empirical: enforcing monotonicity (as suggested by Angelopoulos et al., 2024b) hurts performance because it prevents the model from exploiting \"good\" non-monotonic cases where fewer hypotheses are better . This is a reasonable empirical argument, but it invalidates the theoretical guarantees. The paper should be more precise in framing its contribution as an empirically robust method inspired by CRC, rather than one that provides CRC's guarantees.\n\n- The adaptive score function $\\phi_{\\gamma}$ (Appendix B.1) 44, while well-motivated by dataset noise characteristics 45, introduces dataset-specific hyperparameters $\\gamma$ and $\\tau$ (Table B.1).
