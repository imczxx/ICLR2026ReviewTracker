However, sparse reward structures in long-horizon tasks—where agents receive feedback only after completing episodes spanning 30+ turns—create fundamental training instabilities that existing entropy regularization methods fail to address. We identify a critical oscillation pattern: early steps rapidly converge to low-entropy states due to limited feedback signals, triggering compensatory entropy spikes in later steps that compromise task completion. To address this exploration-exploitation dilemma, we propose Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization (EPO), a novel framework designed for stable on-policy training in multi-turn settings. EPO introduces two key innovations: (1) an entropy smoothing regularizer that mitigates abrupt entropy fluctuations across extended trajectories, and (2) an adaptive weighting scheme that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on training progression. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating how entropy regularization prevents premature convergence in sparse reward environments. Extensive experiments on ScienceWorld and ALFWorld benchmarks show that EPO achieves up to 152\\% performance improvement over baseline methods while exhibiting significantly more stable training dynamics. Our results validate that properly designed entropy mechanisms are essential for successful multi-turn LLM agent optimization.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning; Large Language Models; LLM Agents"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/defa89c858bcf2124e74480772b1b411ce3beaa9.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper explores instability in large language model (LLM) agent training under multi-turn sparse-reward environments and identifies a phenomenon called the exploration–exploitation cascade failure.

Limited novelty: it is essentially a technical paper. The proposed method largely stitches together standard RL tricks (entropy regularization, episodic averaging, heuristic weighting) rather than presenting a fundamentally new idea. The contribution is incremental engineering at best. There is no principled theoretical insight bridging entropy dynamics and long-horizon failures beyond high-level motivation.\n\n2. Equation (6) has zero gradient: which means that the  core method does not work mathematically.\nEquation (6) uses a hard threshold indicator penalty\n$P_{n,t,i} \\in {(0,\\alpha)}$, which is piecewise constant w.r.t. entropy 𝐻. Therefore, almost everywhere zero gradient w.r.t. policy parameters $\\theta$. This means the core contribution has no optimization effect and all claimed behavior improvement must come from other terms. Thus the formal objective contradicts the claimed mechanism. This is a fundamental and fatal flaw.\n\n3. $β$ design is purely heuristic: the dynamic \n𝛽\nschedule is described in narrative form without theoretical grounding nor stability analysis. The schedule resembles a manually tuned hyperparameter annealing, lacking justification or ablation isolating its individual effect.\n\n4. Section 4.1 method has no novelty: the episodic entropy computation in Sec.4.1 is simply taking an average over timesteps instead of per-step entropy. This is a trivial formulation change that should be introduced in preliminaries, not a methodological innovation.\n\n\n5. Paper’s core assumption is unjustified: \nThe supposed phenomenon — entropy fluctuation directly causing cascading failures in long-horizon RL — is asserted without rigorous empirical evidence or theoretical reasoning. The link between entropy and cascade failure remains speculative: there is no causal analysis,\nno stress test isolating entropy as the factor and no ablation proving removing fluctuations solves the problem.\nThe claim reads opinion-driven, not science-driven.\n\n6.

The exploration-exploitation dilemma is a challenging problem in reinforcement learning. To address exploration-exploitation failures in multi-turn interactions, the authors adapt entropy regularization. Instead of calculating entropy per step (as in traditional RL), they compute it over the entire trajectory (across all turns) and then average these trajectory entropies across the batch. This method aims to better capture the long-term, compounding effects of early decisions. However, from the definition of the entropy-regularized policy loss, the policy loss is designed to reduce the bias between the real entropy and the expected entropy. The problem is whether the expected entropy will converge to a single value or a fixed range, preventing further exploration.\n\n2. The authors claim that entropy-controlled LLM methods are fundamentally inadequate for multi-turn agent environments because they suffer from an \"exploration-exploitation cascade failure.\" Sparse rewards and standard entropy regularization cause uncontrolled entropy growth early in the trajectory, leading to unstable and suboptimal decision patterns. The uncertainty accumulated from these flawed early steps then compounds, destabilizing the agent's behavior in later turns. It is curious why early-stage entropy exploration leads to accumulated uncertainty. Can the accumulated uncertainty be measured? Will late-stage entropy increase the accumulated uncertainty?
