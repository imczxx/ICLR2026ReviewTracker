To address this issue, we propose Contact-Rich Adaptive LLM-based Control (CoRAL), a novel modular framework capable of effectively managing complex, dynamic, and contact-rich manipulation tasks. By integrating foundational vision and language models with motion planning and reactive controllers, our system achieves zero-shot planning and adaptive manipulation without relying on extensive tele-operated action datasets. Unlike conventional VLAs, we explicitly separate the roles of vision models and Large Language Models (LLM): the vision module handles environmental parameter initialization and object pose tracking, while the LLM generates initial contact strategies and cost function estimations. This collaboration establishes a physical understanding of the scene, instantiated as a dynamic planning world model for our planner. Additionally, this modular approach significantly enhances both the explainability and performance of the overall framework, as demonstrated by ablation studies. Furthermore, we introduce a memory unit to leverage past manipulation experiences, enabling the generalization and efficient reuse of learned contact strategies and parameter adjustments across diverse manipulation scenarios.

The authors assume that only 2 values — mass and friction — of a single object need to be estimated. This is another strong assumption: the difficulty of physical parameter estimation grows combinatorially with number of objects or degrees of freedom. Even for the simple case discussed in the paper, there seem to be no physical parameter variations for each task. This does not systematically show the effectiveness of the module.

We noticed several consistent misunderstandings regarding our terminology, experimental setup, and the scope of our contributions. To ensure clarity we address these high-level concerns here. The manuscript has been revised to reflect these changes.\n\n**1. Renaming to CoRAL (Clarifying the Architecture):** Reviewers correctly pointed out that \"Contact-VLA\" implies an end-to-end trained model. To prevent this confusion and accurately reflect our modular architecture, we have renamed the method to **CoRAL (Contact-Rich Adaptive LLM-based control)**. We no longer use the term \"VLA\" to describe our method in the revised text.\n\n**2. Clarification of \"Real World\" Terminology (Sim-to-Sim Verification):** We acknowledge the confusion and have replaced \"real world\" with \"evaluation world\".\n\n* **Rationale:** We utilize two simulated environments: an internal planning world for MPPI rollouts and an external evaluation world where the agent executes actions, both within MuJoCo simulated environments.\n\n* **Validity:** We treat the evaluation world as a proxy for reality. As our perception modules operate strictly on RGB images without privileged states, the pipeline is architecturally identical to a physical deployment.\n\n**3. Continuous Action Space (No Motion Primitives):** CoRAL does **not** use motion primitives. It utilizes MPPI to optimize directly over a continuous 7-DoF action space. The LLM formulates the cost function, not skills.\n\n**4. Explicit Novelty Statement: \"LLM-as-a-Cost-Designer:\"** We respectfully disagree with the assessment that our contribution is limited to architectural modularity. Our primary novelty is the formulation of **LLM-as-a-Cost-Designer**. We introduce a paradigm where an LLM translates semantic goals into dense, continuous cost landscapes for MPPI.\n\n* **Why this matters:** This enables the zero-shot execution of complex, contact-rich behaviors (such as force regulation and pivoting) that end-to-end VLA models failed to learn in our benchmarks. The synergy of foundation models with physics-based planning, augmented by online parameter adaptation, offers a distinct and effective alternative to the data-heavy imitation learning paradigm.\n\n**5. Sufficiency of Physical Parameters:** Concerns were raised regarding the sufficiency of estimating only mass and friction. For the rigid-body contact manipulation tasks we target (pushing, pivoting, flipping), mass and surface friction are the dominant dynamics parameters.\n\n* **Robustness:** Crucially, our contribution is not the complexity of the initial estimate, but the adaptation mechanism. As shown in Figure 3, our system detects discrepancies and corrects these parameters online.\n\n**6. Safety and Explainability vs. Black-Box VLAs:** While we acknowledge that LLM-based planners lack formal stability guarantees, this remains an open challenge for the entire field of generative AI. However, CoRAL offers superior safety characteristics compared to the baselines:\n\n* **Transparency:** Unlike black-box VLAs, CoRAL exposes an explicit cost function that links behavior directly to optimization objectives.\n* **Refinement:** Our reactive loop allows the system to critique and correct its own strategies based on physical feedback before catastrophic failure occurs. We argue that this explicit \"reasoning visibility\" makes CoRAL safer for deployment than opaque end-to-end policies.\n\n**7. Upcoming Manuscript Additions: New Baselines & Visual Evidence** To further validate our claims and allow for a direct comparison with human expertise, we are currently finalizing the following additional analyses which will be incorporated into the manuscript shortly:\n\n* **Handcrafted Cost Baselines (Expert vs. LLM):** A key feature of CoRAL is the LLM's ability to propose cost functions with a finite state machine (FSM) structure (e.g., decomposing the \"Push and Pick Cutting Board\" task into a sliding phase and a grasping phase for). To benchmark this, we are working on two new baselines:\n\n    * **Handcrafted Multi-Phased Baseline:** An expert-designed cost function utilizing the same multi-phase logic. This will demonstrate the effectiveness of the LLM as a cost generator comparable to human experts.\n    * **Handcrafted Single-Phase Baseline:** An expert-designed cost function without phase decomposition. This will highlight the necessity of the high-level FSM strategy and the difficulty of solving these tasks with a single, monolithic cost function.\n* **Rollout Videos:** We are also preparing rollout videos of the baseline VLAs. These will serve two purposes: first, to visually demonstrate that the tasks involve complex dynamics that are non-trivial, refuting potential concerns about task simplicity; and second, to showcase the qualitative limitations of end-to-end VLAs, specifically highlighting their inability to master these contact-rich behaviors compared to CoRAL's successful executions."}}, "id": "bEV92TshvY", "forum": "qPbDM5L8tE", "replyto": "qPbDM5L8tE", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25221/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25221/Authors"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission25221/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763706331161, "cdate": 1763706331161, "tmdate": 1763706510263, "mdate": 1763706510263, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work proposes a modular robotic system built with a combination of LLMs, VLMs, pose estimators and motion planners for manipulation task.

However, this is an incorrect claim as experiments are only done in simulation. This is particularly relevant in the context of this work, where high fidelity model is often required for such contact-rich reasoning, which often induces a notable gap between simulation and the real world (for both real2sim reconstruction and sim2real transfer). While it is fine to only demonstrate simulation results and state its limitations, leaving the incorrect impression that the proposed method works in the real world is certainly a over claim.\n- Additionally, the method is named as “Contact-VLA”, which is also inaccurate. VLAs typically refer to end-to-end models finetuned from VLMs to directly produce actions. However, in this work, it is a modular approach that leverages a combination of VLMs and LLMs. As a result, it would also easily lead to incorrect expectation of the work.\n- Since the approach involves using MPPI for planning and is demonstrated only in simulation, it is unclear whether MPPI uses the same simulation environment as that being used for evaluation. If so, it would not establish a fair comparisons to OpenVLA or pi-0.5 since they do not assume access to the environment models.\n- The approach also appears to rely on a text-only LLM for specifying contact strategies and cost functions.
