The prevailing paradigm leverages features from a pre-trained encoder, where anomalies manifest as statistical outliers. However, a fundamental challenge persists: industrial defects vary dramatically in scale, making it difficult for a single model to detect them all effectively. This paper introduces a critical insight: a \"division of labor\" exists between different input resolutions. We find that low-resolution inputs excel at robustly recognizing the presence of anomalies by capturing global context, while high-resolution inputs are essential for refining their segmentation boundaries with precision. To harness this synergy, we propose Multi-Resolution Fusion (MRF), a simple yet powerful training-free strategy. MRF constructs a feature pyramid from the input space by processing an image at multiple resolutions. By fusing features from this pyramid, our method, MRF-AD, effectively combines the recognition capabilities of low-resolution views with the refinement capabilities of high-resolution ones. Extensive experiments show that MRF-AD achieves highly competitive, and in several cases state-of-the-art, results on challenging benchmarks like MVTec AD 2, proving the efficacy of our multi-resolution approach.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["anomaly detection", "anomaly localization", "unsupervised learning", "DinoV2"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2f3717c95f0c5860f1b3628eca61db8c91ab0acf.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a training-free anomaly detection method that leverages multi-scale DINOv2 features as a database.

Based on these two observations, MRF-AD builds multiple input-space views of each image at different resolutions and extracts features from several DINOv2 layers.
