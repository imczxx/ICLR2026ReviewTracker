Our kernel-guided contrastive learning framework learns to disentangle these signals by projecting embeddings into a structured subspace. In this space, each principle is centered on a learnable **prototype kernel**---an optimized vector that embodies its core meaning---while a jointly learned **semantic basis** preserves context. A novel **offset penalty**, a loss term designed to create structure, then enforces a margin around each prototype. This ensures that even semantically similar principles are clearly separated while capturing their inherent contextual variability. Experiments show our optimized embeddings significantly improve performance on principle classification and ordinal regression, outperforming few-shot Large Language Models and demonstrating the value of specialized representations for reliable principle evaluation.", "tldr": "This paper presents a novel learning framework that creates specialized text embeddings to more reliably evaluate abstract principles by representing each principle with a distinct \"prototype kernel\" and enforcing separation between them.", "keywords": ["Contrastive Learning", "Semantic Embeddings", "Principle Alignment", "Structured Representation", "Prototype Learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d0d63d59e379d3904cc1b7b03af995434acc7de1.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/448c5d6756f3ab457bd6f1a7ca49abf534d6d745.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper concerns on evaluating whether synthetic text can adhere to human-defined principles.

Conceptual Ambiguity: “Principle Evaluation” vs. “Value Alignment Evaluation”\n\nThe paper frames its goal as “principle evaluation” but positions it as a step toward “value alignment evaluation.” The distinction is unclear:\n\n- Value alignment typically concerns consistency between model and human values.\n- Principle evaluation here appears to test adherence to explicit, human-defined rules.\n\nIf these are equivalent, standard alignment terminology should be used; if not, the boundary between the two should be clarified and the focus on “principles” justified. This ambiguity weakens the conceptual framing.\n\n### w2. Limited Experimental Coverage\n\nExperiments are limited to one embedding model (Jina v3) and three proxy datasets.\n\n- The tasks (emotion, sentiment, toxicity) evaluate classification separability but not “principle adherence” or “value alignment.”\n- Comparison with few-shot LLMs is not directly relevant, as prompting-based generation differs fundamentally from embedding-level evaluation. \n\nWithout alignment-specific benchmarks, it is difficult to assess whether the proposed framework advances value-alignment evaluation.\n\n### w3. Missing Alignment Evaluation Baselines\n\nIf the goal is value alignment evaluation, the paper should compare against existing alignment evaluators or benchmarks. Instead, it relies on few-shot LLMs and proxy tasks that assess classification rather than alignment. This makes it unclear whether the method improves on standard classification. If the task differs from conventional alignment evaluation, this distinction and its rationale should be explicitly stated.\n\n### w4. Use of “Kernel” Terminology\n\nThe paper uses “kernel” to describe learnable prototype vectors acting as embedding anchors. However, these are not kernel functions in the classical RKHS sense, and no kernelized similarity is applied. This unconventional terminology may confuse readers familiar with kernel methods. Unless a formal connection is provided, “prototype vectors” or “anchors” would be clearer.\n\n### w5. Limited Qualitative and Interpretability Analysis\n\nWhile t-SNE visualizations, kernel–principle correlations, and offset analyses illustrate geometric structure, they remain low-level and do not reveal how learned “principles” map to human-interpretable semantics. More qualitative examples or probing analyses (e.g., principle-specific attribution or activation studies) would strengthen the interpretability claims."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the Weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "17RZm2PKbH", "forum": "CSUqM5uNCC", "replyto": "CSUqM5uNCC", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16359/Reviewer_yaX4"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16359/Reviewer_yaX4"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16359/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762004649423, "cdate": 1762004649423, "tmdate": 1762926485224, "mdate": 1762926485224, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a kernel-guided contrastive learning framework that uses learnable prototype kernels and a novel offset penalty to restructure fixed embeddings, forcing disentanglement of principle-specific features for post-hoc evaluation"}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "The optimized embeddings consistently yield statistically significant performance improvements compared to raw features and demonstrably outperform few-shot LLMs on structured proxy tasks. \n\nThe resulting structured, low-dimensional subspace provides a reusable intermediate representation that simplifies downstream modelling and improves computational efficiency."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "TL;DR: while the work offers some performance improvements, the proposed method is largely an amalgamation of known techniques without significant novelty so I would not consider it appropriate for ICLR and suggest submitting to an alternative venue.\n\n*  Excessive Loss Complexity: The method relies on a highly composite loss function $L_{\\text{total}}$ combining five distinct, weighted terms (Contrastive, Offset, Classification, Orthogonality, Magnitude). This fragility implies that no single mechanism is robust, mandating extensive hyperparameter tuning (e.g., numerous $\\lambda$ weights, $\\tau$, $\\delta_{\\text{intra}}$, $\\delta_{\\text{inter}}$).\n*  Derivativity of Core Components: The introduction of \"learnable prototype kernels\" is an architectural modification of existing Prototypical Contrastive Learning (PCL), and the \"novel Offset Loss\" is fundamentally a configuration of standard metric learning distance margin constraints applied via Euclidean distance penalties.\n* Verification Gap in Problem Scope: The framework is motivated by the \"critical challenge\" of evaluating abstract principles (e.g., fairness, honesty, safety). However, empirical validation is confined to more measurable, structured proxy tasks, namely fine-grained emotion classification (GoEmotions), ordinal star ratings (Amazon Reviews), and binary toxicity detection. This validation scope avoids the subtle, context-dependent, and inherently subjective principles that prompted the research.\n* Non-Rigorous Baseline Comparison: The highlighted superior performance against few-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) lacks rigour. The comparison contrasts a specialized, supervised transformation network against generalist LLMs restricted to simple prompting.
