We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple Polygon Problem. Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one. The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation. Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving. Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Supervised Deep Learning", "Diffusion Models"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/cc5822ddab4210359222066bf0cdb27a4bf3d474.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents a novel pipeline that extends visual diffusion models to tackle complex geometric problems.

Since diffusion models are inherently stochastic, it would be helpful if the authors could further elaborate on how their approach ensures that generated solutions adhere to such constraints.\n2.

This bypasses traditional solvers and graph-based representations, recasting geometric reasoning as a learned generative task.\n\n3. Strong Empirical Results (in 2D): For the 2D tasks, the model produces solutions that are surprisingly high-quality and very close to optimal (e.g., an average length ratio of 1.0008 to the optimal Steiner tree).

No Extension to 3D: The most significant weakness, especially in the context of 3D vision, is the complete lack of 3D experimentation or discussion. The paper's claims of generality are unproven, as it's unclear how this pixel-space approach would scale to 3D representations. Obvious 3D extensions (e.g., 3D Steiner trees for skeletonization, maximal-volume simple polyhedra, or surface reconstruction from points or multi-view images) are never mentioned.\n\n2. Scalability of Representation: The reliance on 2D rasterization is a critical limitation. This approach scales quadratically with resolution ($N^2$) and introduces discretization errors (requiring a \"snapping\" post-processing step). A naive extension to 3D (e.g., voxels) would scale cubically ($N^3$) and be computationally prohibitive. \n\n3. Fragility on Harder Instances: The method's robustness is questionable as problem complexity increases. The \"Valid Trees Rate\" for the Steiner Tree problem (Table 2) plummets from 0.996 (for 10-20 points) to 0.334 (for 41-50 points). Similarly, the \"Valid Polygons Rate\" (Table 3) drops from 0.953 to 0.620 when moving from 7-12 points to 13-15 points. This suggests the approach may fail on real-world, large-scale (3D) geometric problems.\n\n4. Reliance on Post-processing: The method is not truly end-to-end. The model's image output must be converted back into a valid geometric structure using problem-specific heuristics (e.g., node detection, edge extraction, graph validation, and rigid snapping). This reliance on hand-crafted post-processing undermines the claim of a single, general framework."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the weakness part."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "KfWTzjXzmY", "forum": "ao9uaOLvi2", "replyto": "ao9uaOLvi2", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3983/Reviewer_4EKE"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3983/Reviewer_4EKE"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission3983/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761943036145, "cdate": 1761943036145, "tmdate": 1762917123958, "mdate": 1762917123958, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
