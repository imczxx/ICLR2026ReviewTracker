A detailed example is provided below.\n\nIn ML optimizer design, the process can be separated into two stages: normalization and smoothing (or denoising). Here, we outline a roadmap for designing an adaptive optimizer. We start with plain gradient descent:\n$$\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k - h \\nabla \\mathcal{L}\n$$\n\n1. Since the gradient in ML can be extremely large (gradient explosion) or very small (gradient vanishing), to guarantee stable descent, we need to normalize the gradient:\n$$\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k - h \\frac{\\nabla \\mathcal{L}}{|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}|}.\n$$\nThis uses only the direction of the gradient, while the step size is determined by the learning rate $h$.\n\n2. Another consideration is that the gradient we use is actually noisy, and normalization is sensitive to noise. For example, in 1-D, let the true gradient be $$\\nabla \\mathcal{L} = 0.01$$ and the noisy gradient be $$\\tilde{\\nabla \\mathcal{L}} = \\nabla \\mathcal{L} + \\eta,$$ where $\\eta$ is a small random noise, e.g., $\\eta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,0.01)$. After normalization:\n$$\n\\hat{\\nabla \\mathcal{L}} = \\operatorname{sign}(\\tilde{\\nabla \\mathcal{L}}),\n$$\neven a small negative noise, e.g., $\\eta = -0.015$, flips the update direction from $+1$ to $-1$. This illustrates that normalization amplifies noise effects, motivating the need for smoothing.\n\nTo reduce sensitivity to noise, we can adopt filters for the gradient and its magnitude:\n$$\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k - h \\frac{g_1(\\nabla \\mathcal{L})}{\\sqrt{g_2(|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}|^2)}}.\n$$\nIf we apply a filter only to the magnitude $|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}|^2$, it becomes the well-known RMSprop algorithm. When both $g_1$ and $g_2$ are exponential moving averages, it corresponds to Adam.\n\n3. Rewriting normalized gradient descent as \n$$\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k - h \\operatorname{sign}(\\nabla \\mathcal{L}),\n$$\nwe see that noise sensitivity comes from the discontinuity of $\\operatorname{sign}(\\cdot)$. A widely used approach is to introduce homogeneity:\n$$\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k - h |\\nabla \\mathcal{L}|^{1+\\alpha} \\operatorname{sign}(\\nabla \\mathcal{L}).\n$$\nThe function $|x|^{1+\\alpha} \\operatorname{sign}(x)$ is continuous at zero, which greatly reduces the effect of noise. For example, in 1-D, suppose the true gradient is $$\\nabla \\mathcal{L} = 0.01$$ and the noisy gradient is $$\\tilde{\\nabla \\mathcal{L}} = \\nabla \\mathcal{L} + \\eta,$$ with $\\eta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,0.01)$. Using homogeneous normalization,\n$$\n\\hat{\\nabla \\mathcal{L}}_\\text{hom} = |\\tilde{\\nabla \\mathcal{L}}|^{1+\\alpha} \\operatorname{sign}(\\tilde{\\nabla \\mathcal{L}}),\n$$\nwith, for example, $\\alpha = 0.5$, the update magnitude becomes\n$$\n|\\tilde{\\nabla \\mathcal{L}}|^{1.5} \\approx 0.005^{1.5} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-4}.\n$$\nThis is very small, so the effect of noise is greatly reduced, and the update direction is less likely to flip unexpectedly. This 1-D example demonstrates how homogeneous gradient scaling smooths the sensitivity to noise while retaining the stability benefits of normalized gradients.\n\nTo illustrate the effect of gradient magnitude regulation and implicit smoothing, consider another 1-D gradient descent example with learning rate $h = 0.1$.\n\n1. Plain gradient descent: For a large gradient, e.g., $\\nabla \\mathcal{L} = 5$, the update is\n$$\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k - h \\nabla \\mathcal{L} = \\theta_k - 0.1 \\times 5 = \\theta_k - 0.5,\n$$\nwhich is a very large step and may cause instability. For a small gradient, e.g., $\\nabla \\mathcal{L} = 0.01$, the update is\n$$\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k - 0.1 \\times 0.01 = \\theta_k - 0.001,\n$$\nwhich is very slow.\n\n2. Normalized gradient descent: For both $\\nabla \\mathcal{L} = 5$ and $\\nabla \\mathcal{L} = 0.01$, the normalized update is\n$$\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k - h \\operatorname{sign}(\\nabla \\mathcal{L}) = \\theta_k - 0.1,\n$$\nso the step size is constant. Large gradients are controlled, but small gradients are overemphasized, and the method is sensitive to noise.\n\n3. Homogeneous normalization: With exponent $\\alpha = 0.5$,\n$$\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k - h |\\nabla \\mathcal{L}|^{1+\\alpha} \\operatorname{sign}(\\nabla \\mathcal{L}) = \\theta_k - 0.1 |\\nabla \\mathcal{L}|^{1.5} \\operatorname{sign}(\\nabla \\mathcal{L}).\n$$\nFor $\\nabla \\mathcal{L} = 5$, the update is $0.1 \\times 5^{1.5} \\approx 1.12$. For $\\nabla \\mathcal{L} = 0.01$, the update is $0.1 \\times 0.01^{1.5} \\approx 3.2 \\times 10^{-5}$, much smaller than the normalized step $0.1$.  \n\nThis shows that homogeneous normalization rescales the step according to gradient magnitude, preventing large updates from exploding while reducing noise amplification for small gradients.\n\nThe above illustrates the advantages of homogeneity. In this paper, we adopt these advantages together with filtered gradients, which motivates the name \"homogeneous momentum\" for our approach."}}, "id": "KPAr5fz9Bh", "forum": "fHYzKTywr8", "replyto": "fHYzKTywr8", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10311/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10311/Authors"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10311/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762959433906, "cdate": 1762959433906, "tmdate": 1762959433906, "mdate": 1762959433906, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the HomM algorithm, which adaptively scales both the parameters and momentum in the optimization process.

Novelty\n\nThe proposed Homogeneous Momentum (HOMM) mechanism presents an innovative contribution to the field of optimization. By integrating homogeneity (scaling) and momentum, the authors introduce a fresh perspective on accelerating convergence within continuous-time dynamical systems. This integration is conceptually appealing because it unifies two distinct acceleration principles under a single framework, potentially offering both theoretical elegance and practical performance improvements. The idea of embedding homogeneity into a momentum-based optimizer appears novel and could inspire further developments in optimization dynamics and algorithmic design.\n\n2. Experimental Strength\n\nThe experimental section provides solid empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed HOMM. The authors compared HOMM against several widely used gradient-based optimizers, including SGD, ADMM, and other peer methods, across multiple benchmark tasks. The reported results demonstrate consistent performance gains in terms of convergence speed and solution quality. The empirical validation is well executed and suggests that HOMM generalizes effectively across different optimization landscapes. Additional ablation studies or sensitivity analyses (if included) further strengthen the experimental credibility. Overall, the experiments convincingly substantiate the claimed advantages of the proposed approach.\n\n3. Theoretical Analysis\n\nThe paper also provides a rigorous theoretical foundation. The authors establish finite-time convergence results under standard assumptions for both convex and non-convex objectives. The derivations appear mathematically sound and align with the framework’s design principles. The theoretical analysis contributes meaningful insight into why the proposed mechanism achieves improved convergence behavior and differentiates it from existing momentum-based methods. This analytical strength enhances the paper’s overall impact, bridging conceptual innovation with provable guarantees."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited Novelty\n\nThe conceptual contribution of Homogeneous Momentum (HOMM) appears incremental rather than groundbreaking. While the authors describe HOMM as a novel integration of homogeneity and momentum, the underlying formulation—particularly as presented in Equation (1)—relies heavily on the canonical momentum structure that has been well established in prior optimization frameworks, including ADMM and other momentum-based methods. The use of homogeneity as a scaling mechanism is not new, and the paper does not provide sufficient justification for how this particular combination represents a substantive theoretical advancement. Consequently, the proposed method lacks a clear differentiating factor that would establish it as a conceptual breakthrough within the optimization literature.\n\n2. Weak Experimental Design and Limited Scope\n\nThe experimental evaluation is relatively narrow in scope. The authors primarily benchmark HOMM against a small set of peer optimizers using limited datasets, such as CIFAR-100, which restricts the generalizability of the findings. To convincingly demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method, the evaluation should be extended to a broader range of benchmarks, including more challenging or domain-diverse datasets. For example, applying HOMM to medical imaging tasks (e.g., the ADNI dataset) or large-scale vision benchmarks would provide stronger empirical evidence of its robustness and adaptability. The current experimental setup, while adequate for preliminary validation, does not substantiate the claimed superiority of HOMM across different application domains.\n\n3. Outdated Evaluation Framework\n\nThe choice of model architecture further limits the strength of the experimental validation. The authors rely on an older deep neural network, ResNet-34, to evaluate performance. Given the rapid evolution of deep learning, such a model may no longer be representative of the current state of the field. To demonstrate the scalability and modern relevance of HOMM, the authors are encouraged to evaluate their approach on contemporary architectures and openly released large-scale models, such as recent Large Language Models (e.g., LLaMA 4). This would provide a more compelling test of the optimizer’s generalizability and efficacy in modern AI contexts.\n\n4. Incomplete Theoretical Analysis\n\nThe theoretical discussion in the paper is not comprehensive enough to support the claimed analytical rigor. Although the authors cite several works related to finite-time convergence, the provided proofs are high-level and omit essential details regarding convergence bounds and rate guarantees. In particular, the absence of discussion on key comparative results, such as the convergence bound of ADMM, typically \n$𝑂(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}})$, makes it difficult to assess the theoretical strength of HOMM. A deeper analysis connecting the proposed framework to established convergence theory, including explicit upper bounds or stability guarantees, would substantially strengthen the theoretical contribution.\n\n5. Limited Practical Applicability\n\nThe potential applications of HOMM appear constrained by the simplicity of the experimental design. The reported improvements are confined to standard image classification tasks using conventional architectures, which limits the relevance of the findings to more complex or real-world scenarios. To demonstrate broader impact, the authors should evaluate HOMM on more demanding tasks and models, such as transformer-based networks or multimodal large language models. Without such validation, the current results provide only limited evidence of HOMM’s scalability or applicability beyond simple benchmark problems."}, "questions": {"value": "Reviewer Questions and Suggestions\n\n1. Convergence Bound Analysis\nThe paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion and formal proof of the convergence bound of the proposed HOMM. Currently, the analysis focuses primarily on finite-time convergence, but it remains unclear how HOMM compares asymptotically with other state-of-the-art optimizers. For instance, if HOMM can achieve or surpass convergence rates such as $𝑂(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}})$ (typical of ADMM) or $O(\\frac{1}{T^{\\frac{1}{3}}$) (as in STORM), this would provide a compelling argument for its superior efficiency. Establishing such bounds, or at least providing a theoretical comparison, would substantially strengthen the theoretical contribution and position HOMM more clearly within the broader optimization landscape.\n\n2. Comparison with Advanced Optimizers (e.g., STORM)\nThe current experimental evaluation omits a comparison with recent “super-optimizers”, such as STORM and related adaptive momentum-based methods. Since these approaches are well recognized for their robustness and accelerated convergence in stochastic optimization, including them as baselines is essential. A direct comparison between HOMM and STORM would provide valuable empirical evidence of HOMM’s claimed advantages and help clarify its relative strengths and limitations. This would also enhance the paper’s credibility by situating the proposed method within the context of contemporary state-of-the-art optimizers.\n\n3. Expansion to Broader Datasets\nThe empirical validation is currently restricted to a limited set of natural image classification benchmarks. To demonstrate generalizability and broader applicability, it would be valuable to extend the experiments to diverse datasets or domains, such as medical imaging, text-based tasks, or multimodal benchmarks. Evaluating HOMM on datasets beyond standard image classification (e.g., ADNI or other high-dimensional biomedical datasets) would strengthen the experimental section and provide stronger evidence of the optimizer’s versatility across application domains.\n\n4. Discussion of Non-Smooth, Non-Convex Optimization\nIt would be valuable for the authors to discuss how HOMM performs in the context of non-smooth, non-convex optimization problems, which are increasingly common in modern deep learning architectures. As AI models become more complex, their associated loss landscapes often exhibit irregular, non-convex structures that challenge traditional optimization methods. A theoretical or empirical discussion of HOMM’s potential advantages—or limitations—in such settings would significantly enhance the paper’s impact and forward-looking relevance."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "gHIAJbUu14", "forum": "fHYzKTywr8", "replyto": "fHYzKTywr8", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10311/Reviewer_Ex2E"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10311/Reviewer_Ex2E"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10311/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761930484052, "cdate": 1761930484052, "tmdate": 1762921653266, "mdate": 1762921653266, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
