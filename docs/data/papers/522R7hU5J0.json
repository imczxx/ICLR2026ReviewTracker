In the ablation study (Table 2), the \"Attention\" aggregation method performs worse than the clustering-based methods. This is somewhat surprising given the success of attention mechanisms in related fields. Could the authors provide some insight into why this might be the case? Was it a simple attention mechanism, and is it possible a more sophisticated variant could have been more competitive?\n3. The paper mentions that the learned brain states align with known neurobiological alterations (lines 089-090). In the ABIDE-I analysis, the TC group shows a tendency to remain in State 1, described as reflecting \"stable engagement of internally oriented cognition\" (lines 465-466).

Is the model suggesting that the ASD group is less able to sustain this mode of brain activity?\n4. For the dFC calculation (lines 200-204), a sliding-window approach is used.
