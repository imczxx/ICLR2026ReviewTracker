But this often suffers from large errors due to certain outliers in the weights. \nProposed mitigation mechanisms include applying adaptive rounding, random rotation transformations or committing to a post-training target using calibration data. Unfortunately, this reliance on calibration data can be severely limiting in many real-world scenarios as such data may be unavailable or subject to privacy regulations.  In this paper, we propose algorithms to optimize transformations and adaptive rounding without access to any calibration data. The optimization is achieved by designing a suitable proxy function for the quantization loss without calibration data. To maintain inference efficiency, we perform structured matrix transformations for single matrices. For paired weights that interact directly in the computation graph, we use dual matrix transformations and adaptive rounding methods. We conduct experiments on Gemma 2 models, and observe consistent improvement over the baselines. For Gemma 2 9B quantization, our method improves the average benchmark score from 61.9 to 62.4 for 4-bit quantization and from 52.0 to 60.6 for 3-bit quantization, while adding less than 3\\% of computation overhead.

The core idea of learning a transformation (M) to improve quantization is from the central contribution of SpinQuant (Liu et al., 2024). The distinction here is only the use of a proxy loss instead of calibration data and the relaxation of orthonormality constraints. The use of (W1 M^{-1})(M W2) is explicitly discussed and utilized in related works such as QuaRot (Ashkboos et al., 2024b).\nAs for adaptive rounding, the proposed alternating rounding is interesting. However, the idea of joint rounding to minimize the error of a matrix product is a logical extension of GPTQ-style Hessian-based rounding. The novel aspect is doing this without a Hessian (using the pseudo-inverse), but the connection and distinction should be more clearly discussed.\n\n2) All experiments are conducted exclusively on the Gemma 2 family. The LLM ecosystem is diverse (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen), with different architectures, training data, and outlier characteristics. The claim of a general method requires validation across at least one more architecturally distinct model family.\n\n3) The entire framework relies on the L2 norm of the weight reconstruction error being a good proxy for task performance. While Figure 1 shows a correlation, it is not perfect (Spearman ~ -0.64).  \n\n4) The paper rightly highlights low inference overhead. However, the offline cost of the optimization is substantial. Learning transformations for every layer via gradient descent (for single matrices) and running iterative SVD-based rounding (for coupled matrices) is computationally expensive. For a one-time quantization, this may be acceptable, but it should be explicitly discussed and quantified, as it affects the practicality of the method for very large models or frequent re-quantization."}, "questions": {"value": "1) The proposed method performs well on Gemma 2, but does it work equally well on other architectures like GLM, Qwen, or MoE models?\n\n2) You applied paired quantization only to (W_v, W_o).
