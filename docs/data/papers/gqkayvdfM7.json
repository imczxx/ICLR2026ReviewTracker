Meanwhile, severely corrupted data used in these problems has increased the demand for methods capable of handling heavy-tailed noises, i.e., noises with bounded $\\kappa$-th moment. Motivated by these real-world trends and challenges, we explore sign-based methods in this setup and demonstrate their effectiveness in comparison with other popular solutions like clipping or normalization. In theory, we prove the first-known high probability convergence bounds under $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness and heavy-tailed noises with mild parameter dependencies. In the case of standard smoothness, these bounds are novel for sign-based methods as well. In particular, $\\texttt{SignSGD}$ with batching achieves sample complexity $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_0}{\\varepsilon^2} + \\frac{\\Delta L_1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\left[1 +  \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon}\\right)^\\frac{\\kappa}{\\kappa-1}\\right]\\right), \\kappa \\in (1,2]$.

I will go over them in detail.\n\n---\n\n**1 Theoretical aspect**\n\n**SignSGD GENERAL CONVERGENCE LEMMA 1 is not correct**. The authors have a major misunderstanding about the concentration inequality Lemma 3. In _Line 1101_: The authors erroneously set $\\lambda$ to be a random variable depending on the algorithmic trajectory. This is clearly wrong, suggesting that all high-probability bounds in this paper are not correct. The authors may refer to Appendix A.1 in [1], and it can be easily seen that such $\\lambda$ would invalidate the whole lemma.\n\n**I am also skeptical about the in-expecation convergence of M-SignSGD**. In _Line 1579-1588_, the authors used Lemma 4 and Assumption 4 to bound the heavy-tailed noise. However, Lemma 4 is stated under $l_2$-norm, but the one used here is the $l_1$-norm version, which makes Lemma 4 not directly applicable. Extra clarifications are needed for this matter. Perhaps one may consider the coordinate-wise version of Lemma 4 and apply it here. This issue might be addressed, but the current derivations are problematic.\n\n---\n\n**2 Empirical aspects**\n\n**Baselines (AdamW) seem to be undertuned**. In Table 6, the optimal lr for AdamW is smaller than M-SignSGD, which makes me very confused. It is well-known that M-SignSGD/Muon could outperform with AdamW if the RMS-norms of their updates are aligned. Generally speaking, this will result in $lr_{sign}\\approx 5lr_{AdamW}$, since the RMS-norm of the AdamW update is roughly 0.2 [2]. I would strongly suggest that the authors evaluate other hyperparameter choices.\n\n**Another serious problem is to turn off Nesterov momentum for AdamW**. This is fine if you keep it down for other optimizers, but the current setup is just unfair, since Nesterov acceleration is widely acknowledged and empirically validated to strongly boost the performance [1-4].\n\nLastly, the authors does not justify why the weight-decay of M-ClippedSGD and M-NSGD are set to zero. Also, the 0.01 weight decay for M-SignSGD and AdamW seems to be smaller than the commonly used 0.1.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] A High Probability Analysis of Adaptive SGD with Momentum.\n\n[2] Muon is scalable for LLM training.\n\n[3] MARS-M: When Variance Reduction Meets Matrices.\n\n[4] MARS: Unleashing the Power of Variance Reduction for Training Large Models. \n\n[5] Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them. \n\n---\n\n**3 Motivations**\n\nThis is the least significant point here. I don't think this paper is very well-motivated. First, there are no justifications for why high-probability convergence is important and valuable to the broader ML community. Although, as a theory guy myself, I admit that to establish theoretical convergence for a known algorithm is meaningful, in the main body of the paper, the authors still need to justify the reason to study it. To make things worse, given the current evidence indicating that most of the high-probability bounds are erroneous, this paper seems to become meaningless. Besides this part, it would also be better to empirically validate $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness and heavy-tailed noise for signSGD, otherwise the paper will become a \"math flexing\" (not to mention that such flex is wrong!).\n\n---\n\n**4 Novelty**\n\nI checked most of the proof in detail and did not find any novel technical insights. The tools are all relatively standard and quite well-known in signSGD/normalized momentum literature. For the signSGD part, the methods come mostly from Sun et al. (2023). For the generalized smoothness part, the analysis stems from Chen et al. (2023); Gorbunov et al. (2024).  For the heavy-tailed part, the HT batching tool comes from Kornilov et al. (2024), while the more advanced one in Liu & Zhou (2024) is not utilized. For the high-probability convergence, the type of Bernstein inequality/Freedman's inequality (or its variants) is well-known, but the paper did not invoke them correctly. For the parameter-free part, the type of inequalities to bound unknown parameters is due to Hübler et al. (2024b).\n\n---\n\n**5 Others**\n\n1. I would strongly advise the authors to properly use the \\citet{} and \\citep{} commands.\n2. Line 1145: $\\epsilon^k$ should be in the $l_1$-norm.\n3. Line 460: The citations of Zhang et al. (2020b) and Liu et al. (2023a) are inappropriate. The former does not include pretraining tasks on the Transformer architecture, which does not fit into the empirical settings in this paper. The latter is irrelevant and does not discuss optimization characteristics like generalized smoothness. \n4. Line 2253: I would suggest reporting the exact value of the Chinchilla optimal ratio.\n5. Line 2252: This is not necessarily a problem, but a sequence length of 512 seems to be smaller than common practice. See [1].
