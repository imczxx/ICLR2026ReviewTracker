Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer a data-driven alternative that enables fast and scalable property estimation. However, prevailing graph-based pipelines use one-hot or shallow element embeddings and simple distance-based edges, which under-encode element-specific characteristics and cannot faithfully capture bond relations. Thus, we develop HARMAP, a Hierarchical Atomic Representation for Materials Property prediction. First, we build a chemistry-informed Hierarchical Element Knowledge Tree (HEK-Tree) that classifies elements from coarse to fine (e.g., metal vs. non-metal, subgroupings), producing atomic embeddings that preserve unique identities and inter-atomic relations. Second, we map these features into hyperbolic spaces that preserve hierarchical structure, enabling compact separation of levels and smooth similarity across related elements. Finally, we construct a compound graph whose nodes use the learned atomic embeddings and whose edges combine geometric proximity, providing bond-aware connectivity. Across three large public datasets, HARMAP consistently improves over formula-only, structure-only, and standard graph baselines, indicating the effectiveness of HARMAP's unique atomic and bond representations.", "tldr": "A Hierarchical Atomic Representation for Materials Property prediction.", "keywords": ["AI for Materials", "Atomic Representation", "Material Property Prediction"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/f2913d72388d9ffba069d11669af7f23599310e8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper is concerned about crystal property prediction and proposes a hierarchical atomic representation for materials property prediction (HARMAP).

The authors identify key limitations in existing graph-based models, which often rely on oversimplified atomic representations (like one-hot encodings) and geometric-only edges, failing to capture the rich hierarchical relationships between elements and chemically meaningful bonds. HARMAP addresses these shortcomings by creating a more sophisticated and chemistry-aware representation of crystalline materials.\n\nThe main contributions of the work are threefold. First, the authors construct a Hierarchical Element Knowledge Tree (HEK-Tree), a taxonomy that organizes elements from broad categories (e.g., metal/nonmetal) down to specific chemical families and individual elements. Second, this tree is embedded into hyperbolic space, a geometric domain naturally suited for representing hierarchical data with low distortion, which allows the model to preserve chemical relationships effectively. Finally, the framework introduces Bond-aware Connectivity (Bondnec), a method to enrich the edges in the crystal graph by combining standard interatomic distances with a chemical similarity score derived from the hierarchical embeddings, leading to a more accurate representation of bonding."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. Holistic Integration of Chemistry: The model moves beyond simple geometry by incorporating deep chemical knowledge. The HEK-Tree encodes established periodic trends, and the Bondnec module infuses chemical similarity into bond representations. This allows the model to reason about atomic interactions in a way that is more aligned with a chemist's intuition.\n\n2. Strong Empirical Performance: The paper provides compelling evidence of its effectiveness. HARMAP achieves state-of-the-art results across three major, diverse benchmarks (Materials Project, JARVIS, OQMD) and on multiple key properties (formation energy, bandgap, elastic moduli). The consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines are a major strength.\n\n3. Comprehensive Ablation Studies: The authors thoroughly validate their design choices through extensive ablations. They demonstrate the individual contribution of the HEK-Tree, the hyperbolic backbone (Hypformer), and the Bondnec edges, proving that each component is essential for the final performance. The study on the HEK-Tree depth also provides valuable insights into the importance of hierarchy."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Potential Rigidity of the HEK-Tree: The HEK-Tree is constructed based on fixed, pre-defined chemical knowledge. While this provides a strong inductive bias, it might be less flexible than a fully learned hierarchy. It may not easily adapt to discover novel, non-intuitive element relationships that are not already captured by the standard periodic table grouping.\n\n2. Limited Interpretability of Learned Embeddings: Although the HEK-Tree structure itself is interpretable, the actual node embeddings learned in hyperbolic space are high-dimensional and abstract. While the paper shows the model works, it may be difficult to directly translate these learned representations back to concrete, new chemical insights without further analysis."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
