A key challenge in aligning TTA models lies in creating preference pairs, as TTA lacks structured mechanisms like verifiable rewards or gold-standard answers available for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes preference data to enhance TTA alignment. We show that the audio preference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms the static alternatives. With this framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective benchmarks. https://tangoflux56.github.io/TangoFlux/ holds the model-generated audio samples for comparison.", "tldr": "Text to audio generation with semi online preference optimization performed on self-generated audio samples", "keywords": ["text to audio", "flow matching", "preference optimization"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/e0535af5833cc7f3b56c4da914bf0f9aea08f9fd.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/aec0fdd7092c1b7662751881c104952df41477f8.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work introduces TangoFlux, a TTA model trained on open data and aligned via CLAP-Ranked Preference Optimization (CRPO).
