However, current paradigms like manual red-teaming and static benchmarks are expensive, non-systematic, and fail to provide verifiable coverage of safety policies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that brings the rigor of specification-based software testing to AI safety. Our approach systematically generates harmful test cases by first compiling natural-language safety policies into a formal, first-order logic expression. This formal structure is used to construct a semantic graph where violation scenarios manifest as traversable subgraphs. By employing graph sampling, we systematically discover a diverse range of policy violations. These abstract scenarios are then instantiated into concrete, natural language queries using a generator LLM, a process that is automatic and flexibly adaptive to new domains. We demonstrate through experiments that our framework achieves higher policy coverage and generates more effective and interpretable test cases compared to established red-teaming baselines. By bridging formal methods and AI safety, our work provides a principled, scalable, and automated approach to ensuring LLMs adhere to safety-critical policies.", "tldr": "We systematically test an LLM's adherence to its safety policy by converting it into formal logic to auto-generate test cases.", "keywords": ["Testing", "AI Safety", "LLM Evaluation"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/24d39da5faa3b84efaa8e40eaecd545ac468165c.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes compiling natural-language safety policies into formal first-order logic expressions, thus constructing a semantic graph to automatically generate adversarial scenarios for evaluation.

Limited experiments on the influence of hyperparameters. No ablation or sensitivity analysis for k (neighbor size), or embedding model selection in the coverage/novelty metrics.\n4. Authors acknowledge that POLARIS only evaluates single-turn interactions, which limits its applicability to real-world, multi-turn agent contexts.\n5. The effectiveness of the generated test dataset is constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of the manually collected safety policies, whose compilation remains a labor-intensive process.\n6. (Important) It should be emphasized that because safety policies differ across countries and institutions, the dataset generated from a specific policy corpus may not be illegal under other jurisdictions. Consequently, the observed dataset novelty (as indicated by the Expansion Score) may partly stem from policy discrepancies between different countries/companies, rather than from the proposed method itself. Future experiments should be designed to control for this potential confounding factor.\n\nSmall problems:\n1.

While the core idea of bringing specification-based testing principles to AI safety is valuable, the paper has several fundamental issues that need to be addressed.\n\nWhile the idea of bringing formal methods to AI safety evaluation is valuable, the execution has critical flaws.

The natural language policy \"Do not provide instructions for constructing weapons\" is formalized as:\n$\\forall x,y: Instruct (x,y) \\land IsWeapon(y) \\rightarrow Violation(R1)$. This formalization is semantically incorrect. It would flag as violations legitimate queries like \"Give me instructions for preventing weapon usage in my workplace\", \"Give me instructions for reporting illegal weapons to authorities\", etc. The FOL representation captures \"instructions\" + \"weapons\" but completely misses the prohibited action \"constructing\" or \"harmfully using\". This example demonstrates that FOL is fundamentally insufficient for representing nuanced, context-dependent safety policies. The paper does not address this limitation or provide any validation that their formalizations are semantically equivalent to the original policies.\n\nHow can the authors ensure their formalizations are correct when their main example contains this kind of error? Without validation, all downstream results (graph construction, test generation) may be testing the wrong policies entirely.\n\nB) Missing Validation of Policy Decomposition\n\nSection 3.1 describes an automated pipeline for decomposing complex policies into atomic clauses and extracting entities/relations using an LLM. However, there is no validation of this critical step, including no accuracy metrics reported for decomposition, no ground truth dataset with human annotations, and no discussion of what happens with ambiguous or contradictory policies. Since errors in this stage propagate through the entire pipeline, the lack of validation is a serious methodological flaw. The paper needs to demonstrate that LLM-based decomposition is reliable before claiming the approach is \"verifiable\" and \"systematic.\"\n\nC) The three claimed contributions lack sufficient novelty:\n\nContribution 1: Applying formal methods to AI safety is not new. Specification-based testing has been applied to ML systems before (metamorphic testing for neural networks, property-based testing for ML). The paper positions this as \"bridging,\" but it's more of an application than an innovation.\n\nContribution 2: Each component of this stated contribution already exists. In fact, NLP-to-formal-specification is a whole research field in itself. Also, there is sufficient existing work in graph-based test generation and knowledge graph enrichment. The paper essentially combines existing techniques without sufficient innovation in any individual component or their integration.\n\nContribution 3: Empirical validation is expected, not a contribution. Also, the empirical evaluation is lacking as there is no human evaluationa nd no accuracy checks for LLM outputs at various stages. \n\nD) Missing related work\n\nThere is no related work discussion related to Contribution 2. There is an extensive body of work on Natural Language to Formal Logic conversion, many of which show that it is flawed."}, "questions": {"value": "1. How do you validate that your policy-to-logic translation is semantically correct? Example 3.1.1 suggests this is a fundamental problem.\n\n2. Why should we trust the 100% Policy Clause Coverage result when there's no validation of the formalization step?\n\n3.
