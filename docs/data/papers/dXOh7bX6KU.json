The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines. However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated by this gap, we introduce \\textit{AnimeText}, a large-scale dataset containing 735K images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. To evaluate the robustness of \\textit{AnimeText} in complex anime scenes, we conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection methods.

This scale can support downstream text detection and OCR research.\n\n3. **Systematic annotation pipeline.**\nThe three-stage annotation process (YOLO → CLIP → SAM) is well-engineered and reproducible, balancing automation and human verification.

While the authors acknowledge this limitation, this is a fundamental requirement for a dataset paper in 2025, not an optional extension.\n2. Contradicts the motivation of supporting MLLMs: The authors cite Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma 3 to motivate the work, but these VLMs require more than just bounding boxes. Furthermore, models like Monkey-OCR and Qwen2.5-VL have already achieved strong performance on artistic fonts, raising the question: what unique value does a detection-only dataset provide?\n3.

While B0/B1 annotation levels are defined, the paper does not specify which level is used for cross-dataset evaluation in Table 5. Since AnimeText employs a coarser, block-level labeling scheme, direct comparison with word-level datasets such as ICDAR15 is not strictly fair or interpretable.\n\n2. No controlled experiments are provided to isolate the effects of annotation granularity on model performance (e.g., by splitting B0 regions into word-level annotations or merging ICDAR15 into block-level). Consequently, it is difficult to disentangle performance differences caused by domain gap versus annotation gap.\n\n3. The paper shows limited comparison with structurally similar datasets.  Although CTW-1500 appears in the dataset statistics and uses polygonal, line-level annotations (one box per text line, including whitespace), it is omitted from experimental comparisons. Given its structural similarity to AnimeText’s B0 format, CTW-1500 would serve as a more aligned and informative baseline than ICDAR15.\n\n4. The reported precision gains from hard-negative filtering are not accompanied by statistics on mistakenly removed true text instances (false negatives). This omission obscures the impact on recall and overall F1 performance.\n5. While the paper notes that AnimeText exhibits higher text density and peripheral text positioning, it stops short of quantifying how these factors affect detection performance (e.g., through density-stratified F1 curves or ablation analysis).\n\n6. All data originate from online anime sources under research-use licenses. The absence of real-world or user-generated images (e.g., screenshots, edited anime, or derivative fan content) limits the dataset’s robustness and generalization potential for practical applications.\n\n7. AnimeText focuses solely on text localization without providing transcription-level annotations. This restricts its applicability for full OCR pipelines, subtitle translation, or vision-language understanding tasks (e.g., VQA).\n\n8. Several contemporary foundation-level or transformer-based text detection models are omitted from comparison. Including such systems would provide a stronger contextual benchmark and clarify where AnimeText stands relative to current state-of-the-art detectors."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Which annotation level (B0 or B1) is used for the cross-dataset evaluation in Table 5? If B1 annotations are used, how is fairness ensured when comparing to word-level datasets such as ICDAR15, given the coarser granularity of AnimeText? Conversely, if B0 annotations are used, what specific rules govern multi-line grouping, intra-line whitespace handling, and segmentation consistency across varying text layouts?\n\n2. While the paper reports a +26.9 % increase in precision and improvements in Acc/F1 at the classifier level, it does not disclose the false-negative rate—i.e., the proportion of true text instances mistakenly filtered out. Could the authors provide quantitative results on the percentage of true text erroneously removed and its subsequent impact on recall and overall F1 ? Such information would help assess whether the precision gains come at the expense of text coverage.\n\n3. Can the authors experimentally isolate the impact of annotation granularity? For example:  a. Split AnimeText B0 annotations into word-level units and re-evaluate performance. b. Merge ICDAR15 word-level boxes into block-level regions and report mAP/F1 for both settings.\nThis would help disentangle differences attributable to annotation granularity from those caused by domain variation.\n\n4. Why was CTW-1500 excluded from comparative evaluation? As CTW-1500 provides line-level polygon annotations, structurally similar to AnimeText’s B0 format, it would serve as a more directly comparable dataset than ICDAR15 and help validate cross-annotation consistency.\n\n5. AnimeText consists exclusively of static frames and omits temporal continuity information relevant to anime videos—such as motion blur, scene transitions, or persistent subtitle overlays.
