PCB images differ fundamentally from natural images in texture simplicity, spatial sparsity, and lack of informative backgrounds, limiting the effectiveness of traditional vision models. We propose GraphPCB, a generic scheme that transforms PCB images into graph-structured data, where nodes represent localized component regions and edges encode spatial proximity. This representation enables the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to PCB understanding, offering robustness to geometric variations and background noise. We release two high-quality GraphPCB datasets and analyze their structural properties, including graph heterophily and domain-specific challenges. Extensive experiments with various GNN architectures provide benchmarks and insights, establishing GraphPCB as a new testbed for node classification in structured visual domains.", "tldr": "We propose novel GNN datasets for application in IC classification on PCBs.", "keywords": ["Graph neural networks", "PCB images", "node classification", "IC identification"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9ca4031165152d19c65b1ead47d0335815346c99.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/352999a96369cca660b3000f214ccb8e02ea70a6.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces GraphPCB, a framework that recasts the problem of electronic component classification on PCBs as a graph-based node classification task. The authors argue that traditional computer vision approaches are limited by the unique characteristics of PCB images. Their proposed method converts each PCB image into a graph where nodes represent components and edges represent spatial proximity, determined via Voronoi tessellation. Node features are extracted using a pre-trained ResNet50. The paper's main contributions are: (1) this new graph-based conceptual framework for PCB analysis; (2) the release of two new benchmark datasets, Graph-F and Graph-W, created from public PCB image data; (3) a thorough analysis of these datasets, identifying them as inductive, multi-graph, and heterophilic; and (4) benchmarking of various GNN architectures, demonstrating that models designed for heterophily and inductive learning often outperform baselines.

The authors benchmark a wide range of GNN models, including standard, inductive, and heterophily-aware architectures. This provides a strong set of baselines and offers insights into which model families are suitable for this new task."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- Marginal performance gains and unexplained results: The significance of the results is questionable on one of the datasets. On Graph-W (Table 2), the best-performing heterophilic GNNs (GAT-sep, GT-sep) achieve a Subset F1-Score of 0.63, which is a very marginal improvement over the simple MLP baseline's 0.61. This minimal gain does not make a strong case for the added complexity of the graph-based approach. Furthermore, the paper fails to discuss the anomalous result where GIN, a simple homophilic model, achieves a Subset F1-Score of 0.69, outperforming nearly all other models on this dataset, which contradicts the heterophily narrative.\n- Weak justification for heterophily: The claim that the datasets are intrinsically heterophilic is based on the adjusted homophily score. This score corrects for class imbalance, which is dominated by the large others class. The low score could be an artifact of this single, diverse class connecting to all others, rather than a property of the connections between the key classes of interest (IC, DT, Diode). A more rigorous analysis, such as calculating homophily on a subgraph induced by only these key classes, is needed to substantiate this important claim.\n- Ablation study for ResNet50: The paper relies on a fixed, pre-trained ResNet50 for node feature extraction. It is highly plausible that the fixed encoder provides sub-optimal features for this specialized domain. Consequently, the observed performance gains of GNNs over the MLP baseline might not stem from leveraging structural information, but rather from the GNNs' superior ability to process and aggregate these noisy, non-domain-specific features. An ablation study with a fine-tuned encoder is necessary to de-confound these effects and validate the paper's central claim."}, "questions": {"value": "- Could you provide an ablation study comparing results with a fixed ResNet50 encoder versus a fine-tuned one? This would help determine if the GNNs' advantage comes from structural reasoning or from compensating for sub-optimal visual features.\n- To strengthen the claim of intrinsic heterophily, can you provide an analysis of homophily (both naive and adjusted) on the subgraph induced by only the key classes of interest (IC, DT, Diode), excluding the others class?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "68faCLclO1", "forum": "iu5fSByDUZ", "replyto": "iu5fSByDUZ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14785/Reviewer_vWLs"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14785/Reviewer_vWLs"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14785/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761872765708, "cdate": 1761872765708, "tmdate": 1762925137700, "mdate": 1762925137700, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "8Ja8t2T7rV", "forum": "iu5fSByDUZ", "replyto": "iu5fSByDUZ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14785/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission14785/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763197840998, "cdate": 1763197840998, "tmdate": 1763197840998, "mdate": 1763197840998, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces GraphPCB, a novel graph-based framework for Printed Circuit Board (PCB) image analysis.
