Similarly, existing TTRL methods require multiple samples or known answers for optimization, limiting their practical applicability. We introduce Vision Reasoning Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (VR-TTRL), to our knowledge, the first framework to apply TTRL to vision-language models for visual reasoning tasks, enabling adaptation from a single unlabeled sample without any ground truth answers. Our approach leverages majority voting across model rollouts to generate pseudo-labels for self-supervision, combining the structured reasoning capabilities of vision-language models with the adaptive power of test-time reinforcement learning. Through experiments on segmentation and counting tasks, we demonstrate that VR-TTRL enables effective model adaptation using only a single unlabeled sample, achieving performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

Interesting idea for using TTRL for visual reasoning tasks.\n\nThis presents an interesting idea to adapt a VLM on a single unlabeled test image by sampling multiple rollouts, selecting a consensus pseudo-label via IoU/L1 computation, and conduct RL with the proposed reward function. This modification of the prior TTRL framework to support structured output of visual reasoning tasks is interesting and of practical interest of researchers in the filed.\n\n2.

Need to discuss the risk of consensus enhancing mistakes of the model.\n\nThe reward function aggregates rollouts towards the most \"average\" answer of the multiple rollouts. Why doesn't this drive the model toward a mean-valued, low-variance solution and lead to mode collapses? Especially under iterative updates, why this does not lead to reinforcement of early bias in the model and circulate errors? If this happens, it would be helpful to show some failure cases. If this generally does not happen, it would be good to have some analysis and clear explanation of the reason.\n\n2. Task scope is narrow.\n\nExperiments focus on only bbox, points and counting as output of the answers. It unclear how well the approach extends to open-ended VQA or free-form reasoning tasks where majority vote might not work that well or there is no geometric agreement signal.\n\n3. Need to explain why test-time learning is specifically benefited from the framework vs. simply using the training data.\n\nI'm curious where do the gains really come from?
