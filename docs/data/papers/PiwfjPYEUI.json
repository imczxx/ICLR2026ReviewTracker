However, their high dimensionality and mixing patterns pose significant challenges in establishing an interpretable and explicit mapping between historical and future series, as well as extracting long-range feature dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a channel-time dual unmixing network for multivariate time series forecasting (named MTS-UNMixers), which decomposes the entire series into critical bases and coefficients across both the time and channel dimensions. This approach establishes a robust sharing mechanism between historical and future series, enabling accurate representation and enhancing physical interpretability. Specifically, MTS-UNMixers represent sequences over time as a mixture of multiple trends and cycles, with the time-correlated representation coefficients shared across both historical and future time periods. In contrast, sequence over channels can be decomposed into multiple tick-wise bases, which characterize the channel correlations and are shared across the whole series. To estimate the shared time-dependent coefficients, a vanilla Mamba network is employed, leveraging its alignment with directional causality. Correspondlingly, a bidirectional Mamba network is utilized to model the shared channel-correlated bases, accommodating noncausal relationships. Experimental results show that MTS-UNMixers significantly outperform existing methods on multiple benchmark datasets.", "tldr": "MTS-UNMixers disentangles temporal and channel patterns via dual-path unmixing for accurate multivariate time series forecasting.", "keywords": ["Time series forecasting", "Unmixing", "Mamba network", "Shared mechanism."], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/2ce0df32ceedda8cfac6ab3d624f08c7e2a47fab.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/91adfca16fea8337a66f57973fd6ba60089f8d3e.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes MTS-UNMixers, a dual-path architecture that unmixes multivariate time-series along time and channel dimensions to obtain shared, interpretable bases and coefficients used for both reconstruction and forecasting."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

This weakens the overall novelty of the paper. The author should provide a detailed comparative analysis in the Introduction section between the proposed model and these representative methods to better highlight the unique contributions of the proposed method.\n- Several key arguments in this paper require further clarification. For instance, the rationale behind performing decomposition along the channel dimension is unclear. There are multiple existing strategies for modeling channel correlations, including the channel-independent strategy [1], the channel-dependent strategy [2], and several trade-off strategies [3, 4]. The authors should include a comparative analysis between the proposed channel unmixing strategy and these established channel modeling methods to justify their design choice. In addition, the definition of $S$ in lines 165 and 170 appears inconsistent, and the meaning of $t$ is ambiguous. Moreover, in Eq. 7,  it remains unclear why the authors choose to share the coefficient matrix along the channel dimension while sharing the base matrix along the temporal dimension. A detailed explanation or ablation study should be provided to clarify why this asymmetric sharing strategy is preferred over alternative designs, such as sharing either the coefficient or the base matrix across both dimensions. It is also unclear why the authors chose to employ bidirectional Mamba blocks instead of graph neural networks or Transformer-based architectures for modeling channel dependencies. Besides, the original order in the channel dimension mentioned in line 268 is not well explained and requires further clarification.\n- In line 128, the authors claim that the proposed model enhances physical interpretability and prediction reliability. However, the paper does not provide any visual analysis of the decomposed components along either the temporal or channel dimensions.\n- The authors should include state-space models, such as Mamba, as baseline methods to provide a more comprehensive performance comparison.\n\n[1] Y.

(6)) is presented by analogy and lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation for its validity in modeling non-causal channel correlations.\n\n3. The proposed model relies heavily on Mamba blocks. However, the experiments omit comparisons with recent Mamba-based baseline models for MTSF, a significant gap in the experimental evaluation.\n\n4. The notation for the dimensions of the input $\\mathrm{X}$ is inconsistent and confusing throughout the paper.

How do the authors justify this static assumption, and wouldn’t it limit the model’s generalization capability?\n\n3. Why did the authors choose to share $A_t$ and $S_c$, instead of the alternative (e.g., sharing $A_c$ and $S_t$)?
