We propose Looking-back, an implicit video clip re-focusing mechanism that allows an MLLM to retrospectively query the stream for the moments and regions that matter to its current reasoning. Concretely, the MLLM emits a refocus token whenever its spatial belief state is uncertain; this token parameterizes a differentiable spatio-temporal retrieval over the buffered video (key–value memory from a lightweight video encoder), returning a micro-clip and feature patch that are fused back via cross-attention. Training uses: (i) an answer-improvement objective comparing predictions before/after refocusing, (ii) a geometric consistency loss that enforces depth/epipolar agreement across retrieved views, and (iii) a sparsity prior to discourage gratuitous look-backs. The resulting model performs 3D spatial perception through reasoning—estimating relative depth, occlusion order, object layout, and contact relations—while keeping token budgets small. Across benchmarks covering video spatial QA, 3D referring and layout understanding, and egocentric scene reasoning, Looking-back yields consistent gains over strong video-MLLM baselines, reduces hallucinated relations, and improves sample efficiency. Ablations show that both the uncertainty-gated refocus token and the geometric consistency term are critical. Our results indicate that enabling MLLMs to look back when unsure is an effective path toward reliable 3D spatial perception in complex videos.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["MLLM", "Reasoning", "3D", "Spatial", "Perception"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [], "withdrawn": true}
