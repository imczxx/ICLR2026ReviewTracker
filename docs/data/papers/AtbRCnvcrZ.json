We formulate the problem as a general constrained online learning problem that can be applied to diverse bidding settings (e.g., first-price or second-price auctions) and feedback regimes (e.g., full or partial information), among others. We introduce L2FOB, a Look-ahead Lyapunov Framework for Online Bidding with strong empirical and theoretical performance. By combining optimistic reward and pessimistic cost estimation with the look-ahead virtual queue mechanism, L2FOB delivers safe and optimal bidding decisions. We provide adaptive guarantees: L2FOB achieves $O (\\mathcal{E}\\_r(T,p)+(\\nu^* / \\rho)  \\mathcal{E}\\_c(T,p))$ regret and $O (\\mathcal{E}\\_r(T,p)+\\mathcal{E}\\_c(T,p))$ anytime ROI constraint violation, where $\\mathcal{E}_r(T,p)$ and $\\mathcal{E}_c(T,p)$ are cumulative estimation errors over $T$ rounds, $\\rho$ is the average per-round budget, and $\\nu^*$ is the offline optimal average reward. We instantiate L2FOB in several online bidding settings, demonstrating guarantees that match or improve upon the best-known results. These results are derived from the novel look-ahead design and Lyapunov stability analysis. Numerical experiments further validate our theoretical guarantees.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["online bidding", "budget constraints", "ROI constraints", "Lyapunov optimization"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ffd4d5123d788199e577e0ee39734fa3b37c308d.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/4314ad9f7e863a4949157ceab8a07b95de1c11c2.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper provides a framework and an algorithm for ROI and budget constrained bidding in repeated auctions. \nThe framework relies on the notions of look-ahead virtual queue tracing, instead of using a more standard primal-dual approach. \nThe results are expressed in term of error made by prediction oracles. \nThe framework is used to revisite previous works."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 4}, "strengths": {"value": "The topic of budget and ROI constrained bidding  has already attracted a lot of attention, \nand I find the framework proposed by the authors practical and intuitive (compared too, for instance, dual approaches)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "* The writing is not always clear, and I urge the authors to check each paragraph clarity.\n* What would, IMHO, what could really improve the paper would be: \n1. to clarify the positioning with respect to the other papers on the topic (stochastic vs adversarial env, slack assumtions...).

First, the authors miss a fundamental related work ([1]). In [1], the authors study an online learning problem with budget and roi constraints as in this paper. The only difference is that the authors study a non-contextual setting. Moreover, [1] requires some form of Slater's condition on the ROI constraint to obtain the optimal bounds. Nonetheless, [1] attains guarantees for adversarial settings, too.\n2. I find peculiar that the context distribution is assumed to be known. I believe it is not standard in the literature of contextual bandits, while it seems fundamental for the employment of the algorithm, since the expectation on the context distribution is computed at each round.\n3. Paragraph \"Assumptions and Baselines\" is not formal enough. Specifically, Equation (2) is meaningless as it is. First, it is not clear over which distribution the expectation is taken. Moreover, if the expectation is taken over the context distribution, as it seems given that $v_t$ is not used in (2), the problem collapse to a non contextual online learning problem.  \n4. Throughout the paper, the authors claim that they bound the positive ROI violation (using $()^+$). Nonetheless, the standard metric is used in the theorems. \n5. Finally, I don't understand the proof step at line 299. I think the inequality holds paying a $\\sqrt T$ factor thanks to the Azuma inequality. Instead, the authors claims that it works as it is. \n\n[1] \"Online Learning under Budget and ROI Constraints via Weak Adaptivity\", ICML 2024"}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "7QHY2BSqEL", "forum": "AtbRCnvcrZ", "replyto": "AtbRCnvcrZ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10667/Reviewer_sRuk"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10667/Reviewer_sRuk"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission10667/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762265480339, "cdate": 1762265480339, "tmdate": 1762921917931, "mdate": 1762921917931, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies the problem of online bidding with a budget constraint and a return-on-investment (ROI) constraint.
