Current approaches prioritize graph modeling, endpoint alignment, and multi-attribute learning, yet they often neglect temporal modeling. This leads to inconsistent inter-frame detection within scene flows and motivates our focus on temporal propagation for lane segments. Recently, stream-based methods have shown promising outcomes by integrating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment detection and centerline perception.

Likewise to problem 1, it’s still unclear to me why the “slow-fast system” can solve these problems fundamentally. Some evidence or statistics should be given.\n3.    The definition of the Slow & Fast system in this paper may be confusing; originally, the Slow & Fast system on VLA is to address the asynchrony between fast model inference and slow decision processes in real-world action execution. While in this paper, ‘slow system’ and ‘fast system’ are more like a history feature aggregator and a current frame detector.\n4.    Why, generally speaking, methods with Temporal feature aggregation perform worse than those without that, as shown on Table1, and 2?\n5.

Substantial overlap with TopoStreamer[1] in problem framing and technical pipeline, without the necessary systematic comparison or discussion. TopoStreamer also targets temporal lane segment topology reasoning and essentially adopts the same or highly similar streaming mechanisms and supervisory objectives. Yet the manuscript provides no systematic analysis of differences or pros/cons. This is a serious issue by ICLR standards: when facing the most directly related, recent work on the same task, the authors neither include experimental comparisons nor articulate methodological distinctions and trade-offs. In fact, the two papers share highly consistent setups, so adding a direct comparison should be straightforward.\n2. The main text lacks detailed quantitative and qualitative experiments to substantiate the claimed “three critical limitations in stream-based frameworks,” providing only final accuracy comparisons. This obscures the paper’s contribution and makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n3. Ablations are insufficient: there is no systematic cross-study of K values, memory length, or training strategies (e.g., pure world model vs. conventional Warp+Fuse). Meanwhile, compared with other baseline frameworks, the proposed method exhibits a noticeable increase in computational overhead. More compute metrics, including FLOPs and memory usage, should be reported to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n**Minor Weaknesses**\n\n1. Figure 4 caption: “The results of TopStreamer are shown on the top, and the results of temporal baseline are shown on the bottom.” This appears to have mistakenly included another method’s name in this paper’s visualization caption.\n2. Figure 1 caption: “Comparsion” is misspelled.\n3. Several implementation details remain unclear (e.g., the exact cost functions and weights used for Hungarian matching when the fast and slow branches run in parallel, and whether sharing weights between the two branches during training exacerbates mode collapse).\n\n[1] Yang Y, Luo Y, He B, et al.
