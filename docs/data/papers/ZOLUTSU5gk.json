We propose the first practical time-series simulation pipeline which is scalable, fast enough for on-the-fly generation, and enables notable zero-shot forecasting performance. Our simulator is based off of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) as its core data source. Due to instability in the autoregressive component, naive SARIMA parameter sampling often leads to unusable paths. Instead, our simulator follows a three-step procedure: (1) we sample well-behaved trajectories from the system's characteristic polynomial stability region; (2) we introduce a superposition scheme that combines multiple paths into rich multi-seasonality traces; and (3) we add rate-based heavy-tailed noise models to capture burstiness and intermittency alongside diverse seasonalities and trends. Orders of magnitude faster than kernel-based generators, our simulator enables training on circa 1B unique purely simulated series generated on the fly, after which well-established neural backbones exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing strong statistical forecasters and recent foundation baselines, while operating under strict zero-shot protocol. Notably, we observe a ``student-beats-teacher'' effect: models trained on our simulations exceed the forecasting accuracy of the generating processes (i.e. AutoARIMA), suggesting emergent generalization beyond the simulator's components.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["forecasting", "foundation models", "simulation", "zero-shot"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c269d60eba35d3f715822e4df20dd1e9641e0026.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a new pipeline to generate synthetic data for the pre-training of time-series foundation models.

As noted by the authors, many demand or utility time series benchmarks consist of a slow process (like inflation in a financial time series) modulating a fast process (like seasonal demand). Within this generating model class, the authors make appropriate choices to enforces stability in the AR dynamics by sampling poles inside the unit circle. This likely helps preserve diversity in the generated time series.\n\nThe evaluations and experiments are appropriate in scope. The authors use GIFT-Eval, which is the current leading benchmark for zero-shot evaluations. They also perform ablations of each component of their generator, allowing them to identify that SARIMA-2 (biseasonality) is a key driver of their approach.\nI also like the experiment design of comparing fully-trained NBEATS/PatchTST against variants pretrained on prior synthetic data generators (KernelSynth/PFN).\n\nThe authors give a nice demonstration that their generated data co-clusters with real datasets from the M4 competition. Because nonlinear embeddings are neighbor based, this helps show that their data convincingly “passes” as real time series data"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Novelty.** This is not the first paper to train a zero-shot forecast model  purely on simulation data and report strong results. ForecastPFN and TabPFN first used this approach, while Mamba4Cast uses an SSM on PFN synthetic data to achieve strong results on the original GluonTS datasets. While the idea itself is not the first of its kind, the arguments in favor of this paper could be (1) the particular choice of synthetic data generation, and (2) the empirical results. I do not currently feel that either is strong enough to recommend acceptance.\n\nAd hoc data augmentation. Regarding the data generation procedure, I consider the approach to be sufficiently ad hoc that it’s hard to see why a SARIMA approach would be universally preferable. There are not any theoretical guarantees or general bounds that establish that this approach will always produce more diverse or realistic data than prior methods. Prior approaches fall broadly into PFN and its variants (as in ForecastPFN/TabPFN), augmentations thereof (as in Mamba4cast, which introduces spike injection and damping augmentation, or Gaussian-process based methods like KernelSynth used by Chronos. There’s also structured approaches like CauKer, which combine Gaussian Processes with a structured causal model. I can see the author’s ARIMA-based procedure as helping cover data types not covered by other methods; for example, long history dependence when the ARIMA process has a long effective memory due to slow damping. However, it’s hard to argue that any of these dataset generators are universally preferable. \n\n**Experiments.** The experiments show that models like NBEATS or PatchTST become competitive with models like Chronos when pretrained on the SarSim0 dataset. I don’t consider these results strong enough to believe that they justify selecting this data generator over others, because I think there is a bit of a “no free lunch” here: the authors pick a generator that handles multiseasonality well, and it turns out this is useful for M4 and GIFT-Eval, which has many time series that fall into that class. But had the authors picked a multi-scale or trend-dominated test set, a different heuristic for data generation approach could have been preferable. Since there are infinite choices that could be made during the data generation procedure, the overperformance of this particular set of choices mainly tells us about the properties of GIFT-Eval and M4.\n\n**Emergence.** I do not agree with the “emergent effect” argument.  A neural model pretrained with SARIMAX datasets outperforming AutoARIMA does not imply emergent effects. Firstly, Sarima-2 does not directly fall within the model class directly expressible by AutoARIMA. Secondly, initialization and hyperparameters can prevent a model like AutoARIMA from exactly fitting the true generator."}, "questions": {"value": "1.

Are there any mathematical conditions or theoretical guarantees on the distributional properties of the resulting time series?\n\n2. Can you directly quantify the verisimilitude and diversity of your generated data, particularly compared to prior PFN or structured causal model approaches? For example, since you have a UMAP, you could calculate a silhouette score. A statistical significance test would add depth to this comparison.\n\n3. Are you fine-tuning Chronos, Moirai, etc on the SarSim0 dataset? I could not tell if these experiments are what are shown in the first rows Table 1, or if that shows the base performance of those models pretrained on their original pretraining splits.\n\n4.

The core of the simulator is the classical SARIMA statistical model, but with a key innovation: instead of sampling unstable model coefficients, it samples stable poles directly from the characteristic polynomial's stability region, guaranteeing well-behaved series. The pipeline enriches these base signals through a compositional \"SARIMA-2\" scheme for multi-seasonality and adds realism with heavy-tailed noise models to capture burstiness. The authors demonstrate that training standard neural architectures (NBEATS, PatchTST) exclusively on this synthetic data, generated on-the-fly, achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on established benchmarks. Notably, these relatively small models outperform massive, real-data pretrained foundation models and, in many cases, even surpass the forecasting accuracy of the \"teacher\" model (AutoARIMA) from which the data-generating process is derived."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "*   **Core Technical Problem:** The primary strength of this work is its novel and principled solution to the instability problem in autoregressive model simulation. By shifting from sampling coefficients to directly sampling the poles of the transfer function within the unit circle (Section 4.1), the authors guarantee the generation of stable, non-divergent time series. This is a technically sound and elegant idea that makes the powerful but notoriously fragile SARIMA framework a viable engine for large-scale data generation. The resulting speed and on-the-fly capability (Figure 4) represent a significant practical advantage over slower, more complex methods like kernel-based synthesis.\n\n*   **State-of-the-Art Zero-Shot Performance from Synthetic Data Alone:** The paper's empirical results are strong and challenge a key assumption in the field. Table 1 shows that a standard PatchTST model trained solely on SarSim0 data not only outperforms prior synthetic-only methods by a massive margin but also achieves the best overall scores on the GIFT-Eval benchmark, surpassing large foundation models like Chronos, MOIRAI, and TimesFM that were pre-trained on vast amounts of real data. This is a landmark result, demonstrating for the first time that a purely synthetic corpus can be a viable—and even superior—substitute for real-world data in zero-shot forecasting.\n\n*   **Demonstration of Emergent Generalization (\"Student-Beats-Teacher\"):** A deep and significant finding is that neural models trained on SarSim0 data consistently outperform their own data-generating \"teacher,\" AutoARIMA, on the GIFT-Eval benchmark. This is not trivial. It suggests that by learning from a vast and diverse *distribution* of SARIMA processes, the neural network is not merely fitting the teacher's behavior but is learning a more fundamental and robust representation of time series dynamics. This emergent capability is a powerful argument for the synthetic-first pre-training paradigm.\n\n*   **Methodology:** The authors demonstrate a commitment to rigorous, leakage-free evaluation. They operate under a strict zero-shot protocol and provide a detailed breakdown in Appendix C (Table 5) of how prior foundation models violate this protocol by pre-training on evaluation data. This meticulous approach adds significant credibility to their claims and serves as a valuable contribution to the community by highlighting pervasive issues in model evaluation. The ablation study (Table 2) is also effective in validating the importance of the SARIMA-2 and Noiser components."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "In my opinion, the paper's reliance on the SARIMA framework introduces inherent limitations, and the scope of its claims could be tempered by a more nuanced discussion of the benchmarks and the simulator's own complexity.\n\n1.  **Inherent Linearity of the SARIMA Core:** The SARIMA model, which forms the backbone of the simulator, is fundamentally a linear process model. While the paper adds complexity via superposition and non-Gaussian noise, it cannot natively generate time series with core non-linear dynamics, such as regime switching, threshold effects, or volatility clustering (GARCH-like effects). Many real-world series, particularly in finance and econometrics, are driven by such phenomena. The paper's success on the chosen benchmarks may indicate that these benchmarks are dominated by seasonal/trend components, but the simulator's applicability to more complex, non-linear domains remains an open question.\n\n2.  **Opaqueness of the Simulator's \"Meta-Tuning\":** The SarSim0 pipeline itself has a large number of hyperparameters that define the distribution of generated series: the ranges for AR/MA/Seasonal orders, the maximum pole radii, the parameters for seasonality pairs, and the distributions for the Noiser module (Table 8). The paper presents a configuration that works exceptionally well, but it provides no insight into how this configuration was determined. The performance of the downstream \"student\" models is critically dependent on the quality and diversity of the \"teacher's\" curriculum, and this meta-level tuning process is a crucial, yet undiscussed, part of the methodology.\n\n3.  **Potential for Overgeneralization from Current Benchmarks:** The evaluation is performed on the M-Series and GIFT-Eval benchmarks, which are excellent but are heavily composed of business, economic, and demographic time series. These are domains where SARIMA-like models have historically excelled. It is unclear if the remarkable performance would transfer to domains with fundamentally different characteristics, such as chaotic physical systems, high-frequency financial data, or irregular biological signals (e.g., ECG). The simulator's strong inductive bias is a feature, but it may also be a limitation."}, "questions": {"value": "Based on my concerns listed above, I pose the following questions to the authors:\n\n*   **Question 1:** The SarSim0 pipeline is built on a SARIMA core, which is fundamentally a linear process model. How do you see this limiting the simulator's ability to generate data with complex non-linear dynamics (e.g., regime shifts, GARCH effects), and could this explain why models pre-trained on it might struggle on certain real-world domains not covered by the benchmarks?\n\n*   **Question 2:** Table 8 shows a large number of hyperparameters for the SarSim0 pipeline. How were these settings chosen? Could you provide an ablation or sensitivity analysis on key parameters, such as the maximum pole radius (`rmax`) or the range of AR/MA orders, to demonstrate the robustness of the approach?\n\n*   **Question 3:** The \"student-beats-teacher\" finding is compelling. However, the effect appears mixed on the M-Series, where AutoARIMA's MASE is stronger than NBEATS-SarSim0. What properties of the M-Series datasets might explain why AutoARIMA remains more competitive there, and does this suggest limits to the emergent generalization?\n\n*   **Question 4:** The ablation study shows that removing the Noisers can sometimes *improve* performance on the M-Series. This suggests a mismatch between the noise model and the real-data characteristics. Does this finding point to a need for more adaptive or domain-specific noise generation, and how might that be incorporated into the pipeline?\n\n*   **Question 5:** The current work focuses on univariate time series. What are the primary conceptual and technical hurdles to extending the SarSim0 methodology, particularly the stable pole sampling approach, to the multivariate case where capturing cross-series dependencies (e.g., via a VARIMA framework) is essential?\n\n*   **Question 6:** The UMAP visualization in Figure 3 shows impressive overlap. However, are there any noticeable \"holes\" or regions in the real-data embedding space (red) that the synthetic data (blue) fails to cover?
