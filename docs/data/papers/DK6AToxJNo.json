In this paper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called Answer-Then-Check, which enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking ability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to the user. Our method enables models to answer the question directly in their thoughts and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to provide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety Alignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason through direct responses and then analyze their safety. \nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety capability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks. Notably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning capabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. \nBesides, our method equips models with the ability to perform safe completion. Unlike post-hoc detection methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide helpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics (e.g., self-harm). \nOur results show that inference-time strategies alone are insufficient, highlighting the necessity of safety training, and we find even 500 samples can yield performance comparable to the entire dataset, suggesting a promising path for data-efficient safety alignment.", "tldr": "We propose Reasoned Safety Alignment (ReSA), an Answer‑Then‑Check training paradigm where the LLM drafts an intended answer summary, performs a safety analysis over the summary, and determines whether to refuse.", "keywords": ["Jailbreak Defense"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c9c93f04c8ce4de5d4df7cc98911875b57bf16cc.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes the Answer-Then-Check paradigm and trains LLMs via supervised fine-tuning on the Reasoned Safety Alignment (ReSA) dataset ($\\sim 80\\mathrm{K}$ samples) so the model first generates an intended-answer summary and then performs an explicit safety analysis before emitting a final response.
