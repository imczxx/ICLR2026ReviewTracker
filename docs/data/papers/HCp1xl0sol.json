Watermarking offers a promising solution: model owners can embed an imperceptible signal into generated text, marking its origin. Most leading approaches seed an LLM’s next-token sampling with a pseudo-random key that can later be recovered to identify the text as machine-generated, while only minimally altering the model’s output distribution. However, these methods suffer from two related issues: (i) watermarks are brittle to simple surface-level edits such as paraphrasing or reordering; and (ii) adversaries can append unrelated, potentially harmful text that inherits the watermark, risking reputational damage to model owners. To address these issues, we introduce SimKey a semantic key module that strengthens watermark robustness by tying key generation to the meaning of prior context. SimKey uses locality-sensitive hashing over semantic embeddings to ensure that paraphrased text yields the same watermark key, while unrelated or semantically shifted text produces a different one. Integrated with state-of-the-art watermarking schemes, SimKey improves watermark robustness to paraphrasing and translation while preventing harmful content from false attribution, establishing semantic-aware keying as a practical and extensible watermarking direction.", "tldr": "A key module that strengthens watermarking of LLM outputs by using locality-sensitive hashing of semantic content", "keywords": ["LLM watermarking", "SynthID", "ExpMin", "WaterMax", "SimHash"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bdaffbeadacb4561f6e0d2bd2ec3c02937b8f504.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/b6d4e370b3a23f184c662dc2b7df6db663c30975.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a key generation method for watermarking large language models, where the key is derived from the semantics of the prior context.

Although the method is described as distortion-free, this property appears to stem from the underlying watermarking techniques borrowed from prior work rather than from the proposed key generation mechanism itself. The contribution of the proposed method to achieving distortion-free watermarking is therefore unclear.\n- The reported improvements in attack resistance are relatively small and inconsistent. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, standard watermarking methods already achieve comparable robustness. This suggests that the effectiveness against attacks may primarily depend on the watermarking module itself rather than on the proposed key generation scheme.\n- The evaluation setup is insufficiently described. For example, the paper does not specify which datasets were used in the experiments. Moreover, the evaluation relies on only three watermarking modules, which limits the generalizability of the results. The computational cost of the proposed method is also not discussed or quantified.\n- The paper does not address potential countermeasures against spoofing attacks, in which adversaries generate fake watermarks to mislead detection.

While I am not an expert, I am not totally convinced that using a semantic vector gives the same statistical properties as the Kirchenbauer’s red-list green-list watermarking scheme.

I would appreciate if the authors could provide some further details and clarification here: say that I am watermarking text exclusively in one domain e.g. sports articles, do you have any idea of what the effective # of keys I have? How does the effective # of keys affect detection? Again I am not an expert so I would like to see if other reviewers take issue with the statistical soundness of this method. \n\nWithout any additional statistical insight, I think examining TPR at fixed FPR also can give me empirical assurance. All the results in the main text examine p-value, which will show low values despite very badly behaved semantic vectors.\n\nW2.
