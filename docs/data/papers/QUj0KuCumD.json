Significant challenges exist in LTSF due to its complex temporal dependencies and high computational demands. Although Transformer-based models offer high forecasting accuracy, they are often too compute-intensive to be deployed on devices with hardware constraints. \nIn this paper, we propose MixLinear, which synergistically combines orthogonal segment-based trend extraction in the time domain with adaptive low-rank spectral filtering in the frequency domain. Our approach exploits the complementary structural sparsity of time series: local temporal patterns are efficiently captured through mathematically linear transformations that separate intra-segment and inter-segment correlations, while global trends are compressed into an ultra-low-dimensional frequency latent space through learnable rank-constrained filters. By reducing the parameter scale of a downsampled $n$-length input/output one-layer linear model from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, MixLinear achieves efficient computation without sacrificing accuracy.\nExtensive evaluations show that MixLinear achieves forecasting performance comparable to, or surpasses, state-of-the-art models with significantly fewer parameters ($0.1K$), which makes it well suited for deployment on devices with limited computational capacity.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Long-term Time Series Forecasting", "Segmentation", "Adaptive Low-Rank Spectral Filtering"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bdae99ac2fe8e3731a844e2e5df8da51cc157713.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/783110167f466d618eee954a2c26d3f11e4ad010.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MixLinear, a novel model for time series forecasting.

The core idea is to tackle the \"parameter explosion\" problem in current deep learning models by adopting a dual-domain architecture that processes time series patterns in their most natural domains. Specifically, MixLinear uses a segment-based pathway with factorized linear transformations in the time domain to capture local temporal patterns, and a frequency domain pathway that uses an adaptive low-rank spectral filter to compress and model global trends. The authors claim this hybrid approach reduces the parameter scale of a linear model from O(n^2) to O(n).

An 81% parameter reduction compared to the next-lightest model (SparseTSF) is a remarkable achievement. This has profound practical significance for deployment on resource-constrained hardware, which is a major bottleneck for many modern deep learning models.\n\n2) The dual-domain design is well-motivated by the \"Spectral-Temporal Decomposition Principle.\" The idea of processing local patterns in the time domain and global patterns in the frequency domain is intuitive and elegant. The ablation study provides strong empirical evidence that this separation of concerns is effective and that the two pathways are complementary.\n\n3) The paper is backed by a thorough experimental evaluation on eight benchmark datasets. The authors compare against a strong and diverse set of baselines. The inclusion of detailed ablation and hyperparameter sensitivity studies adds significant credibility to the design choices and validates the core hypotheses, especially the finding that a spectral rank as low as 2 is often sufficient."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1) The paper's primary weakness is that the individual components of the architecture are not conceptually new. Time series segmentation (PatchTST), linear forecasting models (DLinear), and frequency-domain analysis (FEDformer, FITS) are all established techniques. The novelty lies in the specific integration and extreme simplification of these ideas. While the final result is impressive, the contribution is more of an engineering and simplification achievement than a fundamental theoretical breakthrough. To strengthen the paper, the authors could be more explicit about this, framing the contribution as a novel synthesis that achieves an unprecedented operating point on the efficiency-accuracy curve.\n\n2) The abstract and main results sometimes use strong phrasing like \"surpasses, state-of-the-art models.\" While MixLinear does outperform SOTA on some dataset/horizon combinations (e.g., Exchange), Table 1 and Table 5 show that it is more accurately described as being highly \"competitive\" or \"comparable.\" For instance, on several datasets, FITS or even DLinear achieve slightly better or similar MSE. A more nuanced description of the performance would strengthen the paper's credibility, for example by emphasizing that it achieves this competitiveness with orders of magnitude fewer parameters.\n\n3) The explanation of how the factorized linear projections in Section 2.3 disentangle \"intra-segment\" and \"inter-segment\" correlations is slightly imprecise. The mathematical formulation in the appendix ($W^T_2$ ($W_1 X_seg)^T$) suggests a token-mixing and channel-mixing mechanism on a reshaped tensor, akin to MLP-Mixer, rather than a hierarchical processing of segment embeddings. It's unclear how one linear layer acts on \"intra-segment\" features and the other on \"inter-segment\" features when they are applied in this manner. Clarifying this mechanism and its connection to the intuition would improve the paper."}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "N/A"}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "nkwU5MggvO", "forum": "QUj0KuCumD", "replyto": "QUj0KuCumD", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8207/Reviewer_GAKK"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8207/Reviewer_GAKK"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8207/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761889985940, "cdate": 1761889985940, "tmdate": 1762920156747, "mdate": 1762920156747, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "To bridge the gap in the design of scalable and lightweight forecasting models in the frequency domain, this work present MixLinear, a dual-domain framework that achieves competitive long-term time series forecasting performance with only 0.1K parameters.
