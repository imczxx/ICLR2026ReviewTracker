Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns, allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a $\\mathcal{F}$ine-grained $\\mathcal{I}$nterventional equivalence class, named $\\mathcal{FI}$-Markov equivalence, represented by a new graphical diagram, $\\mathcal{F}$-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably sound and complete algorithm, $\\mathcal{F}$-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\\mathcal{FI}$-Markov equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent confounders.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Post-treatment selection", "Selection bias", "interventional causal discovery"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/20ceba9400986f9bd26dc429f16238daacf392cc.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses an important problem: interventional causal discovery under post-treatment selection.
