Our approach bridges two complementary paradigms: \\textit{text prompt generation} (RPG) provides strategic planning through regional decomposition, while \\textit{noise prompt generation} (Golden Noise) offers tactical execution through semantic-aware noise optimization. This integration resolves the regional semantic mismatch problem where different image regions require distinct visual characteristics based on their semantic importance and complexity. Our framework maintains RPG's three-stage structure while replacing uniform random noise initialization with region-specific Golden Noise, enabling each region to benefit from noise characteristics aligned with its semantic content. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements across multiple evaluation metrics: 24\\% enhancement in regional semantic alignment, 28\\% improvement in cross-region coherence, and 36\\% better multi-object composition quality compared to baseline RPG. The success of this paradigm fusion establishes that integrating complementary approaches can address limitations that individual methods cannot overcome, providing a foundation for advancing complex compositional text-to-image generation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Text-to-Image Generation", "Diffusion Models", "RPG Framework", "Golden Noise", "Multimodal LLMs"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/777432dcc9585533f0cba5ca39d73bf2fb17d7a6.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents Golden RPG, a framework that integrates semantic-aware Golden Noise into the RPG (Regional Planning) architecture to improve regional semantic consistency and compositional quality in text-to-image generation.

Conceptual framing without substance.\n\nThe framing (“strategic + tactical synergy,” “semantic–regional dual paradigm”) is rhetorical rather than technical.\nThere is no theoretical analysis explaining why region-wise Golden Noise should outperform existing layout-based control, nor how it differs mechanistically from simply conditioning noise via spatial embeddings.\nThe discussion repeatedly markets the framework as “paradigm bridging,” yet every module (noise learning, regional planning, prompt decomposition) already exists.\n\n3. Weak experimental support.\n\nMetrics: no human or standardized benchmark evaluation.\n\nBaselines: Missing key modern controllable diffusion methods such as ControlNet, T2I-Adapter, or GLIGEN, which are more natural points of comparison.\n\nResults: Improvements are small (e.g., CLIP score +0.05–0.1) \n\n4.
