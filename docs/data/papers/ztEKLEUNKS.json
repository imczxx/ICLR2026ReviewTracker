We build on conformal prediction, a statistical tool for generating prediction sets that cover the test label with a pre-specified probability. The validity of conformal prediction, however, holds under the i.i.d assumption, which does not hold in our setting due to the corruptions in the data. To account for this distribution shift, the privileged conformal prediction (PCP) method proposed leveraging privileged information (PI)---additional features available only during training---to re-weight the data distribution, yielding valid prediction sets under the assumption that the weights are accurate. In this work, we analyze the robustness of PCP to inaccuracies in the weights. Our analysis indicates that PCP can still yield valid uncertainty estimates even when the weights are poorly estimated. Furthermore, we introduce uncertain imputation (UI), a new conformal method that does not rely on weight estimation. Instead, we impute corrupted labels in a way that preserves their uncertainty. Our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees and validated empirically on both synthetic and real benchmarks. Finally, we show that these techniques can be integrated into a triply robust framework, ensuring statistically valid predictions as long as at least one underlying method is valid.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Conformal Prediction", "Uncertainty Quantification", "Distribution Shift", "Corrupted Labels", "Privileged Information"], "primary_area": "probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, variational inference, sampling, UQ, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d4c254ef204970e40cfb00fa20f8e45ee5442c12.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/02658b10d750bf8c4d6bee99570b32c21dc73bd8.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the challenge of preserving the validity guarantees of Conformal Prediction (CP) when training and test data are non-exchangeable due to label corruption or missing information.

While conformal prediction assumes exchangeability between the calibration points and the test point, if a subset of calibration points have corrupted labels (specifically if the corruption is non-random or dependent to a feature) then the exchangeability breaks. The paper is focused in the case that there is a privileged information either indicating the faulty label or carrying information about the true label. \n\nFor the case where the information indicates the corruption label, one existing approach - a.k.a. PCP - is to treat each calibration point as a test point and calibrate on the rest of non-corrupted points. With those scores we can find a threshold for the left out calibration point. Then the conformal threshold will be the 1 - beta quantile of those threshold. For this case the authors evaluate the robustness of PCP under various noise in the weights of the weighted conformal prediction.
