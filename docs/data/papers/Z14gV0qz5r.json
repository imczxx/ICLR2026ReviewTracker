Our methodology incorporates a per-dimension\nquantization scheme that efficiently compresses floating-point\nvectors into integer representations, thereby significantly reducing\nmemory overhead and accelerating distance computations.\nEmpirical validation on the SIFT 10K dataset demonstrates\nthat HNSW-LVQ achieves a remarkable 85% reduction in\nquery latency and substantial memory enhancement with only\na marginal 2% decrease in recall. This research validates the\nefficacy of integrating quantization techniques into graph-based\nindexing, offering a pragmatic optimization pathway for the\ndevelopment of industrial-grade vector databases.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Approximate Nearest Neighbor", "Hierarchical Navigable Small Word(HNSW)", "Vector Quantization", "Locally Adaptive Quantization(LVQ)", "Vector Search", "Large Language Models", "Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG)", "Scalable Indexing", "Memory-Efficient Search", "Low-Latency Vector Databases"], "primary_area": "infrastructure, software libraries, hardware, systems, etc.", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ed3dadb42c88b62fc86e72b3e0a889de23f3c28c.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a98de4d7f4abc97fb6cf538fa3d166c33d4020f4.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper violates the ICLR anonymity and formatting guidelines, so I will not be providing an official review."}, "soundness": {"value": 1}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "N/A"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "N/A"}, "questions": {"value": "N/A"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 0}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "AaUV2R3yQQ", "forum": "Z14gV0qz5r", "replyto": "Z14gV0qz5r", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19994/Reviewer_Bz8v"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19994/Reviewer_Bz8v"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19994/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761957998570, "cdate": 1761957998570, "tmdate": 1762932897732, "mdate": 1762932897732, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors provide their names in the paper, and the paper does not follow the ICLR template.
