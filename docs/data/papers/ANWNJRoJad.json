To address this, we introduce SON-GOKU, a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated, and the grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, multi-task learning will improve model performance rather than impede it. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. We provide extensive theory showing why grouping and sequential updates improve multi-task learning, with guarantees on descent, convergence, and accurately identifying what tasks conflict or align.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["MTL", "greedy", "graph coloring"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/83f0cabcac7c2e3cbcaf4a2f1cca5355c69e7c96.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents an interference-aware scheduler named SON-GOKU, which is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of multi-task learning by dynamically grouping tasks based on their gradient conflicts.

The core idea revolves around constructing a conflict graph from task gradient interference and using greedy graph coloring to partition tasks into non-conflicting groups.

This paper uses the interference coefficient to measure the relationships between tasks and then constructs a graph.

Appendix D.5 discusses multiple approaches for reducing time complexity—random projections, deterministic covariance sketching, edge sampling, incremental Gram updates, and warm-start initializations. While each method is described, its individual impact on the final performance is not clearly distinguished. There could be more experimental results to support the theoretical analysis.\n3.

It first measures pairwise gradient interference using EMA-smoothed cosine similarities, builds a sparse conflict graph linking conflicting tasks, and then applies greedy graph coloring to partition them into non-conflicting groups. During training, SON-GOKU activates one color group (i.e., compatible tasks) per step and cycles through all groups, ensuring updates proceed in consistent gradient directions. The graph is periodically recolored to adapt to evolving task relations, and the approach integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers like PCGrad or AdaTask.\n\nFor the theoretical results, SON-GOKU provides guarantees. If there are no edges among its tasks in the conflict graph, the combined step is provably a descent direction with a quantitative lower bound; the overall procedure retains the standard non-convex SGD convergence rate up to a small factor depending on within-group conflict. Moreover, over a refresh window, doing sequential group updates is not worse and can be strictly better than a single mixed update when cross-group gradients oppose each other. \n\nThe authors evaluate SON-GOKU on six benchmarks spanning vision, multimodal, and time-series tasks, using standard backbones (e.g., ResNet-18; CNN/BiLSTM) and deliberately adding positive/negative auxiliary tasks to induce interference. They compare against competitive baselines (including Uniform, GradNorm, AdaTask, MGDA, Nash-MTL, FairGrad, PCGrad, CAGrad, FAMO), and also test hybrid variants where the scheduler is paired with AdaTask, a GradNorm warm start, or PCGrad. Ablations probe two key design choices: freezing a one-shot coloring (to test the need for dynamic recoloring) and estimating conflicts from single minibatches to assess the value of history-averaged interference.
