Conventional numerical methods struggle in the early stages when limited interventional data is available, often yielding noisy or misleading selection guidance. In this work, we introduce the Large Language Model Guided Intervention Targeting (LeGIT), a novel collaborative framework that synergizes the vast world knowledge of LLMs with the precision of numerical algorithms. By analyzing the meta-information of the causal system, it proposes highly informative intervention targets, effectively bootstrapping the discovery process to augment existing numerical approaches, while retaining the convergence guarantees. Evaluated across four realistic benchmarks, LeGIT demonstrates significant improvements in performance and robustness over existing methods, and even surpasses humans.

LLMs have come along way since GPT3, and it's very likely that results would look different with today's state of the art models, especially reasoning models.

Exploring the applicability of LLMs to this problem offers an insightful avenue for assessing their reasoning abilities and the extent of their embedded common and expert knowledge. The idea of treating an LLM as an artificial expert in the absence of a human counterpart is particularly compelling, making the comparison between LLM-selected and human-selected intervention targets especially valuable.\nI particularly appreciate the experiments presented in Figure 2, which provide intuition on how the set of intervention vertices may vary across methods, and Table 2, which—especially when compared to Table 1—illustrates how LeGIT’s performance is influenced by changes in the data budget. However, I would strongly encourage the inclusion of additional experiments analyzing how the proposed enhancements of LeGIT affect overall performance (see the discussion on soundness in the weaknesses section)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "**Notes on Soundness:**\n\nMy most serious concern is that the comparison between the intervention selection algorithms and the LLM-enhanced algorithm is not entirely fair. This is because the LLM has access to additional metadata related to the studied graph, leveraging knowledge that the other algorithms were never designed to use (except for the input provided by human experts). In other words, the assumptions regarding the input data for the causal discovery problem have been extended. It is therefore quite expected that incorporating this extra knowledge—on top of the standard framework—would lead to better results. This is not to say that the impact of such an LLM-based enhancement is uninteresting to study; however, it is important to recognize that LeGIT addresses a different problem than, for example, GIT, AIT, or CBES. This distinction, however, is not reflected in the narrative presented by the authors. \n\nI would suggest that the authors focus on comparing their updated Online Causal Discovery framework with other LLM-guided causal discovery algorithms. For instance, the works of Jiralerspong et al. and Khatibi et al. rely on similar access to metadata from LLMs to uncover causal dependencies, and they use the same or similar graphs and metrics (other comparable algorithms are also summarized in Wan et al.). The experiments with GIT, AIT, and CBES serve more as a teaser or example of LeGIT’s potential, rather than as a fair comparison between methods that have access to the same data.\n\nThe authors could therefore also adjust their narrative to focus on understanding the impact of incorporating this additional knowledge. For example, which nodes are most affected? (Figure 2 is a nice example, although it might be more informative to compare against a simpler case where the ideal distribution can be directly derived. In the graphs from Figure 2, it is difficult to assess which intervention set is correct, or whether the interventions occur on edges that can be reversed within a MEC class—and hence whether the intervention is actually required to achieve identifiability.) Similarly, how do the different enhancements (bootstrapping, resampling) affect convergence or final performance? Does including information about the current graph in the prompt improve or deteriorate performance? How does performance change with the number of nodes proposed by the LLM—and can the LLM propose a ranking of nodes? These are just some examples of how the authors could build a stronger narrative around the ablation studies and deepen the understanding of their framework  while staying within the same online causal discovery framework.\n\n**Notes on Experiments Setup:**\n\nThroughout the paper, the authors use only four graphs of more or less similar size. This is, of course, a reasonable starting point, but I wonder why these specific graphs were selected. More importantly, I see no clear restriction preventing the extension of the evaluation to other networks (e.g., additional graphs from https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/\nMoreover, based on the description of LeGIT, it appears that the method can be used with any algorithm $A$ that satisfies the conditions for online causal discovery (i.e., potentially not even gradient-based). Did the authors attempt to use different base causal discovery algorithms besides ENCO? Even if not as a main experiment, such a demonstration could nicely illustrate the universality of the proposed approach.\n\n**Notes on Contribution:**\n\nI find the topic quite interesting, as it explores the integration of LLMs’ common meta-knowledge—akin to the bias present in human experts—into causal discovery. However, this perspective has also been explored in prior work (e.g. Jiralerspong et al., Khatibi et al., Wan et al.). While focusing on scoring the intervention potential of each node appears novel, the experimental design (see “Soundness” above) does not give me enough confidence to fully assess the strength of the contribution.\n\n**Notes on presentation (Minor):**\n\nThe paper is generally well written, but I do think that some of the sections could use more attention. For instance, Preliminaries  do not explain all the notations in Algorithm 1 (e.g. what is $P(G)$), there is a discrepancy between $\\phi$ in  Algorithm 1 (in “Output”) and in text (line 133). It is not explained what those parameters are and how $A$ updates them (in practice we also have functional parameters that are also updated by the algorithm A and can thus influence the structural ones - see Lippe et al.). In Algorithm 2, line 8, should it not be $D_{bootrstapped}[i-T_{warmup}]$?  \n\n**References:**\n\nJiralerspong, Thomas, et al. \"Efficient causal graph discovery using large language models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.01207 (2024).  \nKhatibi, Elahe, et al. \"Alcm: Autonomous llm-augmented causal discovery framework.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.01744 (2024).  \nWan, Guangya, et al. \"Large Language Models for Causal Discovery: Current Landscape and Future Directions.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.11068 (2024).  \nLippe, Phillip, Taco Cohen, and Efstratios Gavves. \"Efficient neural causal discovery without acyclicity constraints.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.10483 (2021)."}, "questions": {"value": "The current algorithm primarily relies on meta-knowledge derived from the descriptions of the variables. I was wondering whether the authors also explored incorporating contextual information from the graph itself (e.g., details about the MEC class) or integrating principles from do-calculus or v-structure verification. Could such approaches work even in cases where no node descriptions are provided? In other words, could the LLM base its reasoning solely on causal discovery knowledge and the graph structure to refine the current solution and subsequently select the intervention nodes? In that way LeGiT could be used even on fully artificial graphs, or models when no previous bias/knowledge is available about the nodes. \n\nIn Figure 4, it appears—especially for the Child and Fisram graphs—that LeGIT does not improve during the early acquisition steps and then sharply drops. Could this breaking point correspond to when the numerical scoring algorithms start to take effect?\n\nIn Algorithm 2, the LeGIT intervention targets are selected at the beginning of training. Did the authors examine whether incorporating them as the final interventions (or interleaving them with the numerically scored ones) provides any benefit?\n\nI do generally believe it could be an interesting paper, but currently it suffers from its positioning (i.e. the algorithm works well, but it is either not fairly comparable to other approaches - beacuse of the additional knowledge - or other LLM-guided causal discovery approaches could be adapt to work within the online causal discovery framework to allow for a comparision with meta-data)."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "BZSsOJ6Wgp", "forum": "cdxFCHQQnU", "replyto": "cdxFCHQQnU", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24359/Reviewer_dDFN"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24359/Reviewer_dDFN"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission24359/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761922912371, "cdate": 1761922912371, "tmdate": 1762943057254, "mdate": 1762943057254, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a framework to incorporate LLMs into existing gradient-based intervention targeting methods.

The observed effectiveness of the method may relate to how the ENCO method works and may fail to generalize. Note that ENCO has no convergence guarantees when the number of interventions is less than d-1. The ENCO framework only guarantees the recovery of the correct graph when interventions were conducted on at least n-1 nodes. It would be beneficial for the applicability (and possibly performance) to use a method with stronger theoretical guarantees under partial intervention sets, for example, DCDI or DIBS.\n\n4. The approach relies on the ability of LLMs to reason about the variables. This ability can be impaired in at least two cases: insufficient information about variables (when the descriptions are missing or are non-informative), lack of background knowledge.
