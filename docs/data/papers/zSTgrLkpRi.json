Koopman operator theory (KOT), a data-driven dynamical system analysis framework, can then be deployed to discover the otherwise non-intuitive training dynamics. Taking advantage of the predictive power of KOT, the time-consuming Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) iterations can be then bypassed by directly predicting network weights a few epochs later. This \"predictive training\" framework, however, often suffers from gradient explosion especially for more extensive and complex models. In this paper, we incorporate the idea of \"differential learning\" into the predictive training framework and propose the so-called \"predictive differential training\" (PDT) for accelerated learning even for complex network structures. The key contribution is the design of an effective masking strategy based on a dynamic consistency analysis, which selects only those predicted weights whose local training dynamics align with the global dynamics. We refer to these predicted weights as high-fidelity predictions. DT also includes the design of an acceleration scheduler to adjust the prediction interval and rectify deviations from off-predictions. We demonstrate that PDT can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-in with a diverse array of existing optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, LAMB, etc.). The experimental results show consistent performance improvement across different network architectures and various datasets, in terms of faster convergence and reduced training time (10-40%) to achieve the baseline's best loss, while maintaining (if not improving) final model accuracy. As the idiom goes, a rising tide lifts all boats; in our context, a subset of high-fidelity predicted weights can accelerate the training of the entire network!", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Training Dynamics", "Koopman Operator Theory", "Predictive Training", "Deep Neural Networks"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d9499f23e197da1032571a6c19a8072dbbf22442.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "*disclaimer* I only used LLM for understanding of part of sec 3.2. \n\nThe paper proposes an acceleration strategy for accelerating first order methods (SGD and variants) esp. in large scale deep learning systems. The strategy is to use linear approximation to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of weight updates in DNN with first order methods. In particular, the authors propose a predictive differential training  which serves as plug in tool in SGD or variant optimizer. It starts with SGD updates for a few steps and then use these snapshots to linear approximate and forecast a few steps in the future.  To accept the forecasted weights one by one, the author proposed the two criteria: acceleration effectiveness criterion and dynamic consistency criterion so that the predicted dynamics can be in accordance to the global optimizer dynamics.

I am not entirely convinced by this explanation. \nIf I understand correctly, the weight is masked  means the predicted weight is accept. \nIntuitively, this trend may also be influenced by how stochastic gradient descent (and its variants) behaves: early in training, the loss landscape is typically easier to optimize, leading to faster reduction in loss and more stable gradient directions, which in turn may allow more weights to pass the masking criteria. Later in training, as the optimizer approaches (local) minima, gradients oscillate more around the optimum, making it harder to accept predicted weights for prediction horizons like 5 steps. Could the authors clarify or comment on whether this trend may be more related to optimizer behavior rather than intrinsic “complexity of the dynamics”?\n\n2. Has the authors conducted experiments analyzing the impact of different initial learning rates on the masked ratio behavior? Intuitively, a smaller learning rate might lead to more stable gradient directions, thereby increasing the proportion of weights that satisfy the masking criteria early in training. Conversely, larger initial learning rates might introduce more variability and lower the acceptance ratio. That also affects the computational analysis and efficiency of the current approach in the appendix.  \n\n3. The current empirical evaluation focuses exclusively on vision tasks (e.g., AlexNet, ResNet, ViT). While these results are compelling, it would significantly strengthen the work if the method were also evaluated on other domains, such as NLP or speech models.

The overall presentation would greatly benefit from clearer definitions, consistent notation, and explicit mapping to standard training dynamics.\n\n- Most essential implementation details about how the Koopman operator is estimated, how prediction integrates with standard optimizers, and how the dynamic consistency mask is computed—are deferred to the appendix. Since reading appendices is optional during review, this omission makes it impossible to fully evaluate the method’s soundness, novelty, and overall contribution from the main paper alone.\n\n- The toy example provided does not effectively illustrate why or how the method applies to general neural network training. Its formulation lacks connection even to a simple MLP and therefore fails to provide intuition or justification for why Koopman-based prediction should improve training efficiency.\n\n- The paper mentions that predicted updates are applied \"once a while,\" but it does not specifies or studies, either theoretically or empirically, how often these predictions should be used. This frequency is critical for both computational cost and model performance. Without an ablation study on this factor, it is difficult to assess the reliability of the reported improvements.\n\n- The \"mask,\" which seems to determine when to apply predicted updates, is central to the method’s stability but is not properly introduced or explained in the main text. It is defined only in the appendix as a binary gate based on heuristics. The paper does not justify why a mask is necessary, why it must be binary, or how this design choice impacts performance or stability.\n\n- The method requires repeated SVD to estimate the Koopman operator, yet the paper provides no analysis of the associated computational overhead. There is no information about matrix sizes, decomposition frequency, or runtime breakdown.
