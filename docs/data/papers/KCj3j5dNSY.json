However, directly applying LLMs to VQA still presents several challenges: (a) suboptimal performance when handling questions from specialized domains, (b) higher computational costs and slower inference speed due to large model sizes, and (c) the absence of a systematic approach to precisely quantify the uncertainty of LLM responses, raising concerns about their reliability in high-stakes tasks. To address these issues, we propose an UNcertainty-aware LLM-Integrated VQA model ($\\texttt{Uni-VQA}$). This model facilitates knowledge exchange between the LLM and a calibrated task specific model (\\ie \\texttt{TS-VQA}), guided by reliable confidence scores, resulting in improved VQA accuracy, reliability and inference speed. Our framework strategically leverages these confidence scores to manage the interaction between the LLM and $\\texttt{TS-VQA}$: the specialized questions are answered by the $\\texttt{TS-VQA}$ model, while general knowledge questions are handled by the LLM. For questions requiring both specialized and general knowledge, the $\\texttt{TS-VQA}$ provides candidate answers, which the LLM then combines with its internal knowledge to generate a more accurate response. Extensive experiments on VQA datasets demonstrate the theoretically justified advantages of $\\texttt{Uni-VQA}$ over using the LLM or $\\texttt{TS-VQA}$ alone.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["visual question answering", "model calibration"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5669e469ae513df0cfa112add25c1f64a0fada3d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a calibrated, rule-based router to combine TS-VQA and LLM to balance power consumption and performance.
